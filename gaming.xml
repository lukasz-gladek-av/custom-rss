<header><section>
<p>Here are the full patch notes</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Shortly after launch back in September, Marvelous revealed the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-roadmap-outlined">2025 roadmap</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a>, and today, we've arrived at another stop on the journey.</p>
<p>The mech action/adventure has today landed its 'Into the Abyss' paid DLC, a story expansion that sees you sent out to explore an all-new map area, Survey Zone: Locus Initi. You can expect to find new enemies, new gear, and a whole new Axiom base to get your head around.</p>
<p>The 'Into the Abyss' DLC is now available to all those with the Digital Deluxe or Super Deluxe versions of the game. Alternatively, you can purchase the expansion separately on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/DLC/Daemon-X-Machina-Titanic-Scion-Into-the-Abyss-2860504.html">Switch eShop</a> for <strong>£13.49 / $14.99</strong>. Do note that you'll need to have made it past Chapter 18 'Investigate the Facility's Depths' in the base game to see any of this bonus content.</p>

<p>But it's not just paid news for Titanic Scion today, since the game has also landed a free update to bump things up to ver. 1.2. There are a bunch of pesky bugs targeted by this one, as outlined in the full patch below (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342490/Daemon_X_Machina_Titanic_Scion/">Steam</a>).</p>
<h2>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Ver. 1.2</h2>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong><br>
・Fixed an issue where the game sometimes could not be booted when the Online setting was On upon carrying over save data from the demo version.<br>
・Fixed an issue where personal progress would sometimes be corrupted after multiplayer.<br>
・Fixed an issue where the Rematch Simulator would sometimes become unusable after an abnormality occurred.<br>

・Fixed an issue where when trying to join a party in multiplayer, the user sometimes gets the message "Cannot join because the party's privacy settings have changed." and cannot join.<br>
・Weapons that were only available through shops can now be obtained in the field after a certain point.<br>
・Fixed an issue where the number of foes grabbed was not counted when armed with certain weapons.<br>
・Fixed an issue where sometimes "Ambrosia" became undefeatable.<br>
・Fixed an issue where when the mission "Subject: Immortalization Testing Facility?" is completed on a certain route, the music data "Assault Impact" cannot be obtained.<br>
・Fixed some of the music data contents that were swapped.<br>
・Fixed an issue where development data comparison with inventory is disabled when equipped with a Gun Vambrace.<br>
・Fixed an issue where only the visual effect while stunned by Gaze's "Blood Bind" disappears when some Grand Entrance effects occur.<br>
・Fixed an issue in a rematch mission where "Dreadnought RT: β" would stay underground and never come out.<br>
・Fixed an issue in a rematch mission where "Dreadnought RT: β" would jump on the player at high speed.<br>

・Fixed an issue where reboots occurred as an unintended effect of a Grand Entrance.<br>
・Fixed multiple other bugs.</p>
<hr>
<p>We had a perfectly fine time with Titanic Scion when it arrived on Switch 2 earlier this year, but felt that it was let down by its performance issues, which made for a "janky experience in places, with mushy controls and limp feedback". Let's hope that this patch can help move things in the right direction.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.moddb.com/downloads/maxpayne2remixmod-by-darko913">A new Max Payne 2 RTX Remix mod</a> introduces path tracing to a few early locations, offering stunning visuals. However, even on high-end GPUs like the RTX 5080, this lighting technology proves to be a true performance killer without proper optimization.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows the modded version with path tracing and the vanilla version of the second entry in the series running side by side at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS, highlighting how some locations look stunning with path tracing. </p>



<p>At the same time, the comparison video clearly shows how path tracing is extremely taxing on current gaming hardware: with performance dropping from 1,255 FPS in the vanilla game to just 38 FPS in the mod in some instances, an RTX 5080 with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance Mode takes a hit of over 1,200 FPS, representing an astonishing 97% performance drop overall. It's only with Frame Generation that the modded game reaches playable framerates above 60 FPS.</p>

<iframe title="Max Payne 2 Path Tracing with RTX Remix - One of the Most Impressive RTX Remix Mods | RTX 5080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLerlkr2nVE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-path-tracing-requires-optimization-to-be-viable">Path Tracing Requires Optimization to Be Viable</h2>



<p>The massive performance hit seen in the Max Payne 2 RTX Remix mod is far from being an uncommon occurrence, as almost every classic game that has received a path tracing overhaul sees similar performance drops. Among them is the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-rtx-remix-annihaltes-performance-4080/">original Max Payne</a>, which also sees performance drops in the 1000 FPS range on high-end GPUs, the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-remake-black-mesa-path-tracing-30-fps-rtx-5080/">Half-Life remake Black Mesa</a>, and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/">Left 4 Dead 2</a>. </p>



<p>This makes it even clearer how the demanding tech requires optimization work in conjunction with upscaling (and sometimes Frame Generation) to deliver acceptable performance, as demonstrated by some of the best implementations of the tech in recent years, such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-path-tracing-continues-impressive-showcase/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-rtx-remix-remasters-may-continue-to-be-the-best-option-to-update-classic-games-in-the-future">RTX Remix Remasters May Continue to Be The Best Option to Update Classic Games in the Future</h2>



<p>Although the current RTX Remix mods generally require very powerful hardware to run at playable framerates, these overhauls are likely to continue offering the best remaster option for games that won't receive official updates implementing the latest graphics tech. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Among these is&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-4-path-tracing-remaster/" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto 4,</a>&nbsp;whose eventual remaster is unlikely to receive path tracing support,</span> based on<a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/"> the remasters released so far by Rockstar Games</a><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">.</span></p>



<p>Hopefully, gaming hardware will eventually catch up to make these unofficial remasters playable by the majority of players, even those without access to top-end hardware.</p>

            <p>Remember Brendan from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>? If the answer's no, I don't blame you. He's a talking vending machine you can run into and end up going off on a short series of side quests about, but I totally missed him in my fist couple of playthroughs. Anyway, <strong>spoiler alert</strong>, but that quest arc in the base game ends pretty tragically, something a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">modder</a>'s now changed via the addition of an extra bit which lets you pay to have the semi-sentient snack box installed in V's flat.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Prolific Cyberpunk modder Deceptious is behind this short extra mission, which they've dubbed '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/25629?tab=description">Brendan's Death Song</a>' in honour of a Red Hot Chili Peppers song I can't admit often makes it into my playlists. I'm more of a basic Californicationy kinda bloke, what can I say?</p>
<p>With this work installed, after running into Brendan the vending machine outside of Megabuilding H8 in Japantown and running through the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/I_Can_See_Clearly_Now">trio of quests</a> involving him, things usually end with him telling a final gag before undergoing a programming change that'll get rid of his chatty quirkiness. Think the ending of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>, except Roy Batty's spent his life giving out more free snacks than he should have.</p>
<p>But, what if Harrison Ford could have paid some dudes to pick up Roy Batty, bring him back to life, and install him in the wall of Deckard's flat? Sounds pretty horrifying to be honest, but it's probably a lot less horrifying when this mod does it as a way of letting you keep a bit of Brendan in your cyber-life. Once the machine's been added to the default Megabuilding H10 apartment via a quest heavy on text messages, he'll be available for some brief conversation and occasionally dish out a free drink.</p>
<p>"He goes silent during partner dates in H10, but does have a small change of appearance when the partner is there," Deceptious teases, in case you were worried about being virtually cockblocked by a coin-operated flatmate.</p>
<p>To get the mod up and running, you'll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7831">Deceptious' Quest Core</a>, plus standard Cyberpunk advanced tweak enablers <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198">ArchiveXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380">RED4ext</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197">TweakXL</a>. Oh, and a tolerance for groan-worthy gags. Let's face it though, if you saw the headline of this article with my name in the byline and have read this far, you've almost certainly got that. Or you just like hearing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-can-now-serve-daily-word-puzzles-thanks-to-a-mod-called-gonkle-and-the-answers-probably-choom">intriguing Cyberpunk mods</a>.</p>

            <p>Despite being one of PlayStation's most prolific single-player series, developer Guerrilla Games has "always thought about" its Horizon franchise "as a multiplayer game".</p>
<p>That's coming from Guerrilla Games' studio head, <a href="https://x.com/janbartvanbeek">Jan-Bart van Beek</a>, who was resharing yesterday's announcement post about Horizon's spin-off MMO, Steel Frontiers. "From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game," van Beek shared on social media.</p>

<p>The studio exec added that last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, which told a brickified version of Aloy's initial outing in Zero Dawn, was the studio's "first small step" into Horizon's multiplayer offerings.</p>
<p>"With Steel Frontiers we're taking a bigger one," the Guerrilla developer furthered, before adding there is "much more to come".</p>
<p>Following Steel Frontiers' announcement yesterday, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier stated NCSoft's Horizon game is different from Guerrilla's own multiplayer release, which is currently said to be in development at the studio. "That one is Guerrilla's next big project," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5jd6otif22v">Schreier said</a>.</p>
<p>As for Horizon Steel Frontiers, it's coming from NCSoft, though Guerrilla has collaborated with the studio. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-affirms-its-working-on-new-games-in-the-horizon-franchise-as-ncsoft-mmo-skips-ps5">Steel Frontiers is described as a "fierce survival adventure"</a>, in which players take on the role of machine hunters in a region known as Deathlands. The team promises "large-scale raids" and an "advanced combat system". The upcoming MMO is poised for PC and mobile, with no mention of a PlayStation release.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrillas-horizon-franchise-has-sold-over-38m-copies-worldwide">PlayStation and Guerrilla's Horizon franchise had surpassed 38m copies sold</a>. The news came as part of Sony's filed legal complaint against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, where the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">company accused the Chinese technology conglomerate of ripping off its Horizon video game franchise with Light of Motiram</a>.</p>

<p>Europa Universalis 5 carries on Paradox Interactive’s good work in the strategy genre. In contrast, many fans flock to other well-known franchises for their world-conquering needs. Europa Universalis 5 offers all of this and more, and its console commands and cheats are a lot of fun if you feel like messing about with the world.</p>



<p>It’s not easy for Europa Universalis 5 to compete with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/anno-117-pax-romana-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> and Civilization 7s of the world. Yet, here we are with another mainline addition to the long-running franchise. It has all the usual mechanics to consider: Ruling through dynasties, shaping your nation, dictating its fate for hundreds of years.</p>







<p>If you want a little helping hand, the Europa Universalis 5 console commands on PC might be a good little companion.</p>

<p><strong>Activating Europa Universalis 5 Console Commands is as simple as enabling and opening the Debug Mode option, typing each cheat into the box, and triggering it.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick instructional guide on how to do this (using Steam as our example):</p>



<ol>
<li>Open up <strong>Steam</strong>.</li>



<li>Find <strong>Europa Universalis 5</strong> in your game library.</li>



<li>Right-click the title.</li>



<li>Select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>



<li>Choose <strong>Launch Options</strong>.</li>



<li>Copy and paste <strong>-debug_mode</strong> into it.</li>



<li>Boot up <strong>Europa Universalis 5</strong>.</li>



<li>Press the <strong>`</strong> key once the game has loaded.</li>



<li>You can now enter prompts using our list above!</li>
</ol>



<p>You can now adjust food levels, change religions, and all manner of world-tinkering actions. Our favorites include the ability to trigger an event, because as Heath Ledger’s Joker said: “I’m an agent of chaos.” </p>



<p>Have fun building and destroying your own history of humanity.</p>

            <p>Following the latest <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> console update, Nintendo appears to have blocked third-party Switch 2 docks.</p>
<p>Update 21.0.0 was released earlier this week and, finally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-update-for-switch-consoles-finally-indicates-if-your-games-are-digital-or-physical">adds symbols to indicate if software is physical or digital</a>, among other changes.</p>
<p>However, some Switch 2 owners are reporting their third-party docks no longer work following the update (thanks <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-blocked-third-party-switch-2-docks-and-it-sucks-2000644081">Kotaku</a>).</p>

<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrBCQTmb9SU&amp;t=1s">Austin John Plays</a> tested out some third-party dongles and confirmed, after the update, a video signal was no longer transmitted. Shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1ouoalk/some_third_party_switch_2_docks_stopped_working/">reddit</a>, a number of players shared similar stories.</p>
<p>"Can confirm my 2nd (3rd party) dock in our living room just stopped working as well right after today's update," wrote one reddit user. "A full power cycle did not fix it for me. Quite a bummer as we've been enjoying it issue free for months."</p>
<p>"I finally got around to ordering a dock cable for travel, it arrived today," wrote another user. "Plugged it in, happy it worked right out of the box. Launched a game, update alert, update, cable's borked."</p>
<p>Of course, the console comes with a dock in the box. But some users like to have an extra dock available to play in separate rooms or for travelling. An official dock on the Nintendo store costs £92.99, however, so many users have turned to third-party options.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for clarification on this change.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a Nintendo Direct dedicated to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-gets-its-first-trailer-revealing-rosalina-and-bowser-jrs-voice-actors">forthcoming The Super Mario Galaxy Movie revealed its first trailer</a> - here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-breakdown-of-the-super-mario-galaxy-movies-first-trailer-with-the-easter-eggs-weve-spotted">all the Easter Eggs we've spotted</a>.</p>

		<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 runs the risk of being too much game, as Treyarch’s penchant for taking Easter eggs and modes from yesteryear and building them out further comes to its latest form. There are, of course, the campaign and the multiplayer, which are the two main pillars of any COD, but then there’s the annual Zombies mode, there’s the return of the top-down shooter Dead Ops Arcade, and the campaign is playable in co-op and with a bespoke Endgame multiplayer mode. It’s…. it’s a lot to take in.</p>
<p>We’ve had a little headstart on the game’s launch today, dipping a toe into a bunch of the game’s modes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Launch Trailer (PC Features Spotlight)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Ry41LBsSuQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starting with the campaign and, somehow, Menendez has returned, a new message from him defying death and calling for more global uprisings confirmed by a military tech giant, The Guild. Something about that doesn’t sit quite right, so JSOC sends in David Mason and his team as a blunt force data extraction in the city state of Avalon. Fighting through waves of robots and human soldiers alike, they get trapped in a dead end, and then things get… weird. A hallucinogenic gas gets released, sending the team tumbling into David Mason’s nightmarish memories and scenarios, occasionally coming back up to investigate the next step of the story within Avalon.</p>
<p>On paper, it’s a fan-pleasing set up, calling back to some of the most popular games in this franchise, and there’s always a bit of a draw to being able to play in co-op, but in practice, it’s all just a bit confusing. For some reason, Black Ops 7 returns to the well of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/15/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-review/">2023’s Modern Warfare 3</a> for inspiration, creating a big open world map for Avalon which then plays host to a number of missions through the campaign. You just go from point A to B, battle the white clad Guild goons along the way and when you get there, and maybe there’s something daft like riding on the back of a hijacked VTOL to follow a signal – hilariously the voice over tells anyone that didn’t make it onto the VTOL to try and follow on foot. And then you’re sucked into a new hallucinated level with stages made out of floating chunks of land, battling horrible creatures, and mad bosses.</p>


<p>You do get some fun abilities through this, including an augmented jump, grapple hook and wingsuit to speed up getting around Avalon and the necessary movement to get through the dreams. These carry through to the Endgame mode that follows the campaign, returning you to Avalon for more freeform extraction shooter missions – they’re just PvE, though, so all 32 players in a session can collaborate. In this mode, you can work your way up through four areas of difficulty. You’re dropped in, run around and find points of interest with some kind of objective to beat, find gun and gear caches, and then extract before time runs out. As you play, you level up, gaining power to be ready to take on more challenging zones, and build up to more significant challenges, but if you die? That operator’s specs and loadout are all lost.</p>
<p>You might be getting flashbacks to the open world Zombies mode from Modern Warfare III. It’s mostly Guild enemies in regular areas, but there are also plenty of reality-bending moments. Clouds of gas that are home to roving groups of zombies, fun little mini missions, like a portal where that zips you up into the sky to wingsuit and chase after butterflies, or a random little game of Prop Hunt with a monster. There’s fun surprises here, and there’s plans to add more higher level Endgame events and missions through the seasonal content, but I’m not sure that people would load this up instead of heading into Zombies for their co-op fix.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, while I haven’t tried the initial Zombies map and mode, the initial map promises six interconnected regions, a truck that you can drive around in to visit different locations. Despite this, it’s still a round-based Zombie mode, and a main quest will drag this Dark Aether narrative forward. Alternatively there’s Dead Ops Arcade 4, with its top-down twin-stick shooter missions, again offering more co-op.</p>
<p>Now, I’ll be honest, I’m not the greatest connoisseur of Call of Duty multiplayer. Each year brings its particular tweaks and changes, loadouts have different schemes for construction with points or slots, there’s the catalogue perks that come in and out of favour, kill streaks and all the rest. Fundamentally, after a couple hours with a mosh-pit playlist of the core modes, Black Ops 7 feels like Call of Duty to me.</p>
<p>The biggest change in the moment-to-moment gameplay is really the addition of wall jumping, which can be chained together a couple times to let you bridge a handful of deliberate gaps in the level design. On Den, the Japanese feudal castle turned Guild fortress, there’s an outer path on one side of the map that goes over some rooftops that you have to jump between, but there’s also a little wall-jump opportunity to get to a smaller inner path as well, allowing for a flanking move if this route feels locked down. Of course, this is less fundamental on a remake map like the superyacht Hijacked, but it’s a curious addition that feels like it’s a little nod back to the multi-jump, wall-running action of Black Ops 3.</p>

<p>While the 6v6 multiplayer is always going to be Call of Duty’s bread and butter, Skirmish is the latest experiment with something a bit bigger. This objective-based 20v20 mode is a madcap rush of objectives and, presenting you a large-ish map and a steady stream of capture, destroy, takeover and escort missions to race to and complete. It might sound like a riff on Battlefield or previous combined arms modes like Ground War, but since you wingsuit in when you spawn and can just zip to pretty much anywhere on the map, it’s close to being pure infantry. It is absolutely manic because of this, with no sense that any overlook or defensive position won’t just have enemies dropping in behind you, or wingsuiting straight through open windows to combat roll right into the thick of it.</p>
<p>From around 8 hours play, Black Ops 7 is a bit of a head-scratcher in places, and a Modern Warfare III style misfire at its worst. The multiplayer is a solid and dependable evolution, and I’m looking forward to jumping into Zombies properly, but the opening hours of the campaign and the co-op Endgame mode are a jumbled mess of horror shooter and open world that is missing the mark. This might be the biggest Call of Duty ever, and all of it can be played together with friends, but you’ve all got to want to for that to work.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Tomb Raider</a> developers Crystal Dynamics have announced another round of layoffs, their third round of jobs cuts this year. The studio say "just under 30 team members across various departments and projects" are losing their livelihoods, and claim this is necessary "to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future".</p>
<p>This year alone had already seen Crystal Dynamics lay off staff in two waves, with 17 employees being <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-employees">let go in March</a> and an unspecified number of others <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-developers-crystal-dynamics-lay-off-more-staff-say-the-series-future-is-unaffected">handed their marching orders in August</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As with that August round, these latest layoffs were announced via a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_today-weve-made-the-difficult-but-necessary-activity-7394805539140169729-lwXF">LinkedIn post</a>. "We've parted ways with just under 30 team members across various departments and projects as we restructure the company and business for our next generation," the studio wrote. "Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways. We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition."</p>
<p>"We've made these painful choices as a way to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future," they added.</p>
<p>So far, principal animator <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7394854027055910913-ko9W">Shamil Rasizade</a> and producer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/samanthadobes_opentowork-activity-7394845983777619968-jCKp">Samantha Dobes</a> have posted to LinkedIn that they've been let go as part of these cuts. "It’s been a fun 12 years, and I will greatly miss everyone. But I suppose it’s time to join the army of unemployed game devs. You know how it goes these days. If you hear of anything, please let me know," the former wrote.</p>
<p>Solidarity and best of luck to all those affected by these layoffs.</p>

<p>Yes, the 2.1.0 patch is here, and it adds... well, a couple of things. First up, we've got a new, smaller calendar app that no longer takes up the whole ruddy home screen, so that's nice if you like that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Second is a new filter that lets you streamline the news feed according to specific characters. You better believe we'll be laser-focused on anything to do with Samus for the next few weeks!</p>
<p>So let's check out the official patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Added Calendar Widget Sizes</strong></p>
<p>- Added a small widget you can use to check the weekly calendar.</p>
<p><strong>News and Browsing History Filtering</strong></p>
<p>- News and browsing history can now be filtered by character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yeah, that's yer lot.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also recently released a separate app for its storefront, featuring games, accessories, and more. With the Nintendo Music and the Nintendo Switch apps, this is now totals four. Maybe it's time to combine these together in some way, Nintendo..?</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, developer NCSOFT has talked about the game as part of its wider lineup (<a href="https://wccftech.com/aion-2-launch-globally-second-half-2026-monetization-less-aggressive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aion 2</a>, Time Takers, Cinder City, Limit Zero Breakers) in a dedicated session at G-Star 2025, <a href="https://m.ruliweb.com/news/read/217907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as reported by Ruliweb</a>.</p>



<p>During development, Horizon Steel Frontiers was known as Project Skyline, and apparently, it was believed that it would employ 'AI NPCs'. When asked that question, though, NCSOFT focused instead on the fact that AI is being used 'extensively' in the game's production, and that they expect it to be used even more in future games.   </p>



<p><em>We're testing and receiving assistance internally through collaborations with basic NPCs and combat. Since we're an action RPG, we don't play with a large number of players, but rather determine the optimal number of players, and we receive assistance in various aspects. Internally, we also rely on AI for production, from coding to art. It 's being widely adopted in the field, and I think the technologies will gradually become known. The Horizon Steel Frontiers development team is also the one most eager to utilize AI. It's being used a lot, and you'll see that games coming out after Aion 2 will greatly increase their use of AI.</em></p>



<p>In the Q&amp;A published by Ruliweb, NCSOFT adds that the focus will be on PvE cooperation, although Guerrilla had mentioned some sort of competition with other tribes in the announcement video. When it comes to the release window, the Korean studio reiterated the release window <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-says-horizon-steel-frontiers-could-launch-as-early-as-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we previously reported from the NCSOFT quarterly earnings call</a>: late 2026 or early 2027, with public testing scheduled to take place at some point next year.</p>



<p>In case MMORPGs are not your cup of tea and the announcement of Horizon Steel Frontiers did nothing for you, Guerrilla Games is still making <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-co-op-game-nearly-confirmed-by-job-openings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its own cooperative multiplayer version of the franchise</a>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-isnt-only-horizon-multiplayer-game-guerilla-has-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed once again</a> by Jason Schreier.</p>

<p>Released November 14, Black Ops 7 is the latest instalment in the long-running Call of Duty franchise and has plenty to sink your teeth into, including a new endgame mode in campaign, multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone to come in future.</p>



<p>Across all modes, recognizable voices will be heard, and we can tell you exactly who the Black Ops 7 voice actors are and where you may know them from.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-major-actors-in-black-ops-7">All Major Actors in Black Ops 7</h2>

<p><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has a variety of actors starring, with some providing their likeness and voices to roles, while others are voice actors.</strong></p>



<p>Big names include Michael Rooker, Milo Ventimiglia, Nolan North, and Steve Blum, who have all starred in a host of other games, films, and TV series’ respectively.</p>

<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-voice-actors-past-roles">Black Ops 7 Voice Actors’ Past Roles</h2>



<p>If there are a few names in the list above you recognize but can’t quite place your finger on where you know them from, here’s a breakdown of some of the actors and their previous roles.</p>



<h3 id="h-milo-ventimiglia">Milo Ventimiglia</h3>



<p>Milo Ventimiglia shot to fame with the role of Peter Petrelli in the mid-2000’s TV series Heroes, and starred as Jack Pearson in over 100 episodes of This Is Us from 2016-2022.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is only his second video game appearance, from what we can find, with his debut coming in 2011’s X-Men: Destiny. He’s also voiced Wolverine in a TV Mini Series, and lended his voice to Spider-Man Noir in the Ultimate Spider-Man Anime.</p>



<h3 id="h-michael-rooker">Michael Rooker</h3>



<p>Michael Rooker first appeared in the Call of Duty franchise over a decade ago in Black Ops 2, and has also starred in The Walking Dead as Merle Dixon, and as Yondu in the Marvel Cinematic Universe—a role he has reprised for some anime series.</p>



<p>In recent years, Rooker has had fleeting appearances in The Rookie, Creature Commandos, and Peacemaker, as well as providing a voice for a Superman Robot in this year’s blockbuster film.</p>



<h3 id="h-steve-blum">Steve Blum</h3>



<p>Steve Blum is a familiar name in video games, having voiced both Wolverine and Venom in Marvel Rivals, as well as appearing in titles like Date Everything! and Mortal Kombat 1.</p>



<p>Other standout roles include voicing Zeb Orrelios in Star Wars: Rebels, Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop: The Movie, and Starscream in Transformers Prime.</p>



<h3 id="h-nolan-north">Nolan North</h3>



<p>Nolan North is another familiar voice across TV and video games, with 30 credited appearances in Rick and Morty and eight appearances in Family Guy, but it’s his video game roles where he stands out.</p>



<p>His roles include Rocket Raccoon in Marvel Rivals, Superman &amp; Penguin in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Modi in God of War Ragnarok, Deadpool in Marvel’s Midnight Suns, and Iron Man in Marvel’s Avengers.</p>

<p>We had a great time with Grand Bazaar when it arrived on Switch 2 earlier this year, and we were particular fans of how gosh darn charming the whole thing is: "Marvelous has really taken a lot of time to perfect the gameplay loop of Grand Bazaar, and that polish has also spilled out into the characters and the visuals."

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> creators Rockstar have been called out by a member of the UK parliament for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-have-been-accused-of-union-busting-after-the-firing-of-more-than-30-staff-members">dismissing 31 Rockstar North employees</a> in an alleged instance of union-busting. The politician in question, Christine Jardine of Edinburgh West and the Liberal Democrats, says that she has been approached by several of the fired developers, whom Rockstar accuse of leaking confidential information during conversations with union organisers in a private Discord channel. 
</p>
<p>
Jardine has asked the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> company for more details, and wants a meeting with a government minister to discuss support for the affected workers. Intriguingly, she acknowledges that she has a conflict of interest in that one of her own employees also currently works for Rockstar.
</p>
<p>
"Video game giant Rockstar has sacked more than 30 workers across the UK, including my constituents working at their Edinburgh office," Jardine wrote in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cajardinemp.bsky.social/post/3m5jgfa3dis2m">a social media post</a> last night, following the House of Commons session in question. "I urged Ministers to support workers who have lost their jobs, and stop this from happening again." The post includes a video in which she gives a longer account, below.
</p>
<blockquote>
I declare an interest because I have an employee who works for the company I'm about to mention, though they are not affected by the actions taken. That company is videogame company Rockstar, who's fired at least 30 employees across its UK studios, including Rockstar North in Edinburgh. Several of my constituents have been affected, and some came to see me last week to express those concerns. They claim they have been sacked because they were trying to unionise, and discussing working conditions in private. But Rockstar have accused them of distributing confidential information, and sacked them for gross misconduct. I've written to Rockstar to ask for information on the issue, but I wondered, can I can have a meeting with the relevant minister to discuss what steps can be taken to support [the fired Rockstar staff].
</blockquote>
<p>
Last week, RPS attended two pickets organised by the IWGB game workers union to protest the Rockstar North firings. At <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">a London gathering</a> outside Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive's offices, IWGB president Alex Marshall defended the right of the developers to organise and discuss their jobs in meetings attended by union members. He called Rockstar's claims about leaked material "completely disingenuous". The union are taking Rockstar to court over the firings.
</p><p>
In Edinburgh, meanwhile, freelancer Alan Wen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">spoke to several of the affected developers</a>, who claimed that union membership at Rockstar reached the legal minimum required for statutory recognition under UK law shortly before the mass firings. One protestor at the Edinburgh gathering characterised Rockstar's allegations of "gross misconduct" as a "nuclear option" to shut down the unionisation drive before it could gather too much momentum.
</p>
<p>220 Rockstar North staff have now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/220-rockstar-staff-sign-letter-to-management-calling-for-immediate-reinstatement-of-fired-workers">signed an open letter to management</a> calling for the immediate reinstatement of the fired workers. Further protests have been held in London and outside Take-Two's Paris headquarters. There's another Edinburgh rally due on 18th November outside the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood.</p>
<p>
Shortly after the firings, Rockstar and Take-Two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">pushed back the release of GTA 6 to November next year</a>. It doesn't strain credulity that company leadership might see a unionised workforce as a threat to their ability to impose certain working conditions, in order to ship the now repeatedly delayed game. Rockstar recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-reportedly-orders-gta-6-developers-to-end-hybrid-working-in-the-name-of-quality-and-polish">mandated a return to the office</a>, in reports confirmed by several of the Rockstar North workers, and staff have crunched on projects in the past. It's also credible that Rockstar might be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of project secrets going walkies following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-confirm-gta-6-leaks-but-say-it-wont-have-any-long-term-effect-on-development">a massive leak of GTA 6 materials</a> back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time GTA 6 and Rockstar have been brought up in a parliamentary session this week. Far right Polish politician Witold Tumanowicz of the Confederation Liberty and Independence group broached the "disturbing matter" of the GTA 6 delay in <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/1988328220757028917?s=19">footage shared on Tuesday</a>, presumably hoping to score some #based points with his online groupies.

            <p>Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics has announced yet more layoffs at the studio, calling it a "difficult but necessary decision".</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_today-weve-made-the-difficult-but-necessary-activity-7394805539140169729-lwXF/">LinkedIn</a>, the studio said it has "parted ways" with just under 30 employees. These employees came from a variety of projects and departments within the company, with Crystal Dynamics calling it part of a restructuring "for our next generation". </p>
<p>The developer additionally cited the next entry in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">which the studio is working on with Amazon</a>, as part of the reason for its decision.</p>

<p>"To our players - as the realities of the industry continue to evolve, we've made these painful choices as a way to optimise the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future," it wrote.</p><p>The post thanked those impacted by the layoffs for "their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways", adding: "We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition."</p>
<p>Closing, Crystal Dynamics said it appreciated support during these changes at the studio, and that it "[looks] forward to sharing the team's amazing new work with the world in the future".</p>
<p>This most recent wave of layoffs at the studio is at least the fourth in the last two years. In March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs">Crystal Dynamics laid off 17 "talented" staff members</a>, again calling it a "difficult decision".</p>
<p>In August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well"</a>.</p>

<p>Black Ops 7 has landed, with Zombies once again returning to the Call of Duty franchise, and there is another way to play this time around with the addition of Cursed Mode—and we’ve got an explanation of exactly what it is.</p>



<p>Zombies in Black Ops 7 has plenty to uncover, with an in-depth narrative to follow that continues on from the events of Black Ops 6 and a wealth of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-zombie-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive Camos to unlock</a>.</p>



<p>Cursed Mode in Black Ops 7 Zombies provides the biggest challenge of all, however, and we’ve got a breakdown of what you can expect from the mode.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-cursed-mode-in-black-ops-7-zombies">What is Cursed Mode in Black Ops 7 Zombies?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A new challenge. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Cursed Mode in Black Ops 7 Zombies is a hardcore version of the mode, providing a challenge for those familiar with the Zombies mechanics and turning back a more original style.</strong></p>



<p>Players are limited from the off, starting with just a Pistol, and can unlock Easter Eggs and Quests to unlock ‘Relics’—which have a similar style to Skulls in the Halo franchise. Once unlocked, they can be applied to the start of any Cursed run and provide extra challenge.</p>



<p>Each Relic provides debuffs to increase the challenge, and there are three difficulty tiers of Cursed mode that increase with the amount of Relics activated. However, there are also small buffs available at each difficult level, such as Golden Armor purchasable off the wall in Tier 1.</p>



<p>The core differences for cursed mode are detailed below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Players start the match with Pistol only.</li>



<li>Loadout weapons are unavailable.</li>



<li>Minimap is disabled.</li>



<li>Black Ops 3-style point system.</li>



<li>Modified ammo costs.</li>



<li>Maximum four active Perks.</li>



<li>No Ammo Caches.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-cursed-mode-in-black-ops-7-zombies">How to Unlock Cursed Mode in Black Ops 7 Zombies</h2>



<p><strong>Cursed Mode only becomes available in Black Ops 7 when the Ashes of the Damned main quest has been completed for the first time.</strong></p>



<p>This can be done by finding the steps and working your way through the Ashes of the Damned main quest yourself, or by waiting for the Directed Mode to release—which is expected to arrive in Season 1.</p>



<p>Once unlocked, Cursed Mode is permanently available for players to select as one of the four Zombies options alongside Standard Mode, Directed Mode, and Survival.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto VI has been delayed again, this time to November 19, 2026, and while the fan community is reeling in its own way, the impacts are not limited to just GTA’s eager audience. Grand Theft Auto is a juggernaut, with GTA V having sold 220 million copies to date, GTA Online still a wildly popular space month after month, and anticipation for the sequel breaking trailer viewership records. With a game’s release as hot as this one, what does moving it to a year away mean for everyone else? How will GTA VI’s delay impact the wider games industry?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As usual, we consulted our favorite panel of industry analysts to get their takes.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Delay-shaped ripples</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It probably goes without saying, but GTA VI’s delay into November of 2026 also means that behind the scenes, dozens of publishers are now reevaluating their own planned release dates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the moment, analysts point out, there aren’t that many games with public release dates specifically set for the final three months of 2026. But companies of course have their own internal plans, and those plans have been actively shifting around both GTA VI delays, out of sight, this entire time. That could mean a much, much thinner slate of game releases at a time that’s normally bursting with games, says Rhys Elliott, head of market analysis at Alinea Analytics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Publishers historically avoid launching anything major within several weeks of a Rockstar title. Sadly, GTA now again lands squarely in what is usually a packed holiday window. I can see the typical Q4 blockbuster season looking considerably thinner in 2026, especially when it comes to the single-player titles.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Manu Rosier, director of market intelligence at Newzoo agrees,pointing out that major publishers have probably already modeled multiple scenarios that include a GTA VI delay, and have plans for where to move their own games instead – plans that may benefit them in the long run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Newzoo’s title-level data shows that nearly 45% of major single-player launches since 2021 have landed between August and November, and those late-year releases underperform by roughly 25–35% compared to February–May launches in their first three months of playtime,” Rosier says. “That means a shift out of that congested window could benefit GTA VI and other game launches nearby.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even without release dates set already, there are some games we can genuinely count on coming out late in the year, such as a Call of Duty game, EA Sports FC, and Madden. Analysts told me that it’s possible this GTA VI delay causes at least some of them to move out of their usual corner late in the year to another date either earlier or later than usual.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“GTA will also steal engagement and revenues from the current live-service juggernauts like Fortnite and Roblox, which are always having an engagement tug of war, anyway,” Elliott continues. “All these games – and indeed the entertainment industry at large – will be competing with GTA VI for time and attention. Both money and time are finite, so GTA is going to eat up revenue and engagement across the market.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rosier disagrees, saying live-service games will be largely unaffected by GTA VI regardless of where it lands.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 Stills</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Newzoo’s engagement data shows that average monthly playtime across the top 20 console titles has remained up year-over-year, with live-service games accounting for more than half of total console playtime. Those ecosystems will keep momentum regardless of whether GTA VI arrives in spring or later in 2026.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not just AAA games that will be impacted, too. George Jijiashvili, senior principal analyst at Omdia suggests that major publishers will be cautious about making big changes to their own dates after two GTA VI delays and with a whole year to go. “The real impact will fall on indies and AA games, which are most sensitive to major launches and likely to feel a much bigger ripple effect.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Upgrades for the Holidays</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">But while there may be fewer brand new games coming out around the 2026 holiday season, analysts are optimistic for sales of hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is the big question that I've been talking with retailers and publishers about for, well, years now,” says Mat Piscatella, senior director at Circana. “When GTA V launched, there was a positive impact to sales of console hardware and accessories in the launch month, but that incremental boost was short lived before sales returned more or less to previous baseline. But that did not happen in a holiday window, so I'd expect the positive impact here to potentially be more profound. Let's call it somewhere between 250k-800k incremental units of console hardware sold in the holiday quarter worldwide above what would otherwise be expected because of Grand Theft Auto VI (yes, that's a big range). It's very difficult to say with any confidence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Piscatella adds that if a PC version were released around the same time, that would boost PC hardware and accessory sales in the same way. But, he caveats everything by noting that he’s making future predictions based on what happened over ten years ago at the launch of GTA V. Things could always be different now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Elliott does agree with him, pointing to College Football 25’s launch last year boosting PS5 and Xbox Series sales in the US last year. GTA VI is much bigger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While most are on PS5, a huge share of PlayStation’s monthly active users are still on PS4, and GTA VI will not ship on last-gen consoles,” he says. “Many of the holdout players have been waiting specifically for GTA to justify purchasing a PS5 (or Series X/S). That wave of new console owners – and their spending –  has now been pushed deeper into 2027.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Piers Harding-Rolls, research director at Ampere analysis, also noted that "console sales will be even more back loaded in 2026 than is normal," and told me he thinks this move was one the hardware manufacturers would celebrate: "Generally, in terms of launch timing to generate the most console sales, I think a Q4 release is better than Q2."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Will this delay impact GTA VI’s sales?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">No.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Literally every analyst I asked said no, GTA VI’s delay won’t impact its sales. Interest and anticipation for GTA VI are off the charts, historically unprecedented, according to Piscatella and Rosier. Piscatella added that GTA VI’s November release would likely make Q4 2026 the biggest in video game history in terms of U.S. game spending.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Grand Theft Auto is such an outlier franchise when it comes to this stuff that the sky really is the limit, and because it is an outlier in so many ways there aren't benchmarks from which a reliable forecast can really be generated.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Other Impacts</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The analysts I spoke to also mentioned other possible impacts of the delay that I hadn’t considered. One big one, which turned out to be controversial, was whether or not GTA VI’s delay could also end up delaying the release of next-gen consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other impacts were a bit more…psychological. Elliott pointed out that GTA VI was likely to be a cultural moment where entertainment, internet, and social identity all collided in a very public way. While it would be impossible to ever say exactly how the delay impacted that, the timing of GTA VI’s release will inevitably fall into a very specific cultural time and moment in politics and online culture, and will both influence and be influenced by what’s going on around it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Each major GTA release has shaped how people joke, what music goes viral, how cities are portrayed in art and media, and even how players relate to the idea of rebellion in their daily lives,” he said. “A launch in holiday 2025 or early to mid-2026 would have placed that cultural shift inside a very specific online environment, one defined by the competition between TikTok, Reels, YouTube Shorts, and livestreaming for social dominance. That timing would have made GTA the loudest voice in a conversation driven by rapid content remixing and constant viral cycles. In other words, the memes that could have defined 2026 will instead take shape in 2027!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rosier also posed the question of psychological impact, but from a different angle. His view is that the delay itself, regardless of when the game releases, signals something much bigger going on in the AAA gaming industry that other major publishers are watching close:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A GTA VI delay reinforces the growing tension between creative ambition and production realities in AAA development. It’s another signal that even the most established studios are struggling to balance scale, technology, and timelines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Newzoo’s historical engagement data shows that single-player titles typically retain 40% of their active players by week 5 and stabilize between weeks 6–12, declining only ~1% per week thereafter. That means publishers can fill gaps between major launches with live-service content, updates, or early-access beats to sustain engagement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“From a market view, the broader PC &amp; console segment is forecast to reach $85.8 billion in 2025 and continue growing through 2028, supported by rising engagement rather than an expanding release slate. Publishers are learning that the industry’s biggest risk isn’t fewer releases, it’s announcing too early.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Joost van Dreunen, NYU Stern professor and author of the <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SuperJoost Playlist newsletter</a>, was thinking along similar lines. As he points out, the industry has been going through a rough patch the last few years, with mass layoffs, game cancelations, studio closures, price increases, and general economic uncertainty. While there’s a sense from a number of sectors that GTA VI could swoop in and be the industry savior, van Dreunen cautions against putting too many hopes on one game – even one as big as GTA VI:</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s even a somewhat naive expectation that this one release will reverse the industry’s current direction. It won’t. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“After the high comes the hangover,” he said. “I realize that many in the industry are looking forward to this undoubtedly pivotal moment. There’s even a somewhat naive expectation that this one release will reverse the industry’s current direction. It won’t. Once Take-Two releases the game, and both players and investors each enjoy their respective highs, I expect a period of sobriety to follow. In the absence of any similar releases in the near future especially investors are likely to redeploy their capital elsewhere, thereby lowering the industry’s overall valuation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s clear that GTA VI’s delay to November 19, 2026 has already made massive waves industry-wide, and will continue to do so over the next year as the impacts of both its absence in the spring, and its presence in the fall, are more keenly felt.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I’m rarely one to replay a game, so with how often new entries in the Atelier series come out, I usually only manage a single playthrough before it’s time to move on to the next. I’ll happily make an exception to that trend for the Atelier Ryza trilogy, though. I’m a huge fan of Ryza as an Atelier protagonist, and getting to watch her grow and mature across a full trilogy was a beautiful shake up to the usual Atelier formula of new protagonists in each game. I also loved what this trilogy did with combat, turning it into a unique hybrid of turn-based battles and fast-paced real time action. Needless to say, I was beyond excited to hop into the new Atelier Ryza Secret Trilogy Deluxe Pack re-release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atelier Ryza Secret Trilogy Deluxe Pack - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CFj3yfwaYTs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>These aren’t big remasters or major makeovers for the original games – those games being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/29/atelier-ryza-ever-darkness-the-secret-hideout-review-switch-ps4-pc/">Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness &amp; the Secret Hideout</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/26/atelier-ryza-2-lost-legends-the-secret-fairy-review-ps4-ps5-switch-pc/">Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends &amp; the Secret Fairy</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/23/atelier-ryza-3-review-alchemist-of-the-end-the-secret-key/">Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End &amp; the Secret Key</a>. Instead, they’re re-releases that pack in all of the paid, free, and time-exclusive DLC originally released for each title. There’s also a mix of new content in each game, ranging from new playable characters to bonus story scenarios, quality-of-life improvements, and even a new standalone battle-simulator mode.</p>


<p>These “DX” repackagings have been a staple of the Atelier franchise for a while now. They usually came with the excitement of bringing slightly inaccessible older entries to more current or portable platforms, like when the Arland and Dusk trilogies from the PlayStation 3 were brought to PS Vita, or when those and the more modern PlayStation 4 Mystery trilogy were ported to the Nintendo Switch and PC. The Atelier Ryza Secret Trilogy Deluxe Pack is slightly less exciting in that regard. These games have already been available across PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch, but their older version are being delisted for these new editions, and they are debuting on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>


<p>As someone coming into each of these for a second playthrough, Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness &amp; the Secret Hideout DX was the one I was most excited to dig into &nbsp;– almost entirely because of the bonus playable characters in this entry. The DX re-release lets you add Agatha Harmon, Kilo Shiness, and Romy Vogel to your party, and they’re all incredibly charming supporting NPCs from the main story. I’ve been a fan of Agatha and Romy for ages, specifically. Agatha’s whole thing of being a stern woman with a cool purple outfit and a mean face hits a major weak spot for me, and Romy is a hilarious shopkeeper NPC who only cares about profit – equally as deranged yet charming as Anna from the Fire Emblem series. Each of them have unique animations and special attacks that suit their personalities and fighting styles (or lack of fighting style, in Romy’s case) so perfectly. While I didn’t stick it through for an entire playthrough of the main campaign with them, I did spend some time messing around with them in my party for the new bonus stories. The Kilo &amp; Bos story fills in a gap from the main story in a really satisfying and natural way. Meanwhile, the Ryza-led epilogue story is nice for getting some more time with her, but ultimately feels more like a filler episode than anything truly important.</p>

<p>Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends &amp; the Secret Fairy DX adds just two bonus playable characters, but they’re not nearly as exciting as the ones for the first game. Empel Vollmer and Lila Decyrus make their playable debut in this DX edition of the second game, and I’m a big fan of both characters. They were already fully playable party members in the first game, though, so their inclusion here feels a bit more basic by comparison, though the bonus story is more exciting. This sees you playing entirely as Lila as her and Empel explore a new mysterious locale related to their research into the Underworld. It’s a fun adventure, and getting an extended story with an entirely different protagonist to follow for this entry is a nice change-up.</p>
<p>This edition of the game also adds some quality-of-life improvements to exploration via a new companion character, Fi – a floating fairy who will expand your Sensor Map and provide bonus healing after battles. They were helpful features for making another playthrough go by smoothly, but didn’t break the balance of the game in any way.</p>

<p>Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End &amp; the Secret Key DX adds three new playable characters as well. Two of them are also returners from the previous game – Clifford Diswell and Serri Glaus – and the third is Kilo once again, though she already played a big role in this game as a supporting story character. Seeing her made playable here is pretty exciting, but it’s also really fun to compare her appearance and attack abilities from the first game’s DX release to how she is here at the end of the trilogy. Clifford &amp; Serri get a bonus story in this release focused on their adventures outside of the main story, but they aren’t really as exciting to be the focus of an entire chapter compared to Empel and Lila. It’s still a fun change of pace, but they probably aren’t the characters I would have chosen to do a dedicated bonus story for.</p>
<p>Finally, all three games in the Atelier Ryza Secret Trilogy Deluxe Pack feature a new Custom Combat mode that’s basically a big combat sandbox. Pick any enemies to fight, adjust their levels, choose your party, and even customise modifiers to make the battle harder or easier. It’s a fun little excuse to check out the new playable characters for a bit, but my problem is that it’s basically just a combat-only distraction. There’s no ties to the main story or progression mechanics or unlockables, so this isn’t really something worth spending a lot of time in when you can find the same battles in the main game and have your victories actually mean something.</p>
<p>Overall, these new DX editions of the trilogy aren’t mind-blowing reinventions of these games, but they are a really convenient repackaging that is hands down the best way to experience each entry. The loads of bundled-in DLC are nice, and the bonus characters and stories are great for returning players sucked into replaying them, but at the end of the day each of these games is still just as fun and memorable of a JRPG as they were when they originally came out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The open world action/adventure game Immortals Fenyx Rising is now free to grab <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/immortals-fenyx-rising/5cec210a39798c0870c07684.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Ubisoft Connect</a> (PC) until December 2. The offer is Ubisoft's way to celebrate the fifth anniversary of its own ecosystem.</p>



<p>Immortals Fenyx Rising was developed by Ubisoft Quebec, the same team that led development of Assassin's Creed Odyssey and most recently launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. The game debuted in December 2020 to a generally favorable reception. On Wccftech, it earned an 8 out of 10 score from Francesco De Meo, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-fenyx-rising-breath-titan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote at the time</a>:</p>



<p><em>At the end of the day, I enjoyed Immortals Fenix Rising way more than I thought I would. The first impressions were pretty bad, but as the game progressed and more options became available, I found myself fully engrossed in the tale of Fenyx and his war against the terrible Typhon, smiling at the jokes told by Prometheus and Zeus, and loving every second of gliding around the Golden Isle in search of treasure. Sure, the game is not innovative at all, but the way every little element and mechanic comes together makes it easy to look past this issue and enjoy one of the best open-world games put out by Ubisoft in recent years.</em></p>



<p>As usual in these cases, Ubisoft is actually gifting you the Standard Edition. However, it also happens that the DLCs are currently heavily discounted (-65%). You can pick <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-fenyx-rising-a-new-god-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A New God</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-fenyx-rising-the-lost-gods-review-ash-rising-from-the-fenyx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lost Gods</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-fenyx-rising-myths-of-the-eastern-realm-some-stories-are-better-left-untold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Myths of the Eastern Realm</a> for $2.80 each, or just grab the Season Pass at $7.00 to get access to all the DLCs.</p>



<p>In July 2022, a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-fenyx-rising-sequel-will-be-based-on-hawaiian-polynesian-culture-game-is-still-in-early-pre-production-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surfaced</a> that an Immortals Fenyx Rising sequel was in early pre-production at Ubisoft Quebec and would center around Hawaiian Polynesian Culture. However, in July 2023, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancelled-immortals-fenyx-rising-sequel-to-prioritize-assassins-creed-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to cancel the project</a>, ensuring the team would focus entirely on Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>In other Ubisoft news, the publisher has unexpectedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-delays-first-half-2025-26-fiscal-results-release-major-announcement-could-be-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a> its quarterly and half-year financial results, sparking speculation that an acquisition (possibly by Tencent) may be announced imminently.</p>

                <p>The PS5 is celebrating its fifth anniversary, and Sony has released a whole lot of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/12/five-years-of-play-the-evolution-of-playstation-5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statistics</a> to celebrate--including the most-played multiplayer and single-player games on the console. Perhaps unsurprisingly, battle royale monolith <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> took out the top spot for multiplayer, while launch game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla/" data-ref-id="5000-511540">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> still holds the lead in single-player titles.</p><p>Sony revealed that PS5 players have logged a cumulative total of 100 billion hours of gameplay, engaging with a library of over 7,500 published games. Of all those games, Sony revealed which came out on top when it came to playtime--after Fortnite, the most popular multiplayer titles on PS5 were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto V</a> in second place, with 2022's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-563732">Call of Duty Modern Warfare II</a> beating five other PS5 COD titles to claim third place.</p>

			<p>Like many other companies this week, Taiwanese computer, electronics, and phone manufacturer ASUS posted its quarterly reports, and Chief Financial Officer Nick Wu spoke about the new ROG Ally products, released last month in partnership with Xbox. During the Q3 2025 investor call, Wu claimed the market response has been highly positive, and demand for these pricier devices has surprised even ASUS.</p>



<p><em>As many of you know, we introduced the first-generation ROG Ally 2-3 years ago as a market pioneer. Over the past couple of years, this new category, especially within the Windows ecosystem and creating this particular new category, has proven itself to be highly successful. We believe that we have achieved our original goals in terms of premium positioning and creating a new growth driver in the gaming segment. That is why we launched the 3rd-generation ROG Ally last month. It featured deeper collaboration with Xbox. Since its launch, we see that the market response for it has been extremely positive. Particularly, there has been an appetite for the premium higher-end models exceeding our expectations. In fact, these high-end variants are currently in short supply.</em> <em>We are working closely with key component suppliers to ramp up production and fill the demand gap that currently exists. Our goal for the ROG Ally is to remain a core pillar within the ASUS gaming portfolio, while also driving tangible revenue and profit growth for the company.</em></p>



<p>The CFO went on to say that the company estimates a revenue contribution from these launches to be between 3 and 5 billion New Taiwan dollars (NT$), which translates to between $96 million and $160 million. The robust demand leads ASUS to believe that this could increase slightly in future quarters to a range of between 4 and 5 billion NT$ (128-160 million US dollars).</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our review of the ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, David Carcasole praised its advanced hardware capabilities but also criticized the price tag, wondering if there was even an audience for it. Apparently, so far, it's more than enough as far as ASUS is concerned.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, the recently released game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> teased the second chapter.</p>
<p>Now, in an update via Falcom's <a href="https://www.falcom.co.jp/ir-data/20251112-1">latest financial report for September 2025</a>, the company has reportedly locked in a release window for the remake of The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC – with the game scheduled to arrive by the fiscal year ending <strong>September 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/if-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-doesnt-get-a-sequel-our-fans-will-go-youve-got-to-be-kidding-me-nihon-falcom-ceo-on-future-releases/">recent interview</a>, the Falcom president Toshihiro Kondo mentioned how a remake of the second entry had to happen.

<blockquote>
<p>"If we didn’t follow up with a remake of Trails in the Sky SC, people would go, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me.’ So, we do want to do a remake along the lines of Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As our <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/highly-anticipated-rpg-remake-trails-in-the-sky-2nd-chapter-confirmed-for-2026-release">colleagues at Push Square also note</a>, "the second Trails in the Sky game is widely considered to be one of the franchise's best instalments. It's got a gut-punching story and some fantastic character development — alongside some of the most memorable boss encounters in the series".</p>
<p>And without getting too far ahead, Kondo has previously stated how anything beyond this (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/second-trails-in-the-sky-remake-all-but-confirmed-by-falcom-boss">as in a remake of the third instalment</a>) will likely come down to "fan demand". For now, no specific platforms have been confirmed for the second chapter just yet, so when there's an official announcement, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>The 1st Chapter was released on the Switch and Switch 2 on 19th September 2025, and since then, the Switch 2 version has received some "image quality and performance settings". There's also a demo you can download from the eShop.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the campaign mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. For our thoughts on the other modes, see our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review"><u><em>multiplayer review in progress</em></u></a><em>, and our Zombies mode review is still on its way.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bucking the usual trend of breaks between numbered sequels, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is following just 12 months on from Black Ops 6, and you’d perhaps assume that meant only small tweaks to what was one of the series’ high points last year. But the teams at Raven and Treyarch evidently don’t see it that way, and have instead built one of the most unconventional CoD campaigns to date. In many ways, it doesn’t even feel like a CoD single-player mode. It’s more like a multiplayer experiment squeezed into a campaign shell, playing best when you’re accompanied by squadmates, echoing Zombies or the now-defunct DMZ at times. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-review">I recently criticised Battlefield 6’s single-player for playing it safe</a> and not taking any risks, and to Black Ops 7’s credit, the same can’t be said here. The problem, however, is that not many of its big swings hit, resulting in one of Call of Duty’s most intriguing, yet flawed campaigns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its varied string of missions walks the tightrope between traditional military shooter and schlocky sci-fi nonsense, darting between worlds beyond our technological fingertips and deep within our most haunted of dreams. That spectacle is supported by sharp gunplay and a whole host of gadgetry and abilities that make moving around those worlds incredibly satisfying. But it all culminates in a brand-new endgame portion that stitches together aspects of CoD’s past open-world successes and failures in an attempt to become something new. In reality, that post-credits content is a repetitive shooting gallery that adds little to the excitement that leads up to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of Black Ops 7’s intrigue emanates from one fundamental design choice: for the first time in many years, a Call of Duty campaign is fully playable in four-player co-op, and it really does feel like it has been made with that in mind as the preferred method of play. This comes with both positives and negatives. Teaming up with friends is good fun, with fighting big bosses that have multiple weak points to fire upon simultaneously or stealthily working through an enemy area tactically, both coming with a good deal of satisfaction. But it also detrimentally affects the solo experience, from not having AI companions fill in for you if no buddies are online, or kicking you for inactivity if you’re idle for too long, to not even being able to pause due to its online-only nature. Its open areas and endgame portion seem catered toward a group experience as well, and can end up just a little lonely when zipping around by yourself. To an extent, it feels like Activision is finally admitting that most people come to its hallmark shooter for multiplayer fun, rather than the single-player story modes the series was founded on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, having played several missions in both co-op and single-player, I can confirm that playing solo is borderline tedious due to having to repeat multiple objectives, such as placing C4 on a building yourself four times rather than splitting them up as is intended. There are also no difficulty options this time around, meaning that, in theory, it should scale the threat depending on how many players are in your squad. In my experience, though, the number of enemies in a level remains the same, leaving me feeling overwhelmed by foes even in its earliest levels. By comparison, playing in a full squad makes these encounters a breeze, with not enough targets to go around sometimes. In fact, enemy numbers are uneven across the campaign as a whole, sometimes swarming you with dozens of rabid rushers, but at others, presenting you with a couple of soldiers wandering through a door when you’re expecting an onslaught. It’s, admittedly, a difficult balance to get right, but one that has not been achieved here.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It really does seem like it was made to be played in four-player co-op.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the structure of the campaign, Black Ops 7’s story is delivered at breakneck speed, taking me just about five hours to reach the endgame. Its 11 missions threw me from one exotic location to the next, from one time period to another, and deep into nightmare realms full of otherworldly horrors and delights. The year is 2035, and new threats are here to instigate a global collapse once again. The re-emergence of Black Ops 2 villain Raul Menendez thrusts the playable unit, Spectre One, into action and soon has them facing off against evil tech company The Guild. What follows is a set of missions that throws you in and out of reality thanks to a fear toxin being weaponised by The Guild, led by Kiernan Shipka’s Emma Kagan, who is trading in Mad Men for mad mechs here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A combination of cliched evil sci-fi tech corp and Batman Arkham scarecrow-esque antics leads each level to interesting places from a visual perspective, as long-buried memories of our protagonists are dredged up and morphed into horror-filled mazes. It makes for a more varied campaign when it comes to art design, with an impressive number of locations and creatures thematically filling them to gun down. I do wish there was a little more in terms of mission variety when it comes to actual level and objective design, though, with corridor shooting taking the lead in most of these excursions. There’s nothing to rival the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6s-coolest-mission-shows-its-time-call-of-duty-left-modern-warfare-behind"><u>creeping intrigue of last year’s Emergence</u></a> conceptually and its branching objectives and playful enemy design, for example, nor the spy-like cool of infiltrating an embassy fundraiser or high-roller casino.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If last year’s Black Ops 6 leaned more into grounded espionage and subterfuge, 7 is a much louder proposition, choosing to demolish the lobby of a complex to gain access to it rather than sweet-talking the security guard standing in front of it. As a result, there is no shortage of big moments justifying its blockbuster label. Dodging giant falling machetes like you’ve stumbled into a Looney Tunes cartoon is a one-off joy, as is taking control of a lavish luxury boat and ramming into the side of a building. Moments like this feel pinched right out of Christopher Nolan’s back pocket and sit perfectly in the Call of Duty mold. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s just the opening section of one of the standout missions, which takes place in Tokyo and has you dipping into its subway systems and leaping across rooftops. There’s a great sense of forward momentum to levels like these, and I’m a massive fan of them. I just wish more of the campaign were like this Japanese chapter, as I’m not so keen on the ones taking place in the more open-zone areas of the fictional French city-state of Avalon (itself a huge battle royale-sized hub), which struggle to bottle the same exciting energy. These typically have you moving across wider rural patches of its map in order to chase the next cluster of enemies to take down, and essentially serve as tutorials for its endgame. They’re a little less authored than others and fail to capture the same thrills as a result.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Much of the time, it doesn’t really feel like a ‘Call of Duty’ campaign at all.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, much of the time, it doesn’t really feel like a ‘Call of Duty’ campaign at all. Yes, it has the militaristic hallmarks, but borrows just as much from horde shooters like Left 4 Dead and its own in-house zombie modes. It makes for an uneven set of missions, some of which really don’t work for me, but with others that do manage to hit the spot when they capture some of the CoD cinematic legacy. They’re a rarity, though, and for every one of these, there is also a bizarrely dull sequence, such as the time you’re asked to play Frogger on a twisted, upside-down LA highway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you might expect, the gunplay is snappy and satisfying, with SMGs delightfully ripping through armoured enemies and sniper rifles really coming into their own and popping out bits of brain in some of the campaign’s open areas. Each weapon has a good weight to it and is super-responsive when pulling the trigger. It’s Call of Duty, they’ve been doing this for a long time now, and how good its guns feel shouldn’t come as a shock as you rip through enemy healthbars and armor chunks. These extra layers to their vitality do present a slightly more drawn-out cadence to gunfights, though, with a few extra bursts of the trigger needed to take down each. The firearms are supported by a fantastic selection of skills and gadgets, too, with killstreaks making their way into single-player, such as the joyously destructive war machine, allowing for quick mob clean-ups.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All Weapons in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll admit, I was initially sceptical of the near-future setting and Call of Duty’s return to tinkering with near-future tech when it comes to movement, but on the whole, the experiment is largely a success. Wall jumping can be a little clunky, but the kinetic super jump is very fun to use as a quick flanking tool, as is my favourite of the bunch, the grapple hook. Swinging up to roofs to find a better vantage point before swooping down on a wingsuit to get back up close opens up each level’s architecture in interesting ways. It may never reach that Titanfall 2 gold standard when it comes to FPS mobility, but there are flashes of it here, which is always welcome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This desire to experiment also carries into its approach to boss design, which is by no means revolutionary when it comes to FPS campaigns, but a relatively new thing for Call of Duty. I appreciate the efforts made in order to make each have its own gimmick, even if they all ultimately come down to draining an oversized health bar while dodging projectiles. They certainly aren’t complex, but hitting the glowing weak points of a giant, bile-spewing plant in a cave of nightmares is certainly a step up from just pumping bullets into a Juggernaut for the hundredth time, especially when multiple targets are offered up at once and really make the whole co-op nature of the campaign feel worthwhile.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Movement may never reach that Titanfall 2 gold standard, but there are flashes of it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, enemy variety is quite impressive this time around, with human, mechanical, and hallucinatory foes offering different threats that challenge you at all distances. Guild forces include a robot army, as well as traditional militia types such as the machine-gun-wielding Raider, colossal armor-plated Titan, and other NFL team-name adjacent units. Yes, most can be handled with some well-aimed assault rifle fire to the head, but there are more effective ways to deal with them if you choose to explore your arsenal. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I particularly enjoyed one incursion into a robotics lab, which equipped me with a Black Hat hacking device. I liked how it switched up the cadence of the unrelenting bullets a little, and meant I could disrupt and destroy these Terminator wannabes from cover. It even made a miniboss of this zone — an admittedly unexciting rotating turret — easier to take down. I appreciate that, in a game of such ferocious speed as this, you’re occasionally rewarded for taking a breath and using your brain to overcome objectives rather than solely relying on pure firepower.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s kind of a shame, then, that once the campaign’s set of linear missions is over, the endgame borrows little of this philosophy. After the main story’s credits have rolled, you’re offered a chance to experience its epilogue, which takes place in the open region of Avalon that’s teased throughout. If you played Call of Duty’s DMZ mode, then you’ll have a rough idea of what to expect here: it’s an extraction shooter, except it's not. You and up to three friends can team up and drop into this battle royale-sized map and complete the activities that litter it with eye-soreing regularity. On every street corner are Guild checkpoints or zombie-infested buildings to clear out as you progress through its difficulty-tiered regions in order to reach its final boss, located at the epicentre of the island’s toxic smog. The catch? If your squad goes down, you lose all of your progress. That progress is mainly tied to your combat rating, a number that goes up the more killing and map icon clearing you do, and it's therefore up to you to know when to call it quits on a certain run and extract from the map within a time limit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For each level you go up, you’ll get a skill point to plug into any of two given options. These can range from armor plates automatically regenerating when you get kills to overall movement speed or rate of fire increases. The idea is to keep building up your character until you’ve reached the minimum recommended level of 55 and shut down the toxic threat sweeping across Avalon. The progression feels genuine, too, with my character resembling a super soldier at higher ranks, thanks to the sheer amount of speed I harnessed and the damage I could absorb. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The bones of an exciting endgame are here, but it gets tired a little too soon.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In theory, I like this idea and think there are the bones of an exciting mode here — something that could capture the magic the likes of Helldivers 2 has done in recent times — but as is, it unfortunately gets a little tired a little too soon. Objectives are almost all exclusively “go to this place and clear out the enemies there,” which I understand is part of the fundamentals when it comes to shooters, but I would’ve appreciated a little more variety and something that mirrored the minor puzzle-solving sections of the main campaign, or at least clever uses of the gadgetry it introduces. The enemy AI that walks Avalon’s streets is also dumb as bricks and pops out of cover freely, making each encounter a simple affair when you put enough distance between you and them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, zooming around on grapple hooks and transitioning into wing suit gliding mid-fall is still incredibly satisfying, as is plotting out methods of attack in a four-player squad, but all semblance of interesting level or mission design is traded in upon entry here for a few hours of relatively mindless shooting in order to watch some numbers tick up. In some ways, it sits somewhere between the campaign missions and Zombies in its design, but frustratingly borrows the least interesting aspects of both, neglecting the mission structure and mystery-solving that each mode thrives on. It results in a reasonably enjoyable, but not essential, second serving to the campaign. And don’t worry, if the endgame doesn’t sound like your cup of tea, or even sounds a little daunting (the ferocity of its bullet sponge hordes can get overwhelming in its latter stages, especially when heading in solo), the story does wrap up satisfyingly enough beforehand for it not to feel like you’re missing out on an ending completely.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Simon Cardy Ranks Every COD Campaign He's Played</h3><p>A ranking of all of the Call of Duty campaigns that I've played.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a story nowhere near as accomplished as last year’s effort, though. Effectively a direct sequel to Black Ops 2 that also ties into the events of Black Ops 6, presumed knowledge and the speed at which its setup is told can be a little disorientating, especially if you aren’t familiar with its 2012 predecessor. The themes are personal this time around, with David “Section” Mason, recast here as Heroes’ Milo Ventimiglia, placed centre stage as he battles with his past – namely the loss of his father, Alex. There are some fun revelations along the way, as well as treats for long-term fans of the Black Ops series, but as someone who has never held those characters in as high regard as their Modern Warfare counterparts, the pulling of the heartstrings didn’t quite work for me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also means that the rest of the Spectre One squad doesn’t really get plot points of their own aside from flashes of resurfacing trauma, relegating them very much to support characters in David’s world, as Michael Rooker’s Harper in particular is given some truly dumb lines to scream as loud as he can. That being said, if you are someone who has always preferred the adventures of Woods, Mason, Adler, and co, I’m sure you’ll have a great time here. It does mean, though, that this revisiting of the past, combined with a thick layer of exposition, can make the early hours of the story relatively impenetrable to newcomers, so I’d bear that in mind if you’re coming in fresh. I’d really recommend <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-timeline"><u>a thorough recap of the Black Ops timeline</u></a> to all if you wish to get the most out of it.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s campaign is a wild one thanks to the scope of its ambition. Not every roll of the dice pays off, but there’s enough enjoyment to be found across its 11 missions to not feel like a dud, at least when played in its desired co-op fashion. Beyond that, its endgame has the seed of a good idea that could be nurtured with future efforts, but it comes across as a little repetitive and supplementary to the story Black Ops 7 is trying to tell. With satisfying gunplay and very fun movement abilities providing solid foundations, there’s a reasonable mix of styles on show here, even if it doesn’t fire on all cylinders 100% of the time. Despite being a step down from last year’s exhilarating Black Ops 6 campaign, it certainly takes some big swings – they just don’t always land. It’s not bad. It’s not good. It’s simply okay.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review]]></content:encoded>

						<h5>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h5><p><span>November 14th, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, PC</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Treyarch, Raven Software</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Despite being the seventh title in the Black Ops franchise, this year's title, co-developed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/treyarch-call-of-duty-black-ops-3-presents-our-most-ambitious-campaign-yet/">Treyarch</a> and Raven Software, sidesteps last year's title and is instead billed as a direct follow-up to a title that launched back on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 centers around the return of the antagonist of that story, Raul Menendez, back once again and threatening to burn the whole world down.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With Raul Menendez, the overarching antagonist of the second Black Ops title, seemingly back from the dead, a new security contractor/paramilitary force known as The Guild has risen up to protect the world against this terrorist. Even though Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is linked directly with the second title, players get a crash course on the events of a game that was released more than a dozen years ago, yet still futuristic in its timeline (the second Black Ops title was set in 2025, while Black Ops 7 takes place ten years later in 2035). Even if you have never played a Call of Duty title before and know nothing about the task force and various characters, the game's flashy set pieces and nonstop action will draw most players in.</p>



<p>While Menendez is the face of Black Ops 7's campaign early on, this spectre of a bygone era is little more than a boogeyman than an actual threat. No, it should come as no surprise that this up-and-coming security force known as The Guild is the real threat this time around. Led by a millennial woman who channels her inner Elizabeth Holmes in public, this faction is one of Call of Duty's least effective villains. Their main driving force is in the creation and testing of an experimental psychoactive drug that makes the victim hallucinate or lash out in rage. It's a somewhat low-tech solution for a paramilitary company that bills itself as a leader in robotics and AI.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In an era of deepfakes, bringing Raul Menendez back from the dead to make a public threat does little to push the narrative forward beyond digging up painful memories for the lead character and his crew. At no point did Menendez feel like a credible threat during the campaign beyond the collective psychotrips that Mason and his crew endure on a regular basis. I daresay that beyond all of The Guild's scheming and desire to build and test a new chemical weapon, this is overall one of the lowest-stakes campaigns to come around to Call of Duty in a while. The Guild rarely feels as powerful and imposing as its figurehead Kagan would lead the public to believe, even with their technology and fancy toys, and the eleven chapters of the co-op campaign lead up to a rather weak confrontation on the battlefield.</p>



<p>Early on in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's co-op campaign, Mason and his crew are subjected to the psychoactive substance that The Guild has been cooking up, and due to the convenient plot device of having the team share a neural link, they can all go on a collective trip into the deep reaches of each protagonist's repressed trauma. For Mason, it's revisiting Nicaragua to chase down Menendez while massive machetes rain from the sky. For others, it's breaking out of a Russian prison or revisiting 2025 Los Angeles in the midst of a terrorist attack. These set pieces offer something dynamically different from the rest of the narrative, removing the grounded sci-fi military narrative with metaphysical threats and horrors twisted to that character's state of mind. With how the narrative keeps jumping between chasing down Kagan and The Guild in the real world and another psychoactive trip in the next chapter, it can be difficult to keep track of what's going on without the whiplash of jumping between one narrative and the next. Throw in a single mission set in Japan with a different military faction, and you've got one messy timeline to follow along (if nothing else, this mission helps to justify the return of fan favorite multiplayer maps like Raid and Express with a Japanese makeover). </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following up from Black Ops 2 is a tough order for Treyarch and the numerous development studios that worked together to release Black Ops 7 just one year after the sixth numbered sequel. Black Ops 2 introduced significant innovation to the campaign's narrative and flow, most notably through branching storylines and Strike Force missions. Both of these are omitted from Black Ops 7's co-op campaign, instead focused on a rollercoaster that takes players from the televised return of Raul Menendez to the fall of The Guild and lingering around Avalon to clean up the remains in the separate Endgame mode. Instead, the real innovations to the campaign storytelling this time around come by way of the ability to play through the entire shooting gallery campaign with three other friends and a progression track that feeds into the overall leveling up and unlocks for the other two core multiplayer modes. A lack of proper drop-in-and-drop-out matchmaking missed the opportunity to jump into a game with friends during the review period, unless we coordinated to try and meet up before queueing for a specific mission.</p>



<p>From beginning to Endgame (counting a single successful extraction), players are looking at around six to seven hours for the co-op campaign and not much reason to play the first eleven missions unless you missed a collectible (thankfully just one per mission) or the occasional achievement in certain chapters for pulling off an exemplary task. The few campaign missions that take place in Avalon during the latter half of the campaign lacked the sense of urgency and direction that the rest of the chapters had, instead feeling more like a brief tease for the open world map for the final chapter. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Endgame is indeed something unique for the Call of Duty campaigns, but might not feel too distinctly different from some of the other multiplayer offerings beyond the core multiplayer and zombies in earlier entries, namely Black Ops 4's Blackout and the likes of DMZ and MWZ. Players group up in squads of up to four and venture out to level up their chosen operator by completing repeatable missions all across the map of Avalon. As players level up, they'll pick up three different skill tracks out of a possible six, with each level providing a random boon to either their core stats or a skill unique to one of those three tech trees. Not all of these skill trees are created equal, as I found myself gravitating towards the Gunner track for faster reloads and Bulldozer for its immunity to self-inflicted explosions at the highest tier (a launcher was almost always part of my core loadout for Endgame).</p>



<p>Avalon is home to a variety of activities scattered throughout the map, but there isn't a sense of randomness to events across the map. For the most part, the majority of events are available on the map for players to pick off in any order they choose. With Endgame being exclusively a PvE mode, there isn't the excitement of running across an enemy squad like there was back in the days of DMZ. Instead, encounters feel almost like busy work as you replay them for the dozenth time because your operator died in the last match and you're having to start back up from zero. In just a few hours' time, I had a pretty good rotation of events to work with and quickly get my level up to where I could venture into at least the second-tiered zone early on and pick up a higher rarity weapon. Even as rival squads can lay claim to an activity on the map, let enough time pass, and players can come back to do it all over again for more loot and power XP.</p>

<p>Unlike MWZ, there aren't interesting pieces of loot like weapon blueprints or hidden quests to be discovered. Forget scavenging around foot lockers or duffel bags for unique drops. All of the gear that players will come across is either part of their loadout when they spawn into the match or acquired through quest rewards and supply drops. Because of how the weapon attachment system works for Endgame, it's often best to bring in a weapon that you've been leveling up in the core modes, complete with attachments and all, then use the various upgrade machines in each tier to boost the rarity of the weapon and its damage output. What attachments come on a field acquisition weapon is dictated by its initial rarity: base green tier (uncommon) weapons are limited to two, rare weapons three, epic four, and legendary weapons have five attachment slots. </p>



<p>There were also unique weapons that could be uncovered. Still, because I had barely scraped the surface of the highest difficulty tier in Endgame, I'm leaving that out of the campaign review. Instead, I will include it in our separate multiplayer review, which will be published soon. I've already had a sneak peek at what's to come in the first major content drop for Endgame, including some massive dinosaurs and bosses that are far more interesting than the basic Guild grunts and zombies littered around Avalon.</p>



<p>The strengths of <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ready-for-launch-progression-prestige">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s campaign rally around three pillars new for this year's entry: playing with friends, shared progression, and integrating the open-world mode into the campaign. The first two are features that I hope remain a constant in Call of Duty moving forward, but it's tough to recommend Endgame as the main reason to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 when previous modes like DMZ and Blackout offered a far more interesting set of challenges. These inclusions alone help bolster a campaign that otherwise felt like one of the lowest stakes a Call of Duty task force had ever had to shoot their way through. Whether you're here to see the continuation of Alex Mason's story from a decade ago or are just here for more of Michael Rooker's one-liners, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 shines through when you experience it with friends.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Being able to play through Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's campaign in a full squad of four and then jump straight into the Endgame makes this one of the more enjoyable Call of Duty campaigns in recent years, even if the story being told fails to live up to the hype.</p>

</li><li>Shared progression incentivizes players to enjoy the campaign and Endgame through unique camos and unlocks</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>

							<li>Endgame, at least in the lower difficulty tiers, feels like a step back from previous modes like DMZ/MWZ and Blackout
</li><li>Emma Kagan (Kiernan Shipka) lacks the gravitas or presence of prior Call of Duty antagonists
</li><li>Campaign missions set in Avalon fail to impress
</li><li>No difficulty settings for the main campaign leads to one of the easiest campaigns to date, not counting Endgame
