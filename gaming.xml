<p>The team-based competitive title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> has received two major updates since it hit the court last August, and today Nintendo has released the game's first update of 2026.</p>
<p>This one is a much smaller patch. It bumps the game up to <strong>Version 1.2.1</strong>, and apparently addresses some issues to improve the overall game experience. Here's the full rundown, so if you've been encountering these problems during gameplay, they should no longer be a problem once you've performed this update:</p>
<h3>Drag x Drive Ver. 1.2.1 (Released February 3, 2026)</h3>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the effect of defensive pressure on opponents’ halfpipe shots was smaller than intended.</li>
<li>Fixed various issues to create a smoother gaming experience.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This again follows two major updates. The previous one added Survival Tag across multiple modes and even released an update for the game's demo.</p>
<p>If you haven't already tried out this game on the Switch 2, check out our written review as well as our video review above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Drag x Drive may lack options with regards to online modes, and its controls take a bit of getting used to. However, if you can give up some time to engaging with this one, if you can get past the barriers in terms of controls and the early frustrations as you find your rhythm, you'll be rewarded with a unique and very well-made sports game that deserves to find an audience of dedicated fans. Add in some pals, and you've got a solid bit of fun for the price."</em></p>

<figure data-uuid="0f8fe0aa4ee94"><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0f8fe0aa4ee94/xenoblade-chronicles-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo, Monolith Soft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Rumours about a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> release have started to circulate online today after a possible leak on the casting platform Spotlight.</p>
<p>The page of voice actor Caitlin Thorburn (who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qvb7f9/caitlin_thorburn_just_updated_her_spotlight_page/">voiced multiple roles in the second game</a>) has reportedly been updated to reference a "Xenoblade Chronicles" project due out in 2026. She's apparently reprising her role as KOS-MOS, who previously appeared in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/xenosaga_i_and_ii">Xenosaga</a> series.</p>

<p>So that's what's supposedly been leaked. As for the legitimacy of this, it is just a rumour for now, but <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/monolith-soft-development-and-speculation-st.51/page-55#post-2165560">apparently the profile</a> can only be updated and edited by the person who is the subject of the page.</p>
<p>If this is a sign of a new Xenoblade game (or a returning one), this wouldn't actually be the first time something like this has happened. Xenoblade fans have been quick to point out how something similar happened ahead of the reveal of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>, when the Melia voice actor Jenna Coleman spoke about "another game" before the official announcement.</p>

<p>If we hear any updates, we'll let you know. Just be mindful Nintendo or Monolith Soft haven't announced any new or returning Xenoblade Chronicles projects at this stage.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finale-teases-new-location-and-something-big-liberty-prime-colorado-2000665525</link>
            <guid>1424887</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Fallout</em> season two’s finale might not have paid off all the various story threads this season set up, but it did tease a location rarely seen in the games and featured the reveal of something big returning from <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>Fallout 4</em>. Spoilers below for the season in general and the finale episode in particular. If you haven’t watched it yet and don’t want to be spoiled, don’t keep scrolling!</p>  <p>After two seasons of following the Ghoul as he searched for his family, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finale-margot-enclave-cooper-janey-2000665411"><em>Fallout</em> season two’s finale</a> finally brings him face to face with…their empty cryopods hidden deep in a secret Vault below Mr. House’s Lucky 38 Casino. Dang. But inside his wife’s tube is a postcard for Colorado, giving him hope that his family is still alive in the midwestern state.</p>

 <p>So off he goes on a new quest to hopefully find his wife and daughter after a heck of a 200 years. During the credits, a billboard reinforces the idea that next season will, at least partially, be set in Colorado. What do we know about Colorado in the <em>Fallout</em> universe, and what can we expect?</p> <h2>Colorado In The <em>Fallout</em> Universe</h2> <p>Colorado is a state that has been mentioned a few times in past games and <em>Fallout</em> media, but has rarely played a big role. It, like most of the rest of the United States in <em>Fallout</em>, was mostly wiped out by the nuclear bombs dropped during the Great War. Colorado’s biggest appearance in the games thus far happened in<em> Fallout Tactics</em>, a game that isn’t wholly canon, but parts of it might be (it’s weird). In that 2001 tactical turn-based RPG spin-off, we are introduced to Vault 0.</p>

 <p><a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_0">Vault 0</a> is set in an expanded version of the real-life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_Mountain_Complex#Video_games">Cheyenne Mountain Complex</a>, a large underground U.S. military bunker designed to survive nuclear war and other massive attacks. Exactly what happens in <em>Fallout Tactics</em> isn’t really important, but Vault 0 and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex could play a part in season three. We know the Enclave is still around, and it would make sense for them to hole up in something like that to hide away from the rest of the wasteland.</p>

 <p>Interestingly, as pointed out by <em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/fallout-season-3-location/">PC Gamer</a>,</em> in the lead-up to <em>Fallout</em> season one, Amazon posted an hour-long video about the opening of Vault 33. <a href="https://youtu.be/o1YhcviJ7IU?t=761">And during the stream, an announcer says this</a>: “Unless you’re the President of the United States or something like that, and you have a mountain in Colorado to go under and direct the events of the world.” And who did Cooper Howard run into in this season and hand off the Cold Fusion capsule to? The president. I suspect Vault 0 or a version of it will play a role in season three.</p> <p>One other interesting thing to note about Colorado is that the original version of <em>Fallout 3</em> that was being developed by Black Isle Studios before it was canceled was going to be partially set in Colorado. Fitting that Colorado will likely play a big role in season three of Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> show, given that it was previously featured in both the third <em>Fallout</em> game ever made (<em>Tactics</em>) and the original <em>Fallout 3</em> (Project Van Buren).</p>

 <h2>That Other Big (Wink) Tease</h2> <p>After all the credits, Amazon included a post-credits teaser scene featuring Elder Cleric Quintus and Dane back at the Brotherhood’s Area 51 base we saw earlier in the season. Chaos is continuing there after Maximus took off with the Cold Fusion capsule. Anyway, Dane brings Quintus a scroll. He tells the scribe that Quintus the Unifier is no more. Instead, he is now Quintus the Destroyer and unrolls the scroll to reveal a blueprint for Liberty Prime.</p> <p>We technically saw what <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1qcvxny/surprised_no_one_is_mentioning_this/">appears to be Liberty Prime earlier this season</a> in a photo featuring Mr. House’s body double. But this is the giant democracy-defending robot’s first real appearance in the show. Or, well, he appears as a blueprint schematic. Close enough.</p> <p>This seems to be a new version of the big robot, named Liberty Prime Alpha, and is different from the mech that first appeared in <em>Fallout 3</em> and later in <em>Fallout 4</em>. I’m not yet convinced this ragtag chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel is going to be able to create its own Liberty Prime. Perhaps it’s buried away in Area 51? We’ll have to wait until season three to find out.</p>

<p>Following a delay last September</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="56cfcaf6b549d"><a title="Borderlands 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56cfcaf6b549d/borderlands-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: 2K Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last September, 2K Games and Gearbox Software announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> had been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/borderlands-4-has-been-delayed-for-switch-2-digital-pre-orders-cancelled">delayed for Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>The plan was to spend a little extra time to deliver the "best possible experience" on Nintendo's new system, but it appears the plan has changed. In Take-Two's latest earnings results (the parent company of 2K Games), the Switch 2 version has been removed from the company's release schedule.</p>
<p>Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis told Variety, the "difficult decision" has been made to "pause development" on this particular version of the game. The team at Gearbox is instead focused on delivering "quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game".</p>
<p>This decision <em>won't</em> impact other Switch 2 projects, and 2K will continue to collaborate closely with Nintendo. Upcoming releases for Switch 2 include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pga-tour-2k25">PGA TOUR 2K25</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k26">WWE 2K26</a>.</p>
<p>Before the most recent delay and cancellation of pre-orders, Borderlands 4 was meant to arrive on the Switch 2 in October 2025. This title was originally released on other platforms last September and while the shift to open world was praised, there were also reports of the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/borderlands-4?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">console version's problematic performance</a> at the time.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/menace-early-access-review</link>
            <guid>1424842</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Within the first three missions of Menace, I am talking to my squads of snappy space marines as if they are action figures on my bedroom floor. "Fan out and move up. Good shooting! That was clean, girl." My roommates are probably used to me talking to myself when I'm playing video games at this point, but it speaks to how engrossed I got in this turn-based interplanetary war that I was already developing that kind of relationship with it. There's a lot still missing from the Early Access release. But the tactical, bug-blasting fun is already dialed in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Probably the biggest way in which it's obvious that this is an Early Access game is the overall lack of context. I know that I'm a Major on a military ship that suffered some kind of FTL drive accident that destroyed many systems and most of the crew, leaving me as the senior commanding officer. I know that we've wound up in an area of space called the Wayback that is home to a handful of interesting, competing human factions and also a species of giant alien bugs. It's not all that difficult to get a grasp of the basics.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Menace screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But I'm not actually sure why we're here, what the original mission was, what kind of faction we're representing, or what the Wayback even is. Why is it called that? How long have these other humans been here? There are references to some kind of in-game lore encyclopedia, but it doesn't seem to have been implemented yet. At the end of the day, none of this really gets in the way of my ability to shoot at things. But it does make the early game feel a bit aimless, and I find the setting interesting enough that I'd like to know more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not like Menace completely doesn't care about story, either. There is clearly something brewing here, as unfinished as it is, with tension between the Wayback factions and the marines playing out in voice-acted cutscenes every few operations. It's just unclear where it's going or what I'm ultimately building up to other than harder missions, better gear, and upgrading my ship. In about 35 hours, I didn't run into anything that seemed especially like the main plot. There is a steady escalation of stakes and difficulty, though, which at least does a good job of helping me feel like I'm not just spinning my wheels.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hit the Ground Running</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As a squad-based tactics game, man, I really like Menace. The pacing and action economy are so cleverly crafted to encourage you to play in more active and interesting ways. You can't just set everyone on ov erwatch and creep forward, for example, which is a rut I tend to fall into in similar games. There aren't a lot of passive or reactive abilities, so victory comes from making proactive choices. Moving up the field requires thinking about who still has turns left to spend, and how you can make sure your advance elements have adequate support if they run into trouble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Suppression is a huge deal, at least when fighting other humans, and this adds a feeling of authenticity to  every firefight. In actual warfare, they say hundreds of rounds get fired for every one that hits a target, and that's exactly how Menace works. It's often far more important to keep every enemy in line-of-sight pinned down than it is to inflict casualti es. That gives your second wave safety and freedom of movement to either charge in or flank and win the fight, and this creates a constantly engaging tactical loop. Your own squads who get suppressed will have their action points and accuracy penalized, but will also hunker down or hit the deck intelligently depending on the amount of heat they're under, further making them feel like real soldiers.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">This blends nicely with the fact that every squad is led by a named character you can recruit, level up, and customize. They all have distinct personalities and backstories along with a unique ability that defines them. There's sort of an over-the-top Jagged Alliance vibe, though a bit less goofy. Jacques, a private security contractor I hired from the Wayback, can regain action points when he's under heavy fire, so he thrives at the tip of the spear. Marta begins every mission with a major debuff that turns into a strong buff the more turns that pass, making her a clutch asset for closing out a long mission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And unlike in, say, XCOM, these flagship characters only die if their entire squad is wiped out and you can't get anyone over to them to render medical aid, so it doesn't feel like playing a little bit risky will rob you of your beloved blorbos. On the othe=r hand, accompanying each of them (excluding vehicle drivers, which are their own thing) are up to eight renameable squadmates with no dialogue or special abilities. And these guys are… kind of expendable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Manpower is a limited resource you have to manage on the strategic level, so you can't just go throwing background extras into the meat grinder all the time. But especially as you get more advanced medical facilities online that can rehabilitate casualties, the grunts kind of become a wager you can afford to risk by making aggressive plays. And this is such a clever way of getting me to command more actively and break out of my usual, turtle playstyle.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Alien Menace</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Encountering the alien bugs changes things up quite a bit. They're much harder to suppress, though heavy losses can force them to flee. And especially later on, some of them are so heavily-armored that your standard assault rifles are all but useless. They don't really take cover, and a lot of them only have melee attacks. But simply holding your ground and grinding them down at range isn't always an option. Having to switch up my gear and my thinking depending on what I was fighting, in addition to the wide variety of mission types, made me come up with new tactics constantly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Squad customization is also deep and satisfying. There is no standard currency in the Wayback, so all gear is either a mission reward or purchased using the barter system on the black market. But even once you do build up enough scrap bombs and alien guts to trade for the best stuff available, there's a supply budget on each mission that takes into account every piece of equipment and keeps you from simply buying your way to victory. I think this  could use some tuning, since it currently feels like the missions are getting harder a bit faster than my supply budget is increasing. It's almost there. Maybe just a nudge is all it needs.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Favorite Turn-Based Tactics Games</h3><p>Some of my favorite turn-based tactics games, in no particular order.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/LeanaVanadis/lists/lens-favorite-turn-based-tactics-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems like a lot of thought has gone into the various veterancy upgrades squads can earn from promotions, as well. They're pretty well-balanced, feeling powerful enough to be meaningful but not so game-changing as to trivialize combat on their own, like increasing evasion based on how many tiles you moved. Each has a clear role in mind, and almost none feel like they wouldn't be at least situationally useful. It's an area of progression where I can really tell developer Overhype Studios has a strong footing in what works and what doesn't about this genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The strategic layer is not quite as well-developed yet. There are a few different things you can buy with the components gained from completing each multi-mission operation. You have ship upgrades like the med bay and the recruiting office for managing manpower, along with armaments that can be deployed from orbit a limited number of times per mission. Then you have loyalty tracks with each of the three major Wayback factions that can unlock their unique buildings, which can do things like give you an extra chance at post-mission loot or allow you to call in supplies in the middle of a mission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They can be neat, but still feel a bit limited in both scope and depth. It's a good first iteration, but this is for sure somewhere I'd like to see more love  given to over the course of Early Access. There are also only three planets so far, which can start to feel a little samey after a while. More are in the works. Technical bugs have been relatively sparse, though my main file is afflicted by a fairly annoying one right now where my manpower counter seems to be permanently broken.</p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Menace is off to more than a running start already. The turn-based tactical action is some of the best I've played lately, and I love the distinct, voiced squad leaders, as well as both the variety of missions and enemy factions. The biggest missing piece is really story and context. It's hard to get too invested in what's going on in the Wayback when I'm not even really sure why we're here yet. But for Early Access, this is a truly impressive effort, and there's plenty of fun to be had already.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/menace-early-access-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>As we enter February, Nintendo has today announced two more title for the Switch Online's Game Boy library.</p>
<p>Today, it's the 1990/91 platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/balloon_kid">Balloon Kid</a> and along with this is the 1991/92 puzzle title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/yoshi">Yoshi</a>. Here's the official Nintendo description of both games and you can check out the trailer above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Yoshi™</strong></p>
<p>Yoshi is an action/puzzle game starring Mario's trusty buddy Yoshi, who has been imprisoned in an egg. Now it's raining Goombas, Bloopers, and Boo Buddies, and you have to help Mario stop the airborne invasion. As the critters fall, catch them on trays. Stack two of a kind and they both disappear, or capture the whole bunch in between eggshells. When the eggshells match, out hatches Yoshi and up goes your score! The action heats up as the characters fall faster and faster. To save the day, switch and shuffle, and don't let your piles get too high!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Balloon Kid™</strong></p>
<p>In the little town of Pencilvania, there lived a brother and sister who loved to play with balloons. Alice and her younger brother Jim would spend countless days filling the skies with their balloons. One day, Jim filled all of his balloons and tied them together to make a beautiful balloon rainbow across the sky. But suddenly, a strong wind came and carried Jim away.</p>
<p>As Alice, you must save your brother from peril. Float through eight different stages as you follow Jim's trail of balloons. Collect as many balloons as possible to earn bonuses. Test your piloting skills to avoid enemies, or let go of your balloons to face enemies on the ground. In BALLOON TRIP mode, compete for the highest score and move up the ranks. Take a big gulp of courage and give Alice a hand as she searches for her missing brother!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Japan is getting Yoshi and <strong>Balloon Fight GB</strong> this week. The second game is the Game Boy Color version. Here's a look:</p>

<p>The CEO of Take-Two Interactive has confirmed that no generative AI is used in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="114633">Grand Theft Auto 6.</a></p>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/strauss-zelnick-generative-ai-has-zero-part-in-what-rockstar-games-is-building-with-gta-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick discussed his take on generative AI, stating that while he is personally enthusiastic about the technology and its practical uses in terms of saving time and money, he does not believe these tools can create great entertainment on their own and affirms that there is no generative AI usage in the upcoming release in the Grand Theft Auto franchise. </p>



<p>He would go so far as to say that GenAI has no part in what Rockstar is building and that the worlds are handcrafted.</p>



<p>“Specifically with regards to GTA 6, Generative AI has zero part in what Rockstar Games is building. Their worlds are handcrafted. That’s what differentiates them,” he said.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-6-will-have-a-physical-release">GTA 6 Will Have a Physical Release</h2>



<p>In debunking a rumor, Take-Two confirmed in its quarterly earnings report that Grand Theft Auto 6 will have a physical release. Also, marketing is slated to begin this summer. The game remains on track for release on November 19, despite several delays.</p>







<p>Generative AI is on the rise in gaming. PlayStation recently announced plans to use the technology to create podcasts featuring video game characters. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-gen-ai-fake-podcast-playstation-characters/">here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/amds-semi-custom-soc-thatll-power-the-next-gen-xbox-is-progressing-well-to-support-a-launch-in-2027-says-amd-ceo/</link>
            <guid>1424773</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>next-gen Xbox console</strong> from <strong>Microsoft</strong>, which we know will <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-confirms-developing-custom-chips-microsoft-power-next-gen-xbox-consoles-pcs-handhelds/">be powered by a <strong>semi-custom SoC</strong> currently in development from <strong>AMD</strong></a>, is "<em>progressing well to <strong>support a launch in</strong> <strong>2027</strong></em>," said AMD's chief executive officer, <strong>Dr. Lisa Siu</strong>, during the <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1276/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-financial-results">company's 2025 fourth quarter earnings call</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>For 2026, we expect semi-custom SoC annual revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage as we enter the seventh year of what has been a very strong console cycle," </em>Dr. Siu said on the call<em>. "From a product standpoint, Valve is on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year. And <strong>development of Microsoft's next-gen Xbox featuring an AMD semi-custom SoC is progressing well to support a launch in 2027</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Dr. Siu's comment about the Steam Machine isn't anything new, as it only corroborates what <strong>Valve</strong> has said regarding the release of the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">which have always had an <strong>"<em>early 2026</em>"</strong> release window</a>. It's her comments on the next-gen Xbox that are worth noting, which give credence to rumours we heard last year that also identified a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">2027 release window</a></strong> for the next-generation device. </p>



<p>Of course, her comment doesn't mean you should write 'next-gen Xbox release' in your 2027 calendar, because it will ultimately be Microsoft's call as to when the device launches. What her comments do mean is that if Microsoft is in fact ready to launch this next-gen device in 2027, then AMD is currently on track to support that launch.</p>



<p>Officially, we don't know a lot about this next-generation device. Microsoft and Xbox have hinted at what it will be like, with Xbox president <strong>Sarah Bond</strong> hinting that the device will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">a "<em>very premium, very high-end, curated experience</em>,"</a> while also adding that we can look to <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-will-reportedly-be-best-of-both-worlds-between-pc-and-console/">how the <strong>ASUS ROG Xbox Ally</strong> operates in a space between console and PC</a> as to what Microsoft is trying to build with this new hardware.</p>



<p>Everything else we know about the device comes from reports and rumours, some of them supported by official comments, like how Bond calling it a "<em>very high-end</em>" device supports the rumour that <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/">it'll cost somewhere in the range of <strong>$1,000</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Or how allusions from Bond and Microsoft's head of gaming, <strong>Phil Spencer</strong>, about the device being a <strong>PC/console hybrid</strong> support rumours that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rumored-to-be-testing-steam-integration-within-microsoft-store-potentially-for-next-gen-xbox-too/">Microsoft is testing how it would put <strong>Steam</strong> on this new device</a>, which is further <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-features-xbox-game-dev-kit-point-next-gen-xbox-pc-console-hybrid/">supported by features added to software updates for Xbox development kits</a>.</p>



<p>Other questions about the console, like what <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-xbox-controller-with-dualsense-like-haptics-is-reportedly-still-on-the-way-for-next-gen/">features the controller will include</a>, whether it'll <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-digital-next-gen-sony-nintendo/">be a <strong>fully digital device</strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-rumored-to-support-backward-compatibility-at-hardware-level/">if it'll have <strong>backwards compatibility</strong></a><strong>, </strong>remain bigger questions for now. But at least we know that AMD is ready for it to arrive next year. Hopefully, Microsoft will be ready to launch next year, too, and we can learn more about what the company's plans are for its hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reports-a-9-overall-drop-in-xbox-revenue-for-q2-fy26-hardware-down-32/">as console sales continue to <strong>decline each quarter significantly</strong></a>. </p>

<p>An update on when the next Xbox console could come home to players.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_axi0nsx93A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">During AMD’s Q4 2025 earnings call</a>, CEO Dr. Lisa Su provided an update on the potential launch window for the next-generation Xbox. Su stated, “Development of Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox featuring an AMD semi-custom SoC [system-on-a-chip] is progressing well to support a launch in 2027.”</p>



<p>The potential launch timing was mentioned during a discussion of AMD’s semi-custom chip business, which includes video game consoles. She said annual revenue from that segment is expected to decline in 2026 by a “significant double-digit percentage.”</p>







<h2 id="h-the-relationship-between-amd-and-xbox-explained">The Relationship Between AMD and Xbox Explained</h2>



<p>In 2025, Microsoft announced that it was working with AMD on its next-generation console. This is all part of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-comments-partnership-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">multi-year partnership. </a></p>



<p>At that time, Su stated that AMD would go above and beyond by building custom chips for Xbox Hardware and planned to create a “full roadmap of gaming optimized chips, combining the power of Ryzen and Radeon for consoles, handhelds, PCs, and the cloud.”</p>







<p>In other AMD news, the company is raising the price of its graphics cards to offset rising memory costs. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-reportedly-raising-graphics-card-prices/">here</a>.</p>

              <p>On January 29, <em>Ashes of Creation</em> maker Intrepid Studios was promising big updates to the recently launched, long-awaited fantasy Steam MMO. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ashes-creation-refund-kickstarter-steam-mmo-layoffs-2000665006">Less than a week later</a>, the game has been review-bombed, removed from Valve’s storefront, and seen all of its developers suddenly fired, according to a new post from the studio’s communications director.</p> <p><span>“I waited until today to share this because I wanted to be sure I was communicating from a place of clarity,” Intrepid Studios head of marketing Margaret Krohn <a href="https://x.com/MargaretKrohn/status/2018794224276377819">wrote on X</a> on Tuesday. “Intrepid Studios has shut down in a way that I did not expect. What I can share is what I experienced. On January 28, toward the end of the workday, I was informed that we would be laying off 100 developers. I was devastated – these are hardworking people who were going to lose their jobs. Still, I believed it was something we could face together and find a path forward from.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I waited until today to share this because I wanted to be sure I was communicating from a place of clarity.</p> <p>Intrepid Studios has shut down in a way that I did not expect. What I can share is what I experienced.</p> <p>On January 28, toward the end of the workday, I was informed that…</p> <p>— 𝕸𝖆𝖗𝖌𝖆𝖗𝖊𝖙 𝕶𝖗𝖔𝖍𝖓 🌱💕 (@MargaretKrohn) <a href="https://twitter.com/MargaretKrohn/status/2018794224276377819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>That was the day before an unsigned “<a href="https://ashesofcreation.com/news/a-director-s-letter-to-the-citizens-of-verra-336">director’s letter</a>” was posted to<em> Ashes of Creation</em>‘s players promising a February 13 update on the game’s roadmap for the first few months of 2026. But according to Krohn, the mass firings at the studio were already moving forward. She said she received confirmation of which members of her team would be laid off by the end of day on January 29, and the remaining employees began working on “ways to move forward” the following day. But by January 31, it became clear that no one at the studio was safe.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“On January 31, we were all informed via a confusing email that we would be laid off, along with a WARN notice,” she wrote. “It is still shocking. The entire studio gathered to try to understand what had happened and what it meant for our future. In the end, none of us are receiving our final paychecks, the 60 days notice and pay outlined under the WARN Act, PTO payouts, or other compensation owed.”</span></p>

 <p>That’s the same day that <em>Ashes of Creation</em> director Steven Sharif announced on Discord he was no longer in control of the company and was resigning in protest.&nbsp;“I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation,” he wrote on January 31. “Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665514" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665514"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665514">Valve / Intrepid Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>That was the first public mention of the turmoil Intrepid was facing and it immediately ricocheted across Steam, where<em> Ashes of Creation</em> entered Early Access back in December, and Kickstarter, where backers raised $3.2 million to bring the MMORPG to market starting way back in 2017. The game was quickly review-bombed on Valve’s storefront with warnings to other players to stay away of what soon might become a dead game, while backers on Kickstarter demanded refunds over the game never hitting a proper 1.0 launch. It’s since been removed from sale completely on Steam.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“What matters most to me now are the people – both the players and developers,” Krohn wrote today. “To the players: the entire development team was working extremely hard, pulling long hours, and wishes with all our hearts that we could give you <em>Ashes of Creation</em>. There are no words that fully express how sorry we are that this journey ended this way. You should pursue a refund, you deserve it. To my colleagues: this team is truly a family. The culture we built together is something I have never experienced anywhere else. In the midst of heartbreak and uncertainty, we have come together to review resumes, help with portfolios, share job leads, and support one another emotionally.”</span></p>

 <p>As of now, it’s unclear who remains in control of Intrepid Studios as a company, which is based out of San Diego, or what will happen to <em>Ashes of Creation</em>, whose potential for a comeback seems increasingly unlikely. Who funded the game’s development? How did the studio’s finances suddenly get wiped out overnight? And what recourse do developers who worked on it have to be made whole? <em>Kotaku</em> tried reaching out to the studio’s email address but we haven’t heard back. Sharif declined to comment before clearing it with his legal counsel.</p> <p>When we reached out to <span> Krohn she responded with the following: “I made my statement. I can’t really talk more than that, I think I might have even said too much as is, but people need to know what happened.”<br> </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/next-gen-xbox-on-track-for-2027-launch-says-amd-ceo-2000665496</link>
            <guid>1424758</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su shared some interesting information about two upcoming video game devices, <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">Valve’s Steam Machine</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-xbox-microsoft-phil-spencer-new-console-1851700253">Xbox’s next-gen console</a>, both of which are powered by her company’s chips.</p> <p><a href="https://gamesbeat.com/amd-spills-the-beans-on-next-gen-xbox-launching-in-2027/">As reported by <em>Gamesbeat</em></a> on February 3, Su shared some new info about when to expect Valve’s upcoming console-like PC gaming box, the Steam Machine, and further teased a possible launch window for Microsoft’s previously confirmed-to-be-in-development next-generation Xbox.</p> <p>“From a product standpoint, Valve is on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year,” claimed Su in prepared remarks ahead of a financial call.&nbsp; “And development of Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox featuring an AMD semi-custom [System on Chip] is progressing well to support a launch in 2027.”</p>

 <p>This isn’t a confirmation that the next Xbox will launch in 2027, but Su did point out that both the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S will be entering their seventh year on the market at that point, and that’s a good time for a refresh.</p> <p>Valve’s Steam Machine has a confirmed release date of 2026, but nothing any more specific. Valve says the Steam hardware family will expand in early 2026, but didn’t specify if that was all three recently announced devices, just one, or some other combo like the VR headset and new controller. Su’s comments seem to indicate that Valve could start selling and shipping Steam Machines to customers within the next few months. Meanwhile, we’ve known for some time that Microsoft is trying to get the next Xbox out <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-next-gen-xbox-price-specs-leak-release-date-2000635303">around 2027</a> or <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-game-pass-gen-10-release-date-microsoft-1850849528">possibly 2028</a>. Microsoft execs have also teased that the next-gen Xbox will be <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-pc-windows-rog-ally-2000638181">a “very premium, very high-end” device</a>, so it doesn’t sound cheap.</p>

 <h2>The next generation of game consoles will be expensive</h2> <p>While Su didn’t talk about prices, it’s pretty clear to anyone paying attention that any video game consoles or console-like devices arriving in the near future are going to cost quite a bit. President Trump’s tariffs have led to increased prices on many goods made overseas. Meanwhile, AI hyperscalers and tech giants are <a href="https://kotaku.com/intel-cpu-production-pivot-ai-data-centers-shortages-increase-price-ram-memory-pc-2000663095">scooping up more and more PC parts, like RAM and GPUs</a>, to help build out massive AI data centers. <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">This has led to memory prices skyrocketing</a>, and Nvidia is even reportedly looking to start making old GPUs again as the parts needed to make newer cards are routed toward making high-end cards for data centers.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-nintendo-ram-shortage-2000658946">Existing consoles, like the Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">Xbox Series X/S,</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">could also see price increases</a> in the future due to memory shortages and the rising cost of PC parts. <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">Even AMD’s cheaper GPUs are reportedly going to see price increases</a>. Meanwhile, when we’ve seen new gaming-adjacent tech launch in the last 12 months, the prices have been high, as in the case of Xbox and ROG’s handheld PC which <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-handheld-rog-ally-x-price-preorder-2000629161">costs $1,000.</a> And it looks like the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">Steam Machine will possibly cost $800 to $1000</a> or more when it launches later this year.</p> <p>What does all of this mean for the PlayStation 6 and next Xbox? It means you probably need to start saving now if you want to afford one of these devices when they launch in the next 24 months or so. And maybe be prepared to go without one for a while, as it’s likely there will be shortages for a long time following either console’s future launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 players aren't happy after EA and Battlefield Studios' changes to two of its most controversial cosmetics failed to live up to expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-to-alter-2-controversial-cosmetics-after-fans-accuse-ea-of-ai-generated-content-and-call-of-duty-ghosts-inspiration"><u>promises to address fan feedback</u></a> last week, the Battlefield community was quick to see how update 1.1.3.6 adjusted the Objective Ace skin and Winter Warning sticker when the patch went live this morning. The problem is the changes are almost too small to notice.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— DETONATED (@DETONATEDcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/DETONATEDcom/status/2018712937670627367?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s first take a look at Objective Ace. The skin drew criticism through Season 1 when players noticed it bore a striking resemblance to the Call of Duty: Ghosts logo, with both sharing even a few finer details, such as cracks and paint streaks. The Assault skin also caught flak related to the large white armor piece located on its chest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The updated version of the cosmetic received the more noticeable facelift of the two impacted, with its updated look now featuring new details and a slimmer design overall. Still, it’s not enough for the players who were expecting more significant changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“[I] think the damage has already been done,” one <a href="https://x.com/BABYBLUBERRYZ/status/2018723941251256755?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>player commented</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Why did they copy COD in the first place?” <a href="https://x.com/Negan259/status/2018713351526748283?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another added</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">AI Sticker Before VS After Patch <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield6</a> <a href="https://t.co/Srfjhp7ZHj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Srfjhp7ZHj</a></p>— Battlefield Intel (@BattlefieldInte) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldInte/status/2018666389972902043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Winter Warning sticker, on the other hand, was the center of controversy when players noticed details that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-fans-accuse-ea-of-selling-ai-generated-image-after-spotting-what-looks-like-an-m4a1-with-two-barrels"><u>suggested it may have been created using generative AI</u></a>. Battlefield 6 update 1.1.3.6 seems to have brought no change to its design, with its soldier finger placement and double-barreled M4A1 still plainly in view despite being two of the bigger talking points amongst fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been cause for concern for those who feel EA and BF Studios may have misled fans. However, the developers have since <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2018746377569013844?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stepped in</a> to say the timing relayed in last week’s patch notes, which promised to adjust Winter Warning with the February 3 update, was “incorrect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The latest update notes communicated that a change would be made for the Winter Warning Player Card Sticker to bring it more in line with Battlefield’s visual identity,” a message shared today says. “This timing was incorrect. Winter Warning will be updated when Season 2 launches on February 17th.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear what the new version of the sticker will look like when it launches with Season 2 in about two weeks. For now, players have taken to social media to call attention to both the delay and the relatively small changes to the cosmetics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Show what ur doing with it," one <a href="https://x.com/DANNYonPC/status/2018746669802692706?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fan suggested</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Stop using AI generated Art and cosmetics and we will trust this statement and future ones," <a href="https://x.com/LordVonTiger/status/2018747014855430637?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another added</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-was-the-best-selling-console-of-2025-in-the-us-and-is-still-outpacing-the-nintendo-switch"><u>a strong start</u></a> when it released October 10, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S but has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/losing-steam-3-months-after-launch-its-time-for-a-check-in-with-battlefield-6-and-its-community"><u>faced backlash in recent weeks</u></a> as players hope for fundamental changes to how BF Studios is handling post-launch content. The fallout from a disappointing end to Season 1 reached a boiling point in early January, with the team eventually announcing that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-as-ea-tackles-community-feedback-with-an-extended-season-1"><u>Season 2 had been delayed</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following an extended Season 1, Season 2 will launch February 17.

      <p>Animation program Adobe Animate has been an industry mainstay for decades, having been used everywhere from TV to movies to games. So it's wild that this week, out of nowhere, Adobe announced that they're basically killing it off by ending support for the program.</p><p>On a page morbidly-titled "<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/animate/kb/end-of-life.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>End of Life FAQ</u></a>", the company writes:</p><blockquote>Adobe Animate will no longer be available to download for new customers, beginning&nbsp;<strong>March 1, 2026.&nbsp;</strong>Enterprise customers can access the application, download their content, and receive technical support until&nbsp;<strong>March 1</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>2029</strong>.&nbsp;For all other customers, technical support, application access, and the ability to download content will be available until&nbsp;<strong>March 1</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>2027</strong>.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>This is not normal! Companies usually make this move when a product has become obsolete, not when it's <a href="https://aftermath.site/windows-11-nope/"><u>still in use</u></a> by millions of people (and tons of popular shows) around the world. And even then, if there was any kind of recognition or awareness for the community/industry making use of something the company no longer wants to invest in, a reasonable expectation would be that Adobe would open source the code.</p><p>But of course these are not normal times we're living in; Adobe isn't interested in its traditional business model anymore, because like most tech companies, it's<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/adobe-animate-is-shutting-down-as-company-focuses-on-ai/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>more interested in cramming AI bullshit and subscription programs down our throats instead</u></a>.</p><p>Animation site Cartoon Brew<a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/tools/adobe-animate-software-sunset-258612.html?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>are able to put how disruptive this move is to studios and creators in context</u></a>, saying:</p><blockquote>Animate projects are not static assets. They are complex environments that integrate timelines, bespoke symbols, reusable libraries, scripts, export presets, and countless other factors, often built and refined over years or decades.

            <p>
I have a strange affinity for brutalism. It sucks you in, engulfs you in its stature, kills your spirit in such blunt, obvious ways, that I can't help but be wowed by in all its oppressiveness. As an architectural styling, it is also supremely opportune for sick parkour tricks, something Léonard Lemaitre (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babbdi">Babbdi</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a>), Nathan Grange and Niels Tiercelin all deeply understand with the volumetric VHOLUME, a "first-person parkour adventure set in a dystopian brutalist city where bureaucracy turns a simple task into an odyssey," which now has a demo.
</p>
<p>
The demo isn't a massive one, so there's not all that much I can say about its supposed story ("In the derelict capital of Afro-Eurasia, ruled by an all-controlling Ministry, Robert embarks on a bureaucratic quest to restore his family’s revoked ration tickets" sounds juicy and suitable for the setting), but what is there is more than enough to get a strong feel for its "movement-centric gameplay."
</p>
<p>
As previously noted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mirrors-edge-players-with-a-taste-for-brutalism-should-bookmark-vholume-the-new-parkour-game-from-a-babbdi-dev">news overlord Edwin</a>, there is an obvious Mirror's Edgeness to the game given that it is sort of the gold standard for parkour games. I would probably describe VHOLUME as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> Lite, not because it's watered down or worse, just simplified. All you can do is run, jump, and slide, all three of which can be mixed and matched into wall running, clamournig up walls, and gaining such a great whoosh of speed as to feel dizzy.
</p>
<p>
Simple the inputs may be, but the complexity is there. The brutalist setting works incredibly well for route devising, as every single wall surface you can see can be run across. There are obvious main paths to take in the pair of levels present in the demo, and there are a plethora of shortcuts for you to figure out for yourself (some of which I wouldn't advise as I did find a couple of sealings that I fell partially through).
</p><p>
It is a game very obviously prepped for speedrunning - you can race against the ghosts of others who have played the game, some of whom already seem too good for me to feel proud of my times. There is an oldschool quality to it in this sense, and it works wonders to push you to pull off risky maneuvers. Games like this live and die by their movement tech, and I think this one has the potential to live a thousand lives. I will gladly wait for its inevitable appearance at GDQ.
</p>
<p>
You can wishlist VHOLUME and try out the demo for yourself right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4131730/VHOLUME/">here</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[GTA 6 Doesn’t Mean The End Of GTA Online: ‘We’ll Continue To Support It’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-6-gta-online-support-2027-november-post-launch-take-two-ceo-strauss-2000665489</link>
            <guid>1424722</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>During today’s Take-Two Interactive quarterly financial call, the CEO of Rockstar’s parent company was asked about the future of <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em> after the release of <em>G<a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-still-confirmed-for-november-with-summer-marketing-blitz-planned-2000665452">rand Theft Auto 6</a> </em>in November. And he seemed pretty confident that the popular multiplayer game would keep receiving updates into 2027.</p> <p><em>GTA Online</em> first launched all the way back in October 2013 on Xbox 360 and PS3. It has since received hundreds of updates and expansions and been ported to many other consoles, where it continues to be incredibly popular and makes Take-Two a lot of money. So it’s not surprising that Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick confirmed the gravy train isn’t likely to shut down after <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-multiplayer-one-detail-leak-court-docs-player-count-32-rockstar-2000659780"><em>GTA 6</em>‘s multiplayer mode arrives,</a> presumably, later this year.</p>

 <p><span>“Look, Rockstar Games is the locus of information about, you know, where the titles go content and marketing, and generally, we have a pretty light touch when we talk about the label’s creative activities,” said Zelnick during Tuesday’s earnings call. </span><span>“At the same time, I have every reason to believe we’ll continue to support </span><i><span>GTA Online. </span></i><span>There’s a great community that loves it, that stays engaged. And again in this quarter, Rockstar has shown that when you deliver great additional content, despite how long [</span><i><span>GTA Online</span></i><span>] has been at market, people show up.”</span></p> <p>Back in 2025, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6">Zelnick told <em>IGN</em></a> that Take-Two supports games as long as people are still playing them.</p>

 <p>“As an example, we launched <em>NBA 2K Online</em> in China, I think originally in 2012, if I’m not mistaken,” Zelnick told the outlet last year. “And then we launched <em>NBA 2K Online 2</em> in China in 2017. If I’m not mistaken. We did not sunset <em>Online 1</em>. They both are still in the market, and they serve consumers, and they’re alive, and we have this massive audience. So we’ve shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”</p>

 <p>That last part is key. Take-Two and Rockstar Games are more than happy to keep making content and updating old games, as long as there are enough people playing those games and spending money in them to financially justify it. And, at least for now, <em>GTA Online</em> definitely seems to qualify; <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/032e3067-32cd-4c82-b4dd-2bd20a153a6a">it saw a 27-percent increase in consumer spending last quarter</a>, according to Take-Two. When you have a money-printing machine, well, it’s hard to convince anybody to turn it off.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-first-person-geralt-witcher-2000665486</link>
            <guid>1424719</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>When </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>’s first-person perspective was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-a-first-person-rpg-1826775323"><span>revealed</span></a><span> back in 2018, quite a few fans were worried. For CD Projekt Red enthusiasts who were used to staring at the back of Geralt’s gorgeous little ponytail all day in </span><i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i><span> and for others who just wanted to be able to see their painstaking customizations of protagonist V, the decision sparked its fair share of skepticism. However, it ended up working out pretty well, and now one of the game’s leads has taken to social media to explain why.</span></p> <p><span>On Sunday, Igor Sarzyński, who worked as </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077’s</span></i><span> Cinematic Director before being bumped up to Creative Director for </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2</span></i><span>, elaborated on the team’s decision to use a first-person perspective in </span><i><span>2077 </span></i><span>via </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mdsstc5lpk22"><span>a thread on Bluesky</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Purely from narrative design pov I think subjective FPP [first-person perspective] works well with ‘</span><i><span>77</span></i><span> story, genre and world. You’re a mind trapped in a decaying body with only means of leaving it being through technological consciousness processing,” he wrote (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/cyberpunk/cyberpunk-2-lead-says-first-person-pov-was-better-for-cyberpunk-2077-as-third-person-is-for-more-defined-characters-like-the-witcher-3s-geralt-and-god-of-wars-kratos/"><i><span>Games Radar</span></i></a><span>).</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:nkkdls4c67lfagg735y7ywpq/app.bsky.feed.post/3mdsstc5lpk22" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidsrjfslaek5rghf5w24nehi35lxqnu22rim5xbxljyb7blmba3na"> <p lang="en">Purely from narrative design pov I think subjective FPP works well with '77 story, genre and world.

Third-person perspective, he feels, “is better for more defined characters – Geralt, Kratos, Ellie – where you play-replay someone else’s story. FPP lends itself to more avatar-like player characters. V exists somewhere in the middle of this spectrum but for reasons stated above ^ i feel FPP was better for </span><i><span>‘77</span></i><span>.”</span></p>

 <p><span>He also added that the camera lets the game’s visions of “digital ghost” Johnny Silverhand, which he described as a “thing existing only in your subjective perception – rather than both of you being seen equally by an external, objective TPP cam,” feel more immersive.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sarzyński clarified that his comments aren’t meant as a hint at the perspective that will be used in </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2</span></i><span>, or anything else about the game for that matter. “It might be a play-doh stop-motion RTS for all we know,” he joked. It’ll likely be a long time until we hear more news about </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2</span></i><span>, but I’m just happy to hear from one of its leads. It’s always neat to hear about the thinking behind a design decision, especially at a massive studio that could, if it wanted to, be a lot more cagey about its development process.</span></p> <p><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077’s</span></i><span> sequel is still a ways away, but we do know that it’ll be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-orion-night-new-city-chicago-cdpr-1851781566"><span>set in Night City once again</span></a><span>, alongside a second city that’s “like Chicago gone wrong.” CD Projekt Red also apparently began </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-online-multiplayer-witcher-4-sequel-cdpr-2000627198"><span>toying</span></a><span> with some form of online multiplayer for the game shortly after it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-release-date-witcher-4-rpg-cdpr-1851782750"><span>moved into pre-production</span></a><span> last year, but it’s unclear if that’ll even be implemented.</span></p>

            <guid>1424707</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto VI's November 19, 2026 release date is drawing nearer. And while the game has now suffered multiple delays, Take-Two Interactive is starting to sound more confident than we've ever heard them that this time, it's really happening. So confident, in fact, it's announced that Rockstar will be spinning up its marketing beats this summer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Take-Two's Q3 2026 earnings results, which were just released. In those earnings, Take-Two reaffirms that GTA 6 is indeed still planned for November 19, 2026. That on its own would be exciting news after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">two</a> separate <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">delays</a>, but even better is a sentence at the bottom of the release sent to IGN. "Our execution throughout Fiscal 2026 has been extraordinary and we are highly confident as we approach Fiscal 2027 – which promises to be groundbreaking for Take-Two and the entire entertainment industry – led by the November 19th release of Grand Theft Auto VI with Rockstar’s launch marketing set to begin this Summer. "</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's sounding pretty confident, to me! Speaking to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick earlier today, I asked him how he felt about the release date at this time, to which he replied, "I feel good about it. Very good about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, we've asked Zelnick this before, and he said he felt "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">really good</a>" about the fall 2025 release date that was originally announced, ahead of two delays. So I asked him if this time was different in some way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course," he said. "Because any time you're getting closer to marketing beats, you're obviously in a place where your confidence level is as high as it can be."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 is one of the most anticipated games of all time, with many already suggesting it as a potential Game of the Year contender despite us not having seen any gameplay footage of it yet, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/increasingly-convincing-ai-generated-gta-6-gameplay-leaks-are-getting-millions-of-views-on-social-media">leaks and AI fakes</a> going viral all over social media late last year, and its delays having <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-the-gta-6-delay-also-delay-next-gen-consoles">potential industry-shaking impacts</a>. So far, we've seen two cinematic trailers for the game, which have shown the dual protagonists Duval and Lucia Caminos, and the setting of Leonida, Florida, including the infamous Vice City.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even without GTA 6, GTA as a franchise had a great quarter. It "vastly outpaced" Take-Two's forecasts, with GTA+ membership levels nearly doubling year-over-year. We asked Zelnick for insight as to the cause of GTA 5's excellent quarter, and he pointed to the Safehouse in the Hills update for GTA Online doing especially well. GTA 5 has now sold over 225 million units.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, Take-Two brought in net bookings of $1.76 billion for the quarter. The company is raising its expectations in light of a better-than-expected quarter on multiple fronts, with total annual net bookings expected to range between $6.65 billion to $6.7 billion, representing around 18% growth year over year. Take-Two expects that nearly half of its full-year earnings, which it will report next quarter, will come from its mobile business, Zynga.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

              <p>A strange rumor that popped up online last month claimed that, to avoid early leaks, Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive were going to delay the physical release of <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>and the game would only launch digitally. That’s not the case.</p> <p>On February 3, as part of Take-Two’s Q3 fiscal results, the company’s longtime CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">told <em>Variety</em></a> bluntly that the online rumors swirling around <em>GTA 6</em>‘s physical launch were nothing to worry about.</p> <p>“That’s not the plan,” Zelnick told the outlet.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/397290/gta-6-a-wersja-pudelkowa-sprzedawcy-zwiastuja-smutna-wiadomosc-dla-fanow-fizycznych-wydan.html">This odd rumor popped up in January</a> after a Polish site reported that a Rockstar insider had heard that <em>GTA 6′</em>s physical and digital releases could be split up. Once the rumor popped up in January, it quickly spread and was reported by sites like <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6s-physical-release-could-be-delayed-to-2027-because-of-leaks-3309757/"><em>Dexerto</em></a> and was posted across places like Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook. Here is the original, now debunked, claim:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“We are getting more and more information that the box version will not be released simultaneously with the digital version to prevent leaks.”</p></blockquote> <p>However, <em>Kotaku</em> was unable to verify the rumor with any of its sources. And to be honest, it always seemed odd, especially when you consider digital games have leaked via pre-loads. In fact, that happened with <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/634490-grand-theft-auto-v/67072105"><em>GTA V</em> over a decade ago</a>. And now that Zelnick has weighed in officially to call the rumor false, hopefully that’s the end of it. Now, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-breakdown-secrets-spf-sunscreen-reddit-1851144759">GTA</a></em> fans can go back to figuring out the SPF rating of an NPC’s sunscreen via wild math and trailer screenshots.</p> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> launches November 19 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-still-confirmed-for-november-with-summer-marketing-blitz-planned-2000665452">Take-Two has confirmed that marketing for the game will begin sometime in the summer</a>.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> was supposed to be one of the Nintendo Switch 2’s big fall 2025 releases but was indefinitely delayed amid a race to address performance issues for the PC version. Many fans hoped it might end up launching in early 2026 instead, but the Switch 2 port of <em>Borderlands 4</em> is now officially being paused.</p> <p>“We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU,” Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">told&nbsp;<em>Variety </em></a>on Thursday. “Our focus continues to be delivering quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game. We’re continuing to collaborate closely with our friends at Nintendo. We have <em>PGA Tour 2K25</em> coming out and <em>WWE 2K26</em> [for Switch 2], and we’re incredibly excited about bringing more of our titles to that platform in the future.”</p>

 <p>What’s especially odd about the last-minute reversal is that<em> Borderlands 4</em> was already publicly demoed running on Switch 2 last summer at shows like PAX West. Assessments varied, with some players saying it looked surprisingly good while <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1958920625600569844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1958920625600569844%7Ctwgr%5Ef902f1abb49199769f6600e5bad50cb760a1d61f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fborderlands-4-performance-issues-nintendo-switch-2%2F">others said</a> it suffered from surprising performance hang-ups, even when docked.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Okay I’ll just put it bluntly:</p> <p>Borderlands 4 on the Switch 2 could barely run at 30fps with 4 enemies on screen in docked mode. It had horrendous input delay, and the render resolution was seemingly turned all the way down.</p> <p>I’ll talk more about it in a video maybe tomorrow 😬</p> <p>— EpicNNG (@EpicNNG) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1958920625600569844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“We need to share that the release of<em>&nbsp;Borderlands 4</em> on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed,” the studio wrote <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">in a surprise announcement</a> last September less than two weeks before it was set to launch. “We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that.”</p>

 <p>Gearbox Entertainment recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-2026-road-map-updates-cross-save-new-loot-dlc-level-cap-increase-2000664254">doubled down on big plans for the looter shooter’s 2026 content roadmap</a>. That includes a new rarity of gear, raising the level cap, and fresh story content in paid DLC packs. The roadmap even called out the addition of a new photo mode. The Switch 2 port, on the other hand, was conspicuously absent. Publisher 2K Games has yet to reveal how many copies the latest sequel has sold.</p>

 <p><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s absence from the Switch 2 will be a bummer for fans hoping they’d eventually be able to jump in, but it’s not the only port that players have been patiently waiting on. <em>Elden Ring</em> was also announced for Nintendo’s new console last year and also remains MIA. Demos last summer suggested it was having framerate issues as well. Other heavy hitters like <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> have performed well enough though.</p>
