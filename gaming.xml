		<p>Kaznori Yamauchi made a brief appearance during the State of Play Japan stream with a key announcement for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>. With the GT7 Spec III coming out on 4th December, Polyphony Digital has also prepared a new Power Pack DLC to go alongside.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gran Turismo 7 - Power Pack Add-On Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkAuyjsfmuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Gran Turismo 7 Power Pack is a premium DLC that’s all about bringing fully fledged endurance racing to the popular sim racer for the first time.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not the first time that full-on 24 hour races have featured as part of a Gran Turismo game. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/11/24/review-gran-turismo-5/">GT5</a> you could race a full 24 hour race yourself, and put your B-Spec AI drivers into the mixer for some progression while you’re not actively playing the game, but endurance racing provides different challenges for the racing AI, pit stop strategies and more.</p>
<p>Of course, we’d have loved to have seen longer form racing included in GT7 from the off – it’s often a bit of an afterthought, given the demands i puts on both players, game designers, and testers – but Polyphony should be credited with consistently updating and expanding their games with free content, new tracks and more.</p>

<p>Spec 3 will be a big update for the 2022 racer, with the following new and improved features:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 new tracks (Yas Marina Circuit, Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve)</li>
<li>8 new cars</li>
<li>‘Dunlop’ tyres</li>
<li>Data Logger</li>
<li>Collector Level cap increased</li>
<li>Unlimited car invitations in Brand Central</li>
<li>Enhanced Weekly Challenges</li>
<li>New opening movie</li>
<li>New Menu Book ‘Seasonal Menu’</li>
<li>New events in ‘Circuit Experience’</li>
<li>New Curations in ‘Scapes’</li>
<li>Improvements to online races</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As one of the big announcements to kick off the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">State of Play Japan event,</a> Koei Tecmo announced that Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake, a remake of the classic entry into the Fatal Frame franchise, will arrive on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 this coming March 12, 2026.</p>



<p>A new trailer for the remake was showcased during the live stream event, which concluded with a reveal of the game's release date. It's the latest re-release in the Fatal Frame series after the<a href="https://wccftech.com/fatal-frame-mask-of-the-lunar-eclipse-release-date/"> remaster for Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse</a>.</p>



<p>A post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly-remake-launches-march-12/">PlayStation Blog</a> that went live shortly after the trailer premiered delved into the main characters in the game and an overview of the game's story, but unfortunately did not go into too much detail about what is being upgraded in this remake. </p>



<p>"<em>Every element has been enhanced — from graphics and sound to controls. The texture of each character’s skin and clothing has been meticulously refined, while the setting of Minakami Village has been beautifully reimagined with striking contrasts of light and shadow to create an atmosphere that is both haunting and lifelike</em>," writes Makoto Shibata, director of the Fatal Frame series at Koei Tecmo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in late October</a>, Bethesda released Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition yesterday for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X, as a way to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the original launch. </p>



<p>This new version of the critically acclaimed post-apocalyptic open world roleplaying game includes all the six official DLCs released by Bethesda Game Studios (Far Harbor, Automatron, Nuka-World, Contraptions Workshop, Vault-Tec Workshop and Wasteland Workshop), as well as over 150 Creation Club items, including new quests, companions, armors, weapons, skins, player homes, and objects to add to the Settlements system. Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, which will launch next year for Nintendo Switch 2, is priced at $59.99 for new users, $39.99 for those upgrading from the original game, and $19.99 for those upgrading from the Game of the Year edition.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>However, just like with <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-anniversary-edition-out-now-free-update-weighs-5-3gb-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> four years ago, this new edition breaks many essential mods that users had based their modlists around. The main reason is that F4SE, the equivalent of SKSE, an extender upon which many mods are based, no longer works (until its creators update it).</p>



<p>And just like with Skyrim Anniversary Edition, modders have quickly come up with a method to revert Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition to the previous version of the game (v1.10.984), thus preventing the breaking of your precious mods.</p>



<p>The first to post a guide on how to do that was Nexus Mods user ocramuias (in the comments section of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this page</a>). Here's an abridged version of that guide:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open the Steam console by pressing Win + R and pasting <strong>steam://open/console</strong></li>



<li>Run the following command inside the Steam console: <strong>download_depot 377160 377162 5698952341602575696</strong></li>



<li>This forces Steam to download the Fallout4.exe file (38 MB in size) from the previous build, version 1.10.984, which was originally released on May 13, 2024. When the download is complete, open the folder shown in the console log. This can usually be found in <strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\content\app_377160\depot_377162</strong></li>



<li>Once there, you must back up your current executable. Navigate to your game's installation directory (for example, <strong>C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Fallout 4</strong>), and rename the existing Fallout4.exe to Fallout4_111137.exe. Now, copy the previously downloaded file into that folder and replace the existing .exe file.</li>



<li>At this point, it's time to disable automatic updates for Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition. You can do that in Steam &gt; Library &gt; Fallout 4 &gt; Properties &gt; Updates &gt; set "Only update this game when I launch it". From now on, you'll always have to launch the game through <strong>f4se_loader.exe</strong> rather than Steam.</li>



<li>Also, set Fallout4.exe to Read-only by right-clicking with the mouse and going to Properties. This will prevent Steam from overwriting it.</li>
</ol>



<p>Enjoy!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A highly advanced AI-powered robot took a tumble in Russia during a technology presentation. Unfortunately for the robot and its creators, the fall happened while the <em>Rocky</em> theme song played, and it was all recorded and shared online.</p> <p>On November 11, <a href="https://unn.ua/en/news/in-russia-the-first-humanoid-robot-fell-at-a-presentation-it-was-covered-from-the-audience">AIdol showcased some AI-powered autonomous robots</a> at the Yarovit Hall Congress Center in Moscow. <a href="https://www.mskagency.ru/photobank/1063641">Photos from the event</a> posted by the <em>Moscow City News Agency</em> show that the company had a few different robots on hand for the event, letting people get up close to them, take selfies, and <a href="https://www.mskagency.ru/photobank/1063641">even kiss the creepy-looking bots</a>.</p>

 <p>However, at some point during the event, one of the robots was presented on stage and began to walk like someone who had had one too many drinks. Just a few moments later, <a href="https://www.mskagency.ru/photobank/1063636">the bot crashed forward</a> onto the floor, leaving broken bits of plastic and metal on the ground. After the fall, someone tried to use a black curtain to cover up what had happened, but the curtain was twisted up, and it took far too long to hide the situation. While all of this happened, inexplicably, it sounds like the <em>Rocky</em> theme song was playing in the background. Let’s watch:</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:4aqzua5vsewimmusg66fyajl/app.bsky.feed.post/3m5eso76zcs2a" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigiz35sfxgm3s6kshx57kkxjdzsxt26i7zvwddao2cgjnallgr3zm"> <p lang="en">Joke of the day from Moscow: Russia tried to unveil its first humanoid AI robot, Aidol. Key word: tried. The robot collapsed during its debut, forcing organizers to cut the presentation short. Their rushed attempt to lift the prop only made things worse.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4aqzua5vsewimmusg66fyajl?ref_src=embed">NOELREPORTS (@noelreports.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4aqzua5vsewimmusg66fyajl/post/3m5eso76zcs2a?ref_src=embed">2025-11-11T18:53:03.008Z</a></p></blockquote></div>   <p>Folks, I couldn’t write a comedic skit that funny if you sat me in a room and pointed a gun at me. This is top-tier comedy. In fact, it was so funny that I wasn’t sure it was real. I mean, there was that <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/12/13/hi-tech-robot-on-russian-state-tv-turns-out-to-be-a-fraud/">fake robot back in 2018</a> in Russia that turned out to be a man in a suit. Perhaps this was fake, too? But looking around, it does seem like this event happened and was covered by a news agency in Moscow.&nbsp; This is all a bit embarrassing for the folks involved, but at least the robot never stepped on a Lego and <a href="https://b1.mskagency.ru/c/1119897.jpg">screamed in pain…oh no!</a></p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/goodnight-universe</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-goodnight-universe-switch-2-a-supernatural-adventure-quirky-heartwarming.1350388/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160474/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>In 2021, publisher Skybound Games put out <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/before_your_eyes">Before Your Eyes</a> on PC and Mac (later on mobile and PSVR2), which offered an innovative control mechanic in which you primarily interacted with the game through eye movement and blinks. Alongside this cool gimmick, Before Your Eyes was lauded for its gripping emotional story, quickly turning it into an indie favourite that garnered a passionate following.</p>
<p>Now, the developers at GoodbyeWorld Games have created a spiritual sequel called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/goodnight-universe">Goodnight Universe</a>, which both builds on some of the themes of its predecessor and introduces some cool ideas of its own. Though it currently lacks the eye control feature on Switch 2 (a Camera update is planned "sometime after launch"), it still proves a worthwhile narrative experience.</p>
<p>Goodnight Universe places you in the role of Isaac, an infant with the mind of a grown man and psychic powers, born to an unremarkable and ordinary nuclear family. Isaac can babble and cry and do all the things that a normal baby can do, but every now and then he causes a little chaos by flexing his psionic abilities in ways that confuse, frighten, and delight those around him who haven’t caught on and believe that Isaac is simply just a ‘normal’ baby.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160473/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet there’s, of course, the lingering mystery of <em>why</em> Isaac can do these things, and the plot naturally thickens once he catches the attention of the Aio Corporation, a tech company which seems to have some understanding of Isaac’s powers and has its own agenda for how to utilise them.</p>
<p>While the twists throughout the relatively brief (~four-hour) narrative are certainly intriguing, this is ultimately a soulful and heartwarming tale about the importance of family and the finite nature of time. As Isaac narrates his experience, you’re getting a first-row seat to all the ups and downs of ordinary family life, and not all of it is pretty.</p>
<p>In one instance, you’re witnessing a wholesome interaction between Isaac’s sister, Cleo, and his dad, while in another you’re tuning in to his dad’s private thoughts while he reads a bedtime story and learning of various insecurities and concerns he struggles with as the family's main provider. Domestic life can be messy in so many beautiful ways, and Goodnight Universe does a great job of showcasing this while keeping things interesting with the goofy antics of its primary protagonist.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160472/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While there are some key moments in which you can express yourself and choose <em>slightly</em> diverging routes for a given scene, this is a largely linear tale that plays out somewhat like an interactive Pixar movie. Every now and then, you’ll get to choose something — such as whether Isaac responds with happiness or sadness to what another character said or did — and this leads to a few unique lines of dialogue, but there aren’t any bigger moments that lead to completely separate paths and different routes.</p>
<p>Some may be disappointed by this, but I appreciated the single-minded nature of the narrative, as it allows you to more easily immerse yourself, rather than keep stepping out to determine which route might be more interesting.</p>
<p>Gameplay follows the structure of a simple point-and-click adventure game in which you primarily scan the environment for the next interactable object or person needed to move the scene forward. Sometimes you’re given a neat checklist to follow with multiple objectives, while others you must intuit what’s next based on what the characters are doing.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160469/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Isaac can read minds and manipulate objects from afar, leading to all sorts of mischief as you innocently poke and prod at the world, leaving those around you bewildered as dishes seemingly wash themselves and toys aren’t found in the same places they were left.</p>
<p>There are some light puzzles to solve every now and then, but progression is basically a matter of identifying the correct object you need to manipulate in the environment and then doing the action needed to make it move or dance or fly across the room.</p>
<p>You do gain a few new abilities as the narrative progresses and Isaac gets more of a handle on his powers, but it’s very rare that the path forward isn’t made obvious either by the game literally telling you what to do next or very strongly hinting at it. Those of you who are looking for challenge won’t find it here, then, but the gameplay isn’t so braindead that you disengage.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160471/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Just like Before Your Eyes, the controls for Goodnight Universe feel designed around eye-tracking software for video cameras, but... well, the Switch 2 version doesn’t support this at launch. As a result, you’re left to navigate the interface using the right stick to move the cursor and camera, which often feels more tedious than I’d like. It’s the sort of control scheme that’s <em>fine,</em> but it feels clunky and unintuitive, which tends to take you out of the narrative that’s clearly trying to place you in Isaac’s shoes.</p>
<p>While I wouldn’t say that stick controls are a dealbreaker, it’s nonetheless worth keeping in mind that you’re missing out on a key component of the intended game experience when playing it on console before the planned update arrives.</p>
<p>Visually, Goodnight Universe employs a simplistic but charming art style that leans well into the cartoonish absurdity of its protagonist’s abilities. The exaggerated proportions and environments vaguely call to mind the art style of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari</a> series, but there’s plenty of room for detailed character expression and smooth animation as scenes play out. Naturally, all this unfolds without any frame hitches or skips, highlighting the much-welcomed power boost that the Switch 2 hardware brings over its predecessor.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160477/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As far as the audio is concerned, music is sparsely utilized to punctuate scenes and elevate the atmosphere, often adhering to tracks that lean into the whimsy and sci-fi elements of the story. The music takes the backseat, however, to make room for the excellent voice acting, which significantly adds to the overall experience.</p>
<p>Not only are all the performances passionate and nuanced, but little details in the sound mixing contribute lots to the immersion, such as when listening to a character’s thoughts and hearing their internal monologue come at you from different ‘directions’. At boot up, you’re encouraged to play this game with headphones and I couldn’t agree more; the soundscape here is something you’ll want to pay lots of attention to.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Goodnight Universe is an enjoyable and quirky narrative adventure game that feels like a satisfying follow-up to the deeply emotional experience of Before Your Eyes. Isaac’s supernatural adventures are as entertaining as they are heartwarming, and though it isn't terribly long, it makes full use of every moment.</p>
<p>The only major drawback here is that the Switch 2 doesn’t support the eye and face tracking control style of the PC version at launch, which notably does take away somewhat from the core experience. All the same, I’d suggest you pick up Goodnight Universe if this one has already caught your eye. It provides a memorable narrative journey and is the sort of game that you’ll still be thinking about long after putting it down.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>NetEase is set to debut the fifth season of Marvel Rivals this coming Friday, November 14, 2025, and ahead of that launch, it released a new cinematic trailer showcasing the two new roster additions for Season 5, Gambit and Rogue. Also, as usual, NetEase released a Dev Vision video, which delved deeper into the changes coming in Season 5, including the introduction of a new Conquest mode.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Love is a Battlefield | Marvel Rivals Season 5 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXOUHb64164?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Gambit will be the first new hero added to the roster starting on Friday, and he joins the roster as a Strategist, who can use his powers to heal allies, get rid of negative effects on allies, and also do damage against enemies while applying an anti-heal effect.</p>



<p>Season 5 also adds a new map set in New York's Times Square, but unlike other maps in Marvel Rivals, it is a non-combat map dedicated to letting players socialize and do whatever they like instead of always jumping into competitive modes.</p>



<p>Speaking of those competitive modes, the other introduction in this season is the new Conquest (Annihilation) mode. An 18v18 mode that unfortunately does not go live this Friday, but will be live during Season 5 on November 27, 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This is all just what NetEase has to show off for Season 5 so far, since under the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-reveals-new-details-for-season-2-hellfire-gala-introduces-emma-frost/">new seasonal structure it instituted starting with Season 3</a>, each season is broken up into two halves, with one hero added to the roster in each half. So if you're looking for more from NetEase, there is more to come, you just have to wait a little longer.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-ii-isn%E2%80%99t-a-story%E2%80%94it%E2%80%99s-maintenance.1350346/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I lose again in </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Damn.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I wake up in the same dim corner of the Crossroads, staring at the same painting. Melinoë as a baby, held by her mother Persephone. Her brother Zagreus beside them. Hades smiling down, the whole family together with the serenity of a dream you wake up forgetting.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The game gives me one prompt: “Brood.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>When I press it, Melinoë scoffs, </span><i><span>“You don’t remember them, besides this painting and your dreams. But still you fight for them…”&nbsp;</span></i></p>

 <p><span>Another scripted moment no one will remember, lost to the churn of repetition. Brood, indeed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That’s pretty much all of </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>: a game that repeats forever without ever meaning something more than what’s said the first time.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Death to Chronos,” Melinoë says.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Death to Chronos,” Hecate says.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Death to Chronos,” I say.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Chronos is the enemy. Chronos must die. It’s a setup that sounds rich with mythic potential—time itself is the tyrant that must be slain—but </span><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>never seems interested in asking what this devotion might cost its protagonist. Melinoë isn’t a character enduring a story; she’s a weapon driving it forward until the moment when the story finally surrenders.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><em><strong>This piece contains major spoilers for the story of&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>Hades II.</strong></p> <figure id="attachment_2000614569" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614569"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614569"><br><!--EndFragment --></figcaption></figure> <p><span>And yet, the structure of <em>Hades II</em> seems built for that interrogation. Like its predecessor, it’s a roguelike: death, rebirth, progress through repetition. A form that practically begs for introspection. Each failure could have been an opportunity to reveal more of Melinoë’s interior life. We could question what “Death to Chronos” even means to her. And yet the game never bothers, never earns her conviction. It takes her belief as a given and never really interrogates the ache that made her say it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This is what writers call a failure of scaffolding.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Zagreus was a protagonist positioned perfectly within the roguelike form. Every run was a teenager sneaking out of the house against his father’s wishes, even though they both knew he would have to come back eventually. Zagreus, like so many teenagers, wanted more, wanted to push up against the limits of possibility, maybe push beyond them, to make things different than they are. And so often he has his hopes dashed, his yearning unfulfilled.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>, by contrast, trades that ache for a slogan. Death to Chronos, Death to Chronos, Death to Chronos. The game is full of endless divine chatter that fills the stretches of silence between combat runs, but the world never gets any deeper. Hours of dialogue evaporate as soon as they’re read; nothing sticks. Worse, nothing scars.</span></p>

  <p><span>By the end, the plot resolves neatly enough. Melinoë finally defeats Chronos, but instead of killing him, she sends a message to Zagreus in the past: reach out to him, forgive him, bring him back into the family. Zagreus does. History rewrites itself. Everyone remembers two timelines—one where Chronos was cruel and one where he was kind—and they choose to believe the gentler one. Melinoë gains not only the family in the painting but also the grandfather she was trained to destroy. Then, without fanfare, she sets off to repeat the cycle in “other timelines.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s clean. Complete. A conclusion stated instead of learned.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Because </span><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>is a Rites of Passage story that forgets to include the passage.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A Rites of Passage story</span><i><span>, </span></i><span>for the uninitiated, always begins with a life problem—something unavoidable and existential. Growing up, forgiving, grieving, learning how to stay. The wrong way to face it is denial; the right way is acceptance. The beauty of the genre lies in watching someone resist change until they can’t anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>If we consider another story in this genre, like Judy Blume’s widely beloved 1970 novel </span><i><span>Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret</span></i><span>, we can better understand </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>. Margaret’s life problem is becoming herself. She is learning what it means to inhabit a changing body, a changing faith, and a changing world. Her wrong way is through control. She prays for time to move faster, for life to just happen already. The hard truth she must accept is that time will go on with or without her permission.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, in Stephen Chbosky’s </span><i><span>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</span></i><span>, Charlie’s life problem is trauma. His wrong way is silence—the belief that not remembering will keep him safe. His catharsis comes when he finally recalls the truth and survives it. Both stories build empathy through resistance. We ache as their denial collapses because we’ve been with them through the denial.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628068"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628068">©</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>has the same ingredients but none of the impact. Melinoë’s life problem is being born into revenge. Her wrong way is living by it. Her hard truth is that forgiveness ends the cycle. But the game skips the middle act. Where is the resistance? Melinoë never fails because of her flaw. Her vengeance doesn’t cost her anything. No friends lost, no cracks in her resolve, no moment where the loop itself becomes unbearable. She doubts only in fleeting dialogue, never in action. Her transformation happens underneath a run of combat indistinguishable from the last.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Without the wrong way, there’s no reason to crave the right one.</span></p> <p><span>The roguelike loop doesn’t stall Melinoë’s growth. It always rewards her for embracing it. Every run makes her faster, or stronger, or more resilient. “Death to Chronos” is not a curse, but an endless battery. The game trains us to believe and give into what it should have taught us to question: Death to Chronos.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There’s one moment that could have broken the pattern. Late in the game, Melinoë learns that her mentor, Hecate, is an older version of herself—a Melinoë from another timeline who succeeded in killing Chronos but lost herself in the process. Her personhood sanded down until she’s just the witch who trains the next one.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The two speak in soft circles. There has never been meaningful friction between them and there won’t be today. Melinoë insists, </span><i><span>“</span></i><span>You are my mother.</span><i><span>” </span></i><span>Hecate replies, </span><i><span>“</span></i><span>I am not</span><i><span>.” </span></i><span>When it’s over, they agree, </span><i><span>“</span></i><span>Let’s pretend none of this transpired</span><i><span>.” </span></i><span>And nothing changes. Melinoë loves her just the same. The revelation is a gift to the audience, not the character. We’re handed a twist, a piece of trivia, not a destabilizing truth. I feel nothing.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Are we meant to believe the passage occurs here? That painful transformation is proven by one version of Melinoë living on under another name, sustained only by this timeline’s necessity? This version, like our unyielding allegiance to “Death to Chronos,” exists not to change the story, but to make its ending possible. Hecate had to be here. She is the proof of what the game can’t admit—that something must break for time to move forward, but </span><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>refuses to break </span><i><span>our </span></i><span>Melinoë at all.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>is afraid of its own premise. A Rites of Passage story demands stillness, loss, change, and this roguelike cannot abide. The game talks about ending cycles while mechanically refusing to stop spinning.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>When I play, the only emotions I feel belong to the combat: the thrill of a build working out just how I imagined, the delight of a particularly rare boon appearing when I need it, the visceral pleasure of clearing a room without ever being touched. When the credits eventually roll, I’ve learned nothing. I haven’t learned anything about Melinoë, or about myself, or about existence. Zagreus saves Chronos, everyone remembers a better time, and Melinoë sets off to fix other timelines. </span><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>isn’t a story. It’s maintenance.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>So I wake up again, in that corner of the Crossroads, and stare at the painting. Melinoë, the not-yet-formed person she was. The family she was promised.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>“</span></i><span>You don’t remember them, besides this painting and your dreams. But still you fight for them…</span><i><span>”&nbsp;</span></i></p> <p><span>After brooding for too long, she sometimes covers the painting with a cloth. I understand now. Some dreams stop meaning something the moment you wake up.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has sparked shock and anger among Warhammer 40,000 fans after it killed off two main characters from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a> via a brief lore update posted on its website.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-just-promoted-titus-from-space-marine-2-with-a-fancy-new-trailer-that-sets-up-the-next-narrative-expansion-for-warhammer-40000">Games Workshop announced that Titus, the main playable character from last year’s blockbuster hit video game Space Marine 2, had been promoted with a cool new trailer that set up the next narrative expansion for the Warhammer 40,000 setting</a>, dubbed 500 Worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Captain Demetrian Titus, Master of the Watch, is now once again Captain of the Ultramarines Second Company, a position he had already held before he was taken into custody on suspicion of heresy by the Inquisition after the events of the first Space Marine game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the context of Titus’ promotion, fans had expressed concern over the fate of Sevastus Acheran, the former captain of the Second Company and Master of the Watch who dishes out missions (and can never spare enough men) in Space Marine 2. Now we know what actually happened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a lore update post on <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/2uwxtd2k/500-worlds-how-did-titus-become-captain-of-the-second-company-again/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Community</a>, Games Workshop revealed what Acheran got up to following the events of Space Marine 2. And yes, as fans feared, he’s dead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Confirmation comes from a four paragraph lore explanation in the article itself, which reveals Acheran went out in a blaze of glory fighting a Genestealer Cult on the hive world of Trygg. That’s that. Acheran is dead. But it gets worse.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/11/40k-secondcoycaptains-nov11-image5-ntfnir5ucc-1762888578681.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sevastus Acheran is dead. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out Lieutenant Chairon, one of Titus’ squadmates from Space Marine 2 and who was conspicuous by his absence from Games Workshop’s Titus reveal, was by Acheran’s side and also died at the hands of the Genestealer Cult. Chairon doesn't even get more than a shout out, despite being the more prominent character in Space Marine 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s how it went down:</p><blockquote>Every last Space Marine that landed on Trygg was slowly worn down in a series of increasingly desperate battles. When Imperial reinforcements arrived to purge the last of the cult, they discovered that Acheran, Chairon, and the rest of their brothers had sold their lives to cull untold numbers of xenos hybrids.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say Warhammer 40,000 fans are a tad upset not just <em>by</em> the news of the characters’ deaths, but <em>how</em> Games Workshop revealed the news. Many are saying Acheran and Chairon deserved better than to be killed off-screen, and should instead have got their moment in either Space Marine 2 DLC or the confirmed Space Marine 3. At the very least, the characters could have been dealt with in a short story or, better still, a Warhammer 40,000 novel. But no. All they get is a few pars in a Warhammer Community article most fans won’t even read.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">F's in the chat for the GOAT Chairon (and Acheran too I guess) <a href="https://t.co/wY0C1ags0L" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/wY0C1ags0L</a></p>— Master of Machines 🚧 (@MachDominus) <a href="https://twitter.com/MachDominus/status/1988269547271414241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"They had so much options," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1oubpkp/comment/noanrqq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Fit_Fisherman_9840</a> on the Space Marine subreddit, which is currently up in arms. "Make Chairon the new LT, or since his hate for the traitor make him the company Judiciar. And Acheran?

"Killing them both off screen, especially Chairon as a Primaris that was born during the Heresy, is really low. It should have happened in a DLC or maybe a animation."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"He died as he lived, unable to spare any more men," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/1oucaor/comment/noamd38/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beaker_person said</a> of Acheran's demise on the 40kLore subreddit. "Is there anything more grimdark than to die offscreen?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1oubixc/comment/noamax5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joked ChaoticMat</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And what does this all mean for the other Ultramarines in Space Marine 2? Are they dead, too? In particular, fans are wondering about Chaplain Leandros, who was not mentioned as being among the dead alongside Acheran and Chairon. Perhaps he’s still out there somewhere, casting an inquisitive eye on Titus as he tries desperately to reclaim Ultramar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this probably feeds into Space Marine 3 in some way, assuming the sequel picks up after the events of 500 Worlds or takes place during them. We know next to nothing about the game, but we can probably count poor Acheran and Chairon out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p>Kicking off later this week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Yes, it really is here — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>, the soccer RPG from Level-5 which has seen multiple delays and <em>two</em> name changes, finally launches on 13th November 2025 on Switch and Switch 2. And ahead of that day, the developer has shared the first 30 minutes of the game's story mode.</p>
<p>The footage (above) is from the game's Story Mode, and as you can see, it's <em>very</em> story-heavy. There's not even any footie. But there's plenty to do as you explore the grounds of the school for the very first time.</p>
<p>Plus, one of the early highlights are the gorgeous animated cutscenes from MAPPA, the animation studio best known for its work on <strong>Jujutsu Kaisen</strong>, <strong>Attack on Titan</strong> Season 4, <strong>Vinland Saga</strong> Season 2, and <strong>Chainsaw Man</strong>.</p>
<p>You might have seen that some people are already playing the game online; that's because pre-orders for the PC, PlayStation, and Xbox versions of the game grant Early Access to the game. That's <em>not</em> the case on Switch 1 or 2, unfortunately. So we'll have to wait until Thursday for a kickabout...</p>

<p>You might also be wondering about official reviews, too. We'll echo the words our sister site Push Square <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/site-news-wheres-our-inazuma-eleven-victory-road-ps5-ps4-review">shared yesterday</a>: we don't have a pre-release code.</p>
<p>And, as we'll be reviewing the Switch 2 version — which has Mouse Mode, along with better performance and visuals and other features — we also don't have access to... early access, so we won't be able to make a start until we get a code or until the game's officially out.</p>
<p>So, basically, we'll have a review for you as soon as we can, but as you're likely aware, this game is <em>massive</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You probably heard the big news about </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i><span> last week: Rockstar’s open-world crime drama </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><span>has been delayed until November of next year</span></a><span>. However, that wasn’t the only major </span><i><span>GTA 6</span></i><span>-related bomb that dropped. The studio also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525"><span>fired a few dozen workers</span></a><span> for “gross misconduct,” including what Rockstar claims was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525"><span>the public leaking of company secrets</span></a><span>. Now, the affected developers are organizing with in-person protests, and preparing for a possible legal battle if Rockstar doesn’t reinstate their jobs.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of these developers were part of a growing attempt to unionize within the company’s UK branch where reportedly just over 10 percent of the studio’s workforce had been recruited, which would qualify the Rockstar workers there for “statutory recognition,” requiring the company to recognize the union.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite what the developers and IWGB Game Workers Union are calling an attempt at union-busting, the dozens of employees affected still want to go back to Rockstar to finish their work on </span><i><span>GTA 6</span></i><span>, and depending on how the company responds, it could lead to a lengthy legal battle. The workers have been picketing outside Rockstar and publisher Take-Two’s offices, with footage from the demonstrations showing they aren’t backing down from the fight.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Fired </b><b><i>GTA 6 </i></b><b>devs just want to get back to work</b></h2> <p><span>YouTube channel </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9nOwjeznjI"><span><em>People</em></span><i><span> Make Games</span></i></a> <span>was on the ground at one of the picket lines and interviewed some of the affected workers about the questionable circumstances regarding their termination, the culture of fear that current employees feel after these firings, and the underlying desire to reunite with their colleagues to bring </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6 </span></i><span>over the finish line after years of work.</span></p>

  <p><span>Thus far, the union has put in an appeal for Rockstar to voluntarily reinstate the workers it fired, but if that doesn’t happen, the issue could escalate into a legal battle.</span></p>

 <p><span>“What happens next is up to Rockstar,” IWGB organizer Fred Carter told </span><i><span>People Make Games</span></i><span> last week. “We’ve just submitted our legal claim. The ball is in their court to respond. We hope they’ll resolve this with us amicably. This is<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->in the end, this is egregious, and to be honest, shocking. I have never seen a thing like this, not just in the game sector, but in UK trade union organizing in the last 20 years. This is the moment where they can make that right. These are workers who just want to go back to work, to work on a game that they love. If they don’t, they’ve seen what they have to contend with.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Rockstar’s official stance on the issue is that the developers were “distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum,” and that these firings were “in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.” The only place </span><i><span>GTA 6 </span></i><span>developers say they were discussing anything about the company was on a private Discord server where members of the union spoke about working conditions at the </span><i><span>GTA </span></i><span>company and organized union-based activities. Rockstar declined to comment when </span><i><span>People Make Games </span></i><span>asked if this server was the “public forum” the company referred to, but according to IWGB president Alex Marshall, the conversations should have been protected by British Trade Union legislation.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“It looks like they’re essentially trying to decapitate the union when they see it’s gathering momentum, when they see it’s kind of passing this 10-percent threshold, when they can see it’s picking up,” Marshall told </span><i><span>People Make Games</span></i><span>. “And instead of actually thinking, ‘Oh, our workers are unionizing. Clearly, there’s something we should engage with,’ they’ve just tried to steamroll it, and completely gut the company of a union so they can continue with the behaviors that we’ve seen have been deeply problematic and toxic, and were the exact reason why workers started unionizing. I think what Rockstar has done is just proven, out in the open, what the workers were actually trying to counter behind closed doors.”</span></p> <h2><b>A fight for the soul of Rockstar</b></h2> <p><span>In addition to the ongoing protests, the firings could also be a huge hit to the morale of people at Rockstar still working on </span><i><span>GTA 6</span></i><span>. One anonymous former employee told </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-union-protest-rockstar/"><i><span>Aftermath</span></i></a><span> that losing people in the game’s final development year could have catastrophic consequences for the team, but knowing that many people still in the company are on their side has been heartening.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account,” they told </span><i><span>Aftermath</span></i><span>. “It’s clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The most raw account we’ve gotten of these events has come from an anonymous Rockstar employee on the </span><a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1004182-rockstar-games-alleged-union-busting/#comment-1072605777"><span>GTA Forums website</span></a><span>. The worker, whose identity the site’s moderators say they verified, described a very brief and dehumanizing firing process, one that didn’t offer any evidence or specifics of the supposed “gross misconduct.”</span></p> <p><span>“Those of us who are lucky and remain for now work in fear,” they wrote last week. “Fearful when talking to each other at the tea prep, fearful that we’re next in line and are easily got rid of, too scared to go outside the studio and talk to (or even acknowledge) our colleagues outside protesting in fear of reprisals. Morale in the studio is at rock bottom.”</span></p>

 <p><span>They continued,&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>When we should be excited about what’s to come over the next year, we are now totally deflated, and our trust and confidence in others is totally shot. Which is the truly heartbreaking part, as for us in the Union, all of our ambition was to make Rockstar a happier, fairer, safer, and more equitable place. That’s all. What has happened clearly shows that we care more about the well-being of our colleagues at Rockstar than the Company does. The union remains unbowed and is fighting to win the reinstatement of every dismissed member of staff at Rockstar through legal means and campaigning. This fight is critical; if Rockstar can get away with this, they will keep treating their workers with disdain, disrespect, and subjecting them to continued illegal treatment.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Whatever happens, </span><i><span>GTA 6 </span></i><span>has at least another year of development to go before it launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on November 19, 2026. According to industry </span><a href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/1985132691206135905"><span>insider Kiwi Talkz</span></a><span>, the game is content complete and just needs additional polish to avoid a “</span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>” situation. </span><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i><span>’s Tom Henderson </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiosAignxbM&amp;source_ve_path=MTc4NDI0"><span>reports</span></a><span> that the game’s latest delay could cost an estimated $60 million more in development costs.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But the fight to reinstate the fired developers goes beyond a single game. If Rockstar doesn’t reinstate them, IWGB Game Workers Union co-founder Austin Kelmore tells </span><i><span>Aftermath </span></i><span>the organization “intends to pursue every legal avenue available” to get these developers their jobs back. The larger ramifications this will have on Rockstar and its public perception won’t stop at the launch of </span><i><span>GTA 6 </span></i><span>next year. </span></p>

              <p>To celebrate Veterans Day in the United States, EA has teamed up with the veterans’ charity group <a href="https://www.nationalrgrassociation.com/">National Ranger Association</a>&nbsp;and released a new cosmetic bundle in <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> honoring Army Rangers. It looks a lot like a charity bundle, but some fine print makes it clear that’s not the case, as none of the proceeds from sales of the new pack are being donated to the veteran charity group.</p>

 <p>On November 11, EA released the “Lead the Way” cosmetic bundle in its hit multiplayer FPS<em> Battlefield 6.</em> The pack costs $12 and includes gear inspired by Army Rangers, including a new weapon skin, character outfit, and camo parachute. It’s a pretty grounded, realistic cosmetic pack, <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-skin-is-causing-community-meltdown-grounded-ea-2000638294">the kind of thing<em> Battlefield 6</em> fans love.</a> And if you head over to the<em> Battlefield 6</em> store online, <a href="https://store.ea.com/battlefield/en/bundle/lead-the-way-pack">you’ll see a preview image with text that states</a>: “Join <em>Battlefield</em> in our support of the National Ranger Association.” That seems to imply this is a charity pack, and the store listing’s most prominent text does nothing to indicate otherwise. But if you scroll down far enough, in small text, you’ll find that EA clarifies that the “Lead the Way” pack isn’t directly supporting vets.</p>

 <blockquote><p>“No portion of the Lead The Way pack sales is donated.”</p></blockquote> <p>Now, to be clear, EA did explain this pack isn’t benefiting vets more directly <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/veterans-day-lead-the-way-pack">in a blog post on Monday</a>. In that article, EA explained that this isn’t a charity pack way at the bottom of the post. Here’s the text included:</p> <blockquote><p>While proceeds of the Lead the Way Pack are not allocated to charity, our independent donation to the National Ranger Association helps advance their important work for the Ranger community. We encourage you to learn more at their website and consider supporting their mission.</p></blockquote> <p>Still, it’s very strange to obfuscate the fact that this pack, which looks a lot like a bundle dedicated to supporting real-life vets, won’t directly benefit those people. <em>Kotaku</em> contacted EA and Battlefield Studios about the bundle and donation, but didn’t receive a response.</p> <p>Sure, EA donated money independently to the group and is sponsoring the charity’s “Best Ranger Competition.” That’s nice and all, but it seems a bit scummy to sell a Veterans’ Day cosmetic pack that is directly connected to a charity organization, but not make it extremely clear that the proceeds aren’t going to that group or toward helping its mission. Compare this to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_Endowment#Funding">Activision’s<em> Call of Duty</em> Endowment organization,</a> which sells cosmetics in-game to support vets finding new jobs after service and donates 100 percent of the proceeds to the group, and it makes EA’s bundle seem much worse.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Nintendo "will never position themselves as a direct competitor to PlayStation."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aime has said he "scratched his head a little bit" after seeing the company's first line-up of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> software. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsg5P9fcx4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a>, the ex-Nintendo veteran shared his thoughts on the company's handling of the Switch 2 this year, as well as Nintendo's position in the video game market overall compared to Microsoft and Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing the dominance of PlayStation, Fils-Aime, who left Nintendo in 2019, said he expected the company to continue to thrive alongside Nintendo as the latter would never position itself as a direct competitor. As for Xbox, Fils-Aime expressed surprise that Microsoft hadn't already released more games for Nintendo's new console.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/11/gettyimages-1384659694-1762881485957.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Reggie Fils-Aimé. Image credit: Samantha Burkardt/Getty Images for SXSW.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"From a business perspective, when I first saw that line-up, I scratched my head a little bit," Fils-Aime said of Nintendo's decision to fill Switch 2's first six months with Donkey Kong Bananza, Kirby's Air Riders, a new Hyrule Warriors game and two cross-gen titles: Metroid Prime 4 and Pokémon Legends: Z-A. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not a threadbare line-up by any means, but it lacks the big one-two punch of a new 3D Mario and Zelda that the Switch received during the same time period, alongside a breakout new franchise: Splatoon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Certainly, what I underestimated was the enhanced Nintendo Switch 1 content, which I think has been compelling," Fils-Aime continued. "The stuff that you get for free as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, I think that has helped drive some of the momentum. And then certainly, [Donkey Kong] Bananza was a key driver for them."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fils-Aimé was more complementary about Switch 2's potential to act as a platform for the biggest third-party games, though said that Nintendo needed to ensure it was enabling other developers to take advantage of its hardware potential in the same way it did — squeezing enormous games like Tears of the Kingdom onto a tiny cartridge through intimate knowledge of the Switch's innards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But let's be clear," Fils-Aimé stated, "Nintendo, in my opinion, will never position themselves as a direct competitor to PlayStation. It's not in their DNA. It's not how they think about the business opportunity. However, would they welcome some of the latest core gamer-type of content, whether it's the latest Assassin’s Creed or Call of Duty, onto their platform? Absolutely. Do I think that there's a player base there for those games? Absolutely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The key, and this is something that the team there thinks about every day, is making sure that third-party developers have the tool sets so that they have the full capability to bring the best of their games onto Switch 2."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One company that has notably held back from going all-in on Switch 2 is Microsoft, which launched a couple of games on Switch 1 (including Grounded and Pentiment) but is yet to discuss any future plans for Nintendo's platform. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm surprised that Xbox has not yet fully embraced Switch 2 from a software perspective," Fils-Aimé noted. "Certainly some games could easily be ported over to Switch 2. And I'm surprised that we haven't seen more of that. I thought there would be much more, especially during this timeframe leading into the Holiday. All through the fall, I was fully expecting some dedicated announcement," he continued. "And I'm surprised it hasn’t happened." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After bringing Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush to PlayStation 5, Nintendo fans have been waiting patiently for Microsoft to confirm those games, and others, for Switch 2. There's also the small matter of Microsoft's previous pledge to launch Call of Duty on Nintendo hardware — though there's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-its-working-with-nintendo-to-get-call-of-duty-on-switch-but-will-black-ops-7-be-on-switch-2">no sign of that happening for this year's Black Ops 7</a>. Perhaps 2026 will finally see Microsoft make its intentions clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, Fils-Aimé said he had "enjoyed" playing his Switch 2 so far, though noted: "the company did not send me one for free."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Samantha Burkardt/Getty Images for SXSW.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/possessors-review-devil-you-know</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/possessor-s-review-the-devil-you-know.1350286/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>is a new, rather awkwardly-titled Metroidvania from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hyper-light-drifter" rel="nofollow">Hyper Light Drifter</a>&nbsp;</em>studio Heart Machine and indie powerhouse Devolver Digital, and it asks a very important question: what would happen if you found yourself sharing your brain with a demon?</p>

<p>Well, if this roughly 15-20-hour adventure is anything to go by, it turns out the answer is simple: you'd end up exploring a sprawling map, unlocking a suite of movement abilities, and fighting challenging bosses to progress a story about "codependency, loss, and survival", according to the devs.</p>

<p>I won't mince words at the outset:&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>&nbsp;offers a pretty bog-standard example of its genre, at least in gameplay terms, and I'm not entirely sure its narrative explores the aforementioned themes with enough depth or complexity to make it worth recommending either.</p>

<h2><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>Is Metroidvania By the Numbers</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/possessors-review-exploration.jpg?itok=L83ybhHF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/possessors-review-exploration.jpg?itok=THqnYZPC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>doesn't have much new to offer in structural terms.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite an initially enthralling and fascinating setting - that of a city wracked by an apocalyptic event and still shuddering with the aftereffects of demonic invasion -&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>quickly settles into a rather rote Metroidvania rhythm.</p>

<p>If you've played the greats in the genre, like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight" rel="nofollow">Hollow Knight</a>&nbsp;</em>(or, indeed, <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/castlevania-symphony-of-night" rel="nofollow">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a>&nbsp;</i>and <i>Super Metroid</i>), then you'll know what to expect here.</p>

<p>You'll gradually uncover a large, interconnected space full of themed areas, using newly-acquired traversal powers to reach hitherto-unavailable spaces, all while upgrading your combat abilities and survival capacity as you go.</p>

<p>It's not a particularly inspired take on the genre's typical gameplay conceits, and short of repurposing certain household objects as weapons - main character Luca will wield kitchen knives or a baseball bat rather than swords and spears - there's not much here that's pushing the envelope.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're looking for nothing more than a structurally unchallenging exploration-based platformer with some solid combat, that may not be a drawback for you, but if you're searching for any kind of innovation from your next Metroidvania hit, it's safe to look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the level design and art style will offer a diverting vista; you'll see a huge rupture in reality off in the background, for instance, or a series of floating office desks serving as platforms - but they're little more than set dressing for a very straightforward set of maps.</p>

<h2>Combat in&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>Is Fun, but Repetitive</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/possessors-review-tygo.jpg?itok=dJdGrZyW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/possessors-review-tygo.jpg?itok=lZZhmk0Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Boss fights in&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>are a rare highlight.</figcaption></figure><p>Solid is very much the word to describe the combat in&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>. Heart Machine says the combat here contains "elements of platform fighters" like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Smash Bros</em>.</a></p>

<p>That's&nbsp;superficially true; you can juggle enemies and use a variety of different special attacks mapped to directional button-attack combos, and you can utilize an aerial dodge to keep yourself safe from nasty air attacks as well.</p>

<p>Honestly, though, I managed to make it through&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>without using most of the purportedly&nbsp;<em>Smash Bros.</em>-inspired moves at Luca's disposal. Early on, you'll unlock a parry (another increasingly overused mechanic, I think), and that'll carry you through the majority of <em>Possessor(s)</em>.</p>

<p>For the most part, combat in&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>works pretty well, even if it fails to realize its full&nbsp;platform fighter potential.</p>

<p>Attacks land with a fairly satisfying heft (provided you're using a heavier weapon like the baseball bat), and knocking enemies against walls once their&nbsp;<em>Sekiro</em>-style poise is broken can be cathartic as well.</p>

<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>falls into a very common trap that's littered with the corpses of lesser Metroidvanias, and that's enemy variety. Put simply, you'll have seen every enemy on offer here within the first handful of hours, and the rest is essentially going through the motions.</p>

<p>As it progresses, Heart Machine's adventure will throw enemy variants at you, but they're little more than palette swaps with slightly more powerful attacks, so dodging or parrying them is a matter of dull course.</p>

<p>As is usually the case with games that struggle with enemy variety,&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>quickly devolves into muscle memory and tedium. I was begging for just one or two surprises to be hurled at me, but those surprises never came, and fighting the same set of possessed objects and animals became insanely repetitive.</p>

<p>Bosses are a slightly different matter; while there aren't many of them (and&nbsp;the sidequests reuse them in a borderline unforgivable manner), they're fun to fight and surprising in terms of their movesets. It's just the parts in between that feel boring.</p>

<h2><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>Has an Okay, If Uninspired Story</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/possessors-review-story.jpg?itok=gDaMcKCY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/possessors-review-story.jpg?itok=Yzu-rYFG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Possessor(s)</em>' story isn't particularly new, but its characters are alright.</figcaption></figure><p>With combat and map exploration proving relatively unexciting, it's up to&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>' story to pick up the slack, but I don't know if it's ready to bear that kind of weight.</p>

<p>The characters here are endearing enough. Luca is a guarded young girl who's suddenly having to share her head with a demon, Rhem; they both need each other to survive at the outset of&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>, so their relationship is initially an uneasy one.</p>

<p>From that setup, however, I'm sure you can quickly guess how things are going to end up. Could it be that Luca and Rhem will find a grudging respect for one another as they both learn about their respective histories?</p>

<p>That's the core problem with&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)'&nbsp;</em>story in a nutshell; everything unfolds in an entirely obvious and predictable manner. A corporation called Agradyne, which manufactures batteries, is involved, and the fact that it's a corporation is literally all you need to know about its role in the narrative.</p>

<p>There are no twists or turns here, nothing that surprised or engaged me beyond the baseline level. At times,&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>revealed information to me that I think it thought was surprising, but I just rolled my eyes and said "well, obviously".</p>

<p>With that said, Heart Machine must have been doing something at least vaguely right, because I did have a tiny little lump in my throat at&nbsp;the story's conclusion. I don't think it's a particularly memorable tale, but it serves its purpose while it's around.</p>

<h2><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/possessors-review-whip.jpg?itok=Xi-wx6bG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/possessors-review-whip.jpg?itok=tNoGmtIe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>From downtown!</figcaption></figure><p>I enjoyed my time with&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>exactly enough to play through it once and then never think about it again. Its well-worn story is played out and unengaging, but its characters are fun enough to be around for exactly the time they're on screen and no more.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of Metroidvanias, like me, you'll quickly settle into the familiar Sunday-afternoon rhythm of&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>, but those who don't like the genre or who are still coming down from the high of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow">Silksong</a>&nbsp;</em>can safely wait before being possessed by this particular demon.</p>

As new card prices hit record highs, it naturally draws in many new collectors hoping to hit it big, which causes scalpers to swoop in to drive up scarcity and prices, attracting more new collectors, then more scalpers, and so on, a vicious circle that is increasingly tightening, strangling the hobby. This situation has now reached a spectacular new low, with reports that people are attempting to sell the Mega Gengar ex special art rare card from <em>PTCG</em> set Mega Dream ex for $800. But there’s a small problem: the card doesn’t exist yet. It’s set to be part of Japan’s Mega Dream ex special set, only officially announced on Friday, which doesn’t go on sale until November 28.</p>

 <p>Despite <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">multiple promises throughout 2025 from The Pokémon Company</a>, it remains the case that it’s close to impossible to walk into either a specialist or mainstream store and buy a pack of <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>cards released in the last 12 months. Since November 2024’s pre-orders began for the Eevee-themed <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-pull-rates-rares-1851742071">Prismatic Evolutions</a>, new sets have sold out before human beings can click on sites to buy them, while <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-scalpers-mega-evolution-tiktok-2000638182">stock in stores has been stripped from shelves by camping scalpers</a> before kids can spend their allowance. The only solution is to outprint the demand, but as yet The Pokémon Company has demonstrated that it either can’t or won’t do this, and in fact <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-gold-cards-pull-rate-2000630564">seems to be going out of its way to make the situation far worse</a>. And following on from the gold card fiasco of Mega Evolutions, the latest English-language set that goes on sale November 14—Phantasmal Flames—ups this ante by including a single gold card, and having it be the most desired Pokémon on cardboard, Mega Charizard. It’s going to be&nbsp;<em>crazy</em>.</p>

 <p>But if there’s one card that could potentially prove more popular than Mega Charizard ex (which is also getting a Special Illustration Rare version that will inevitably fetch more than $500), it’s Mega Gengar ex, and that ghostly beast is appearing in&nbsp; Japan’s Mega Dream ex later this month. And as reported by <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/mega-gengar-ex-240-pre-sale"><em>Wargamer</em></a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/weve-reached-unprecedented-levels-of-cooked-the-mega-gengar-pokemon-tcg-is-selling-for-usd800-even-though-it-doesnt-actually-exist-yet/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>), people are <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/397243002072?_skw=Mega+Gengar+ex+%23240%2F193&amp;itmmeta=01K9PPMWXCK456FFJQCCGRDSZG&amp;hash=item5c7d872cd8:g:T~kAAeSwdQlpD~Dz&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA0FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1dNIO%2F55w8M20oPYIKOiRGJYfOPTDZbfsqACeI0yA58V9SgTbGZAjx5jzskijh0KLARlhOnqiyoxGbOxSSqCge0%2Fc0KZ51o9SqnbF%2FvDvkeODnztPa3GHAB%2BdPoLIll6UNOAteF9UtmUl1DdKYKfJ4sEn%2BqZ68kmmWn5CgG5Q40dXRGfJwlfFbSfRUxLH6Lo8fGHPhuzdakr%2Bec9lHbZ3BGZaeMOv9DjJbMFexcO2HnxbjHI2M48amPrcvzaMFjiIk%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR-bO09bNZg">already putting the card up for sale on eBay</a>. For $797.99.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643010" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643010"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643010">© eBay / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>To be clear, even though you will see American YouTubers ripping open packs of international cards long before their street dates (either because they are sent samples by TPCi, as we are, or because they get retail stock ahead of sale), this isn’t the case for the Japanese sets. No one has these cards yet. The art for the Mega Gengar ex Special Art Rare was only revealed digitally on Friday. Then cut and pasted onto eBay with a price tag.</p>

 <p>Japan is having all the same problems with stock as the rest of the world, such that even physical Pokémon Centers over there are—I’ve been told—limiting customers to four single packs each. Scalpers will likely be abusing retail options to get hold of the booster boxes, stripping them down to resell valuable cards, and then dumping the bulk. That’s how someone could be confident enough to believe they can honor a sale of a card that is probably still in production right now.</p>

 <p>Presumably the only thing stopping people from trying to hawk copies of the English version of the Mega Gengar ex is that they haven’t got an image of it yet. It will likely be included in whatever January’s special set of Pokémon cards proves to be, and guarantees that this tiresome situation will drag on into at least the start of 2026. It’s a bubble, and it <em>will</em> burst, but the concern is just how much harm it will have done by that point. Not only is <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-magic-the-gathering-scalpers-cards-2000632017">an entire generation of children being excluded from the hobby</a> (and thus from becoming the next generation of collectors), but it’s having a real-life impact on specialist card stores. Store owners are telling me they’re unable to get stock, and that TPCi is actively refusing to engage with them about the issues, meaning customers aren’t coming in. One store owner told me he’s resorted to getting up in the early hours of the morning to try to buy packs online from other retailers, just so he has something to sell on his shelves, while knowing he’s driving the problem by doing so. It’s miserable.</p> <p>So, don’t buy from these scalpers. Don’t endorse those selling sealed product at double or triple the MSRP. Refusing to participate is the only action we can take to address the situation, and thinking, “Well everyone else is doing it, so…” makes you part of the problem. Yes, it’d sure be great to pull that gold Mega Charizard—it could pay for a vacation—but you most likely won’t. (The pull rates for one of the Mega Evolution golds were one in every 2,250 packs, ffs.) Oh, and especially don’t buy from people claiming to sell you a card that’s not even printed yet.</p>

			<p>The Game Awards, the final major video game industry event for the year, will take place at the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles on December 11, 2025, and will be available to watch on YouTube, Twitch, X (formerly Twitter), and TikTok, as per usual. This year, however, for the first time, the trailer-show masquerading as an awards show will be available to watch on Amazon Prime Video as well.</p>



<p>Game Awards creator and host Geoff Keighley announced the news <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1988291558417068465">with a post on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, where he writes, "<em>We’re excited to welcome</em> <em>Prime Video as another distribution partner for</em> <em>The Game Awards live on Thursday, December 11. For the first time, The Game Awards will stream live on Prime Video around the world in more than 200 countries and territories</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's a significant move for the awards show and for Amazon as it is seemingly finding ways to keep ties to the video game industry through its TV show adaptations and now the live streaming of its most popular awards show, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">but not through the actual development of video games</a>. </p>



<p>As part of the partnership, not only will Amazon be livestreaming the show, it will launch a Game Awards-dedicated store for users to purchase Game Awards merchandise and take advantage of "<em>Prime-exclusive, limited-time deals across nominated games, new releases, hardware, and more, revealed in real time</em>."</p>



<p>In a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/game-awards-streaming-amazon-prime-video-twitch-1236574939/">Variety</a>, Keighley said, "<em>The great news about this is that it's additive and we still get to air everywhere we already air the show, and we're adding Prime Video as a partner, which is really exciting for us. We've had lots of conversations with people over the years, and we're like, there's no way, there's no world where we could ever really take the show off YouTube and Twitch - where it was born back in 2014</em>."</p>



<p>Keighley also added that Amazon's involvement will not "<em>change</em>" the show. "<em>We're still making the same show. I came out of a life of working on television networks. And you had television folks that would give opinions and things on what you want the show to be. This is still The Game Awards. It's the exact same show. They're really just another distribution outlet, and they're really letting us build the show the way</em> <em>we always do. We're not changing anything about the show to accommodate a new platform</em>."</p>
