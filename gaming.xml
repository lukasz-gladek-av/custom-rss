		<p>Oh, it’s Friday already? Well, I won’t complain about that too hard, but it’s felt like the week has raced by for me, and not necessarily because of having my face buried in some video games. I have played some games, though, passing the pad back and forth in a jolly jaunt through Little Kitty, Big City, getting the inside scoop on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/11/planet-coaster-2-preview-slip-and-slide-into-the-wet-stuff/">Planet Coaster 2</a>, and kicking in a few doors in Anger Foot – though not many, as I left it to <strong>Miguel</strong> to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/11/anger-foot-review/">review</a>. I’ve also been continuing on with SteamWorld Heist 2 for a review closer to launch.</p>

<p>Between meandering discussions about the potential future (or lack thereof) for Game, the precarious balance of politics around the world and <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-port-sex-toy-electronic-fleshlight-mod-weird-1851587885">the latest X-rated device</a> that has had Doom installed on it, we also checked in on what everyone else has been playing.</p>
<p>Having been a tad disappointed by Man of Medan’s use of the ghost ship premise, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has been pleasantly surprised to discover that his potato of a laptop can emulate PS2 games these days, and has been playing The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age – “It’s basically Final Fantasy but lord of the rings. It’s pretty great.” He also tried “the best football game of all time” in the form of RedCard, Burnout Revenge and State of Emergency 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while <strong>Dom</strong> would love to play more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/09/zenless-zone-zero-review/">Zenless Zone Zero</a>, and has been doing so, his patience is being tested by it needing updates almost every time he wants to load it up. Thankfully we’ve been distracting him with reviews of other games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/infinite-inside-review/">Infinite Inside.</a></p>


<p>Avoiding the update churn by playing something so old that updates would have been measured in megabytes, <strong>Jim’s</strong> been continuing on with Skyrim and has taken a detour into the Dawnguard DLC questlines. He’s also been playing Cyberpunk 2077, which is starting to grow on him, though he regrets making stealthy distraction-based characters for both these RPGs.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> had reviews of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/11/blacksad-under-the-skin-review-2/">Blacksad: Under The Skin</a> and Rack &amp; Slay too do this week: “Blacksad is a decent noir detective game, though a bit predictable. Rack and Slay is a nice basic, roguelike based around billiards. Enjoyable in short bursts.”</p>
<p>It’s been Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden for <strong>Steve</strong> this week, which is basically tailor made for his particular interests, though he complains about the pacing… which he himself is exacerbating – “Part of the length is my own fault as I am doing all the sidequests and finding all the collectables to prolong things even more.” He also checked out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/12/the-smurfs-dreams-preview-the-3d-platformer-to-drive-away-your-blues/">The Smurfs – Dreams</a>, restarted Sons of the Forest, dipped into Escape Academy and has Once Human lined up for some playtime next.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong> has been mixing his usual Dead by Daylight with an attempt to finish off WWE 2K24. He’s also&nbsp;started Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess and is excited to dive deeper into.</p>
<p>And we can round things out with <strong>Tuffcub</strong> who has, obviously, been playing Destiny 2, but also has RoboCop: Rogue City on the go, “because our review was clearly wrong.” – Ade thought it was “utter poo.” Who is right?</p>
<p>Now then, what have you been playing this week?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phasmophobia-console-release-and-price-hike-confirmed-for-this-year.925749/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've been waiting for the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>console release to happen, then you're in luck, as developer Kinetic Games has announced that the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the ghost-hunting game are coming this year.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/739630/view/4250916799060403949" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam FAQ</a>, Kinetic says that the console version will be released during the 2024 Halloween event, which was admittedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release">also the plan</a> for last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-delay-halloween">now-delayed</a> console release.</p>
<p>When the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions drop, however, they will support full crossplay, so if you're playing on console, you'll be able to hunt ghosts alongside your PC-playing friends if you want to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike-camera.jpg?itok=xA6cTg63 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike-camera.jpg?itok=saZzmzSG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>is coming to consoles this year, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Kinetic, the console versions don't currently support voice recognition; instead, you'll have to use the game's text input as a substitute, although the studio is "working on a solution for this".</p>
<p>It'll be rated at 16+ or Teen, although this rating will vary depending on region, and there are also no plans to bring&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>&nbsp;to any of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier">however many tiers Xbox Game Pass currently has</a>.</p>
<p>The console versions of&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-update-point-hope">use the game's 0.10 build</a>, with further improvements and updates coming later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will also be a price hike for&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>when the console versions arrive; you'll be paying $19.99 for the game. Kinetic says this is "due to the amount of content and playtime added since the start of Early Access".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike-ouija-board.jpg?itok=o96h6Dut 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike-ouija-board.jpg?itok=hHicnW8L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"Will&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>be launched on consoles this year?"</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer ghost-hunting horror game that sees you and your friends exploring haunted locations to find evidence of paranormal activity.</p>
<p>You'll use what the devs amusingly term "real" ghost-hunting equipment to identify the paranormal entity haunting the location you're investigating and figure out how best to deal with it.</p>
<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and it's due to come to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

		<p>Sony’s upcoming multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord </a>has&nbsp; a beta test this weekend and originally it was reserved just for those who have pre-ordered the game. That has now changed and anyone with a PlayStation Plus subscription can join in the fun, although that does seem to suggest that the pre-order numbers are rather low.</p>
<p>“During the Early Access and Open Beta, all 16 of our launch Freegunners will be unlocked and available to play and customize,” say Firewalk. “Whether you want to snipe from afar, lock down an area, provide support for your teammates, or… just dive head-first into the fight, our roster of Freegunners has something for everyone. It’s been a minute since we’ve checked in with the Freegunners of the North Star, so we’ll also be sharing our first Vignette during our Early Access Beta and can’t wait for you to learn more about the crew and their tidy ship.”</p>



<p>Firewalk and Sony have big ambitions for their shooter, looking to usurp the formula laid out by Overwatch almost a decade ago. It will drop you into the shoes of the crew of the North Star, taking on high-stakes jobs that will see you facing off against other Freegunner crews. With 16 class-based characters each with contrasting abilities and gear, the parallels to Overwatch are clear, but there is a key distinction to how the game plays as some gear and gadgets will be able to have effects that persist between rounds &nbsp;– traps, lane-blockers, shield barriers and more can shape an entire match between teams.</p>

<p>There’s also a greater emphasis on story being built directly into the game.&nbsp;Each week will open with a new cinematic vignette that will feed into the character building and overarching universe that Firewalk is creating, aiming to go beyond the character building of other examples of the genre.</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jqQJhjf_3o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The full launch for Concord is then set for 23rd August, both physically and digitally for £34.99 here in the UK and $39.99 / €39.99 / ¥4,480 in other regions</p>

            <p>
In theory I'm down to review <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/breachway">Breachway</a>, a roguelike deck-building <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space sim</a> which is sort of FTL but 3D and with cards. The second I wrested this privilege from Ed Thorn's resentful fingers, however, developers Edgeflow Studio and publishers Hooded Horse delayed the early access release. Perhaps this reflects Hooded Horse's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-manor-lords-publisher-thinks-we-should-all-reject-the-opportunistic-and-predatory-quest-for-a-viral-hit">atypically forgiving, when-it's-ready approach</a> to game publishing. Or perhaps they just hate me and wish to deny me things that might bring me pleasure. It matters not, because the game now has a new early access release date - 30th August 2024 via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2118810/Breachway/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breachway">GOG</a>, and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/breachway-aa1bbf">Epic Games Store</a>. Catch a celebratory trailer below.

I enjoyed Breachway's demo, which is still available on Steam - hence, badgering Edders for the review. The game puts you in charge of a single ship and crew, following starlanes from event node to event node, as you join a galaxy-wide search for a mysterious "Signal". Battles cut together close-ups of opposing ships in a way reminiscent of Nude Maker and Platinum's 2009 DS game Infinite Space. To some degree, it's just celestial set dressing for the straightforward reality of playing cards to attack and defend your health bar, but it's swish.
</p>
<p>
Here's what you can expect in the early access build to begin with.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Four ship types, each with their own layouts, synergies, bonuses, and initial faction standings.
</p>
<p>
Multiple types of combat systems to wield in tense turn-based combat, from lasers and missiles to flak and railguns, and even hacking!
</p>
<p>
A large collection of over 200 cards to discover to enhance your modules and fine-tune your loadout.
</p>
<p>
Unique characters to recruit to your crew, with special abilities to deploy in combat.
</p>
<p>
A galaxy map with two regions with their own events, enemy types, and boss encounters. Use the fuel system to reach difficult areas, and be wary of environmental hazards that will affect combat!
</p>
<p>
Four fully fleshed-out factions, each with their own associated events and allegiances.
</p>
<p>
Meta progression between runs - unlockable ship bonuses, modules, and ship variants.
</p>
<p>
Space stations, missions, items, random events, and more!
</p></blockquote>
<p>Inasmuch as Breachway has a game it must dogfight for my affections, it's probably <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cobalt-core">Cobalt Core</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cobalt-core-isnt-just-a-great-game-its-soundtrack-is-also-an-all-timer">we did a whole Game Club month</a> on during the Silver Age of RPS when Katharine "Ironsides" Castle sat the editor's chair. They complement each other pretty well, mind you. Breachway is the more serious piece of storytelling, for people who want to lose themselves in the space opera, while Cobalt Core has Pong-style manouevres and talking animals.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bioware-lead-writer-explains-why-blood-magic-isnt-available-to-players-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioware-lead-writer-explains-why-blood-magic-isn%E2%80%99t-available-to-players-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard.925731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bioware-lead-writer-explains-why-blood-magic-isnt-available-to-players-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Thanks to BioWare, we already know that the player character (called 'Rook') of Dragon Age: The Veilguard won't have Blood Magic specialization available when choosing a Mage class; the only available options are, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/dragon-age-the-veilguard-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-dragon-age-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our info roundup article</a>, Death Callers (necromancers), Spellblades (warrior mages who enhance their melee attacks with magic), or Evokers, masters of elemental fire, ice, and lightning magic.</p>
<p>Blood Magic has long been a staple of the franchise, though. Players could select it when playing as a Mage in Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, for instance, and some fans had been looking forward to it. At first, BioWare only shared that the main character would have compelling reasons to avoid using this type of magic.</p>
<p>Now, Patrick Weekes (Lead Writer at BioWare on the Dragon Age franchise since David Gaider's departure) has provided a more detailed explanation of this choice, as <a href="https://x.com/Hrungry/status/1811605276069347640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by Twitter user Hrungr.</p>
<p><em>Blood Magic is unlikely (<strong>editor's note: even in future games for player characters</strong>) because we've shifted it from a power boost to really being the key to a lot of nasty stuff we aren't interested in having the heroes do. I think it can be ethically neutral if you only use your own blood, but after seeing it used as a required part of mind control and demon binding in Dragon Age 2 and Dragon Age Inquisition, it's just not a road we want the hero to walk right now.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, this magic school leverages the intrinsic spellcasting power of blood for potentially powerful spells, like mind control, not to mention the extremely dangerous demon summoning ritual. In Dragon Age lore, the magisters of the Tevinter Imperium used Blood Magic to conquer most of Thedas. Nowadays, however, even they discourage its usage, at least in an official capacity.</p>
<p>Even though BioWare is looking to veer away from the usage of Blood Magic for player characters, that doesn't mean there won't be something similar. Weekes also wrote:</p>
<p><em>"Use your health to cast more spells" is a fun gameplay twist for folks who like that kind of risk/reward playstyle. We might find other ways to get that. Just not Blood Magic for the hero for now.</em></p>
<p>Are you disappointed about the disappearance of Blood Magic as a viable Mage specialization? Let us know below. As a reminder, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is scheduled to launch this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

The Super Nintendo Entertainment system then arrived to overtake it, but with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-squeezes-more-life-out-of-the-switch-as-switch-2-anticipation-builds">Nintendo's Switch successor still a while away</a>, the current console will seemingly hold a solid new record.</p><p>This is further evidenced by the myriad titles coming to Nintendo Switch in the next year, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-for-nintendo-switch-with-zelda-as-protagonist">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, Super Mario Party Jamboree, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-june-2024-opens-with-mario-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>, Professor Layton and the New World of Steam, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-gameplay-revealed">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and more.</p><p>Nintendo could announce some of these as dual Switch and, for lack of an official name, Switch 2 titles, of course, just as it did with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> on the current console and Wii U, but it has already indicated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-the-nintendo-switch-2-before-april-2025">the next generation hardware won't arrive until April 2025 at the earliest</a>.</p><p>Company president Shuntaro Furukawa has otherwise indicated confidence in the Switch's longevity,  saying in a February 2024 <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240207e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shareholder meeting</a> that Nintendo wants hardware sales to "maintain momentum" despite it being in its seventh year.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch launched in March 2017 and has sold an incredible 141.32 million units, as of March 31, 2024. It's still unclear exactly when the Switch 2 will launch, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-it-will-announce-switch-successor-console-within-this-fiscal-year">Nintendo has said an announcement is coming by March 31, 2025</a>.

It launched on PC on July 9 and quickly found an audience, with an impressive peak concurrent player count of 148,968 on Steam.</p><p>But Once Human also has a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, with some players expressing concern about everything from the game’s privacy policy to the use of the NetEase Launcher. In gameplay terms, players have hit out at mandatory seasonal resets and how they can affect your sense of progression and attachment to your character, as well as cosmetics being tied to individual characters.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Once Human July 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Following a meeting with Twitch streamer and former Blizzard employee Jason Thor Hall, best known as ‘PirateSoftware,’ NetEase <a href="https://x.com/OnceHuman_/status/1811625157846540662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acknowledged</a> this feedback, and promised to make all purchased cosmetics accessible across multiple characters within the same account by August.  “If you have already purchased the same cosmetic on different characters within the same account, we will refund the consumed Crystgin or other in-game currency for the additional purchases once the cosmetics are account-wide,” NetEase explained.</p><p>NetEase had already published <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460/view/4230650600765346781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on the Once Human Steam page</a> addressing the backlash to the mandatory seasonal resets. In it, the company insisted players do not lose their in-game progress every six weeks. Some in-game content will be retained no matter how the seasons and servers change, NetEase promised. This includes important currency, gear blueprints, cosmetics, and main story and side story task progress. However, some content and resources will only be partially carried over when you enter a new season.</p><p>“In each new season, your character begins at Level 1, and all exploration progress on the World Map is reset,” NetEase said. “This ensures a level playing field for all players in the new season. Additionally, the new scenario will present a different map for exploration and rewards. Each seasonal server will also feature fresh challenges, tasks and rewards.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>And earlier this week, NetEase addressed the privacy and launcher concerns. It said it only uses personal data "if we have a legitimate legal basis, such as providing requested services or acting with your expressed consent."</p><p>"We will only use your data lawfully and reasonably and in accordance with local legal compliance requirements, while practicing the data privacy principles such as data minimization, purpose limitation, and transparency," NetEase continued. </p><p>And on the NetEase Launcher, NetEase said it offers broader access to games published by NetEase Games, similar to launches from the likes of Blizzard Entertainment. "Like some of our industry peers who run multiple games simultaneously, we hope that the launcher can provide convenient access to multiple NetEase's games for our users," the company said.</p><p>"However, please note you would only be required to download the launcher if you download Once Human from our official website. Players who play the game from Steam or Epic will NOT need to download or use the launcher."</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/are-space-shooter-games-still-a-rite-of-passage-<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s an age old saying in the video games industry which goes along the lines of “space shooters are a rite of passage”. This phrase probably coined popularity amongst games developers as the basic idea is that they are “easy to make” although </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>many</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> indie developers would probably say something along the lines of “go make pong”.&nbsp; As someone who has done both of these things (although I have only released one commercial game which funny enough is a space shooter &amp; quite a lot of personal projects)&nbsp; - I will attempt to provide the games developer community with my thoughts regarding how I ventured into ‘solo indie’ games development. I won’t go into the personal projects so much as I’ve wanted to be a games developer since I was about 5 years old back in the *cough* 90’s *cough* *cough*.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Going indie.">Going indie.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Talking about coughing: The year was 2020, Covid just hit and the UK finally started taking it ‘seriously’ just after I sent my youngest off to school and said to myself “I’m going to make a video game” – as in first commercial video game after the supermarkets had been ransacked and I ended up home schooling all of the kids at that time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;So, where did I start? It feels like a really long time ago now but I started off by downloading some game engines: Godot, Unity &amp; Game maker.&nbsp; I would advise to take this approach to see which one “suits your needs” or is “easiest for you to get along with” as well as reading the T&amp;C’s for each one – PS: I settled on Game maker. Not that the other engines are bad or anything but I knew I was going to start off with a 2d game &amp; game makers workflow just ‘worked’ for me (there are other engines of course for that as well such as RPG maker etc which I used back in the 90s-ish).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first game I tried to make (since going indie) was pong and I actually failed to do that even following a tutorial in not just one but </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>all</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of the pre-mentioned engines. Eventually I discovered a tutorial by “friendly cosmonaut” on making an asteroids clone called ‘space rocks’ which was using the game maker engine. &nbsp;After realising the engine had been updated since that tutorial and bashing my head off a keyboard for what felt like weeks: I finally made an asteroids clone. Was it a perfect clone? Well, no but it was functional with some programmer duct tape here and there. After the asteroids clone; I made a few game jam games such as: pong &amp; other space shooter clones without using tutorials such as space invaders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What did I learn from all that? Well, here’s the thing: doing anything new for the first time is going to be pretty awkward and bumpy. Before I embarked into ‘indie’ games development (as opposed to level design) I used to do pixel art commissions and each time I did a new commission it felt like doing something I’ve never attempted before. Many years ago I tried learning C# and C++ but gave up within a day or two (don’t be a quitter). This time around nothing was going to stop me and now (some years later) I do: art, animation, sound FX, voice acting, programming etc – be prepared to wear many hats as a solo indie or even in a small team! I even had to manage a few people that I hired for my first commercial game “Crystal comet” – thankfully I’ve worked as a supervisor in other industries before!</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="My first commercial space shooter game.">My first commercial space shooter game.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here’s where things get a bit dicey! “Crystal comet” was a game that I wanted to make (being a fan of Starfox64 &amp; Left4Dead with the use of AI teammates) and was not considered “a rite of passage” for me - Although at the time that seemed like an unusual ‘bonus’ of sorts. However, let’s look at some other games in the genre shall we? We have games like: Jamestown+, Zero ranger &amp; old favourites such as Death smiles &amp; the Psikyo games etc. Some of these games are the most beautiful looking games in not just their own genre but others too! There is fierce competition in the “shmup” genre and the fan base is very specific about the things they like and dislike oftentimes falling into a “niche within a niche”. There is a mountain of choice of the type of shoot em’ up you could potentially make. I fell into the “vertizontal twin stick shooter category” – Just a little market research could have helped avoided a certain calamity there!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s horizontal shmups, vertical shmup’s, retro shmups, Bullet hells, ‘Euro’ shmups (derogatory term amongst genre fans) etc. Some fans even hate the term “shmup” but the tag “shooter” became overcrowded by first-person and third-person shooters a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>long</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> time ago. Then there are your rogue-like varieties as well and so on. For example: did anyone see Vampire survivors coming? A “bullet heaven”? Well, I did but the funny thing is that isn’t even considered a “shmup” amongst the purist of fans but more of a “shmup adjacent” game – </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>some</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fans of the genre might even be mad at me for even saying just that! &nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is it all bad news? Honestly, making any game as your first commercial experience is going to teach you more compared to a non-commercial game. The benefit from making a “shmup” is that there is a small but very dedicated audience that you could </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>learn a lot about games design</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from. In terms of commercial viability however, it really depends: the more of a certain genre you make the more your audience can grow in that genre. For example a game called “Angel at dusk” which recently did pretty well! - Although it would seem that developer has been developing games in the “shmup” genre for quite a while now.&nbsp; I should say however that some genres are more in demand than others if you get my drift. The “shmup” or “shoot em’ up” genre is somewhat “over-saturated” in terms of commercial viability alongside the many games being released.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Will I be making another “shmup”? – Unlikely (unless as a passion project as originally I wanted Crystal comet to be a trilogy). Although I did get contacted by two publishers (which isn’t bad honestly) you still have to remember that publishers will throw out a bunch of fishing lines to see ‘who bites’ - It could still lead to nothing. The initial sales of Crystal comet probably wouldn’t be good enough to rise above the other biters. Even if there are some ‘super fans’ who are ‘diying’ for me to make another game – I’m sorry but the sales wouldn’t enable me to live from making Crystal comet games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What did I learn from developing my first space shooter game as a commercial project? As much as that could be an entire article in itself I’m going to give you the abridged ‘cliff notes’. Making any game is going to be difficult, especially in today’s modern age. Player’s expect more, the technology has improved vastly and the quality bar for any game has risen significantly as a result. Had I released Crystal comet back in ~2010 it </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>might</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have done ok. However, as I kind of stated before any commercial game will teach you something that a non-commercial game won’t (I’ve made plenty of non-commercial projects but had no idea what was coming).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For arguments sake though, let’s ‘bullet point’ some things that will save you some time:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making a full-game ‘mostly’ by yourself is going to be a lot harder than you think – originally I thought Crystal comet would take about 9 months. The game was started in 2020 and finished in 2024.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Research the target audience before you do </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>anything</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> – they like specific things. Give them what they want!</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Art from the start” – Your game’s art may actually be more important than the gameplay itself which hurts me so very much to say.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Get early reaction ASAP. My game was perceived as “party Galaga” which I didn’t know until very late in development – I could have used that! Being associated with one of the most </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>well-known shooters of all time </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">with some twists isn’t a bad thing!</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;Get your store page up ASAP – gage how well things are going early. Cut features if you need to based on how reactions etc are going. Push the release early, lower the price and move on if you need to. If you don’t, you don’t and that’s a much better situation to be in.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bonus tip: Listen to the people who have more experience with this than you do. I ignored a ton of advice along the way thinking I knew better being a gamer myself since I was a child – it’s not enough! Yet also know when something doesn’t apply directly to you aka advice for much larger companies. If you’re solo, you’re really solo. Some solo dev’s or duo’s worked on their game for many years gaining wishlists over a long time period before release.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s of course a lot more I learned but let’s KISS: “keep it simple stupid” for now.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Are space shooters a rite of passage? Yes and no. Theoretically speaking space shooter games are ‘air quote’: “easy to make” but not on a ‘commercial’ scale. It’s like when you assess the difference between a game jam game and a commercial game in that regard. A commercial game (regardless of genre) is going to require a lot more than a hobby project or a learning project. When I added controller remapping to “Crystal comet” I had no idea this would actually take weeks if not months to code from scratch (factoring in polish, debugging &amp; play testing etc). When I spoke to another developer at a game dev meet up and said “I thought it would take a week” – they laughed and shook their head. So, in conclusion: the simpler a game you can make when starting out - the better! Check out the competition when considering any ‘viable commercial project’ to know exactly what you’re getting into because the “shmup” indie developers are making some ‘banging’ games that have kept me more than busy over the last few years whilst making Crystal comet.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What’s next for RewdanSprites?">What’s next for RewdanSprites?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’m currently working on my next project. After ~20 years of trying to break into the games industry (and failing) and now falling into ‘indie games development’ – I haven’t given up just yet! (and probably never will). So, if you’re a games company looking for a guy that simply just does not know when to quit – I’d make a fantastic level designer (I’ve made hundreds if not thousands in the platformer &amp; arena shooter genre - also did well in competitions). Other than that though - I guess I’ll just keep making indie games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Where to find me?">Where to find me?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">YouTube: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@RewdanSprites">https://www.youtube.com/@RewdanSprites</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Twitter/X:&nbsp; </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/RewdanSprites">https://x.com/RewdanSprites</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Crystal comet” the video game: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2642920/Crystal_Comet/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2642920/Crystal_Comet/</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">E-mail: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="077562706366697477756e73627447606a666e6b2964686a">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Per a new release date trailer, Lidia will be released on July 25th, and you'll be able to play as her three days earlier if you own the Playable Character Year 1 Pass, which also includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-eddy-gordo-release-date">previous DLC fighter Eddy Gordo</a>.</p>
<p>In grand&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>tradition, Lidia's release date was revealed via a trailer that also shows off some of her moves. She's facing off against Leroy Smith in the trailer, so unlike in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-tekken-8-gameplay-trailer-reveals-jin-kazama-in-action">other</a>&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>characters' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-paul-phoenix-gameplay-trailer-brings-back-fan-favorite">trailers</a>, she's not battling someone with whom she has a particular relationship.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tekken-8-lidia-release-date-pose.jpg?itok=3knY0_RU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tekken-8-lidia-release-date-pose.jpg?itok=nFY2X3Sy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lidia rejoins the roster as&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s second DLC fighter.</figcaption></figure><p>As you might expect from a karate practitioner, Lidia's moves are disciplined and swift, so you can expect her to be on the quicker end of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s roster.</p>
<p>She dispatches Leroy fairly quickly in her trailer, after which she moves on to series mainstay Jin Kazama, who tells her he can see that she's "no pushover". She returns the compliment, and the two bow, suggesting a duel between equals rather than a grudge match.</p>
<p>Of course, since this is Lidia's trailer, Jin doesn't stand much of a chance, and it's not long before she's facing off against Reina, another new character (who was, incidentally, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-reveals-new-character-reina">designed by&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>artist Mari Shimazaki</a>) in the&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>lineup.</p>
<p>Once again, Lidia's victory against Reina is assured, and we get to see the Polish Prime Minister's Rage Art, which sees her declaring victory "in the name of all Polish people".</p>

<p>Lidia serves as&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s second Season 1 DLC character, with the first being the aforementioned Eddy Gordo. Two more are set to be announced, one in fall and one in winter.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778820/TEKKEN_8/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/tekken-8/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tekken-8/9PPSM14VKCLW" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

From <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a> through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prey-2006-review">the original Prey</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/untold-riches-an-analysis-of-portals-expressive-level-design">the obvious touchpoint Portal</a>, gaming hath no greater love than that for an unassuming door which stitches together two places that are notionally far apart.</p>
<p>This rampant enthusiasm for teledoors might seem strange, given that video games are make-believe worlds held together by arbitrary squiggles of magic language. There is fundamentally no reason any video game door <em>should</em> obey the customary laws of spacetime. But don’t let that stop you watching the announcement trailer for Motion Blur’s Black State, a third-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> which is heavily redolent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain">Metal Gear Solid</a> but also, awash with doors that work in mysterious ways.

If you don’t have three minutes to spare, here’s a summary: following some Matrixy preamble, a bro in glistening webbed armour with a backful of sleek, corrugated guns runs down a corridor, opens a door, finds himself in a speeding tube train (“DESTINATION: UNKNOWN”), opens another door, walks into a military base stacked with shipping crates, rouses the fury of sundry gun-toting chaps in rain cloaks, and throws himself into a spot of cover-shooting mixed with close-quarter finishers and drone grenades.</p>
<p>You can see the Metal Gear influence immediately: the protagonist has an agreeably Campbellished radio contact, and the radial awareness icons and last-ditch opportunity to cap alerted guards in slow motion are straight out of The Phantom Pain. The trailer’s snatches of dialogue suggest that it’s going to spend a lot of time belabouring the high-concept mythology of this world. Apparently the brotagonist works for a group called the Architects. There is also a glum lady who seems to live in a reptilarium, and a lairy individual with horns whom, given a sufficient budget, you'd expect to be voiced by Troy Baker.
</p>
<p>
I admit, I’m writing this up partly because I’d love to know what Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima might do with the concept of teleportation doors – that is, the Hideo Kojima who has a supernatural aptitude for being granted infinite time and wealth to pursue any fantabulous brainfart he has while chewing on his Instagrammed sandwiches. Going beyond the opportunity to warp through perimeter defences, imagine the NPC high jinks that might result from guards being lured through doors that have a slippery relationship with the geography.</p>
<p>Imagine stocking an outpost with intricately chained portals so that people leaving a random portaloo teleport in front of jeeps, which then skid through through doors and end up colliding with patrolling helicopters, which then preserve their momentum as they tumble through a final set of doors and erupt from the very same portaloo at the start of the chain, polishing off the base commander whose tea you recently laced with laxatives. Or how about a Rainbow Six: Siege setup where all the windows lead out of other windows, ejecting SWAT teams as they invade, like popcorn from the pan. It's probably been done. But has it been done in photorealism-humping Unreal Engine 5, with all the associated bells and whistles? 
</p>
<p>
I doubt Motion Blur - a new studio based in Istanbul - have the resources for anything quite that sandboxy. I wouldn't be surprised if the magic doors turned out to be comparable to those gaps you squeeze through while the game loads the next major area. But I’m intrigued to see more. Black State will be available on Steam and the Epic Game Store. There’s no release date yet.

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/external-translators-hired-for-nintendo-projects-bemoan-lack-of-credit-in-almost-every-big-title</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/external-translators-hired-for-nintendo-projects-bemoan-lack-of-credit-in-almost-every-big-title.925677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/external-translators-hired-for-nintendo-projects-bemoan-lack-of-credit-in-almost-every-big-title<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Translators contracted from firms outside of Nintendo have complained about not being credited for their work on high-profile games from the Mario maker, including The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Super Mario RPG.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/nintendo-s-systemic-policy-of-miscredting-is-harming-external-translators">Game Developer</a>, anonymous sources who worked for external translator agencies on Nintendo's projects said they had been left off credits. In addition, sources said they had been asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement which prevented them from talking about their work for 10 years.</p>
<p>"I kind of accepted [miscrediting] as 'part of the business' but that doesn't mean it's fair or right," one source who worked on Nintendo projects through service providers Localsoft and Keywords told the publication. "The fact that these companies are not able to give any reasonable explanation for omitting external translators (and even developers) from their credits is proof of this, I think.</p>
<p>"Professionally, it's hard to tell how much this has impacted me. It's entirely possible that more translation agencies would have approached me if my name was out there in all these big blockbuster Nintendo games, but who knows?"</p>
<p>One source blamed Nintendo's own rules on crediting for this. "It is Nintendo's policy to not list the name of translators from external agencies in their game credits, which also forbids us from listing those titles on our CVs," they said.</p>
<p>"For games like Animal Crossing or Breath of the Wild you don't really notice that 15 or 20 translators are not in the credits, as there are all the other names from their in-house translators, which is why Nintendo's policy of miscrediting might have flown under the radar," one source added.</p>
<p>"But almost every big title that Nintendo releases which uses external translators actually fails to credit translators."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Localsoft_TotK.webp?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>While Localsoft received a 'Special Thanks' for its work on Tears of the Kingdom, individuals from the company were not credited. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo via Game Developer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One translator called this snub "upsetting", but sadly not surprising. "That's generally how things work when working through translation agencies, so as much as we were upset (at least some of us), in the end, we shrugged it off as just another day in translation," they said.</p>
<p>It's unclear to what extent in each case the decision not to credit is entirely influenced by Nintendo's own policies, or the policies of the external translation agencies. Eurogamer previously investigated the issue of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-localisation-workers-regularly-left-out-of-game-credits">why localisation workers are regularly left out of game credits</a> and found that the blame was often shared between agencies and the companies they worked with.</p>
<p>"The agencies and the clients just play the blame game endlessly," a source told Game Developer. "It is my opinion that the clients don't care, and the agencies have everything to gain from keeping their vendors, us the translators, in the dark. When it comes to money, fees, contracts and anything related, everything shifts to dark mode."</p>
<p>
Another source added there was a "closed circuit between game companies and translation agencies" which was "as opaque as it can be so that the agencies can make as much profit as they can".
</p>
<p>"If the game company makes a bad call, the agency will roll with it 100 percent. If the game company screws the translators over, the agency will nod their heads and feed on what's left," they said. "And if the agencies can get you to work more for less, even though the company didn't ask for it, they will."</p>
<p>However, despite this unfairness, Game Developer's sources said there was a risk of getting "blacklisted" if they raised concerns. "This is a field where taking an annual break can shut you out of months of work. No one cares what we think because there's literally nothing we can do about it, and that's even if we were willing to forfeit our livelihood for the greater good," they said.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Nintendo, Localsoft and Keywords for comment on today's report.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Localsoft_AC_NH.webp?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>This is not the first time video games have left team members uncredited in a final product. In January last year, a former Sega localisation specialist criticised the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-sega-developer-highlights-lack-of-credit-for-translators">lack of credit for language translators in Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden</a>.</p>
<p>That same month, multiple former Striking Distance employees revealed they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/developers-left-out-of-the-callisto-protocol-credits-accuse-striking-distance-of-playing-favourites">had not been credited for their work on The Callisto Protocol</a>, a decision described as "egregious" by one developer.</p>

<p>In a recent <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1811595182577426907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Paul Tassi of Forbes reported that The First Descendant developer Nexon plans to make “adjustments” following comparisons to Destiny 2.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Tassi first reported controversial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendent-accused-of-copying-from-destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similarities between certain icons</a> in The First Descendant and Destiny 2. While there were some differences in the imagery, the comparisons still drew some backlash.</p>



<p>Now, Nexon reportedly states it has “taken the concerns raised seriously and decided to make adjustments.” These changes intend to distinguish the “imagery that may appear similar” and better reflect “the unique identity” of The First Descandant.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nexon added that the First Descendant team admired Destiny 2, which “served as an inspiration during the development process.” The devs clarify that the team also has a “deep affection and respect” for other games in the genre, too.</p>



<p>The First Descendant just launched last week and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-charts-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soared up charts</a> despite receiving some mixed reviews. On day one, it reached at least 229,000 concurrent players. </p>



<p>Soon after, developer Nexon also addressed The First Descendant’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nexon-gives-fix-for-the-first-descendent-frame-rate-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frame rate issues</a>. The team said it was investigating the issue, and to try reinstalling in the meantime. Today, the devs reinforced that they will “continue to improve the game for fans of the looter shooter genre.”</p>



<p>Nexon also recently launched The Finals, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nexon-the-finals-not-performing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later admitted</a> that the game did not perform as well as expected.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-gains-three-previously-japan-only-gba-platformers.925644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-gba<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released the first three three&nbsp;<em>Densetsu no Starfy&nbsp;</em>games (known as&nbsp;<em>The Legendary Starfy&nbsp;</em>outside of Japan) in the West for the first time via its Nintendo Switch Online service.</p>
<p>The three Game Boy Advance platformers were originally released in Japan in 2002, 2003, and 2004 respectively, and this release marks the first time they've been available outside of Japan.</p>
<p>It's worth noting, however, that although these games are now available to Western gamers, they haven't been translated, so you'll only be able to play them in Japanese.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-japan-only-text.jpg?itok=84GJy3gY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-japan-only-text.jpg?itok=7gQbNt90 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I hope you've got a decent grasp of Japanese if you're planning to play&nbsp;<em>Densetsu no Starfy</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Starfy&nbsp;</em>games are side-scrolling platformers, but they're perhaps a little more text-heavy than other games in the genre might be, and they feature dialogue with instructions for the player as well, so a basic grasp of Japanese might be needed to fully enjoy them.</p>
<p>However, if you're willing to work on visual context clues and a little bit of guesswork, then you'll probably be able to get through these three platformers just fine, and their adorable protagonist should hopefully carry you through some of the more frustrating parts.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Densetsu no Starfy&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo Switch Online right here.</p>

<p><em>Densetsu no Starfy&nbsp;</em>joins a range of other Game Boy Advance games available on Nintendo Switch Online, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/golden-sun-nintendo-switch-online">the&nbsp;<em>Golden Sun&nbsp;</em>games</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kirby-nintendo-switch-online"><em>Kirby &amp; the Amazing Mirror</em></a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-online-gba-mario"><em>Mario Advance&nbsp;</em>lineup</a>, plus more.</p>
<p>It's also not the first game entirely in Japanese to hit the Western Switch Online service; other games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-september-update"><em>Downtown Nekketsu March: Super Awesome Field Day!&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-september-update">Kirby's Star Stacker</a>&nbsp;</em>are also only available in their original language.</p>
<p>You can grab a Nintendo Switch Online subscription via your console's eShop. If you want to enjoy Switch Online's Game Boy Advance library, you're also going to need an Expansion Pack addon, which costs extra but which also adds DLC for games like&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>and <i>Splatoon 2</i>.</p>

<p>"It pains us that the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues, and the recent abhorrent attack on the children's hospital in Kyiv by Russian military forces shook us to our core," the studio said in a statement posted to X/Twitter.</p>
<p>"Mere words would be empty without a meaningful act though – we had previously stated that a portion of 11 Bit Studios revenue generated from Indika will be donated to aid children affected by the war in Ukraine, we knew the time to act was now. That is why we decided to donate $50k to Liberty Ukraine Foundation to support Ukrainian kids receiving treatment at Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv.</p> <div>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-olympic-esports-games-saudi-arabia/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/breaking-12-year-deal-signed-to-bring-first-olympic-esports-games-to-saudi-arabia.925638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-olympic-esports-games-saudi-arabia/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has just been announced that Saudi Arabia will become the proving ground for the inaugural Olympic Esports Games in 2025. This landmark revelation comes off the back of a 12-year deal signed between the IOC and the Saudi Esports Federation. Presently, the Esports World Cup is taking place in Riyadh, but the Olympic Esports Games will be something else entirely.</p>



<p>This is the result of a collaboration between Thomas Bach, the President of the IOC, and HRH Prince Abdulaziz, Minister of Sport in Saudi Arabia.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-history">Making History</h2>



<p>The IOC has long toyed with the idea of introducing esports to the Olympic Games, but why do that when you can just create an entirely new event focused on the unique, digital industry?</p>



<p>In a statement on LinkedIn, Ralf Reichert, the CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>National teams and pride are still underdeveloped in esports but I am certain this will change over time. This is a big step for the sport, not so much for the short-term impact but the long-term prospect.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This huge deal will see the first-ever Olympic Esports Games play out in Saudi Arabia next year. Speaking on the partnership, the IOC’s Thomas Bach touched on some key concerns about the setting: <em>“By partnering with the Saudi NOC we have also ensured that the Olympic values are respected, in particular, with regard to the game titles on the programme, the promotion of gender equality and engagement with the young audience, which is embracing esports.”</em></p>



<p>It hasn’t been established how often the Olympic Esports Games will be held, but if it aligns with the traditional Olympic Games, it’ll be once every four years. The <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-announces-olympic-esports-games-to-be-hosted-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full press release</a> is available on the Olympics’ website.</p>

<p><em>Having been </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/romance-of-three-kingdoms-8-remake-delayed-to-improve-quality">delayed back in December</a><em>, Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8&nbsp;</em>is officially set to launch across PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch on October 24th, when you'll be able to pick it up digitally via these platforms' respective storefronts (it'll be on Steam for PC players).</p>
<p>This reimagining of&nbsp;<em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8&nbsp;</em>will be based on the original game's&nbsp;<em>Power Up Kit&nbsp;</em>version, so you can expect the same features offered by that enhanced edition, including the All Officers Play and All Periods Scenarios options.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-8-remake-release-date-strategic-window.jpg?itok=CrX-Fkbj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-8-remake-release-date-strategic-window.jpg?itok=suGckIhp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>but wish it was a bit more cerebral,&nbsp;<em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake&nbsp;</em>is for you.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also look forward to the addition of Traits, abilities possessed by officers with "exceptional achievements or memorable anecdotes in history".</p>
<p>Legendary Wei general Cao Cao, for instance, can act twice during the council stage, while the iconic hero Liu Bei can meet with officers "without fail". Various other generals will likely have exciting traits for you to discover as well.</p>
<p>Lots of other changes have been implemented, too, including the ability to view relationships quickly and easily as they build up via the new Relationship Chart, as well as the addition of Tales, a new way by which officers can initiate major historical events and anecdotes within the game.</p>
<p>You can check out the new release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake</em>, which features some lovely-looking art courtesy of illustratior Keiji Hida, right here.</p>

<p><em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8&nbsp;</em>is a strategy game set during the warring Three Kingdoms period of ancient Chinese history.</p>
<p>The game allows you to manage your very own kingdom as one of a number of officers from the period, and if you're a&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>fan, you'll likely recognize famous faces like the aforementioned Cao Cao and Liu Bei, as well as Lu Bu, Zhang Fei, and more.</p>
<p>You'll be able to get your hands on&nbsp;<em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2288150/ROMANCE_OF_THE_THREE_KINGDOMS_8_REMAKE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch on October 24th.</p>

            <p>Red Barrels has a new villain, map, trials, and rig for players brave enough to re-enrol in The Outlast Trials.</p>
<p>As part of the first major update to the chaotic cooperative horror since it released in full earlier this year, new enemy Franco "II Bambino" Barbi is "the perverse son of New Orleans mafia don Salvatore Barbi, driven by craven entitlement, greed, and psychosexual violence fueled by his impotence and insecurities" (yikes) and "a freakish big baby obsessed with his Pacifier".</p>

<p>To mark Barbi's arrival, the Bambino Special Event will run for the first four weeks following the update. You'll find Franco Barbi pop up in certain Trials and MK-Challenges, alongside Mother Gooseberry or Sergeant Coyle, and in Trials and MK-Challenges set in The Docks map.</p>
<p>Talking of which: new map The Docks – which is Franco's drug manufacturing domain – is also on the way. It features deadly puzzles during which you'll come face-to-face with Franco in a new trial, Poison the Medicine.</p>
<p>There's also a new game mode, too. Escalation Therapy is a rogue-lite mode which pits players "against a never-ending series of randomised Trials with variators until they succumb to a Permadeath or begin anew". Reagents spawn with nothing, and will have to build their loadouts as they unlock upgrades along the way.</p>
<p>The Barricade is a new rig you can use to, unsurprisingly, create barricades, blocking pathways to give you the chance to get an objective completed or make your escape.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, there's a new maddening-sounding lobby mini-game, Stroop Effect Test, which asks you to correctly select the colour of a word when the word it spells out is in a different colour.</p>
<p>The new content will drop next week on PC, PS5, and Xbox on 16th July, 2024.</p>
<p>Red Barrels says "Project Lupara" is simply the first of a number of upcoming major updates for the "growing live service game, which has sold over 2 million copies to date".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-outlines-post-launch-plans-with-this-intriguing-qa-session">Red Barrels recently opened up about what's next for its deliciously gory cooperative horror, The Outlast Trials</a>.</p>
<p>In a Q&amp;A posted to YouTube, director Alex Charbonneau and community manager Rosie Sarno explore how the game has changed between its early access release in May 2023 and the 1.0 update, which rolled out earlier this year, as well as field questions from the Outlast community.</p>
<p>"The Outlast Trials is excessive and frantically enjoyable - but can occasionally tip over into frustration more than fear," I wrote when I reviewed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-review-a-unique-obscene-spin-on-the-horror-staple">The Outlast Trials</a> back when it was released in early access last year, awarding it three out of five stars.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dungeonborne-release-date-revealed-for-next-week.925596/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mithril Interactive has announced the&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>release date, and if you've been excited to get your hands on the PvPvE dungeon-crawling action RPG, you won't have much longer to wait.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2448970/view/4228398800952553301" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>will launch in Early Access on July 18th, so you've got less than a week to wait before you can check it out, assuming you haven't been taking part in the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-playtest-early-access">pre-release playtests</a>.</p>
<p>If you have been taking part in those tests, however, your progress has been wiped, so you'll be starting off with a clean slate when next week rolls around, which is probably better for everyone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeonborne-release-date-spell.jpg?itok=9O36Io2f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeonborne-release-date-spell.jpg?itok=74hVE3K_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>brings its dungeon-delving RPG action to Steam Early Access next week.</figcaption></figure><p>Mithril says it will be "cooking hard" over the next week or so in order to ensure that&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne</em>'s launch is smooth, so hopefully, everything will be ready come July 18th.</p>
<p>Changes that will be implemented prior to the Early Access launch include widespread class balancing changes, more skill options, and improvements to various systems including PvE engagements and matchmaking lobbies.</p>
<p>In short, if you have tried out the&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>playtests ahead of release, then you'll almost certainly find a smoother and more player-friendly game waiting for you when the Early Access version arrives.</p>
<p>You can check out the new&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>release date trailer, which gives a sense of what kind of game you're in for if you pick it up, right here.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne</em>, it's a PvPvE dungeon-crawling action-RPG inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-and-darker"><em>Dark and Darker</em></a>, as well as games like&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>. It counts rivals <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeon-stalkers-early-access-fall">like&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeon-stalkers-early-access-fall">Dungeon Stalkers</a>&nbsp;</em>among its stablemates.</p>
<p><em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>challenges you to delve into a series of dungeons, comb them for loot and goodies, and then get out before things get too hairy. With eight classes to choose from and more than 80 items to help you craft a unique build,&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>wants to be your go-to dungeon-crawler.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>and see whether it can replace&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>in your heart on July 18th, when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2448970/Dungeonborne/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-lite-oled/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-lite-oled-is-a-massive-improvement-over-regular-model-new-video-highlights.925593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-lite-oled/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Nintendo Switch Lite OLED mod has been in the works for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-lite-oled-not-expensive/">a few months</a>, and a few hours ago we got the very first look at it, and at how much of an improvement it is over the regular Lite model's screen.</p>
<p>The first proper look at the OLED mod for the handheld-only model of the current Nintendo console came from a video shared by the mod's creator <a href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1752326328697889212%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taki Udon</a>, who showcased the OLED screen with Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and compared it with a regular Switch Lite and Switch OLED. Using the same Vivid profile used in the regular OLED model, the colors look more saturated than on a regular Lite and generally much better.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch Lite OLED - Engineering Preview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ufYiLnbOkbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As showcased by multiple systems in the past, an OLED screen is always the better choice, but not every manufacturer is willing to go with one, at least for a system's first iteration. Having received no hardware revision, the Nintendo Switch Lite is among those systems stuck with an LCD screen, and with the console being at the end of its cycle, the only option for those who want a better screen will be to get this mod. Hopefully, Nintendo will launch its next system with an OLED screen from the get-go, although it is hard to say at this time if it will be the case due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-no-oled-release-date/">contradicting</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-oled-samsung/">information.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <p>Free-to-play open world survival shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/once-human">Once Human</a> has spent its first week in the wilds weathering a series of complaints about its data collection practices, much of it orbiting a line from publisher NetEase's privacy policy in which they state that personal information they receive from you may include "government-issued ID, such as passport information, as required by applicable laws for age verification and correction of personal information".</p>
<p>Following a backlash in the user reviews (the game was Mostly Negative on Steam at launch, but has since risen to Mixed) and on social media, the game's developers Starry Studio have published a blog insisting that they harbour no dark intentions for your personal details, or at least, that they harbour intentions no darker than any of the large number of video games that collect your personal information.</p><!--more-->
<p>You can read NetEase's privacy policy <a href="https://protocol.unisdk.easebar.com/release/latest_v475.html#div1">here</a>. The primary bone of contention is the bit directly under "Personal Information we receive from you".  This includes "name and contact details", "such as first and last name, title, prefix, email address, telephone number, (instant) messaging account, postal address, date of birth, age, gender, country/region, and government-issued ID, such as passport information, as required by applicable laws for age verification and correction of personal information."</p>
<p>Another thing users have picked up on is that NetEase may (with consent) collect "location information... such as IP geolocation information, cell-ID, and Wi-Fi connection location", by means of third-party services and platforms, who will of course have their own data collection policies. There's a lot more in the doc. If you're uneasy about the game, I encourage you to go through it in full.</p>
<p>Now, here's Starry Studio's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2139460/announcements/detail/4230650600762196614">post on Steam</a> in response to the privacy concerns. "Once Human takes our users' data privacy very seriously," it reads. "We would only use personal data if we have a legitimate legal basis, such as providing requested services or acting with your expressed consent. We will only use your data lawfully and reasonably and in accordance with local legal compliance requirements, while practicing the data privacy principles such as data minimization, purpose limitation, and transparency. We appreciate and welcome any and all feedback given by our players to help us improve."</p>
<p>The statement notes that if players are worried about NetEase's launcher specifically, they have the option of playing Once Human over Steam or Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>"We sincerely apologize for any confusion or uncertainty experienced by our players," it goes on. "We hope this clarifies the above and please rest assured that we will continue to maintain a transparent, player-friendly gaming environment, not only because it's required by law, but also because it's the right thing to do."</p>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/once-human/privacy-policy">PCGamesN</a>, NetEase are hardly alone in gathering this kind of data. <a href="https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/en-gb/privacy-policy">The privacy policy for ZeniMax Media</a>, for example, notes that "in limited circumstances" they may collect your "Social Security Number, driver’s license, precise geolocation, and personal information collected and analyzed concerning a consumer’s health". <a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/legal/8c41e7e6-0b61-42c4-a674-c91d8e8d68d3/blizzard-entertainment-privacy-policy">Blizzard's privacy policy</a>, similarly, specifies that "in some very rare, specific and restricted cases, we may ask you to provide a copy partially obfuscated of a document or government-issued ID to verify your identity, location, and/or account ownership to comply with our legal obligations."</p>
<p>Again - and at the risk of being a brow-beating mollycoddler and trying to set you homework - it's worth reading those documents in full if you have anxieties about how the games in question are handling your info.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/former-world-of-warcraft-security-expert-defends-survival-hit-once-humans-unpopular-privacy-policy-fearmongering-on-social-media-is-boring-as-s/">Gamesradar</a>, Jason Thor Hall, a former Blizzard and Amazon developer and nowadays, director of strategy for Offbrand Games, thinks the online reaction to Once Human's privacy policy is "fearmongering". In <a href="https://x.com/PirateSoftware/status/1810952269283868895">a Xitter post on Wednesday</a>, he commented that the policy doesn't actively require you to hand over the personal info given under "Name &amp; Contact details".</p>
<p>"The general internet has warped this into a demanded requirement and a privacy issue," Hall wrote. "It's not. These are only sent to the company when required by applicable local laws. This is why it says 'Receive from you' and 'as required by applicable laws'. In some countries government issued ID's are required for live service game access. If you are not in one of these countries you obviously are not asked or required to present those documents."</p>
<p>My fairly unremarkable tl;dr: I think it is generally a bad thing that video games sponge up so much of our personal data, especially in countries whose governments keep their citizens under tight surveillance. Based on my own reading of the Once Human TOS and the commentary above, I do not think that NetEase in particular are doing anything out of the ordinary here.</p>
<p>While many of the concerns I've read about Once Human's data collection seem sincere and substantial, I think there's a touch of sinophobia to a portion of the angry reactions, and an accompanying dismissal of how much of our private lives we've normalised handing over to nice, safe Western companies like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/">Valve</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy">Epic</a>. It would be useful if the furore over Once Human - which, privacy concerns aside, doesn't sound like a brilliant game - lent momentum to a larger conversation about such things.</p>
