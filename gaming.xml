			<p>The next two free games up for grabs as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store 2025 Mega Sale</a> are <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/tiny-tinas-wonderlands" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/limbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Limbo</a>.</p>
<p>The first game is the 2022 spin-off of the Borderlands series, built as a sequel of sorts to Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, a Borderlands 2 DLC. The premise is completely different and more familiar to fans of tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons: the titular Tiny Tina is the dungeon master of a fictional tabletop RPG called Bunkers &amp; Badasses, and the twist is that she can modify the game world on the fly at her whim.</p>
<p>The game turned out to be quite successful in terms of sales (which exceeded the expectations of publisher Take-Two) and average critic score. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands earned an 8.5/10 score here on Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tiny-tinas-wonderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Rosh Kelly</a>:</p>
<p><em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, with its fantasy setting, tabletop homage, and constant references, takes the world exploration in a different direction. For the first time in the Borderlands IP, players will have an overworld to wander through, complete with side quests and secrets. This travel by map can make the locations feel a bit unconnected, but it also allows for a huge variety of places to delve into. And once you’ve reached your location, you’ll have the full experience you’re used to.</em></p>
<p>The other game gamers can grab for free this week on the Epic Games Store is Limbo, the masterpiece puzzle/platform/horror indie game released in 2010. Limbo was developed by Playdead, a Danish studio also known for 2016's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/inside-review-what/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside</a>. In the game, an unnamed boy roams traps and dangerous environments in the desperate search for his sister. Limbo received multiple awards and accolades, winning the coveted Game of the Year prize at the Game Developers Choice Awards and BAFTA Video Game Awards in 2010.</p>
<p>As usual, both games are available to be permanently added to your Epic Games Store library as long as you grab them before next Thursday at 5 PM.</p>

But this time around, it will feature more characters, new dance moves, and a fresh song. And yes, Eagly fans will get to see the bird shake its tail feathers.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197576" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="PlayStation’s Days of Play Brings Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, NBA 2K25 &amp; More To PS Plus" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="88" data-playlist="197576,197567,197565" data-current="197576"><div><p>PlayStation’s Days of Play Brings Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, NBA 2K25 &amp; More To PS Plus</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197576/197576_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197576/197576_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197576/197576_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23099.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>But first, just to make sure everyone is on the same page, here’s the fantastic musical intro that appeared before every episode of <em>Peacemaker</em> and which I never skipped a single time. How could you skip something as awesome as this? </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/peacemaker-season-2-james-gunn-john-cena-exclusive-11740471&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/peacemaker-season-2-james-gunn-john-cena-exclusive-11740471" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a new interview with <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>,</a></span> DCEU boss and <em>Peacemaker</em> showrunner James Gunn confirmed that the new season, starting in August, will once again feature a musical intro. But it will be completely new, partially because so many people died in season one. </p><p> “We killed everyone in the season,” Gunn told <em>EW</em>. “So we kind of had to [film a new intro]. Everyone died! Also, we have a lot of new cast members — Tim Meadows is Langston Fleury, Sol Rodriguez is Sasha Bordeaux, and Michael Rooker’s in the cast, Judomaster is a bigger character this time — so I knew that I needed to do a new dance.” </p><p>And yes, there will be a new song, though ditching Wig Wam’s infectiously catchy “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/fOdSUtGmxwU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/fOdSUtGmxwU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Do You Wanna Taste It</a></span>?” was a tough decision for Gunn. </p><p> “I really went back and forth an awful lot,” said the showrunner. “And at the end of the day, I decided that we use a new song that’s a little bit more about what the season’s about.” </p><p>And for all you fans of Eagly out there, you’ll get to see the bird try to dance this time around. Gunn told <em>EW </em>that in this new intro, we see Peacemaker’s eagle pet try to “dance for the first time.” </p><p>“He is not the best at it, but he tries to really join in the dance sequence at the end. He’s got a little pose this time,” said Gunn. </p><p>Gunn admits that he’s unsure if the new dance sequence will “one-up” the original featured in season one, but that’s okay because he just wants to make something good that people will like, even if it doesn’t get “4 billion views on TikTok.” </p><p>“[The popularity of the original dancing intro] was a complete surprise, and you just can’t replicate that,” said Gunn. “However, the surprises within the show itself, I think, replicate that many times over, because there are so many more twists and turns in this season with what happens and what you find out about this universe.”</p><p><em>Peacemaker</em> finally returns after nearly three years away on August 21 on HBO Max. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-dead-back-streaming-service-old-name-wb-zaslav-1851780622&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-dead-back-streaming-service-old-name-wb-zaslav-1851780622">Yes, it’s called HBO Max again.</a></span> </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>Nintendo's Switch 2 has a small handful of new releases in its launch lineup, but for the first few months after its release, the main thing you'll be able to play on it will be your existing library of Switch games. And while Nintendo has promised reasonably comprehensive backward compatibility, the company is still working through the process of testing over 15,000 third-party Switch games with the new console.</p>
<p>With a week to go until launch, Nintendo has updated its compatibility support page with the results of nearly two months of extra testing. Of the "over 15,000" third-party Switch games, Nintendo says roughly two-thirds of them either have "no issues" or have problems that will be resolved quickly at or after launch. On the original version of this support page, Nintendo had only performed its basic compatibility testing on roughly 20 percent of all third-party Switch games.</p>
<p>Nintendo says that nearly all of the roughly 5,000 remaining Switch games will launch just fine on the Switch 2 but that "further tests" are "in progress." The support page doesn't say when Nintendo will provide its next update.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also updated PDF documents listing <a href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN_05272025.pdf?_gl=1*1ux5pd1*_gcl_au*NDM5NzMzNjM0LjE3NDY4MTQ5MjU.*_ga*NTkwMzgzMjEwLjE3NDY4MTQ5MjU.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDg1MzUxMTIkbzUkZzAkdDE3NDg1MzU2MzUkajYwJGwwJGgxNjYzMzE0MjY5">individual games that won't launch</a>, games that start up but have <a href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-launchable_compatibility_issues_EN_05272025.pdf?_gl=1*1ux5pd1*_gcl_au*NDM5NzMzNjM0LjE3NDY4MTQ5MjU.*_ga*NTkwMzgzMjEwLjE3NDY4MTQ5MjU.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDg1MzUxMTIkbzUkZzAkdDE3NDg1MzU2MzUkajYwJGwwJGgxNjYzMzE0MjY5">some other kind of compatibility problem</a>, and games with problems that should be "<a href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-issues_to_be_addressed_EN_05272025.pdf?_gl=1*1ux5pd1*_gcl_au*NDM5NzMzNjM0LjE3NDY4MTQ5MjU.*_ga*NTkwMzgzMjEwLjE3NDY4MTQ5MjU.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDg1MzUxMTIkbzUkZzAkdDE3NDg1MzU2MzUkajYwJGwwJGgxNjYzMzE0MjY5">addressed by launch or shortly after</a>."</p>
<p>Nearly all of the 122 first-party Nintendo games will run fine on the Switch 2, with the only exceptions being the Nintendo Labo cardboard kits that were made with the physical dimensions of the original Switch in mind. Additionally, some games that use features of the original Switch Joy-Cons will only work if you pair an external Joy-Con with the Switch 2.</p>

Sapienza--the quaint Italian coastal town from the 2016 Hitman game--is currently being given away as part of the free-to-play Hitman: World of Assassination starter pack. Normally, this edition of the game only gives you a barebones experience with the ICA training missions--and Sapienza on its own is a $10 purchase--but for the low price of absolutely nothing, it can be yours if you claim it before <strong>9 AM PT / 1 PM ET on May 30</strong>.</p><p>Even after nine years, Sapienza is still regarded as one of the all-time best Hitman maps. It has everything you could ask for, from beautiful architecture to secret underground labs, and there are multiple ways to take care of the targets in this map. These range from booting scientist Silvio Caruso off of a cliffside after you feed him tainted spaghetti to disguising yourself as his therapist and smothering him to death with a pillow.</p><p>As mentioned above, you're only getting Sapienza and the ICA missions in this download. Hitman: World of Assassination has a confusing pricing model, as there are currently <em>five </em>different editions of the game to purchase with varying levels of content spread across them. World of Assassination is a compilation of Hitman 1-3, the soft reboot of the game series that began in 2016.</p><p>While the first Hitman game saw each stage released via an episodic model, Hitman 2 and 3 were full releases following IO Interactive's departure from Square Enix. Each sequel introduced several improvements and new ideas to the formula established in Hitman 2016, and they were also retroactively incorporated into the older games.</p><p>Developer IO Interactive is also working on a James Bond video game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-project-007-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/">which currently has the working title of Project 007</a>. The studio is aiming to craft an original take on the world-famous super-spy, and the game was first announced in November 2020, and one of the confirmed platforms for it is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>

What do you think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/islands-and-trains">Islands &amp; Trains</a> is about? I'm not going to give you long, because it really is just right there in the name. As you've presumably already guessed, it is a quaint-looking sandbox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> where you make tiny diorama-like islands, adorning them with tracks for trains to choo-choo along. I told you, it's a name that does what it says on the tin, and if it appeals to you at all, well, there's some good news, as it just came out today.

<p>
Islands &amp; Trains for the most part looks like one of those kind of build-your-own screensaver type of games, without the screen saving part. Developer Akos Makovics specifically cited games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/islanders">Islanders</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/townscaper">Townscaper</a> as influences, all titles with a focus on making peaceful places to look at with a hopeful sense of ease. So, if they're up your alley, this one probably will be too.

There's apparently over 400 types of tiles to play around with, lots of variations amongst those too, and you'll notice animals like cows and ducks flocking in as you build up your city. I'm not typically a sandbox builder kind of person myself, and yet looking at it I can't help but harken back to my own childhood playing with my dad's model railway. 
</p>
<p>
He wasn't the kind of model train enthusiast that had all the extremities like sets and tiny trees, so imagination was key to building up a picture. Islands &amp; Trains looks like a nice opportunity to express that childlike sense of train-oriented curiosity. You can pick it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1957760/Islands__Trains/">Steam</a> right now if it takes your fancy.

But the big news is that the Switch App will now let you upload screenshots and videos from the Switch 2 directly to your phone without needing to use a QR code. You can even set the Switch 2 to automatically upload up to 100 screenshots and videos to the app. These will remain available to download from your phone for 30 days. Even better, this new feature is available for free, no paid Switch Online membership is needed. However, this new option is only available on the Switch 2. </p><p>Some other great changes include the ability to add friends via the app itself, and the ability to receive notifications on your phone when your friends log on.</p><p>A lot of these features are things that have existed in Sony and Microsoft’s apps and consoles for years now, so it does feel like Nintendo is finally catching up. Still, it’s nice that the Switch app on phones will feel more modern and be far more useful. As someone who never shared a screenshot from my Switch to my phone, I was gobsmacked that you had to use a QR code and transfer it over wifi.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-gets-review-bombed-again-this-time-over-its-big-battle-for-super-earth<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The battle for Super Earth is raging on in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>, as players fight to hold back the invading Illuminate fleet. A new controversy surrounding the invasion, though, has led to some frustration and a fresh flood of negative reviews.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To set the stage, the latest update for Helldivers 2 — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-finally-brings-the-illuminate-invasion-to-the-streets-of-super-earth">Heart of Democracy </a>— brought months and months of storyline building to fruition. The Meridian Singularity, a black hole formed during an operation against Terminids, had been flung towards Super Earth as the tip of the spear for an Illuminate invasion. The "Great Host" fleet flooded through the now-wormhole and onto Super Earth, turning the planet into a battlefield.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the days since the update went live, players have fought to hold the various Mega Cities of Super Earth, which correspond to major cities in real-life. York Supreme, for example, corresponds roughly to New York, and Remembrance to Buenos Aires. As the invasion has continued, more and more cities have fallen; as of this writing, only Equality-On-Sea (Shanghai) and Super Earth's capital, Prosperity City (Stockholm) remain standing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the invasion has approached what feels like endgame, a <em>lot </em>has happened. Helldivers players tend to "get into character" and play up the Major Orders, rallying behind different causes and calls to try and beat each new challenge that developer Arrowhead lobs at them. Some, for example, stopped playing matches on Super Earth to contribute to a new effort in another sector against the Automaton forces, which ultimately brought the DSS — a massive military orbital space station — <a href="https://x.com/Helldivers_NOW/status/1927759821836538125" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back to Super Earth</a> to assist with the defensive efforts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Illuminate gaining ground and taking Mega Cities, efforts rallied behind Equality-On-Sea to make a last stand. Amid all this, there was a sense of comradery extended across nations; as more players dropped in to raise Equality-On-Sea's percentage and hold it against the Great Host, memes and support flooded in. Even as the Illuminate focused efforts on the city, players held out and kept diving.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's all been fairly heartwarming and exciting stuff, the sort of emergent story that Helldivers 2 is quite capable of forging in its greatest moments; where developer storylines, player investment, and community efforts result in some really brilliant moments of cooperative war theater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Equality-On-Sea never hit 100%. From here, the situation gets a little more complex, and a lot rougher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While players made a concerted effort to hold Equality-On-Sea against the continued onslaught, the current arc closed with the cities' percentage meter at 99.9783% (keep that number in mind). Most Major Orders and operations in Helldivers are about completion, a binary success-or-failure state. As some have pointed out, though, there might have been confusion about what the percentage meter meant in the defense of Super Earth. Rather than "liberating" a city and re-taking it, players are holding it. So it stands to reason that Helldivers might not be able to "100%" the defense, because the Illuminate are continuing to invade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, alongside theories that the war is narrowing down to an ultimate showdown in Super Earth's capital of Prosperity City, seems to be the main driver behind a new influx of negative reviews on Steam. As of this writing, roughly 2,312 negative reviews of Helldivers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have been submitted to Steam</a> in the last 24 hours compared to 324 positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the negative reviews are in Chinese, and while the machine translation doesn't seem accurate enough to quote, there are some recurring points one can easily glean: frustration over driving the narrative, the perception of a thumb on the scale from Arrowhead, and repeat mentions of "99.9783%."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Helldivers NOW (@Helldivers_NOW) <a href="https://twitter.com/Helldivers_NOW/status/1928075624414920862?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, it's important to keep this all in context. Yes, there is a fresh round of negative reviews on the game, and it's obviously a larger amount than the average trickle of reviews. It also still, at this moment, pales in comparison to the more-infamous review-bombing of Helldivers 2 from May 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-ceo-apologizes-amid-helldivers-2-review-bombing">where thousands upon thousands of negative reviews flooded in over PSN requirements</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are, broadly, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ky6fp6/can_we_not_reviewbomb_the_game_because_were/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">understandably</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ky8p1o/we_cant_ever_have_anything_nice/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frustrated</a>. This should be a peak in Helldivers 2 history, as both the culmination of a long-running storyline and one of the cooler in-game moments Arrowhead has concocted. I've spent some time diving on Super Earth, and it's really an incredible feat. Arrowhead has nailed the feeling of holding out in these Mega Cities as massive, terrifying Illuminate forces rampage through, causing wanton destruction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And because so much of this is all tied into national identity, the previous sense of international comradery has been tainted a bit too. Even as players, mods, and fan accounts have <a href="https://x.com/Helldivers_NOW/status/1928044854225031493" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">urged players</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ky7jdu/comment/muw298u/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not get caught up</a> in the controversy, it has put a tinge of a bad taste on this otherwise incredible moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of this writing, Helldivers are still holding out across the Mega Cities of Equality-On-Sea and Prosperity City, with the former holding the higher percentage. It looks like the battle for Super Earth is entering its final phase, and the current order is simple: Hold Super Earth. Hopefully players can still hold out, seize victory, and celebrate the good in all this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Developer FuturLab has released the final free content update for PowerWash Simulator as the team shifts all its focus to PowerWash Simulator 2.</p>
<p>PowerWash Simulator was released in early access in 2021, and shortly after leaving early access, it reached more than <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/powerwash-simulator-has-topped-3-million-players">3 million players</a>. Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/news/thank-you-for-17-million-powerwash-simulator-players">studio announced</a> that the game had reached more than 17 million players through game sales and its inclusion on services like PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>The game has featured multiple free and paid updates in the last four years, collaborating with major series like Shrek, Spongebob Squarepants, Wallace &amp; Gromit, and more. The last free update for the game, titled 'The Muckingham Files 6', is now available on all platforms, and adds two more jobs and locations for players to clean up.</p>

<p>"<em><span>Whether you’ve been busting the grime with us from early access, or hopped aboard the PowerWash hype train somewhere down the line, we’d love to say a huge thank you for enjoying this adventure with</span></em><span> us,</span>" FuturLab <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/news/all-aboard-the-muckingham-files-6-has-arrived-for-powerwash-simulator-s-last-stop">writes in a blog post.</a></p>
<p>"<em><span>PowerWash Simulator has truly transformed FuturLab - it's helped us grow our team, evolve as a studio, and take on exciting new challenges. We’re endlessly grateful to every single player who’s supported our satisfying, sudsy adventure. You’ve made all of this possible. </span></em><span><em>And we’re not done yet! PowerWash Simulator 2 is bubbling away and will release later in 2025. With a bunch of brilliant new gnomes joining the FuturLab family, we’ve been able to level up the experience with fresh new and improved ways to play and spray in the sequel. We can’t wait to show you what’s next!</em>" </span></p>
<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and potentially Nintendo Switch 2, when it launches sometime later this year.</p>

            <p>A modder is asking for help resurrecting Borderlands Online, an MMO version of Gearbox's comedy gun-runner that only ever saw daylight in China. It was announced in 2014 and shut down in 2015 alongside development studio 2K China, but footage of the abandoned project appeared online earlier this year. Now, intrepid digital archaeologist EpicNNG is trying to overcome "thousands of errors" and restore the MMO to a playable state.</p><!--more-->
<p>You can hear about these mighty ventures in the latest update video, below. The build EpicNNG is working with "has been publicly available for the past 10 years", but was only recently discovered by another modder, Lewis, with the cautionary note that "a lot of the downloads were riddled with viruses". They've now confirmed that "we have got the full game" and "can get in eventually, it is just a matter of when".</p>

<p>That's providing, however, other people pitch in, and EpicNNG is concerned that Take-Two Interactive, 2K Games or Gearbox might block the project ahead of the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>. "God forbid that happens here, and this gets shut down, and I receive a cease and desist because we're taking away from the marketing of Borderlands 4," the video frets. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, we covered a Stop Killing Games survey which held that around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/70-of-games-with-online-requirements-are-doomed-according-to-stop-killing-games-survey">70% of games with online requirements are doomed</a>. Here's hoping this one returns from the abyss. It's the first I've heard of the Borderlands MMO, and while I've fallen off the series, I'm curious to see how the developers at 2K China reworked the fittings.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-gets-an-earlier-release-date-as-accidentally-revealed-by-randy-pitchford">launches on 12th September</a>. Gearbox frontman Randy Pitchford has recently been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/randy-pitchford-shows-hes-capable-of-not-being-an-idiot-about-borderlands-4-prices-raising-questions-about-previous-insistence-on-being-an-idiot">saying daft things about it</a>. He does so love doing that.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-twitch-emote-artists-are-tackling-the-rise-of-ai-art.1201767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/twitch-emote-artists-ai<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Twitch emotes are, essentially, the language of the Amazon-owned streaming platform. It’s become customary for streamers to provide unique emotes for their communities to use in chat, so much so that a secondary economy has been built up around Twitch. For years, Twitch emotes (and other stream art) has been a space for artists to make money from their work. Emote artists were in high demand during the pandemic, when more people took to Twitch; demand has slowed since then, but there’s something else threatening artists: the proliferation of AI art.</p><p>Generative AI art tools scrape publicly available art — be it illustrations or photos — to create images. That’s art theft, <a href="https://www.zhangjingna.com/blog/class-action-lawsuit-artists-v-stability-deviantart-midjourney-runway-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to a group of artists suing AI companies like Stability AI, Midjourney, and others</a>. (Don’t forget <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the catastrophic environmental impact of AI, </a>too.) Twitch has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1h8me3p/twitchs_new_holiday_global_emote_is_ai_generated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused recently</a> of introducing AI-made global emote and category banners. While the emote hasn’t been confirmed as AI, some of the category banners are: You can find the images used on Adobe’s stock image page, where at least one, of a Corgi on a treadmill, <a href="https://stock.adobe.com/search?filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aphoto%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aillustration%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Azip_vector%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Avideo%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Atemplate%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3A3d%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aimage%5D=1&amp;k=corgi+on+treadmill&amp;order=relevance&amp;search_page=1&amp;search_type=usertyped&amp;acp=&amp;aco=corgi+on+treadmill&amp;get_facets=0&amp;asset_id=926933857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is most definitely AI</a>. Twitch has not responded to Aftermath’s request for comment.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Really glad the Fitness and Health category image was changed to an AI generated dog running on a backwards treadmill from Adobe Stock photos. Incredible move from Twitch. Very impressed. <a href="https://t.co/NR0WfQZy1J">pic.twitter.com/NR0WfQZy1J</a></p>— Pirate Software (@PirateSoftware) <a href="https://twitter.com/PirateSoftware/status/1924921642398220661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>The impact of AI on Twitch emote artists varies: some emote artists Aftermath spoke to said their communities value art, and that they haven’t seen a major impact. Others, <a href="https://x.com/Laghardra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like French artist Laghardra</a>, say their business is struggling. Laghardra said they have created more than 2,000 emotes for hundreds of different streamers, but that AI-generated art has slowed their business. “Unfortunately, over the past year, AI-generated emotes have flooded Twitch and sales platforms like Etsy and Ko-Fi,” they said. “You can now find packs of 50 emotes for less than €10, whereas the average price per emote from an artist is typically €15–18.”</p><p>Laghardra continued, “The offer is very appealing, and we simply can't compete. That's why, after six years in this profession, I can no longer make a living from it. My revenue has dropped significantly, and some of my former clients are now creating their own AI-generated emotes — even using mine as inspiration.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://x.com/PlurpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plurp</a>, another emote and YouTube thumbnail artist, said there has been a decrease in demand for emotes, but attributes it to the post-pandemic decrease of streaming in general, as well as an increase of bots on Twitter offering art and pushing out actual artists. Twitter has been a space for artists to connect with potential buyers, but Jay, <a href="https://x.com/jootics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an emote artist</a>, told Aftermath that AI has likely made these bot-based scammers' job much easier. "[Bots] are what make [an] artist's life hell," Jay said.</p><p>Several emote artists, <a href="https://vgen.co/NanaFromHell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including Nana Jiei</a>, said the VTubing community is propping up their businesses. “VTubers mainly do not support AI-generated images and I am very happy and thankful about that,” Jiei said. “My client-base is very keen when it comes to full customization of their emotes and would want them specifically tailor-made for them and their brands.” Still, Jiei is worried about Twitch emotes and art outside the VTubing community; people want “cheaper and fast mass-produced emotes done via the use of AI.”</p><p>Taya, an artist who works largely with VTubers, agreed: "The people that are using AI art were never my customers to begin with," she said. Taya said it's not even really about the money — her rates are so low that she's "undervaluing her time" to ensure people can have art. "These people have never had the care to support small artist[s] and give jobs to real people for their art because they don’t have the same level of passion as the people who do art and pay for art," Taya said.</p><p>Artists — and people committed to human artwork — are turning to marketplaces like <a href="https://vgen.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VGen</a>, an art marketplace tailored specifically toward VTubers and streamers looking to commission art. The platform is specifically for human-made art; no generative AI is allowed on the platform. Artists are able to promote their work to people who value human-made art, and streamers can ensure they’re not getting something generated by AI — a little piece of art that can set a stream apart.</p><p>And if people are still turning elsewhere after being educated on AI use, some artists said a little shaming doesn't hurt. "I’d say that if you use AI emotes, the [artist] community will degrade you which will, in turn, push you to commission a real artist," <a href="https://x.com/artdragonz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an emote artist named Kat said</a>. Other artists emphasized this point, too, especially in the VTuber space.</p><p>“Emotes have real power and reach,” Lagharda said. “Tomorrow, you could gain 10 more viewers just because someone used a cool emote in another person’s chat. It’s amazing that such a small, complex piece of artwork can create that kind of effect.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs"><h3>Another Day, Another Round Of Layoffs At EA</h3></a><p>Black Panther is canceled, and workers (once again) suffer the consequences</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ushimitsu-gao-beastars"><h3>Ushimitsu Gao Is A Ghost Cuckold Romance Manga For Folks Who Defend Beastars (Me)</h3></a><p>Paru Itagaki let her freak flag fly with Beastars.

            <p>
Day one patches are the curse that comes with the modern age of video games because development doesn't end at the point of printing the discs we play them on any more. It sucks, it's bad for preservation, but we're stuck with them. However, it's also a bit funny that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, due out tomorrow, May 30th, sort of has a <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-101?">day minus one patch that's already available</a>. Of course, unless you're a journalist, YouTuber, or very friendly with your local video game store clerk who hooked you up with an early copy of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a>, this won't concern you for a good few hours yet.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The patch notes are also just incredibly useless. Here's the full list of them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved handling of playable characters</li>
<li>Soundtrack addition and adjustments</li>
<li>Text adjustments</li>
<li>Balance adjustments</li>
<li>Added character scenarios</li>
<li>Bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<p>
To be fair, the only one that might be of any interest to you or I are those new character scenarios, and the fun part about a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> game is discovering those sorts of things for yourself. Or, you know, watching a YouTube video explaining the lore to you because you're an adult with a soul crushing job and you don't have time to play and think about the games you're playing.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there's something more important that's related to Nightreign I want to draw your attention to: a trailer that genuinely, no word of a life, features Evanescence's Bring Me to Life. There is not a single part of my soul that understands how this could have come about, I'm just going to thank the universe that we're moving past considering the 2000s a time solely full of cringe.

They started only a couple of years ago and will be hitting their 100th episode, they tell me, after Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest this year. How did these guys get a Switch 2 before almost anyone else?</p><p>The answer is both simple and complex, they explain. It begins with Volkov seeing a friend post in a random Telegram group about securing a Switch 2 order that was scheduled to arrive the Monday before the official June 5 launch. When Volkov inquired about the details, the acquaintance gave him the name of a seller who had a handful of Switch 2 units coming in on a plane from Dubai. </p><figure id="" data-id="e1ea6281a6ec219f7efaf6999d2cb6c8" data-recommend-id="image://e1ea6281a6ec219f7efaf6999d2cb6c8" data-format="png" data-width="1036" data-height="569" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man looks at a Switch 2 screen.

I will have some in on Monday.”</p><p>Then the guy pinged Volkov back 10 minutes later. He actually had a guy with an extra Switch 2 on a flight that would be arriving much sooner. Would Volkov be interested? They settled on a price: roughly $800. Volkov conferred with his podcast mates before accepting. “I couldn’t believe I [was] really going to get the Switch 2 nine days before release, first in the world, that we’ll unpack it, unbox it,” he said. “Until I saw the box, until I touched it with my hands, I couldn’t believe that it’s real.”</p><p> Volkov immediately <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-menu-settings-firmware-day-one-patch-1851782656&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-menu-settings-firmware-day-one-patch-1851782656">started making videos</a></span>, which quickly disseminated throughout <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1kxeux6/nintendo_switch_2_leaked_first_boot/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1kxeux6/nintendo_switch_2_leaked_first_boot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a ravenous Nintendo fandom</a></span> on social media.

Podcast cohosts Malykhin and Kolomiets point to the use of Indian and Turkish PSN accounts, prepaid cards from overseas, and even bank accounts set up in neighboring Kazakhstan as ways to bypass the various restrictions. HBO Max isn’t available in Russia, but they’re caught up on <em>The Last of Us</em> thanks to VPNs (season 1 was great but season 2 has had more ups and downs, they say).</p><p>Unlike some leakers, Volkov hasn’t tried to anonymize his identity. In fact, his face is the first thing that appears in the group’s initial pre-release Switch 2 unboxing, the YouTube comments for which were littered with people joking about “Nintendo Ninjas” being dispatched to disappear Volkov and the channel. “I thought about it first, like, ‘Whoa, what if they’re gonna, like, ban my Switch account?’” he said. He’s not planning on logging into the console with his existing account until June 5.</p><p> I mentioned the new provision that lets Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-piracy-brick-threat-homebrew-1851779895&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-piracy-brick-threat-homebrew-1851779895">brick anyone’s Switch 2 if they violate the company’s terms of service</a></span>. He didn’t seem worried. “I didn’t sign any NDAs. I bought this with my money. I bought, it I didn’t steal it or something like that. Also, Nintendo is from Japan, you know, and they don’t have any official shops in Russia anymore. They don’t have a jurisdiction in Russia.”</p><p>That’s no doubt part of why he ended up purchasing one for almost twice the sticker price from a guy on Telegram instead of at a store like he did with his original Nintendo Switch. The other, of course, was internet clout in a gaming culture that prizes being first more than most things, though Volkov, Malykhin, and Kolomiets claim the goal wasn’t to troll anyone. “It’s not like we want to show that, ‘Oh, we got a Switch 2, you didn’t get a Switch 2,” Volkov said. “No, we just want to show you, like, some content and show that even in Russia, we have a lot of sanctions, you know, a lot of big companies banned us, yeah, yeah, but we want to show all the world that Russia also has, like, just some guys that just want to play video games.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Real, lived experiences are some of the strongest influences in art.</p><p dir="ltr">It's AAPI Heritage Month--an annual reminder that Asian and Pacific Islander influences are worth celebrating. AAPI doesn't just include East Asian cultures like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, but a wide range of racial and ethnic groups including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-games-are-lagging-behind-in-south-asian-representation/1100-6503195/">South Asian</a> and Native Hawaiian. As a Filipino-American, I also fall under the AAPI umbrella.</p><p dir="ltr">While the term helps rally support and advocacy behind a large chunk of racial and ethnic groups, it can be difficult to define because of that broadness. Those who identify as AAPI often have the perspective of growing up abroad and either coming from a different country or being born to immigrant parents. That opens the door to a unique experience full of its own pros and cons, not quite fitting in with the people from your ethnic group but also not quite fitting in with the foreign culture your family is trying to assimilate into.</p><p dir="ltr">It's an experience that isn't easy to explain in just a few words, though some games manage to get the message across in impactful, meaningful ways. In the past few years, we've enjoyed games from AAPI developers such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/venba-review-tourist-to-your-own-culture/1900-6418096/">Venba</a>, 1000xResist, and Butterfly Soup--and those are just the start. Some of these games have AAPI developers directly at the helm and even sometimes feature stories about first- and second-generation AAPI characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of that, games like A Space From The Unbound from Indonesia and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-until-then-showcases-the-beauty-of-filipino-culture/1100-6523531/">Until Then</a> from the Philippines are helping to round out East Asian-heavy representation of the cultures underneath the AAPI umbrella, even if they aren't created by Asians overseas. Both types of games give us powerful narratives to relate to and prove how even those who can't personally relate to AAPI heritage can appreciate other cultures and the depth they bring to a story.</p><p dir="ltr">To celebrate AAPI month, GameSpot gathered thoughts from AAPI developers and professionals in the gaming industry about what AAPI month means to them and how their identity has shaped their work:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503389-1000-resist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503389" data-ratio="0.56217162872154" data-width="1713" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503389-1000-resist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503389"></a><figcaption>1000xResist</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503389-1000-resist.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Our whole mission with 1000xRESIST was to see ourselves, and Asian diasporic stories, in-game and on screen, portrayed with dignity. To realize our desire for these stories to be told in ambitious and experimental ways, that held space for dreaming, yearning, and searching. Our identity and lived experiences are such a huge part of the work we make, and we try to lean into the specific as much as possible. This month really reminds me of the kinds of sacrifices the previous generation made, under hostility and discrimination. I don't want to take that for granted, and I want to fight to continue to tell these stories, especially with and for other AAPI creators." -- <strong>Remy Sin, Creative Director of 1000xResist</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"AAPI Month has, in the past, left me feeling a bit complicated as someone who is half Korean and--especially growing up--was unsure how I fit into the celebrations as someone 'in-between.' The ways that games have typically interpreted and portrayed 'Asians' as a monolith honestly didn't help much either. What has helped is media--by AAPI developers--that's highlighted the variations, range, and richness of the Asian-American experience. As cheesy as it sounds, games (like <a href="https://emmkid.itch.io/half" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Half</a>, 1000xRESIST, Venba, Butterfly Soup 2) have helped me explore my bi-racial, second-generation identity, and I hope we continue to see more." -- <strong>Jenny Windom, Communications Director, Ivy Road; Co-Owner, Soft Not Weak; Organizer/Host, Wholesome Games</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"Truth be told, AAPI month always felt like a tricky one. You see, most of my life, it always felt like being of Indian descent didn't qualify as 'Asian.' Which is utterly ridiculous because the country is literally in Asia! But even more importantly: 'Asian' celebrations and media usually didn't include people of darker skin tones. I was different but not the 'right kind' of different. The stereotypes and racist remarks that my community was subject to were of violence and filth. On a positive note, though, I do think that diversity culture is slowly changing. I am seeing more people who look like me, with actual personalities, being portrayed on screen. Hey, I even got to write my thoughts for AAPI month on GameSpot, ha!" -- <strong>Neha Patel, Composer/Sound Designer</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"There is so much to AAPI heritage, but at the end of the day I'm grateful for the sense of camaraderie and joy we can find in each other. Everything I do now is influenced by the support I was surrounded by in my culture. And as we continue to tell our stories, I hope we see more variety in AAPI developers, aesthetics, and themes." -- <strong>Victoria Tran, Communications Director at Innersloth</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503393-butterfly-soup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503393" data-ratio="0.56222547584187" data-width="1366" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503393-butterfly-soup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503393"></a><figcaption>Butterfly Soup</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503393-butterfly-soup.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Every project I've worked on contains a small reflection of my Filipino-American identity in hopes that those who interact with it may see a piece of themselves in it, too. Representation is endlessly impactful, especially in an immersive medium like video games. It welcomes more people to feel a sense of belonging, allowing our imagined worlds to reflect the diverse one we live in today. AAPI Heritage Month is always a lovely reminder of how much pride we all have in our unique cultures and how important it is to celebrate and embrace it within our industry!" -- <strong>Belinda Garcia-Maguid, Game Writer and Narrative Designer at Crystal Dynamics</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"Three years ago, I met an Asian-American narrative designer for the first time and realized I could also become one. Meeting her broke an imaginary boundary I didn't know I drew between my creative and professional identities, and I remember asking her what it was like being the only AAPI writer on her team. She just shrugged, and said when I joined the industry, there'd be at least two of us. Now, as an early career developer, I'm reminded how representation demonstrates to aspiring AAPI developers that they have a place in games to exist and thrive. Even as the industry struggles, I'm still excited for the day when I can say: 'Well, there's at least three of us.'" -- <strong>Anne Zhang-Huang, Associate Narrative Designer at Zenimax Online Studios</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"My game is set in Ontario in 1914, and I knew that I would be including a Japanese-Canadian character to honour my family heritage. The first wave of Japanese immigrants to Canada started around 1877. My grandmother on my father's side was born in Vancouver in 1912. Representation in our media is so important because historically this representation hasn't been common--d – Despite the fact that diverse populations were and are the reality, more often than not." -- <strong>Julia Minamata, Solo Indie Game Developer of The Crimson Diamond</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"The rising tide of AAPI representation lately fills me with so much pride. In Everything Everywhere All At Once, I saw my mother: from her sensible shoes and puffer vest to her toiling in a mom-and-pop laundromat. In the rise of K-pop, I see people who look like me held up as aspirational figures, influencing generations worldwide in the way they look and dress. I didn't have this growing up, though being born and raised in Los Angeles meant that I never felt like a minority (even though I was, in a numerical sense). In my own work, I'm proud to express my diverse viewpoints with my love of character and emotional conflicts; things that don't scream 'the Asian experience' at the forefront, and yet are made up of references from how I grew up and the traits I value. I love AAPI Heritage Month as a beautiful celebration to highlight all the different voices that make our worlds, both real and fictional, all the more interesting." -- <strong>Karrie Shao, Lead Narrative Designer &amp; Lead Writer of Pacific Drive</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503394-pacific-drive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503394" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503394-pacific-drive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503394"></a><figcaption>Pacific Drive</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503394-pacific-drive.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I've lived in the US as a US citizen for 85% of my life and I'm still wondering how long I have to live here to be accepted as an American. As a kid, I assumed things would get better as time went on and never did I think back then attitudes would start going backwards. It's true, if we look back at where racial acceptance was 50 or a 100 years ago, things have gotten better but in my life and where we are, it certainly doesn't feel that way. I see some changes and want a bright future for my teen sons as they navigate their way to adulthood but at the same time I worry. That worry might be just how every parent is with generational divides and the idea of loss and the idea that we won't be around to see our kids' story play out fully into their lives.</p><p dir="ltr">"What I like for them to remember is that their differences in their mixed Asian heritage is what makes them unique and instead of shying away from it like I did as a new immigrant kid learning English for the first time., I want them to own it and be proud of it. It's easier said than done but I have hope. The reason we still (for now) recognize AAPI and other non-dominant cultures is because it's important to understand that the US is a land of diversity and a land of immigrants. People in power tend to forget that this country was not theirs but it was taken by bloody conflict and by force. Dominant culture likes to simplify and establish a very narrow set of rules of what it means to be an American but we know it's more nuanced than that. It's why stories and sharing experiences are important and why we and our studio focuses on games about underrepresented cultures and themes. I'm hopeful, cautiously hopeful and I know I've got to do my part in creating interesting experiences to keep pushing the idea of the variety of people that make up this country." -- <strong>Chandana Ekanayake, Creative Director at Outerloop Games</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"We've made a lot of strides in representation when it comes to video games. Institutions may not be there yet, but I do believe players are! The love and support our game has gotten stands as testament to that. However, video games are a truly global medium. Too often, discussion of representation is limited to works from the diaspora in the West. I would like to see the industry as a whole make more of an effort to pay attention to and support works from underrepresented regions, too. There is a growing game development scene in South Asia that I'm personally very excited about, and I would love all inclusion efforts to reach farther than the Western-centric approach we default to." -- <strong>Abhi, Creative Director and Founder of Visai Games</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503391-venba.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503391" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503391-venba.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503391"></a><figcaption>Venba</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503391-venba.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month is a time of reflection of our immigrant histories, arts, and the unevenly experienced socioeconomic and civic participation. Although there have been brilliant titles in recent years that highlight the unique challenges faced by the Asian diaspora, we devs have more work ahead of us to highlight that Asian experiences aren't interchangeable and monolithic to both the industry and the public. Just as the census has increased ethnic origin specificity (such as including Hong Kong in the 2021 Canadian census), games deserve representation that reflects the complexity of our cultural and civic preoccupations." -- <strong>Tanya Kan, Executive Producer and Director at Vivid Foundry</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"There was a time I provided cultural consultation on a past title. I remember being shown concept art for the villain who was supposed to be an older man. In one of the iterations, he was wearing a taqiyah, which is a prayer cap worn by men in many different countries around the world who follow Islam. I expressed concern over that specific choice because it belongs to a group of minorities who are rarely represented to begin with. I felt having a practicing Muslim man portrayed as the 'bad guy' could send the wrong message and be seen as disrespectful to those who follow Islam. The artist thanked me for the insight and went in a different direction as a result. While there is a wealth of knowledge that we can find online, there is nothing that beats lived experience when it comes to cultural nuances and making sure all minorities are represented correctly and respectfully." -- <strong>Neha Nair, Campaign Marketing Manager at The New Blank</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"Games inspire. They inspire players to face challenges creatively; to explore endlessly; to see themselves in unexpected reflections. They inspire gamemakers to design for different minds; to imagine bigger, bolder worlds; to respect the audience's most valuable resource of time. For players and developers both, diversity makes the material for inspiration richer. It widens the pool of perspectives to draw from in making games, and broadens the invitation of play to people across all markers of identity.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's the big philosophy, and in practice, my identity has affected my work in treasured ways. It's connected me to fellow devs and players, with precious moments of Pinoy and LGBT pride. It's empowered me to be unafraid in drawing from my own background in what I create. But most importantly, it's made me a stronger, more empathetic, more open-minded observer and listener, who readily welcomes inspiration from others and hopefully inspires others in turn. Happy AAPI Heritage Month and Pride Month! Isang Bagsak!" -- <strong>Isa Mari De Leon, Narrative Writer at Riot Games</strong></p>

            <p>
The end is nigh for developer FuturLab's endlessly hypnotic original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>, but before the studio packs away its nozzles in anticipation of an upcoming sequel, there's one last free update featuring a couple more spaces in which to unleash your hose.
</p>
<p>
"The time has come to reach our final destination for PowerWash Simulator," FuturLab <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/news/all-aboard-the-muckingham-files-6-has-arrived-for-powerwash-simulator-s-last-stop">wrote in an update on its website,</a> "and what a journey it has been!... Whether you've been with us busting the grime from early access, or hopped aboard the PowerWash hype train somewhere down the line, we'd love to say a huge thank you for enjoying this adventure with us."
</p>
<p>
And as a final farewell to the original game, FuturLab has released Muckingham Files 6, which features two more locations in desperate need of a clean. The first will be immediately familiar to old hands, taking players down into the Muckingham subway station for one last spray. However, rather than demanding a repeat of the harrowing tunnel clean-up job featured in the base game, this time you'll be aiming your nozzle at an extremely grubby train that's pulled into the station, washing away the grime from its outers and innards.

<p>
After that, there's one last stop in the form of Sculpture Park, where players will be working at the behest of Darcy d'Arcy to restore the area's collection of "fine" art - including a large Monolith and The Man of A Thousand Faces - to its former glory. And, of course, there's a giant gnome, because what sort of send off would it be without one?
</p>
<p>
"We hope you enjoy this final PowerWash Simulator update as much as we have enjoyed creating it," FuturLab concluded in its update. "The team have poured their hearts and souls into creating a world for you all to escape to and clean, somewhere for you to relax and solo clean, or a place to gather with friends and catch up over a satisfying wash." 
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator's free Muckingham Files 6 update - which follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/have-another-peek-at-powerwash-simulator-2-then-hose-down-an-ice-cream-parlour-in-the-original">April's inclusion of Muckingham's Dessert Parlour</a> for a cleaning - is available now on all platforms, and FutureLab has taken the opportunity to squeeze in a couple more bug fixes, as detailed in its <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/news/all-aboard-the-muckingham-files-6-has-arrived-for-powerwash-simulator-s-last-stop">patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Next up, of course, is PowerWash Simulator 2, which is currently expected to launch for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-2-announced-and-its-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">possibly Switch 2</a> later this year. It promises new jobs, new dirt to blast, and a new hub-like HQ. And if you're a fan of PowerWash Simulator's ridiculous narrative, don't fret - FuturLab has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-powerwash-simulator-2-is-bringing-back-the-ludicrous-brilliant-lore">also confirmed plenty more Muckingham lore</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-developer-warns-users-using-latest-graphics-cards-may-experience-frame-rate-drops/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign may not run well at launch on the "latest GPUs", forcing users to reduce graphics settings or resolution to avoid experiencing frame rate drops.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's release on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, Bandai Namco and FromSoftware shared the patch notes for the day one update, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-101?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=ER-NIGHTREIGN-Patch101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update 1.01</a>, which improves the handling of playable characters, adjusts the soundtrack, text and balance, adds character scenarios and addresses some unspecified bugs. Accompanying the official patch notes is a warning for PC users that PC configurations using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops. This issue is under investigation, but anyone experiencing a significant drop is advised to turn down graphics settings from the default High to Medium or Low, or lower the game's resolution.</p>
<p>While it is not specified which new graphics cards currently have trouble running the game properly, it's very likely the Elden Ring Nightreign developer was talking about the NVIDIA RTX 50 series cards, as during my over 30 hours with Elden Ring Nightreign, I did not experience any significant performance issue on an RTX 4080. As such, if you own one of these new GPUs, it may be a good idea to hold off getting the game until the issues have been fixed.</p>
<p>Performance issues on new GPUs and some glaring oversights, such as the lack of cross-platform play, Elden Ring Nightreign is an incredibly engaging experience that masterfully twists the typical Souls series formula to provide a fast-paced co-op experience that is hard to put down. You can learn more about this engaging experience with my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">review.</a></p>

            <p>
I was 20 minutes into the demo before I realised that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/becoming-saint">Becoming Saint</a> is that most terrible of things, <em>another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a></em>, but that's OK, because by then I'd been burned at the stake for heresy after failing to convert the homely town of Spoleto. The presiding Inquisitor very kindly let me off 100 years of purgatory because I'd mostly rebelled against the Emperor, not the Pope. But then he slapped on 68 years for "minor sins". 
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure which sins. Possibly my being a bit parsimonious with the bread rations on the road to Spoleto? Possibly my favouring the company of a majestic wolf, "strong as he is beautiful"? Regardless, the happy ending here is that after 968 years in purgatory, I was eventually canonised as a Saint in the year 2317. Today, 29th May, is in fact Saint Edwina's day. If you would like Saint Edwina's blessing, know that she accepts all major credit cards and is also happy to be paid in vouchers for Cafe Neros.

<p>
Becoming Saint, then: possibly not the most reverent game you can play. Possibly not a game you will relish if you are a committed Catholic. But quite jolly all the same. The setup here, as I probably should have mentioned about 200 words ago, is that you're a budding preacher in 14th century Italy. Your goal is to Become a Saint within your own lifetime, rather than getting yourself martyred before you can enjoy any of the perks. To do this you will need believers, gathered from 16 social classes.
</p>
<p>
Which believers you attract is based on your own evolving political compass and doctrine, which begins with the three narrative choices you make at the outset. For example, choice of familiar. I picked a wolf as my animal emblem and promised the faithful all the florins they could eat, which got me branded a Capitalist, but your alignment can shift as you give speeches at towns over the course of the run. This may cause some believers to peel away and others to latch on. The presentation is eye-grabbing: pop-up cardboard towns, menus written on parchment scrolls, choose-your-own adventure beats with Kate Beaton-esque illustrations. A little like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a>, in places, but simpler and bolder.
</p>
<p>
You can anoint up to five types of believer as followers, which allows you to field them in "confrontations" with opposing zealots while trying to convert towns. These confrontations take the form of grid-based real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> battles with a tactical pause function. Units have three stats and some Rosary, Paper, Censer-style strengths and weaknesses. Book-wielding Monks are great at perplexing Peasants, for example. Other followers excel at begging, which is important because your holy cause is powered by bread as much as charisma.
</p>
<p>
It's all the antic and disarming work of Open Lab Games, developers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roller-drama">Roller Drama</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-drama">Football Drama</a>. You can find that demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643010/Becoming_Saint/">Steam</a>, along with the release date: 15th July 2025.
