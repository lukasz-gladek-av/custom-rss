            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-delayed-august<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ultizero Games and publisher PlayStation have announced that China Hero Project game&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until summer.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Lost_Soul_Aside/status/1917433911195353572" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Ultizero says that in order to deliver "a high-quality game experience", the game, which was originally due to be released on May 30th, will now be launching on PC and PS5 on August 29th. That, incidentally, means the game has moved from the&nbsp;release date of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>&nbsp;</em>to just one day before&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow"><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em></a>.</p>

<p>Ultizero goes on to say that in order to meet the "standards" it's set for itself when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, it needs "some additional time to polish the game".</p>

It's been in development for some time, but in December last year, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-release-window-2025" rel="nofollow">finally given a 2025 release window</a>, before a release date of May 30th was subsequently revealed (although it won't be making that date now, it seems).</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, it's an action RPG in which you'll embark on a journey to save your younger sister, and humanity as a whole, from "mysterious dimensional invaders from beyond the starlit skies".</p>

<p>As part of that quest, you can expect a "gauntlet of formidable enemies and colossal bosses" to take on, as well as lots of exciting combat abilities to upgrade and skills to try out.</p>

<p>Of course, the PC version of the game will also boast a host of graphical options, including 4K resolution, ray tracing, and HDR, but if you want to use your DualSense controller on the Steam version, you'll be able to do that as well.</p>




<p><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>will launch on August 29th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lost-soul-aside/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.</p>

            <p>
Gearbox and Take-Two recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-gets-an-earlier-release-date-as-accidentally-revealed-by-randy-pitchford">brought forward the release</a> of giggling gunslinger <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> from 23rd September to 12th September. This came a week or two after Bungie and Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-is-real-looks-ridiculously-stylish-has-a-release-date-and-is-getting-a-closed-alpha-this-month">also decided</a> to release their <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> reboot on 23rd September. 
</p>
<p>
If you thought all that was evidence of publishers playing 4D chess around the currently unannounced release date of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>, with Bungie and Sony making the fair assumption that Take-Two won't release GTA 6 and Borderlands 4 on the same day... then you were mistaken. You should be ashamed to speculate in this fashion! Pshaw! Harrumph! Damn your eyes, sir, and damn the stalking horse you rode in on.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
So says Gearbox chieftain Randy Pitchford, who has climbed the parapets of social media to insist that the new Borderlands is only shipping early because it's super, duper good, and not because Gearbox are trying to avoid either an elevator fight with Marathon <em>or</em> the undivulged impact site of the incoming GTA 6 meteor, which will surely obliterate the sales of any game foolish enough to ship in close proximity. 
</p>
<p>

"Borderlands 4 shipping early is 100% the result of confidence in the game and development trajectory backed by actual tasks and bug find/fix rates," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1917393753456664966">wrote</a> Pitchford. "Our decision is literally 0% about any other product's actual or theoretical launch date." 
</p>
<p>
As is the lot of many chieftains standing on parapets, Pitchford is getting a lot of heat for these assertions that Borderlands 4 is simply too darn brilliant to consign to the wastelands of late September. The Xitter replies are damning: three Dr Evil fingerquote gifs and counting, also a Pinocchio, an Anchorman, and several side-eyeing dogs. Now to see if Marathon, too, undergoes a sudden excess of confidence and brings its release date forward a few weeks. The Great Game continues.
</p>
<p>According to what we know for sure, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-wont-slip-to-2026-take-two-assure-theyre-highly-confident-about-fall-2025">GTA 6 will release in fall 2025</a>. "There is slippage in the industry and we're not immune from that," Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick commented in November. "However, we narrowed the timing because we are highly confident in that timing."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The first match I played of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-overwatch-2s-stadium-mode-heroes-powers-and-bounties-work/1100-6530857/">Stadium</a> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a> was a miserable experience. I was stuck in a third-person view that felt terrible and had to scramble to understand the different items you can get and how they impact your abilities. The enemy Soldier 76, however, was able to make his Helix Rocket one-shot me as Juno by the third round; he then proceeded to spend the rest of the match doing just that, while my allies spammed me in chat for not healing more.</p><p dir="ltr">By the end of the match, I was ready to dismiss Stadium as another unremarkable side mode for the hero shooter--one I planned to never touch again. Yet I continued to queue, as I wanted to better understand the mode. As I played more matches, I found that the new item builds and faster rounds are quite enjoyable, even if this mode needs far more polish.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What doesn't work in Stadium</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4485006-owthird-person.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485006" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4485006-owthird-person.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485006"></a><figcaption>Stadium defaults to a third-person perspective, but you can--and should--swap it back to first-person.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4485006-owthird-person.jpg"></figure><p>Stadium has a few issues out of the gate that make the onboarding experience feel bad. The first is that the mode is currently only available in competitive mode. On top of that, it doesn't offer placement matches, instead having everyone start at the same rank and work upwards. As such, initial matchmaking is wildly inconsistent, which is especially concerning in a mode that can snowball. Since you earn currency by playing well, which lets you buy better items, the team that's winning can quickly start to dominate.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the mismatched skill levels, it being competitive means the matches are longer and can't be backfilled if someone quits, and people have been quitting. In the three dozen or so matches I have played, someone has quit in about half of them. In a normal Overwatch competitive match, when someone quits and fails to return in two minutes, everyone on their team can quit without penalty and the match will conclude. If someone leaves prior to the match starting, or before a certain time, it cancels the match.</p><p dir="ltr">All of that is true, on paper at least, in Stadium, but the mode is quite buggy, leading to situations where the game fails to recognize when a game should be called off. For example, I had a match where our tank player picked Junker Queen, but never left the spawn area. The game waited too long to boot them, resulting in the match not being canceled, despite us never having a tank. The timer is also buggy too, as it resets at the end of round, and won't restart until after the Armory buy phase, which lasts over a minute. More often than not, if you don't want to get punished for leaving, you just have to play it out, as there is no surrender-vote option.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a mercy rule, where a team leading 3-0 with a currency lead of 15K or more will automatically win without having to play a fourth round. This also doesn't always work, as I've had matches where the requirements for a mercy rule were met, the in-between rounds loading screen stated that the requirements were met, and yet, a fourth round was played.</p><p dir="ltr">The final issue for onboarding is the third-person perspective. According to <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24191421/enter-the-stadium-lessons-learned-from-the-playtests/" rel="nofollow ">Blizzard</a>, it defaults to third-person to make it easier to see everything happening in Stadium. Yet Stadium does not feel like it requires being able to see more than regular Overwatch 2, and the third-person shooting feels stiff and strange. Fortunately, you can go into the settings and swap it back; I did and had a much better time. You can also establish Stadium-specific settings, allowing you to pick and choose which characters use which perspectives, and tweak your settings to better fit its third-person perspective. However, without a casual mode, all this adjusting will have to be done during competitive matches or in the training grounds.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What works in Stadium</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4485007-ow2stadiummap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485007" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4485007-ow2stadiummap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485007"></a><figcaption>Stadium features smaller versions of existing maps, and a few new maps like the Gladius Control map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4485007-ow2stadiummap.jpg"></figure><p>So after all that, what makes Stadium worth pushing through to experience? For starters, it provides enough new and exciting experiences to be worth playing. The new building system is great, easy to understand once you spend some time with it, and there are tons of options. I appreciate that each hero has powers specific to them that can fit your playstyle.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, I enjoy building Ashe to deal high primary-attack damage. This means getting the powers that boost primary-fire damage, like Incendiary Rounds, which provides an extra 30 fire damage if you hit two scoped shots consecutively. After that, I can purchase items that further boost my primary-attack power to really increase the damage my shots do. However, you can also build Ashe to focus on dynamite explosion damage, or to buff B.O.B., Ashe's robot bodyguard and ultimate ability, so that you can use him more often and he does more damage.</p><p dir="ltr">This build system pairs well with heroes being locked from the start of the match. Unlike other modes, you cannot switch heroes during the game. This means that if you get stuck in a bad matchup, like Zarya against D.Va, instead of counter-swapping to a different hero, you must instead focus on building D.Va in a way to make it a more even fight. Swapping heroes mid-match is a huge part of the strategy of the game--even if Blizzard has seemingly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-more-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/">taken steps</a> to try and discourage it--but Stadium completely removing this is a breath of fresh air.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, the shortened versions of each game mode make some of the more tedious ones actually feel fairer and more fun. In Stadium, each round is essentially an abridged version of another mode. Instead of Clash being best of five, it's best of three, while Push maps are about half the size, and Control is narrowed down to just a single round. The overall match is longer, but you get more variety, and modes that can feel like a stalemate--like Push and Clash--feel better suited to these shorter experiences.</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 Stadium needs a ton of polish and bug fixes before it can be a truly great experience, but the core aspects of the mode are there. The hero-building offers a ton of flexibility and options, the shorter rounds feel better, and having locked-in heroes removes one of the more frustrating aspects of the game. Fewer bugs and a casual playlist for Stadium could make the experience of learning the new mode less miserable, which would encourage more of the playerbase to try it out without having people constantly quitting from matches. The mode also should just default to first-person, with an option to swap to third-person, to make that first match feel less jarring. Stadium feels like it could be a staple of the hero shooter moving forward, if it gets the love and care it needs.</p>

			<p>Today, NVIDIA announced the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/campaigns/doom-the-dark-ages-rtx-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages GeForce RTX 50 Series bundle</a>. As with previous such bundles, the promotion stipulates that purchasing a GeForce RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, or 5070 desktop or GPU, or a laptop with a GeForce RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, or 5070 Laptop GPU provides a complimentary digital code for the game's Premium Edition.</p>
<p>Priced at $99.99, here's the full content of DOOM: The Dark Ages Premium Edition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base Game</li>
<li>Up to 2-Day Early Access</li>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DOOM-TDA_PremiumEdition-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages will launch on May 15 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game will support full-fledged path tracing and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation to maximize visuals and performance. Check out our DOOM: The Dark Ages hands-on preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Today, NVIDIA also provided an update on the latest games that will adopt its DLSS upscaling technology. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in my hands-on, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation is already implemented in the ARC Raiders Tech Test that begins today for the public. Of course, GeForce RTX 40 users can enable Frame Generation, and GeForce RTX 20/30 users can activate Super Resolution.</p>
<p>The recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> supports NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and DLAA, while also taking advantage of the ray tracing cores available in the RTX architecture if the user enables hardware-accelerated Lumen ray traced global illumination.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DLSS-251-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>The roguelite first-person shooter game Deadzone: Rogue <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3228590/Deadzone_Rogue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in early access this week with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and DLAA. Just like Oblivion Remastered, it also takes advantage of the RT Cores when enabling Lumen-based hardware-accelerated ray tracing.</p>
<p>The Wuxia open world action/adventure roleplaying game Where Winds Meet was also updated to support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation on top of Frame Generation and Super Resolution. According to NVIDIA, performance can be accelerated by 3.9X at 4K resolution and max settings. The GeForce RTX 5090 can run the game at over 500 frames per second. As a reminder, a new Closed Beta Test <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-new-cbt-set-for-may-16-19-on-pc-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is coming in a couple of weeks</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Lastly, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mistfall-hunter-a-fantasy-pvpve-action-rpg-announces-new-steam-beta-test-for-late-april/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beta 2 Test of the third-person PvPvE extraction RPG Mistfall Hunter</a> already supports NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation and Super Resolution.</p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo Switch 2 is setting out to be one of the most impressive ports launching together with the system, as the game's latest footage highlights how a more recent build of this version of the open-world RPG by CD Projekt Red has already been improved over the one used to capture the reveal trailer.</p>
<p>In a new analysis shared on YouTube, SuperMetalDave64 goes over the new footage released as part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FeYJHMW9xY">Nintendo's Creator's Voice series</a>, taking a good look at the game's visuals and performance. The most noticeable improvement is regarding textures, as the sequence where V is talking with Johnny Silverhand inside a restaurant, for example, features more detailed textures than in the same sequence shown in the reveal trailer. Additionally, the graphics settings seen in the new footage, a mix of mid and high PC settings, which is incredibly impressive, given the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, and the stable performance in Dogtown, the demanding central location of the Phantom Liberty expansion which wasn't released on previous generation systems, highlight how the new Nintendo console is definitely capable of surpassing PlayStation 4 graphics and performance level.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch 2 Cyberpunk 2077 Graphics Upgrade Confirmed in New Gameplay Trailer In-Depth Analysis" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xLYOReVmzXc?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Seeing Cyberpunk 2077 run on Nintendo Switch 2 in the way it currently does is extremely impressive, so it will be really interesting to see how the game will look at launch. Helping CD Projekt Red achieve this level of visual quality at solid performance is likely the use of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/">NVIDIA DLSS</a>, which the game will employ in all of its display modes, both docked and handheld.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 complete with the Phantom Liberty expansion on June 5th, the same day the system launches worldwide, with some exceptions like China, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-wont-launch-in-central-america-or-the-caribbean-this-year/">Central America, and the Caribbean.</a></p>

Japanese gamers were reminded of these painful feelings on April 30, when actor Shinya Okada’s dramatic reaction to losing all his original Pokemon Red save data from 1996 was captured in a YouTube video. The actor’s stunned facial expressions and fans’ outpourings of sympathy even led the incident to be featured on <a href="https://www.crank-in.net/news/165828/1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Japanese entertainment news outlets</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A familiar face in Japanese TV dramas, 77-year-old actor Shinya Owada is also a huge Pokemon fan, regularly playing through various games from the series on his YouTube Channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@shinyaohwada" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“Shinya Owada’s Hideout.”</u></a> Often accompanied by his trusty Squirtle plushie (that he <a href="https://x.com/oowadashinya/status/1887780979852673211" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>recently took on an adorable trip to the aquarium</u></a>), Owada’s warm-hearted enthusiasm for the games, plus his dramatic narration of the dialogue has earned the veteran gamer over 56.4K subscribers.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/30/japan-1746009732056.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Japanese actor Shinya Owada lost his Pokemon Red save data.

As many commenters suggested, it seems likely that the battery in Okada’s Game Boy cartridge of Pokemon Red finally died, thus deleting his precious save data. Without the benefits of cloud-based storage back-ups, it was quite easy to lose all the data on your cartridge or memory card if the contacts wore out, you took it out of the console too quickly, or even looked at the console in the wrong way (this writer swears that this is how she lost her 90 hours of Final Fantasy IX gameplay back in 2001...).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Losing save data is also losing life,” stated one commenter on Owada’s YouTube video, drawing stark attention to the hours of effort and grinding that vanish into oblivion when you lose a save (something that all Simmers, Citybuilders, and RPG fans can attest to). Others were more philosophical: “even if save data disappears, the memories remain!” Comments also showed fans’ fondness for Owada, with one user adding: "If this happened to any other video game streamer, I would laugh at how ridiculous it is, but with Mr. Owada, it's a different story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If all this has strangely inspired you to go back to Game Boy-era Pokemon games, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-version/walkthrough"><u>IGN’s comprehensive walkthroughs</u></a> for Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit Shinya Owada / YouTube.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

In all seriousness, this is a brilliant set that's often overlooked. Whilst the price is a little over MSRP, it's worth getting just for the booster packs included. Plus the promo, sleeves and dice look great in this particular ETB. Following the trend, Twilight Masquerade single cards are also crashing in price, so make sure to check if you can just buy the cards you're after for less.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Twilight Masquerade Single Cards</h2></p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Surging Sparks Single Cards</h2></p><p id="shining-fates-collection"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Shining Fates Collection">Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219657"><div id="219657" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">kachu gets a lot of oversized cardboard love in this box with a promo card, a giant version, and four Shining Fates booster packs.

It is an officially licensed Dark Brotherhood medallion, limited to 5000 pieces, finished in black and gold, and somehow still cheaper than most novelty keychains. Ships later this year, assuming you survive the wait</p></div><p id="paldean-fates-booster-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Paldean Fates Booster Bundle">Pokémon TCG Paldean Fates Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219659"><div id="219659" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG Paldean Fates Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Paldean Fates brings back shiny Pokémon in a big way, and this bundle gives you six booster packs to chase them. I want to be excited about it, but again, single card prices for Paldean Fates are not holding up well. If you just want a shiny Charizard ex SIR without the suspense, the singles market is sitting there quietly judging your pack opening addiction.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Paldean Fates Single Cards</h2></p><p id="azure-legends-tin"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Azure Legends Tin">Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 Packs</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219660"><div id="219660" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 Packs</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Includes 2 x Surging Sparks Booster Packs</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I like a good tin, especially one with five booster packs packed inside, but getting a random Kyogre, Xerneas, or Dialga promo card feels a little like gambling with slightly better odds. It is a solid pickup for the price if you do not mind leaving your promo fate to the RNG gods. If you are only after one specific chase card though outside of the included two Surging Sparks boosters, it might save your blood pressure to just buy it separately.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Surging Sparks Single Cards</h2></p><p id="lexar-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lexar Sale">Lexar Sale</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219661"><div id="219661" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lexar Sale</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Up to 54% off Micro SDXCs, Portable SSDs, M.2 SSDs, Sata III SSDs and RAM </p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Lexar is finally giving some breathing room on pricing with this Amazon sale, and the Armor 700 is a standout. You are getting 4TB of rugged storage with serious transfer speeds for about 100 dollars off the typical price. It is water resistant, dust resistant, and a lot more durable than whatever junk is sitting at the bottom of your backpack right now.</p></div><p id="pokmon-game-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Game Sale">Pokémon Game Sale</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219557"><div id="219557" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Click through for the full Woot gaming sale</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot is offering a solid spread of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/pokemon">Pokémon</a> games today, and I want at least three of them. Brilliant Diamond, Legends: Arceus, Let’s Go, Eevee!, and a few others are sitting between $39.99 and $44.99, which feels right for anyone catching up before Switch 2 changes the landscape again. In my opinion, it is a smart time to grab them while prices are behaving themselves. Everything here is fully playable now and will likely get performance bumps once Nintendo's next system arrives.</p></div><p id="msi-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MSI Sale">MSI Desktops &amp; Components Sale</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219558"><div id="219558" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MSI Desktops &amp; Components Sale</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Click through for the full Woot gaming sale</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">MSI’s factory-reconditioned gaming desktops are quietly one of the best parts of today's sale. Machines like the AEGIS R 13NUE-448US are going for $1,129.99, and RTX 4060 GPUs are under $300. I want to be responsible, but this pricing makes it harder than it should be. If you have been thinking about rebuilding your setup, this is exactly the kind of deal you hope not to miss.</p></div><p id="samsung-512gb-microsdxc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Samsung 512GB MicroSDXC">Samsung Pro Plus 512GB MicroSDXC + Reader</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219560"><div id="219560" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Samsung Pro Plus 512GB MicroSDXC + Reader</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/publisher/samsung">Samsung</a> PRO Plus 512GB microSD card with a USB reader for $29.99. I think it is a good fit if you are adding games to your Switch, Steam Deck, ROG Ally, or anything else still using microSD storage. It is fast enough for quick transfers, big enough for most libraries, and cheap enough that you do not have to think too hard about it. Just know it is not built for Switch 2, in case you're planning ahead.</p></div><p id="8bitdo-xbox-edition-keyboard"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="8BitDo Xbox Edition Keyboard">8BitDo Retro 87 Mechanical Keyboard (Xbox Edition)</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219562"><div id="219562" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>8BitDo Retro 87 Mechanical Keyboard (Xbox Edition)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/8bitdo-retro-mechanical-keyboard-review">8BitDo Retro 87 Mechanical Keyboard</a> is down to $99.99 at Amazon. I think it is one of the best-looking keyboards out right now if you want something that works and does not scream “boring office equipment.” It has Kailh Jellyfish X switches, a top-mount design, fast response, and Xbox-inspired styling that actually looks good on a gaming desk. I probably do not need another keyboard. I am thinking about it anyway.</p></div><p id="8bitdo-mouse-xbox-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="8BitDo Mouse Xbox Edition"> 8BitDo Retro R8 Mouse (Xbox Edition)</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219563"><div id="219563" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> 8BitDo Retro R8 Mouse (Xbox Edition)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon also has the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/8bitdo-retro-mechanical-keyboard-review">8BitDo Retro R8 Wireless Mouse</a> on sale for $58.68. It feels like the natural companion to the Retro 87 Keyboard, but it also stands fine on its own. It packs a PAW 3395 sensor, programmable buttons, a 4K polling rate, and a charging dock that doubles as a signal booster. I want one for a low-key gaming setup that does not look like it is held together with RGB lighting and prayer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/returnal-ps5-pro-patch-is-out-now-promising-2-5x-the-pixels/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Housemarque has released an update for the early PlayStation 5 hit, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/returnal">Returnal</a>, adding support for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> that brings a higher resolution experience to players of the game.</p>
<p>Once you’ve downloaded the update, the PS5 Pro is capable of running the game with up to 2.5x the pixels of the game on base PS5.</p>


<p>Looking back at early analysis of the title, Digital Foundry pegged the game’s original PS5 release to having a native 1080p pixel count that was then upscaled through temporal reconstruction to 1440p, and a further checkerboarding pass to 2160p. Housemarque hasn’t put a firm figure on the new resolution targets, but with 1920×1080 delivering just over 2 million pixels, rendering 2.5x the pixels would put this around 5 million pixels, or an uncommonly heard of 1700p. Of course, this is “up to” and we’re dealing with dynamic resolutions throughout.</p>
<p>While it’s perhaps a little disappointing that Housemarque haven’t enhanced the game with a 120Hz performance mode – 120fps is generally out of reach for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/19/returnal-pc-15-february-release-date-minimum-recommended-specs/">the PC version of the game</a>, even – a straight up resolution bump still has plenty value for increasing image clarity and reducing the effects that temporal and checkboarding upscaling have on image quality.</p>
<p>Looking back on Returnal,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-ps5/"> our glowing 9/10 review</a> of the PS5 launch window game said, “It feels immensely satisfying to be sat here in 2021, eons after playing Super Stardust HD on PS3, and see just how far Housemarque has come. Offering a visual bullet hell spectacle, a showcase for the DualSense controller and a rewarding sci-fi narrative woven around the roguelike loop, we can say with unflinching confidence that Returnal is the PS5’s best game to date.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/saros-is-the-next-time-looper-shooter-from-returnal-devs-housemarque/">Housemarque announced Saros</a>, their next project during February’s State of Play, which following in the footsteps of Returnal’s roguelike shooter form, starring Rahul Kohli as our player character Arjun Devraj.</p>

			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows may get expanded in the future with a multiplayer mode, judging from some recent discoveries.</p>
<p>As reported on X by game modder Sliderv2, the game's current version features, inside its Bootstrap file, a mention of a few developer test maps for multiplayer and PVP. This not only gives more credibility to some earlier rumors that suggested the new entry in the series would feature multiplayer in some form, but also suggests that it could still be coming at some point in the future, especially considering the game has yet to receive any major new feature as some of its predecessors did after launch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Rumors of a planned multiplayer mode for Assassin's Creed Shadows may be true. The Boostrap file mentions a few developer test maps for Multiplayer and PVP. <a href="https://t.co/GJYqn99pNT">pic.twitter.com/GJYqn99pNT</a></p>
<p>— Sliderv2 (@Totocko97) <a href="https://twitter.com/Totocko97/status/1917365143895433361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Regarding content, however, Assassin's Creed Shadows is not lacking, as the game is full of side activities to complete as Naoe and Yasuke further their war against the Shinbakufu. While the game is not on par with the best open-world RPG available on the market, it is a solid and enjoyable game, and one of the best entries in the series, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

            <p>It's been nearly a decade since the first reveal of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-soul-aside-launches-in-2025-nine-years-after-devil-may-cry-and-final-fantasy-15-inspired-action-games-reveal">Devil May Cry and Final Fantasy 15-inspired RPG action game Lost Soul Aside</a>. Now the wait is <em>almost </em>over - though things are now going to take a little longer than expected.</p>
<p>Lost Soul Aside is still set to debut later this year but - in order to allow for some extra polish and whatnot - it will not arrive quite as soon as initially planned, its developer has said. "To match the standards Ultizero Games have set for ourselves, we are going to take some additional time to polish the game," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3378960/view/507326880609731162?l=latam">Lost Souls Aside game director and studio head Yang Bing explained on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>As such, Lost Soul Aside will now release on 29th August. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-nearly-a-decade-of-development-playstation-published-action-game-gets-a-release-date">initially slated for 30th May</a>, which was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-the-pc-requirements-for-elden-ring-nightreign">same day as Elden Ring's co-op spinoff Nightreign</a>. Bing said the team was "truly grateful" for all those who have responded positively since the game's announcement, and everyone involved wants to make sure Lost Soul Aside releases with a "high-quality game experience" for fans.</p>
<p>The upcoming game is being published by PlayStation, and will be launching across PC and - of course - PS5.</p>
<p>"Embark on an epic odyssey to save your younger sister – and the whole of humanity – from mysterious dimensional invaders from beyond the starlit skies in Lost Soul Aside," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/">official game description over on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/fortnite-will-premiere-star-wars-tales-of-the-underworld-before-it-airs-on-disney/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As we build up to the yearly puntastic celebration of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars">Star Wars</a> on May 4th this weekend, Disney and Epic have announced a new collaboration that, alongside a Star Wars-themed season coming to the Battle Royale game, will see Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld premiere first within <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> before it airs on Disney+.</p>
<p>The first two episodes of anthology series Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld will be watchable on the Star Wars Watch Party island from 3PM UK time on 2nd May. It’s sure to be highlighted within the game, but the island code is 2124-6713-8076.</p>


<p>The island is another example of what’s possible within Unreal Editor for Fortnite, using official Star Wars assets that are available to other creators to mess around with in their own islands. The island features a battle arena where you can fight waves of enemies – there’s no damage in this mode, though.</p>
<p>Another freebie is a First Order Stormtrooper outfit, which can be unlocked by linking an Epic Games account with a MyDisney account.</p>

<p>As was recently <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swcj-2025-fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle">announced at Star Wars Celebration</a>, the next season of Fortnite Battle Royale is dubbed Galactic Battle and will kick off on 2nd May. During this event, players can play as Emperor Palpatine, pilot X-wings and TIE Fighters, and it will build up to an in-game event, Death Star Sabotage. Leaning in on the age old memes and jokes, you’ll also be able to play as Darth Jar Jar.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Galactic Battle Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SqTXd-YiAtk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s a pretty huge collaboration between Epic and Disney, who previously linked up in the days before the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker in 2019, hosting a film preview in-game that featured a message from Palpatine – a message that was mentioned in the opening crawl, but not heard by moviegoers.</p>
<p>“For the first time, Disney+ is premiering a show inside a game, launching alongside our largest Star Wars collaboration with Fortnite to date – giving fans and players an exciting first look at the kinds of experiences they can expect as we shape a new future together,” said Sean Shoptaw, Executive Vice President, Disney Games &amp; Digital Entertainment. “We’re building the next era of digital entertainment, where fans can play, watch, create and connect – and we’re just beginning to tap into what’s possible.”</p>
<p>What could leave an odd taste in the mouth, though, is that Disney are putting these episodes out there within a free-to-play game, putting that audience ahead of people who pay for Disney+. Sure, it’s only by two days, as the show will arrive on Disney+ on 4th May, but you’d be understandably a bit miffed if you were in the wrong part of the audience Venn diagram.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review/657618/gpd-win-max-2-review-2024-2025-tiny-laptop-handheld-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Since <em>Neuromancer</em> took the sci-fi world by storm in 1984, computing nerds have pined for a “cyberdeck” — the ultimate in personal, portable PCs for surfing and hacking the world. Usually, they’re DIY affairs. But the 10-inch GPD Win Max 2 is the closest I’ve seen to an off-the-shelf cyberdeck worth buying.</p><p>It’s far from the best laptop or gaming handheld. It’s an ergonomic compromise in <em>five ways</em>, and the webcam is trash! It’s also a portable computing dream. It doubles as a gaming handheld, with joysticks and buttons smuggled away in hidden compartments. It optionally triples as a desktop gaming PC, with a rare Oculink port that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/606006/nvidia-rtx-5090-egpu-gaming-handheld-oculink-test-pcie-minisforum-deg1">lets you plug in a beefy eGPU</a>. It has more full-size ports than most small laptops can dream of, twin SSD slots, and a minimum 32GB of RAM.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, it has the most competent keyboard I’ve used on a computer this small, with near-zero learning curve. I’m writing every word you’re reading right now, at my normal speed, on the Win Max 2. I’ve spent many full days working from this 10-inch notebook, and it’s tackled everything. I even edited <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seanhollister.bsky.social/post/3lnivk5kuks2z">a recent Today I’m Toying With video</a> on this tiny PC.</p><p>GPD’s been building tiny laptops for around a decade, and this one’s tantalizingly close to something I might actually pay for — if I could only convince the company to change a few key things.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->1005</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Excellent keyboard for the size</li><li>Stellar array of ports</li><li>eGPU-ready, both Oculink and USB4</li><li>Doubles as a gaming handheld</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Awkward to hold</li><li>Webcam is atrocious</li><li>Tiny touchpad makes you stretch</li><li>Battery doesn’t last the day</li></ul></div></div></div><p>On paper, the GPD Win Max 2 seems like it should be in the upper echelon of handhelds. You get your choice of AMD’s HX 370 “Strix Point” or its Ryzen 7 8840U chip, up to 64GB of memory, up to 4TB of storage, a high-res 2,560 x 1,600 IPS screen covered in Corning’s Gorilla Glass 5 for durability, and a larger-than-average 67 watt-hour battery to power the whole thing.</p><p>But using it on the couch, in bed, and on flights to and from Japan, gaming was more awkward than I expected.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Ports, buttons, bumpers, and triggers. There are even back buttons on the underside.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>For once, I’m not talking about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24351383/handheld-pcs-challenge-switch-2-editorial#:~:text=G.%20Di%20Benedetto-,Operating%20system,-Buyers%20need%20to">how terrible Windows can be</a>! With a large 10.1-inch touchscreen and a full keyboard, it’s the rare handheld where Microsoft’s OS is easy to manage, easy to tap touchscreen buttons and drag windows around. (It does still struggle with sleep.)</p><p>Nor am I talking about the 2.2-pound weight — while my arms<em> do</em> get tired holding it like a Nintendo Switch, I can usually just open the laptop’s hinge, prop it up on my chest, or plop it on my lap for a bit.</p><p>Even the game pad controls are decent, as awkward as they might look! You get two analog sticks that feel nigh-identical to Nintendo Switch, save the drift-resistant Hall effect sensors underneath. The PSP-style translucent D-pad is responsive, as are the tiny ABXY face buttons. You get clicky microswitches under each bumper. Only the triggers feel a little weak.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Assume the party position.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>No, the main problem is that to <em>hold</em> those game pad controls, you have to grip the laptop’s rigid aluminum and resin chassis, which has no real dampening to isolate my hands from the handheld’s grumbling guts. I can feel every fan vibration traveling through my fingers, up into my wrists. It feels indescribably weird and bad! I’ve asked GPD, but the company’s suggested fan adjustments haven’t fixed it. A replacement unit had the same issue.</p><p>The second pain point is the screen. 2560x1600 is <em>far </em>too many pixels for AMD’s portable chips to push in even moderately intensive games — and because GPD chose a fixed 60Hz screen nothing feels as smooth as on 90Hz and 120Hz VRR handhelds like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">Asus ROG Ally X</a>, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/609761/polygon-ayaneo-3-hands-on">Ayaneo 3</a>. It’s a good display for productivity or watching movies, particularly considering the Win Max 2’s decent DTS:X digital sound enhancements, but I will no longer buy a gaming handheld with a 60Hz fixed refresh screen.</p><div><h2>GPD Win Max 2 720p benchmarks</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>GPD Win Max 2 (8840U)</h3></th><th><h3>Asus ROG Ally X (Z1E)</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Z2 Go)</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AC Valhalla, 15-watt TDP</td><td>58</td><td>52</td><td>44</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>~20-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>67</td><td>55</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~25-watt TDP</td><td>78</td><td>83</td><td>60</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~30-watt TDP</td><td>79</td><td>86</td><td>62</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>80</td><td>86</td><td>65</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>49</td><td>42</td><td>36</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>~20-watt TDP</td><td>56</td><td>51</td><td>41</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~25-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>68</td><td>45</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~30-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>70</td><td>46</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>69</td><td>70</td><td>49</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>73</td><td>59</td><td>56</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>~20-watt TDP</td><td>81</td><td>72</td><td>63</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~25-watt TDP</td><td>86</td><td>86</td><td>66</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~30-watt TDP</td><td>88</td><td>89</td><td>67</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>88</td><td>89</td><td>70</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>35</td><td>30</td><td>24</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>~20-watt TDP</td><td>37</td><td>38</td><td>26</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~25-watt TDP</td><td>39</td><td>39</td><td>29</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~30-watt TDP</td><td>40</td><td>42</td><td>30</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>42</td><td>42</td><td>32</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>57</td><td>52</td><td>53</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>~20-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>66</td><td>53</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~25-watt TDP</td><td>70</td><td>71</td><td>55</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~30-watt TDP</td><td>72</td><td>76</td><td>64</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>79</td><td>76</td><td>65</td><td>61</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average framerates.

While it does seem to have a performance advantage at 15W, battery life is still meh, as it has a smaller battery within.</p><p>With the Ally X, I got over eight hours of magic poker game <em>Balatro</em>, my best-case-scenario test for these handhelds since it’s non-intensive; the Win Max 2 managed only five hours and 22 minutes on a charge. I also saw just two hours of <em>Armored Core 6</em>, on par with the Steam Deck, but the Ally X can get nearly three hours. Plus, you can drain the Win Max 2’s battery in an hour and a half with more intense games if you try.</p><p><em>Unlike</em> other handhelds, though, you can play flat on a tray table, like I did on my flights. The joysticks and buttons are still accessible, plus a whole keyboard. Over the past month, I’ve nearly beaten <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> playing exclusively on the Win Max 2, transitioning between laptop and handheld, cordless and corded modes.</p><p>And that’s before you consider that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/606006/nvidia-rtx-5090-egpu-gaming-handheld-oculink-test-pcie-minisforum-deg1">you can genuinely plug an RTX 5090 external graphics card dock</a> into this thing. Just know that Oculink products, unlike USB-C ones, aren’t made to be hot-swapped. They have to be fully powered down before you yank the cable, or you risk damage.</p><p>So that’s the Win Max 2 as a gaming machine. As a laptop, it’s largely the same story: uniquely intriguing until you bump into ugly shortcomings.</p><p>Don’t even think about buying a Win Max 2 for your Zoom and Teams calls, as it has one of the worst webcams I’ve had the displeasure of using — and I say that having suffered years with the nosehair webcam on a Dell XPS 15. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512743/dell-xps-15-gtx-1650-laptop-webcam-placement-fixed-pricing-features-release-date">We wrote an entire story</a> when Dell fixed that mistake.) The Win Max 2’s hinge-cam is angled so low that typing appears to your colleagues as GIANT SPIDER FINGERS invading the conference call.</p><p>Plus, the camera’s optics are just bad. “You are a lovely person, but it is actively unpleasant to view you through this webcam,” said one colleague; another called the microphone “shit.”</p><p>If you plan to fix that with an external webcam, you might also add a travel mouse to fix the other big shortcoming. The touchpad is just 2.7 inches (70mm) wide and 1.6 inches (40mm) deep, <em>and</em> awkwardly placed above the keyboard rather than below, making me stretch for it every time. It does physically click, but it’s terrible at click-and-drag. I’ve never met a laptop that needed<a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/6/30/21292182/thinkpad-trackpoint-mouse-nub-button-trackpad-challenges-design-user-input"> a ThinkPad nub</a> more.</p><p>The good news: the Win Max 2 has <em>plenty</em> of ports for practically any peripheral you’d care to add.</p><div><div><p id="ports-to-spare"><h2>Ports to spare</h2></p></div><p>While you won’t find the Ethernet and RS-232/serial/DB9 jacks that sysadmins might want in a true cyberdeck — <a href="https://gpdstore.net/gpd-mini-laptop/gpd-pocket-4">GPD sells a different modular laptop for that</a> — this one still has ports to spare: </p><div><ul><li><span>Two 40Gbps USB 4 ports with docking, charging, monitor, and eGPU capabilities</span></li><li><span>Two 10Gbps USB-A ports for traditional USB gadgets</span></li><li><span>Full-size UHS-II SD card slot and UHS-I microSD card slot</span></li><li><span>Full-size HDMI 2.1 port for built-in video output</span></li><li><span>3.5mm headset jack</span></li><li><span>63Gbps Oculink port for compatible eGPUs</span></li></ul></div><p>Adding storage is a cinch: not only are both SD card slots full-depth, so nothing’s sticking out of your PC, but there’s a modular SSD bay on the bottom to quickly add a short M.2 2230 stick, on top of its internal M.2 2280 one, without cracking the case.</p></div><p>Should GPD have sacrificed some of those ports to make the stout Win Max 2 thinner? I don’t think so, though you should know it won’t fit neatly into many laptop sleeves. But GPD could ditch the modular SSD and modem bays for extra battery capacity.

            <p>
Nintendo Switch owners with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-prepares-for-switch-2-with-original-console-update-adding-gameshare-virtual-game-cards-and-more">the console's latest system update</a> have noted that it is no longer possible to play the same digital game online across two systems simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
Previously, a Switch designated as a primary console could load up a digital game and play online alongside the owner of that game logged in via a second Switch.
</p>
<p>
Now, this "loophole" has been closed, due to the introduction of Nintendo's new Virtual Game Cards system which treats digital games as if they were physical cartridges.
</p>
<p>
Users can still play a single copy of a digital game while playing offline, however. This is possible if you turn on a new  Online Licenses option (buried in your Profile's user settings), which lets you play a digital game even if you don't have the Virtual Game Card - as long as it's not being played elsewhere or, crucially, as long as it is being played elsewhere but on a Switch that is set offline.
</p>
<p>
"If this option is enabled, purchased digital software will be playable while the console is connected to the internet, even when the virtual game card for that software isn't loaded to the console," Nintendo's explanation of the Online License setting states. 
</p>
<p>
"However, when using an online licence, only the user signed int to the Nintendo Account that was used to purchase the software will be able to play it, it will not be playable for other users on the console. Your virtual game cards can be used to play software regardless of this setting. Online licences cannot be used on multiple consoles at the same time. The online licence and virtual game card for a software title cannot be used at the same time."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has tested this for ourselves, and confirmed this system is now in place.
</p>
<p>For instance, if console A shares a virtual game card with console B, only console B can access the game when both consoles are online. However, with the Online Licenses option switched on, if console B plays the game offline, console A is unable to tell if the game is being played and will still allow access.</p>

<p>
Reacting to the changes, fans on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-now-blocks-playing-the-same-game-online-on-two-switchs-simultaneously.1177164/page-3">ResetEra</a> have a mixed response. "So Virtual Game Cards are a downgrade," wrote one user. 
</p>
<p>
"A major downgrade," wrote another. "My wife and I played hundreds of hours of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> and Animal Crossing together off of a single digital purchase."
</p>
<p>
"You can play online while game sharing on PS and Xbox," noted a third. 
</p>
<p>
Another new feature added in today's Switch system update is GameShare, which will alleviate this change somewhat - but only for select games on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>. 
</p>
<p>
GameShare lets you play supported software with a nearby Switch 2 owner, including on a Switch 1. But support for this will be on a game-per-game basis - and will require a Switch 2. So it won't help anyone looking to continue sharing Splatoon 3 or Animal Crossing on Switch 1 in the same way.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 is now just over a month from launch - though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/someones-already-beaten-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-on-switch-2-a-month-before-the-console-is-available">someone has already beaten the new version of Zelda: Breath of the Wild already</a> at a demo event. Fans have also discovered that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">many third-party physical Switch 2 games do not actually have the game on the card</a>, and will still require a download.

        <p>Hitting the big 1-0 with dozens of compatibility fixes</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/proton">Proton</a>, the compatibility software co-developed by Valve and CodeWeavers for helping Windows games run on Linux – and, thus, the foundation for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> – is getting its first full version update in nearly a year. Proton 10.0 is now available in beta form, heralding compatibility fixes and improvements in enough games that I gave up bothering to do an accurate count. <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/releases/tag/proton-10.0-1b">Loads, basically</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Changes in this milestone update range from the addressing of specific issues in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto V</a> Enhanced, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xcom-2">XCOM 2</a> to the gift of SteamOS compatibility with games that previously lacked it entirely. These include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/batman-arkham-asylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a> Game of the Year Edition, which are currently listed as Unsupported for the Deck on their respective Steam pages – once Proton 10.0 gets a stable branch launch, those ratings may need to be reviewed. Indeed, when I set Arkham Asylum to run using the beta, it worked perfectly, having failed to get past the launcher on Proton 9.</p>
<p>It's not just Steam Deck fixes in 10.0 either. The patch notes also promise amendments for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a> – among others – crashing on Intel GPUs, so the update has Linux-based desktop users in mind as well. Incidentally, Marvel Rivals had a less productive coming-together with Proton earlier this year, the software being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-unbans-steam-deck-and-mac-players-wrongly-caught-up-in-cheater-purge">mistakenly flagged as a cheating tool</a>.</p>
<p>Some of these fixes have been included in past updates to Proton Experimental, or were beaten to the punch by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-proton-ge-on-the-steam-deck">Proton GE</a>: an unofficial, custom build that takes advantage of Proton’s open-sourcedness to pack in even more compatibility tweaks. Even so, Valve/CodeWeaver’s beta builds are inherently more polished and bug-light than Experimental versions, and unlike Proton GE, don’t need any side jaunts into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-enable-desktop-mode-on-the-steam-deck">Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode</a> to get working.</p>
<p>Between that readiness of use and the current lack of timeframe on when 10.0 might get a stable release, the beta is arguably worth trying out now if you’ve suffered any of the compatibility problems it claims to have sorted out. Proton beta versions also work on the stable branch of SteamOS, so you don’t need to switch to the operating system’s beta branch as well, and installation is a cinch: just search for the Proton 10.0 beta in your Steam library, and you can download it from there as if it were a game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
