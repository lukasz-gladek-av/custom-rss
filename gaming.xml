I realize $400 seems like the lowest possible price for the tech, and Nintendo is known for never selling consoles at a loss, but I also think there’s a reason it went for the LCD instead of the OLED. I have a feeling it’s going to be $350.</p><p><strong>Zack Zwiezen:</strong> Finally, I get a chance to bring out my magical crystal ball that can tell the future. I’m looking into it now, and it shows me $400.</p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard: </strong>599 U.S. Dollars.<br></p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> Based purely on the rules for winning <em>The Price is Right</em> I’m going with $450. Also I think it makes a separate bundle with a game for $500 an easy upsell. There will also be some question about how much of the sticker price is in anticipation of consequences from Trump’s ongoing trade war. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b7cbe8f4a008feb85b78bf15c582bf3f" data-recommend-id="image://b7cbe8f4a008feb85b78bf15c582bf3f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1333" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A photo shows a store shelf for Nintendo products.

The OG Switch was announced about five months before it launched in March 2017. A June 2025 launch is about six months after Nintendo revealed the Switch 2. I could just check my crystal ball, but I don’t need to. June 2025 is the launch window.</p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard: </strong>Shadow dropped on April 2 right after the direct.

The only thing I really desperately want and need at the launch of Switch 2 is a shiny new 3D <em>Mario </em>game. Give me a new <em>Mario </em>game as big and awesome as <em>Odyssey</em>, and I’ll buy a Switch 2 on day one. Considering the last big 3D <em>Mario </em>game was <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, released in 2017, it seems like we are due for a new one.</p><p><strong>John Walker: </strong>It’d be weird if there weren’t a new <em>Super Mario</em>, right? My wish is for something that realizes the amazing promise of <em>Bowser’s Fury</em>, an open-world-ish 3D <em>Mario</em> game with all the imaginative innovations Nintendo could do with all that space. It’d be <em>crazy</em> if there weren’t <em>Wind Waker</em> and <em>Twilight Princess</em> remakes, but then it’s been <em>crazy</em> that those haven’t happened for every year of the original Switch, too. Can we all agree to collectively boo if there’s word of a <em>Pikmin 5</em>?</p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard:</strong> <em>Breath of the Wild 3 </em>and a <em>Pokemon MMO</em>.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> <em>Donkey Kong Country 6</em>, some first-party gimmick party game called, like, <em>Mouse Attack</em> or something, and a port of <em>Sea of Thieves</em>. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8997bcdff410a320304a57d189ed8068" data-recommend-id="image://8997bcdff410a320304a57d189ed8068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 displays a patent for the Joy-Con mouse functionality.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Zack Zwiezen:</strong> The rumored ability to use a Joy-Con as a mouse sounds wild and could make it easier to port PC-only things to Switch 2, though I have a feeling Nintendo will still require all games to be playable without using the mouse feature.</p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard:</strong> The Switch 2 can do your taxes for you, which is why it’s shadow dropping: so it can get in people’s homes before taxes are due.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> GameCube games will get added to Switch Online via the Expansion Pack Deluxe. Paying extra for this will also be the only way to utilize voice chat. The Virtual Console will return to the eShop, but NES games will be $10 each, with $10 added on for each subsequent console generation. There will be no built-in social media sharing. You’ll be able to share save files with the people on your friends list. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="32488bccf783587f8bc453b49bc2c2e0" data-recommend-id="image://32488bccf783587f8bc453b49bc2c2e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1785" data-height="1003" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 screenshot shows the C button.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Zack Zwiezen:</strong> Perhaps the C button is just the new screenshot button and C stands for capture? That would be a really boring answer. Another option is that C stands for connect and this will be the button you use to sync stuff or maybe even connect to an OG Switch? The wildest idea I’ve come up with: The C button stands for camera. In this scenario, you’ll be able to hit it, and the Switch 2 controller will become a virtual in-game camera controlled via motion in games that support photo modes. The truth is that I don’t know what the C button will do, but hopefully it’s not something annoying that makes me hate using the Switch 2.</p><p>  <strong>John Walker:</strong> I’m at my most pessimistic here. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307">I’ve bemoaned previously</a></span>, I think this is just going to be a better Switch, and as such lack that Nintendo weirdness you’d usually expect in a follow-up console. I really hope I’m wrong, and that mysterious button causes games to climb out of the screen or something. </p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard: </strong>C stands for “Car horn,” so the Switch 2 honks if you press it.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach: </strong>The C button stands for ChatGPT integration and will summon a Shigeru Miyamoto MiiBot that gives you tips for playing games. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7bbe6298886a467edc1476828a1292f9" data-recommend-id="image://7bbe6298886a467edc1476828a1292f9" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 sits in a dock.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Zack Zwiezen:</strong> Mobile chips and hardware have come a long way since 2017, so I expect the Switch 2 will be a much more capable machine and should be able to run most new games, though likely at lower framerates or resolutions. Interestingly, I wonder if the Steam Deck’s success in recent years has helped devs get better at optimizing settings for a portable, smaller device with a limited battery. If so, that could be very helpful for Switch 2 ports.</p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard:</strong> It will be powerful enough to run old Switch games like they should have run on the last one, god willing.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> People are going to be asking for a Switch 2 Pro by Christmas. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="25d90edbff26f6fa55f946ab4205712b" data-recommend-id="image://25d90edbff26f6fa55f946ab4205712b" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cartridge is shown being inserted into a Switch 2.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Zack Zwiezen: </strong>Yuuuuuuuuuuup. I expect that for the following 20 months or so, getting your hands on a Switch 2 will involve scanning Discord servers, religiously following Wario64 on Twitter for stock updates, and being ready to drop everything at a moment’s notice to snag one before a thousand resellers show up with bots to vacuum up any units that arrive in warehouses or stores. Or you might be able to pay triple the price to get a Switch 2 via eBay. But don’t do that. Don’t reward the resellers.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> Absolutely not. I think pre-orders might be touch-and-go, especially if there’s little to no scalper protection and resellers are inflating demand. But I also think Nintendo delayed this console by a full year to make sure it had enough stock so that you could walk into a Target or Best Buy once school is out and upgrade to a Switch 2. The alternative is Nintendo risks a small but not insignificant group of Switch owners upgrading to a PS5 or Steam Deck instead. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="477cfa797b2be5fdf0b5ff67d0836cea" data-recommend-id="image://477cfa797b2be5fdf0b5ff67d0836cea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Master Chief Collection appears on Switch 2.

Rockstar brought the <em>GTA Trilogy</em> to Switch, as well as some other games. But <em>GTA V </em>remains unavailable on Nintendo hardware. That’s a huge market that could be buying Shark Cards in <em>GTA Online</em>. And with <em>GTA 6</em> unlikely to arrive on Switch 2, <em>GTA V </em>might be the next best thing. And hey, maybe a <em>GTA IV </em>port, too. I also wouldn’t be shocked if some more Xbox games arrived on Switch 2.<em> Forza Horizon 5 </em>on a Switch 2 sounds splendid. </p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> I expect Microsoft to load up the Switch 2 with former Xbox console exclusives including <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>, the rumored <em>Gears of War </em>anthology, <em>Diablo 4</em>, and a bunch of other games. <em>Elden Ring</em> is a riskier but more exciting bet. But I’ll go big and say <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> comes to Switch 2 before the end of 2025!</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered makes its bow on PC, broadening the game’s availability. The survival title already looked unbelievable on consoles, so let’s tell you its PC specs and system requirements to have you clacking at Clickers in no time.</p>



<p>The Last of Us Part 1 Remastered came to PC, so it makes sense for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-2-remastered-announces-free-no-return-content-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> to follow suit. Naughty Dog’s award-winning sequel is here in all its remastered and revitalized glory. It features the complete dual-narrative of The Last of Us Part 2 but comes with lots of new features.</p>



<p>Not everyone’s PC setup is the same. This is why system requirements are important before a game’s release. Naughty Dog has unveiled the entire list of PC specs and requirements here, and you should look to see which tier you are compatible with.</p>

<figure><figcaption>The game is breathtaking. Credit to Naughty Dog</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/the_last_of_us_part_ii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Part 2</a> Remastered’s requirements are split into four categories: <strong>Minimum, Recommended, High, and Very High</strong> settings. Minimum is what you need to run Part 2 at all. We need to hit these requirements to ensure the game works and we don’t run into any problems.</p>



<p>The game runs better the closer you get to “Very High.” This is reserved for the most elite gaming configurations though, so don’t be disheartened if you fall short of the requirements.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here’s every set of system requirements for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/want-to-know-the-best-way-to-gain-attention-on-steam-add-a-demo-<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">2023 gave Steam quite the scare. The premiere PC gaming marketplace saw a major downturn in revenue for new games, pushing Valve to put significant work into new features that would drive engagement and sales on the platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Their main priority? Pushing developers to add demos and putting those demos in front of as many players as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In 2023, Valve actually made less money from new games, it actually declined," said game marketing strategist Chris Zukowski. "All of 2024 was them pushing out features, thinking that they needed to fix the issue. They Flooded the store with features that all focus on demos. Valve was saying, in not so subtle terms, that everyone needs to make a demo."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Everything is demo oriented">Everything is demo oriented</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zukowski gave a talk on navigating these new Steam features at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. We sat down with him after the talk to dive into the topic in more detail. The main point of the talk was that demos are the key to getting discovered on Steam. It's natural, according to Zukowski, that interest in your game will have a greater chance at visibility if you give streamers a way to play.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For most games, social media doesn't work," Zukowski said. "And the reason is streamers can play a demo. Streamers can't play a screenshot. They need the demo, and when they play it on stream, it brings their audience."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/-the-public-are-kinda-crazy-palworld-developer-pocketpair-underlines-the-human-cost-of-success" target="_self" data-discover="true">'The public are kinda crazy:' Palworld developer Pocketpair underlines the human cost of success</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the majority of the talk was focused on demos, Zukowski also elaborated on what else developers can do to get exposure for their demo and game. It involves launching a page, gathering some sort of audience, and then running a playtest in order to drum up interest. Developers only have one shot at releasing a demo and leaving a good impression, and a playtest can give them a chance to "iron out the kinks" according to Zukowski. He estimated, from extensive data, that 100 concurrent players may be the threshold to being discovered by the algorithm.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The real revelation is that a demo launch is front page featuring now," Zukowski said. "It's big, but you have to have an existing audience and you have to have enough players simultaneously playing your demo for the Steam algorithm to put you on the front page."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zukowski was insistent that you can't just throw a game page up on Steam, launch a demo, and then expect success. It's not that easy for developers to get discovered in a marketplace that sees thousands of new games released every year.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The playtest is like priming the pump," Zukowski said. "It's getting the pump working."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/senua-s-saga-hellblade-ii-dominates-bafta-games-awards-2025-nominations" target="_self" data-discover="true">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II dominates BAFTA Games Awards 2025 nominations</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zukowski brought up several specific examples of games using this method within the past year. Some had been near dormant for months, sometimes years, before running a playtest and then launching a demo. Those games' wishlist numbers shot up soon after.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A common mentality: release demos close to a game launch, so that players could try the experience and have it be top-of-mind when the full game hits. Zukowski refutes that idea, saying that momentum doesn't play a role in smaller game launches. The games are so small that a big influx of players, especially a long way from launch, is better than trying to set up some sort of curated event around launch.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The good, the bad, and the AI slop">The good, the bad, and the AI slop</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One point brought up during Steam Next Fest was that these new demo and discovery features elevated almost every game who utilized the feature on Steam, including what some journalists called "AI slop."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Day one of Next Fest, everyone gets a certain amount of impressions," Zukowski said, adding that wishlist numbers will impact how many impressions a game may get at first. On day two, Zukowski pointed out that Steam had given visibility to everyone, including games many considered poor quality. "That's Steam giving everyone visibility."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Steam's algorithm then gives certain games more of a boost based on impressions and other statistics. Games that don't get that attention will sink to the bottom, having wasted their chance at gaining players while showcased on the front page.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/astro-bot-and-black-myth-wukong-take-the-lead-in-gdca-2025-nominations" target="_self" data-discover="true">Astro Bot and Black Myth: Wukong take the lead in GDCA 2025 nominations</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The system that Steam is using for demos is brand new. It's not even a year old in its current iteration. The main question that popped into my mind was, "How well with all this work in a few years after demos have flooded the store just as much as other games have?" Zukowski's answer was that discoverability isn't that much of an issue to begin with.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He showed me a graph that he had removed from his talk, as it would "take too much time to explain" as part of his current presentation. It showed how many games were released per year on Steam and how many games of that number actually received more than 50 reviews.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From 2019 to 2024, several thousands more games were released each year, culminating in over 18,000 games in 2024. However, only a little over 4,000 of those games actually received more than 50 reviews. The same went for every year, where only a fraction of the games released picked up any traction on Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think the problem is that [...] a lot of people are making their first game. They don't know how to make the type of game the Steam audience likes, or aren't skilled enough, or it's just their first game. I think the biggest limiting factor is not visibility, Steam gives us a ton of visibility," Zukowksi said, adding that Steam players have a certain taste. "Demos give everyone a better chance to see these games and make a judgement."</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has been an massive success for publisher Capcom, but not everybody's happy on PC, where the game has been repeatedly lambasted for its poor performance. Finally, however, a month after its release, Capcom has revealed a first round of performance-related PC improvements is coming later this week.
</p>
<p>
Capcom shared the news in a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter/">lengthy post from Monster Hunter Wilds game director Yuya Tokuda</a> over on the official Monster Hunter website. After thanking players for their support amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-rises-beyond-another-impressive-milestone-in-first-month">Wilds' impressive 10m sales milestone</a>, Tokuda began detailing some of the improvements the developer is targeting in response to player feedback.
</p>
<p>
The big one, for PC players at least, is the promise of improved game stability. "The team is continuing to identify stability issues and make improvements where possible," Tokuda wrote, "especially on the Steam version. This will be an ongoing process, where we'll aim to make continual steps forward in this area and respond to critical issues."

<p>
The good news is Capcom's first round of performance-related PC improvements is set to arrive very soon - as part of Monster Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1 this Thursday, 3rd April. This'll include a promised reduction in VRAM usage, as well as an upgrade to the DirectStorage version on Steam - both of which "should result in an overall improvement in stability for our PC players", according to Capcom.
</p>
<p>
Notably, VRAM usage and DirectStorage issues were both highlighted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">Digital Foundry's review of Monster Hunter Wilds on PC</a>, in which Alex Battaglia detailed the games "profound performance problems" and "substantial" technical issues. At the time, Alex advised "caution" for higher-end GPU owners, but flat-out recommended anyone with lower-end graphics cards "avoid" Wilds until Capcom could improve the situation - so hopefully this week's update will bring meaningful changes ahead of promised "continued improvements" in future patches.
</p>
<p>
Away from PC performance, Tokuda highlighted some other areas the team is targeting. There's talk of weapon balance adjustments, for instance, which are set to be implemented "gradually" with each new title update. As for quality of life changes, Capcom says it's currently looking to make it easier for players to access information they require through UI/UX improvements, alongside "additional adjustments... to further enhance the overall feel of the game to curate an even smoother gameplay experience."
</p>
<p>
Capcom says to expect changes making it easier to restock items, check skill information, participate in multiplayer quests, and use the Seikret. Additionally, improved camera behaviour during hunts is also on the developer's to-do list. More generally, the team is planning to "take a wider look at overall gameplay flow, which encompasses a range of things, such as the in-game economy, balance and other areas." This, it says, will "require more time for preparation".
</p>
<p>
Alongside the aforementioned PC performance improvements, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-content-update-detailed-ahead-of-next-weeks-release">this week's Monster Hunter Wilds title update</a> introduces a new social hub and a range of new monsters, including bubble dragon Mizutsune, a High Rank version of Zoh Shia, and the arch-tempered Rey Dau. Notably, Tokuda's blog stresses additional tough monsters are on the way, following criticism of Wilds' low difficulty at launch. May's update, for instance - which previously appeared to be relatively small in scope - will bring tempered variants of Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad. Additionally, more "challenging monsters will also appear in future updates".
</p>
<p>
"We will continue to add new elements and content to make Monster Hunter Wilds even more enjoyable for all hunters through our free content updates," Tokuda concluded, "while at the same time making further improvements and adjustments to the game."

The CEO laughed and gave a big grin before answering that the date is a secret because they want to keep fans excited. </p><p>“The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I’ve ever seen for an entertainment property,” said the former 20th Century FOX President. “And I’ve been around the block a few times and I’ve been in every entertainment business there is, and we want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement.”</p><p>Of course, he fails to mention that at this stage Rockstar Games likely hasn’t committed to a release date yet.

And we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation. I don’t always get it exactly right, but that’s what we’re trying to do.”</p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006">We at <em>Kotaku </em>predict, based on various factors</a></span>, that<em> GTA 6</em> will arrive in late October.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-mario-kart-9-1851772264?_gl=1*g6doqr*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQ0NzM3OS40Ni4wLjE3NDM0NDczODIuNTcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-mario-kart-9-1851772264?_gl=1*g6doqr*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQ0NzM3OS40Ni4wLjE3NDM0NDczODIuNTcuMC4w"> And with theSwitch 2 reportedly launching in June</a></span> and Take-Two’s <em>other</em> big game, <em>Borderlands 4</em>, arriving in late September, I’d hazard a guess that <em>GTA 6</em>'s second trailer might drop in early August or perhaps the last week of July.

            <p>IGN Entertainment (Eurogamer's parent company) has officially announced that IGN Live will run in LA from 7-8 June, 2025.</p>
<p>The fan-focused event, which takes place during summer's video game event season, is being held in downtown Los Angeles at Magic Box @ The Reef. Currently the confirmed list of studios, publishers, and brands includes Netflix, 2K Sports, Lenovo, and Arcade1Up, with more set to be announced soon. IGN Live will feature playable games on PCs, consoles, and handheld devices, plus gameplay and trailer reveals, celebrity panels, merch giveaways, a live DJ and more. It's not just video games, either, with the show aiming to be a celebration of games, movies, TV, comics, collectables and more.</p>
<p>Tickets can be bought now from <a href="http://ign.com/live">IGN</a> at a reduced price compared to buying at the door.</p>
<p>Ticket prices are detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early bird, single day tickets: $15 USD</li>
<li>Early bird weekend/VIP tickets: $30</li>
<li>Regular pricing, single day tickets: $25</li>
<li>Regular pricing, weekend/VIP tickets: $40</li>
<li>Single day tickets at the door: $30</li>
<li>Weekend/VIP tickets at the door: $45</li>
</ul>
<p>Act early if you want the cheapest prices, with early bird tickets only available until 30th April. A VIP pass also includes a goodie bag containing exclusive items valued at $40. You can still save money on the door price if you buy tickets online after 30th April.</p>
<p>If you can't make it to LA in June, IGN will be livestreaming the entire weekend event across IGN platforms, including IGN.com, YouTube, Twitch, social channels, and more.</p>
<p>IGN Live 2024 saw a number of big-name guests and reveals including <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-might-debut-an-unnamed-tolkien-character-ign-live-2024">The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power cast</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/phil-spencer-talks-xbox-showcase-studio-closures-xbox-handheld-and-more-ign-live-2024">Xbox’s Phil Spencer</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/assassins-creed-shadows-why-its-the-right-time-for-the-series-to-go-to-japan-ign-live-2024">Ubisoft discussing Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/johnny-rico-recruits-roughnecks-for-starship-troopers-extermination-ign-live-2024">Casper van Dien talking Starship Troopers: Extermination</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-don%E2%80%99t-offer-4k-output.1150251/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-dont-offer-4k-output/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In just two days, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be fully revealed in its very own Nintendo Direct. Fans have been eagerly anticipating any information about the upcoming console, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/">rumors</a> flying wildly. Some have been relatively tame and logical, while others have been completely outlandish.</p>
<p>One of the more recent rumors is that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support 4K resolution in one way or another. Previous rumors that were announced suggested that this resolution will be available when the console is docked, and that the resolution in handheld will be 1080p.</p>
<p>There have now been recent claims that there won't be 4K support, as the dev kits for the Nintendo Switch 2 don't contain any support for 4K resolution. This news comes from the Game Developers Conference (GDC) that took place in San Francisco earlier in March.</p>
<p>"I heard this from one developer at GDC and also heard it separately in an email, but the dev kits, or some of the dev kits, don't have a 4K output," says Tom Henderson during the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLUrxzSPZhU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">episode of Insider Gaming Weekly</a>. Whether this is true or not is yet to be confirmed by those who have access to the dev kits, but it's also likely that they are unable to confirm anything until Nintendo gives them permission to.</p>
<p>Although a dev kit may not have 4K output, it doesn't necessarily mean that the Nintendo Switch 2 won't support 4K output. Console development kits don't typically match the specifications of the final system, and there is a possibility that a newer dev kit will be released with this potential.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's hard to tell what is true and what isn't about the Nintendo Switch 2, based solely on the little information that is available across the internet. Luckily, the Direct is just around the corner, where we will hopefully find out the specifications, extra features, and price tag of the console. It's uncertain whether any games will be announced during this Direct or whether it will be focused solely on the console itself.</p>
<p>This console comes with new Joy-Cons, which look like they will be more stable overall compared to the first console. Hopefully, a lot of questions will be answered about what to expect from this console for both developers and consumers. Just three days ago, there was a leak of <a href="https://wccftech.com/us-retailer-documents-reveals-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/">US retailer documents</a> that showed the potential pre-order plans, with an expected date for pre-orders opening to be April 9.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Eidos Montréal Lays Off 75 Employees as Work on ‘Mandate’ (Fable?) Ends]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-mandate-fable-ends/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/eidos-montr%C3%A9al-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-%E2%80%98mandate%E2%80%99-fable-ends.1150230/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-mandate-fable-ends/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Canadian developer Eidos Montréal has laid off 75 employees. The studio <a href="https://x.com/EidosMontreal/status/1906728993061020142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the news with the following message shared on social media channels:</p>
<p><em>Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end. It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services. These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition. Eidos Montréal stays committed to deliver its other projects currently in development.</em></p>
<p>Besides the unfortunate (albeit sadly common in the industry lately) fact that people are losing their jobs, the message's wording is definitely interesting. Eidos Montréal singled out the end of a specific work commission as the cause of the layoffs, and the mind cannot but go to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-studio-eidos-montreal-is-helping-out-on-xboxs-fable-reboot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> that the developer had been helping out Playground Games with the Fable reboot. While the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to 2026 earlier this year, it was originally supposed to launch in 2025. It's possible and even likely that Fable is now content complete and Playground Games simply does not need any further help from the Canadian studio as it approaches the polishing phase.</p>
<p>Still, it's unfortunate that Eidos Montréal could not reassign those employees to its other projects. This is not the studio's only recent round of layoffs; it also had to cut 97 employees in January 2024 following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancellation of a new Deus Ex game</a>. It is unclear what else the studio might be working on right now; its latest game is still the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-what-kind-of-name-is-avengers-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underrated Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, sister studio Crystal Dynamics, which worked closely with Eidos Montréal on projects like Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Marvel's Avengers, also <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-team-members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the removal of 17 employees. Crystal Dynamics is also helping out with the reboot of a Microsoft-owned IP, <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-reboot-will-be-a-collaborative-effort-between-the-initiative-and-crystal-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect Dark</a>, in collaboration with The Initiative.</p>

<p>ASUS is teasing something big for its Republic of Gamers (ROG) lineup on social media. In a short video teaser posted on Monday afternoon, ASUS teased what’s next for the ROG Ally. And what’s next is expected to be the rumored ASUS Xbox handheld currently known as Project Kennan.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-launching-partner-gaming-handheld-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rumors</a> and reports, this device isn’t going to be the standalone Xbox handheld that Microsoft is actively working on. Instead, it’s going to be a third-party device that will include Xbox branding.</p>







<p>Specifics on what the device will be remain scarce, including exact details on how it will fit as an Xbox device. A recent report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-is-partnering-with-asus-for-upcoming-gaming-handheld-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Central</a> seemed to make it clear that the system won’t play Xbox games as it will be a “tried-and-true Windows PC in essence”. Instead, it will be act like the current ROG Ally while featuring an Xbox Guide button and “more prominent grips”.</p>



<p>Lastly, it’s also unknown if it will feature any other spec updates over the original ROG Ally or will be similar to the anticipated ROG Ally 2.</p>



<p>What do you think the ASUS-Xbox Handheld known as Project Kennan will include? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows launched on March 20, and it got off to a hot start in the US. The game was the best-selling title overall in the US during its launch week, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3llom4qat5c2g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to analyst Mat Piscatella of Circana</a>. This counts sales through March 22, so Shadows achieved this after only three days.</p><p>Piscatella added that, after three days of sales, Shadows is already one of the top five best-selling games of 2025 in the US based on dollars. In terms of a comparison, Piscatella pointed out that only Capcom's Monster Hunter: Wilds had a better first week in terms of dollar sales in 2025 so far.</p><p>Wilds is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6281">No. 1 best-selling game of 2025 so far in the US</a>. March's complete sales data for the US will be published by Circana on April 23, at which point we will have a better picture of how Shadows sold in March and how it compares to other titles in the

<p>Fighting mobs is fun, but we’re after The First Berserker Khazan’s bosses for the tense, multi-hour fights that leave you wanting to pummel your controller. We’ve rounded up every main boss fight in the game and can tell you how many there are.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-trophy-list-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is one of the hardest Soulslikes I’ve ever played. I’m not sure how Neople managed it, but they’ve put together a collection of unique, challenging, and rewarding boss fights. Very rarely are they unfair, either—a rarity, as when I die in a Souls game, I blame anyone but myself.</p>



<p>The boss fights in Khazan are fantastic. If you’re just starting or wondering how many are left, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-bosses-are-in-the-first-berserker-khazan">How Many Bosses Are in The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This guy… Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 16 main bosses and a further 10 optional side bosses in The First Berserker Khazan.</strong></p>



<p>If you want to beat <a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The First Berserker Khazan</a>, you need to overcome 16 boss fights. Encounters can have several phases, and enemies have a large moveset of attacks they inevitably cycle through.</p>



<p>I had the pain of fighting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-nerfs-hardest-bosses-in-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-patch Viper before it was nerfed</a>, and I can tell you I spent <em>over 2 hours</em> on this fight alone! Your mileage will vary depending on your ability, your patience, and how adept you are at studying and memorizing attacks.</p>



<p>Also, there are ways to make particular boss fights easier. <strong>The Aratra fight—for example—requires you to target the enemy’s weak points</strong> to inflict massive damage. If you coordinate your attack well enough, you can lop off its limbs simultaneously and bring yourself very close to the finishing line.</p>

<p>Eidos-Montreal, a development studio known for Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy and support on games like Marvel’s Avengers and Tomb Raider, has announced a wave of large-scale layoffs.</p>



<p>The Embracer-owned studio posted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eidosmontreal_nous-avons-inform%C3%A9-aujourdhui-les-membres-activity-7312494582850543616-TzUD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a> on Monday afternoon that it was letting go 75 employees.</p>



<p>“Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end,” the article reads. “It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.</p>



<p>“These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition.”</p>



<p>The studio closed its statement saying that it was “committed to deliver” the projects it has currently in development.</p>



<p>Currently, Eidos-Montreal is supporting Playground Games on the Fable reboot that is scheduled to launch in 2026. The game’s delay into 2026 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was recently announced</a> by Playground Games.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Embracer Group about the layoffs at Eidos-Montreal and whether the Fable delay had anything to do with the decision. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article.</p>



<p>What do you make of the layoffs at Eidos-Montreal? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1796/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

Just weeks after a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>-themed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> mod was praised as "amazing" by Larian Studios co-founder Swen Vincke, it's been targeted by lawyers representing Dungeons &amp; Dragons company Wizards of the Coast, and hit with a DMCA takedown.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-baldurs-gate-3-mod-gives-you-another-way-to-romance-sultry-vampire-astarion">Baldur's Village mod released earlier this month</a> after more than a year in development, giving players the chance to explore a new village north of Stardew Valley's Pelican Town that's populated by some "rather unusual" residents. Its Baldur's Gate 3-inspired additions included a romanceable Astarion, alongside a new tavern and more.
</p>
<p>
At the time, its creator, Xun, said the release was just the start, with a storyline for Halsin also planned in addition to more "world-building, background stories, and gameplay". But even this initial version was enough to catch Larian boss Swen Vincke's eye, and he <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1898633725417504953">shared news of its launch on social media</a>, writing, "So much love went into this - amazing work!"

Unfortunately, it seems Dungeons &amp; Dragons license holder Wizards of the Coast was less impressed, and Baldur's Village has now vanished from modding website Nexus Mods after the company's lawyers hit it with a DMCA takedown over the weekend.
</p>
<p>
In a statement <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wizards-of-the-coast-scores-pr-masterstroke-bullies-bg3-stardew-mod-that-had-swen-vinckes-personal-approval-off-the-internet-with-a-dmca/">provided to PC Gamer</a>, Nexus Mods described Baldur's Village - which <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888">remains "under moderation review" on the site</a> at the time of writing - as an "an incredibly creative cross-over to Stardew Valley that the community loves". It optimistically added, "Hopefully, this is an oversight from WotC, who often use external agencies to hunt down violating content, and they will revert their decision. Fingers crossed for Baldur's Village."
</p>
<p>
Larian's Swen Vincke also chimed in to <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1906765058270540219">defend mods such as Baldur's Village on social media</a>. "Free quality fan mods highlighting your characters in other game genres are proof your work resonates and a unique form of word of mouth," he wrote. "IMHO they shouldn't be treated like commercial ventures that infringe on your property. Protecting your IP can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled. There are good ways of dealing with this."
</p>
<p>
Wizards of the Coast and parent company Hasbro have, of course, expressed considerable interest in continuing the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> franchise following the mega-success of Baldur's Gate 3 - despite the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">Larian won't be attached</a> after it instead opted to focus on its own IP.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Hasbro <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">claimed plenty of other developers are "very interested" in continuing the Baldur's Gate series</a>. "We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that," it explained. "And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that."
