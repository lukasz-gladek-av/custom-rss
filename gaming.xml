            <p>A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">mod</a> providing VR support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> is no more, after CD Projekt issued a takedown notice they claim hinged on them not being happy that the mod's creator had stuck it behind a paywall. In response, modder Luke Ross has accused the company of being all about making money.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Many of you have noticed that two of my recent posts disappeared about a week ago. I apologize that I could not comment personally about the fact, because there was an ongoing legal exchange," Ross wrote in a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/another-one-dust-148437771">Patreon post</a> over the weekend. "Now that the dust has settled, I'm even more sorry to announce that we are leaving behind an adventure that so many of you deeply loved and enjoyed. CD PROJEKT S.A. decided that they would follow in Take-Two Interactive Software's steps and issued a DMCA notice against me for the removal of the Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod."</p>
<p>This Cyberpunk VR mod is actually just one limb of Ross' creation, which is dubbed R.E.A.L. VR and essentially serves as a framework offering various VR support forks for a bunch of different games. In order to grab Cyberpunk VR, folks have had to take out a paid subscription to Ross' Patreon (the modder does also list some works for free on <a href="https://github.com/LukeRoss00?tab=repositories">Github</a>). That, according to a post from CD Projekt business development vice president Jan Rosner, was the crux of this takedown strike.</p>
<p>"We have indeed issued a DMCA strike, as it was available as a paid mod (only accessible to Patreon subscribers)," Rosner wrote. "This directly violates our Fan Content Guidelines: we never allow monetisation of our IP without our direct permission and/or an agreement in place. We were in touch with Luke last week and informed him that he needs to make it free for everyone (with optional donations) or remove it."</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I’d like to briefly address the discussion around the “Cyberpunk VR” mod created by Luke Ross. We have indeed issued a DMCA strike, as it was available as a paid mod (only accessible to Patreon subscribers).

</p></div>
<p>That, it would seem, isn't a road Ross is prepared to go down. "As usual they stretch the concept of 'derivative work' until it's paper-thin, as though a system that allows visualizing 40+ games in fully immersive 3D VR was somehow built making use of their intellectual property," the modder wrote. "And as usual they give absolutely zero f***s about how playing their game in VR made people happy, and they cannot just be grateful about the extra copies of the title they sold because of that - without ever having to pour money into producing an official conversion (no, they're not planning to release their own VR port, in case you were wondering)."</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Luke Ross, a pseudonym according to a 2022 report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23190201/luke-ross-vr-real-mod-gta-v-elden-ring-horizon-red-dead">The Verge</a> which claimed the modder was making £20,000 per month from their VR modding efforts, has had a publisher issue them with a strike. As you might have gathered from their earlier mention of Take-Two, R.E.A.L. VR's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, and Mafia trilogy support had a copyright-focused takedown filed against them <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-v-and-rdr2-vr-modder-receives-dmca-takedown-from-take-two-interactive">back in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>As for next steps, Ross used the end of that post to announce that they'd be putting out a VR mod for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> ahead of schedule, "without going through the ordinary testing cycle". On one hand, I understand at least some of the modder's ire at being asked via lawyers to change up how they make their living, but on the other, if the option to go free but with optional donations for Cyberpunk is there, that seems a decent compromise for CD Projekt to have offered.</p>

                <p>In the lead up to its release on March 5, Bungie has revealed the full voice cast for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a>--and it is stacked. Featuring fan-favorites from recent hits like Baldur's Gate 3 and Clair Obscur, TV sci-fi stars, and other notable gaming voices, Bungie is clearly going all-in on Marathon's voice acting.</p><p>In a blog post, Bungie revealed the 33 names that make up the English voice cast for Marathon, many of them instantly recognisable for fans of games and sci-fi. The list includes the voices of some of our favorite Baldur's Gate 3 companions including Jennifer English (Shadowheart), Neil Newbon (Astarion), Samantha Béart (Karlach), and Tracy Wiles (Jaheira). Also from the realm of RPGs are Ben Starr and Rich Keeble, who lent their voices to Verso and Monoco respectively in Clair Obscur.</p><p>Sci-fi fans might recognise Nika Futterman, who voiced Asajj Ventress in the Clone Wars animated series, as well as Elias Toufexis, the voice of Adam Jensen in the Deus Ex series, who later broke into TV sci-fi with roles in The Expanse and Star Trek: Discovery. Some other notable names include Roger Clark who plays Arthur Morgan in Red Dead 2, Morla Gorrondona who plays Eris Morn in Destiny 2, and Erin Yvette, who has appeared in Dispatch, The Wolf Among Us, Hades 2, and more.</p><p>Check out the full voice cast below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Krizia Bajos</li><li dir="ltr">Samantha Béart</li><li dir="ltr">Beau Bridgland</li><li dir="ltr">Ry Chase</li><li dir="ltr">Roger Clark</li><li dir="ltr">Darin De Paul</li><li dir="ltr">Jennifer English</li><li dir="ltr">Dave Fennoy</li><li dir="ltr">Nika Futterman</li><li dir="ltr">Morla Gorrondona</li><li dir="ltr">Reina Guthrie</li><li dir="ltr">Donnla Hughes</li><li dir="ltr">Keston John</li><li dir="ltr">Sohm Kapila</li><li dir="ltr">Rich Keeble</li><li dir="ltr">Elliot Knight</li><li dir="ltr">Erica Lindbeck</li><li dir="ltr">Piotr Michael</li><li dir="ltr">Brent Mukai</li><li dir="ltr">Neil Newbon</li><li dir="ltr">Ariana Nicole George</li><li dir="ltr">Emily O'Brien</li><li dir="ltr">Lee Shorten</li><li dir="ltr">Jason Spisak</li><li dir="ltr">Ben Starr</li><li dir="ltr">JB Tadena</li><li dir="ltr">Fred Tatasciore</li><li dir="ltr">Craig Lee Thomas</li><li dir="ltr">Elias Toufexis</li><li dir="ltr">Oliver Vaquer</li><li dir="ltr">Scott Whyte</li><li dir="ltr">Tracy Wiles</li><li dir="ltr">Erin Yvette</li></ul><p>It's unusual for a game to reveal its full cast ahead of release, though the move makes sense with all the popular voice actors Bungie has on board. Marathon's latest trailer introduces one of many characters players will meet in the world of Tau Ceti--Gantry, the MIDA faction agent. Marathon will have six factions for players to interact with, each with their own network of characters to interact with and mysteries to untangle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbNhSVj6WZM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UbNhSVj6WZM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Marathon is set to release into direct competition with popular extraction shooter Arc Raiders, and its impressive voice cast might just be an important point of distinction for Bungie's entry into the genre. While Arc Raiders has been well received overall, one unpopular element amongst some fans and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">critics</a> is the game's use of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">AI-generated voice over</a>.</p><p>Marathon is set to release on March 5 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-launches-on-march-5-will-cost-40/1100-6537486/" data-ref-id="1100-6537486">priced at $40</a>--the same price point as Arc Raiders. Preorders for Marathon are available now.</p>

Those haven't changed ahead of Marathon's full release, but we now also have a set of recommended specs to size up against.</p>

With reasonable minimum specs, even those with older or less powerful PCs should be able to manage the game on lower settings, too. The specs currently don't say how much system storage will be required to install Marathon, another detail which will likely come closer to release.</p><p>Marathon's development so far hasn't been smooth sailing--originally planned to release on September 23, 2025, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">launch was delayed</a> due to poor player feedback from the alpha playtest. Marathon was also embroiled in a scandal around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">stolen art</a>, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-stolen-art-issue-has-been-resolved/1100-6536649/" data-ref-id="1100-6536649">later resolved</a>, and recently the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-has-lost-its-art-director-just-months-before-release/1100-6537099/" data-ref-id="1100-6537099">game's art director left</a> just months before launch. The game will also launch into direct competition with extraction shooter Arc Raiders, which has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-hits-480000-active-players-on-steam-quadruple-cods-launch-weekend-peak/1100-6536262/" data-ref-id="1100-6536262">hugely popular</a> since it launched last October.</p><p>As one of the projects in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonys-live-service-game-status-report-canceled-released-shut-down/2900-6143/" data-ref-id="2900-6143">Sony's questionably ambitious push into live service</a>, Marathon has drawn <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">comparisons to Concord</a>, the live-service title that notoriously shut down <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/concord-is-shutting-down-after-two-weeks-but-is-that-unprecedented/2900-5747/" data-ref-id="2900-5747">within two weeks of launch</a>.

            <guid>1410535</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As is customary for any game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-marathon-release-date-following-xbox-store-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirms a release date and opens up pre-orders</a>, <strong>Bungie</strong> revealed the official <strong>Marathon</strong> PC system requirements by updating the store page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on <strong>Steam</strong></a>.</p>



<p>The good news is that any PC released in the past six to nine years should be able to run the game. The minimum graphics card requirement is either <strong>NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 1050 Ti</strong> (released in <strong>October 2016</strong>) or <strong>AMD's Radeon RX 5500 XT</strong> (launched in <strong>December 2019</strong>). Intel's option, the <strong>ARC A580</strong>, is much more recent, having been released in <strong>October 2023</strong>, but that's only because Intel entered the GPU market much later.</p>



<p>Overall, it is quite obvious that Bungie aims for Marathon to be playable on a vast number of computers, making the extraction shooter accessible to as many users as possible.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Marathon</strong> <strong>Specifications</strong></th><th><strong>MINIMUM</strong></th><th><strong>RECOMMENDED</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</td><td>Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i5-6600 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</td><td>Intel Core i5-10400 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>8 GB RAM</td><td>16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti (4 GB) / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (4 GB) / Intel Arc A580 (8 GB, with ReBAR on)</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 2060 (6 GB) / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT (8 GB) / Intel Arc A770 (16 GB, with ReBAR on)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>DirectX</strong></td><td>Version 12</td><td>Version 12</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Then again, this was always their philosophy, even with 2017's <strong>Destiny 2</strong>. For comparison, we've also included the PC system requirements of Bungie's previous game release. Marathon runs on an evolved version of the proprietary Destiny 2 '<strong>Tiger</strong>' engine, after all.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Destiny 2</strong> <strong>Specifications</strong></th><th><strong>MINIMUM</strong></th><th><strong>RECOMMENDED</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</td><td>Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i3 3250 3.5 GHz or Intel Pentium G4560 3.5 GHz / AMD FX-4350 4.2 GHz</td><td>Intel Core i5 2400 3.4 GHz or i5 7400 3.5 GHz / AMD Ryzen R5 1600X 3.6 GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>6 GB RAM</td><td>8 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 2GB or GTX 1050 2GB / AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 4GB or GTX 1060 6GB / AMD R9 390 8GB Memory 8 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>105 GB available space</td><td>105 GB available space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Anyway, the most interesting aspect of the Marathon PC system requirements is that they really open the door to a <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> port. On paper, Nintendo's hybrid console should definitely have enough power to run the game, especially since it supports NVIDIA DLSS, whereas the GTX 1050 Ti does not. </p>



<p>Bungie Game Director <strong>Joe Ziegler</strong> did comment on this very topic <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/39409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Japanese website Famitsu</a>. This was shortly after the reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 in April 2025. Ziegler replied:</p>



<p><em>At the moment, we don't have any plans to add any other compatible hardware, but we will consider doing so in the future.</em></p>

            <p>Historical real-time tactics game Strategos is out in early access today, boasting over 120 factions and 250 units based on “the major and minor powers of the ancient Mediterranean”, according to developers Strategos Games. If you are a brazen tomfool, you might summarise it as Total War without the sprawling campaign map element. If you are an <em>excessively</em> brazen tomfool – brazen to the point that a formation of Greek Hoplites would use you as cover while manouvering around some pesky Achaemenid Persian archers – you might also say that “Strategos” sounds like a spiky brand of cereal, rich in essential iron and horse sweat.</p>
<p>We neither of us are tomfools, however. We know better than to write such nonsense out loud. I’ve still yet to play Strategos, but I’ve been reading more about its “command and control” simulation, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/real-time-tactics-game-strategos-aims-to-outflank-total-war-with-over-120-factions-at-launch">covering the news that MicroProse would publish the game</a>, and it does sound like a worthwhile complication of the process of clattering phalanxes together like frying pans.</p><!--more-->

<p>In brief, there’s a gap between giving an order and receiving or executing that order. Orders are issued by generals, rather than arriving magically in every unit’s brain whenever you left-click. To receive an order directly, units need to be within earshot of a general (some generals are louder, making them better commanders). If the general is too far away, they’ll need to send one of a finite number of couriers. Couriers can be intercepted and killed. Do you see? I have played wargames that make communication a feature in this way, but not recently.</p><p>Even if an order is successfully delivered, units may act independently, based on what’s going on nearby. They may choose their own targets. They can be goaded by enemies. Having one of your generals ride up to offer morale support and instructions is one way of countering this, along with keeping units in reserve to plug the line.</p>
<p>Units may also take unprompted tactical breathers after a certain amount of time spearing each other’s bellies, rather than grinding away till they rout, as in Twar. As the developers explained to <a href="https://strategyandwargaming.com/2025/03/27/is-this-the-new-total-war-strategos-exclusive-interview/">Strategy And Wargaming</a> last March, “[o]ngoing combats can also periodically shift into a mutual ‘passive’ mode where the two sides, although still locked into melee, fall back for a rest during which combats are not resolved and they can rally (and they may hurl some missiles at each other if available), which is part of the ‘Pulse Model’ of ancient warfare that inspired much of Strategos.”</p>
<p>I consider all this very juicy, and I’m sad we don’t have some review impressions to share with you. That said, the game has only just launched into early access, so there’s time yet to flank the bastards and treat them to a vigorous Wot-I-Thinking. The plan is for it to launch into 1.0 in early 2027 or so. The current build includes five historical campaigns, nine reenactment battles, and one map-based campaign, and the devs aim to “add additional scenarios and units (including chariots), along with a more refined map-based campaign”.

            <p>With the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-the-switch-2-getting-more-expensive-soon-nintendo-says-theres-no-immediate-impact-but-will-keep-an-eye-on-volatile-memory-market">menace of price hikes</a> looming over every piece of gaming hardware and early 2026 reports that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Nintendo Switch 2 was below Switch 1's sales curve over its first December period</a> in the US and Europe, many have started to wonder if we were looking at a strong start with bad legs for the newest hybrid console. But, in Japan at least, that doesn't seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japans-console-game-market-grew-by-138-8-in-2025-driven-by-the-nintendo-switch-2/">Automaton West</a> (from original reports by Kadokawa Game Linkage and Famitsu), we have learned Japan's console game market saw a big boost year-on-year in 2025, with a 138.8 percent growth across the board. It reached 418.13 billion yen, which amounts to around $2.64 billion. These figures are based on physical software and hardware sales as reported through the end of 2025, so they include the bulk of the Christmas shopping we typically see every December.</p>
<p>Mind you, we haven't seen the more specific data for the Christmas period, but overall, Japan's console game market is looking remarkably strong, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pierre485.bsky.social/post/3mbwj5lp24s2o">outpacing Switch 1's first year</a> (and every other console's, it seems) in Nintendo's home turf. Things look even better when we take into account that digital sales, DLC, and in-game purchases are not accounted for in the aforementioned reports.</p>
<p>Moreover, the original Switch continued to perform well given its age and the presence of Nintendo's second hybrid console, with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendos-japan-dominance-continues-as-switch-2-fuels-40-market-growth-in-2025/">1.52 million units reportedly sold in 2025</a>, putting it above PS5's sales in Japan last year. It must be noted <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466770/2025-japan-sales-comparison-charts-through-december-switch-2-vs-ps5-vs-xbox-series-vs-switch/">other charts aren't as optimistic</a>, but the information shared shows the Japanese market favours Nintendo's hardware.</p>
<p>When it comes to best-selling physical games in Japan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> (2.668 million units) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> (2.534 million units) conquered the top spots with the Switch 1 &amp; 2 releases combined.</p>
<p>Looking at what early 2026 has in store for us and the strong focus on iconic JRPG series like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-demo-now-available-on-switch-2-and-xbox-series-xs-so-you-can-check-out-performance-on-nintendos-console">Final Fantasy</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-are-developing-this-to-be-the-masterpiece-version-dragon-quest-7s-producer-on-taking-a-scalpel-to-the-structure-of-a-classic">Dragon Quest</a> making the jump to Switch 2 before first-party heavy hitters start to arrive, we're not expecting a slowdown of that market's growth.</p>

            <p>Marathon has swiftly climbed Steam's Top Sellers list following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-release-date-reportedly-leaks-via-xbox-store-pre-order-trailer">reveal of its 5th March release date</a>.</p>
<p>Bungie's extraction shooter, which has up until now lived in the realm of closed betas and behind-closed-doors tests, was made available for pre-order overnight. In those midnight hours many wallets were opened by keen members of the public, landing on the number seven spot.</p>
<p>It lies currently behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, at third. There's also EA Sports FC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a>, and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Those three currently ranking well due to substantial discounts on the PC marketplace. Marathon is currently retailing for £34.99 / $39.99.</p>

<p>It's a great first showing for the extraction shooter, which has until now had to power through a turbulent development process at Bungie. Only last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-art-lead-departs-bungie-of-his-own-volition-ahead-of-games-new-release-date">its art lead left the company</a>, and prior to that the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-still-lives-as-bungie-announces-new-closed-technical-test-ahead-of-public-update">underwent drastic design changes</a> to the game following a mixed reception to initial public betas.</p><p>It follows on the heels of Arc Raiders, another extraction shooter which took the world by storm last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-robot-bosses-set-to-become-even-scarier-pve-escalate-embark">growing in popularity through the winter holidays</a>. Whether that game has set the stage for wider extraction shooter popularity, allowing Marathon to launch to a comparable level of success, will be made clear as early as March.</p>

<p>As detailed in the (very brief) patch notes, the app is now live in Argentina, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo Today! - Version 2.3.0 Update</strong></p>
<p>Now available in Argentina, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you've yet to experience the delights of the Nintendo Today! app, it's essentially Nintendo's primary way of communicating key announcements and updates since its launch in 2025. You'll often find that new trailers or even Nintendo Direct announcements will be made on the app before they go live on social media or YouTube.</p>
<p>One such announcement was for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, the single-player spin-off title for the <strong>Splatoon</strong> series on Switch 2. A debut trailer was released on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/splatoon-raiders-a-new-splatoon-spin-off-is-confirmed-for-switch-2">10th June 2025</a>, but we've yet to hear anything more about this mysterious title. Here's hoping Nintendo will host a fresh Direct soon and reveal its secrets.</p>

<p>However, it wasn't actually the mod itself that the team took issue with. Rather, CD Projekt requested the removal after Ross put his mod behind a Patreon paywall, effectively selling its content. This is at odds with the Cyberpunk 2077 studio's official 'Fan Guidelines' document, which states any content created with its games can not be used for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>"We're happy for you to accept reasonable donations in connection with your fan content, but you're not allowed to make people pay for it or have it behind any sort of paywall (e.g. don't make content only available to paid subscribers)," <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/fan-content">this document reads</a>.</p><p>Despite this, Ross has admitted he feels "bitter" about being forced to remove his Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod. "In the end it amounted to the same iron-clad corpo logic: every little action that a company takes is in the name of money, but everything that modders do must be absolutely for free," Ross wrote in a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/148437771">very to the point Patreon post</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/luke-ross-cyberpunk-pc-vr-mod-dmca-takedown/">roadtovr</a>).</p>
<p>"As usual they stretch the concept of 'derivative work' until it's paper-thin, as though a system that allows visualising 40+ games in fully immersive 3D VR was somehow built making use of their intellectual property," Ross continued.</p>
<p>"And as usual they give absolutely zero f***s about how playing their game in VR made people happy." According to <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/2013313704004120925?s=20">@SynthPotato</a>, Ross generates $20k monthly from paid mods.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, our Ian took Ross' Cyberpunk 2077 mod out for a spin. You can check out his adventures in the video below. </p>

<p>Despite the legal issues between Ross and CD Projekt, he is not giving up his VR modding endeavours. In his same post, he announced the release of a new VR mode for Larian's acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>

			<p>Two days ahead of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-playground-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct 2026</a></strong> showcase, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MP1st has shared</a> a <strong>Fable leak</strong> featuring lots of concept art created by <strong>Playground Games</strong>. This is a great way to assess the game's visual style, if nothing else, as well as to preview some of the locations that players will find in the game during their explorations.</p>



<p>For example, one of the images shows a sign for <strong>Bloodstone</strong>. Those who played Fable II might remember that in that game, it was a modest-sized port town that harbored criminals and pirates. Geographically, it was surrounded by the deadly swamp, <strong>Wraithmarsh</strong>, to the north, east, and west, and by the ocean to the south, making it virtually isolated from the rest of <strong>Albion</strong>. </p>



<p>Besides Bloodstone, the concept art pictures are a mixture of scenic environmental shots of rolling hills and forests and creepy dungeon-like locations. </p>

<p>According to official info shared by Microsoft, the Xbox Developer Direct 2026 showcase, airing on Thursday, January 22 at 10 AM Pacific Time, <strong>will offer the first proper, in-depth look at the Fable reboot</strong>. Indeed, even the official X account of the game wrote:</p>



<p><em>We’ve been working on Fable for a really, really long time. It’s time to show you more. Much more. Tune in to Developer_Direct at 10 AM PT (6 PM GMT) on 22nd Jan for our first deep dive into the game.</em></p>



<p>The very first rumor that Playground, developer of Forza Horizon (also featured in its sixth incarnation in the showcase), would undertake the considerable effort of bringing back the fantasy action RPG series originally created by <strong>Lionhead</strong>, appeared in <strong>early 2018</strong>. It's therefore been at least <strong>eight years of waiting</strong> for fans, though it might not be long before they can actually play the game, given that it is scheduled to launch this year on PC and Xbox Series S|X. According to VGC sources, Fable <a href="https://wccftech.com/playground-fable-rumored-launch-day-date-ps5-forza-horizon-6-wont-wasnt-ready/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might also launch on <strong>Sony's PlayStation 5</strong> at the same time</a>, though this remains unconfirmed. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Razer CEO Explains Why Grok Powers Its New ‘Waifu’ Hologram]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/razer-waifu-holograms-why-powered-grok/</link>
            <guid>1410502</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>That’s a pretty interesting and loaded title. Recently, Razer unveiled Project AVA, an AI-powered desktop device that houses a holographic representation of what has been described as a ‘waifu’. The cylindrical device uses Grok AI and dynamic personality metrics to embody a 3D hologram with ‘human-life vision’ and ‘full contextual awareness’.</p>



<p>The <strong>conceptual </strong>device has been described as an ‘enthusiastic gaming wingman,’ and it sits on your desk, organizes your day, and keeps you company with a conversational model backed (at least initially) by Elon Musk’s Grok AI.</p>



<p>Recently, the firm’s CEO explained why they’re leading the way with Grok, given all the recent scandals.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-is-project-ava-using-grok-because-it-s-the-best">Why is Project AVA Using Grok? Because It’s the Best</h2>



<p>Project AVA was unveiled by Razer at CES, emerging as one of the most innovative (and perhaps invasive) inventions at the show. It’s a small, Razer Chroma-backed tubular device that has minimal inputs and maximum practicality, apparently. It has an HD camera, microphones, an LED system, and, most importantly, a 5.5-inch, 3D holographic avatar projection system.</p>



<p>Razer has unveiled a string of ‘companions’ that users can pick from to power their wingman device. It’s a relatively bizarre lineup, but it’s worth stressing right now that there’s no release date for the device. Razer has <strong>no idea </strong>when Project AVA will leave the conceptual stage.</p>



<p>First, there’s AVA, a throbbing circle of Razer-branded energy that doesn’t take a human form. There’s Kira, your traditional anime waifu model, dubbed the ‘loveliest gaming partner’, and then there’s Zane, a muscular, traditionally handsome, and tattooed male model.</p>



<p>The roster continues with Lee “<em>Faker</em>” Sang-hyeok, one of the most recognizable esports pro players in the world and a certified GOAT of the League of Legends space. Finally, you’ve got SAO, a corporate female character modelled on <strong>kawausosuki0513</strong>, a Japanese ‘office lady’ creator.</p>



<p>Right now, the biggest point of contention around Project AVA is the fact that <strong>Grok </strong>is the AI engine powering its development. In recent weeks, Grok has come under intense fire as the AI model has been stripping people naked on Twitter (now known as X) at the simplest request.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent interview</a>, Razer’s CEO, Min-Liang Tan, explained <strong>why </strong>the company had gone with Grok first:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Well, I think for Grok, you know… We picked Grok also because it’s got the best conversational AI at this point, for us. At least from a conversation, personality side of things, and that’s one of the things that we looked at from a tech perspective. Now, ultimately, however, we do see Ava as an open platform, right? </p>



<p>If somebody wants to be able to use a different model, it’s one of the things that we’re taking into consideration. And we are multi-model, right? But I think from a perspective of an avatar, from a conversational AI for CES, we feel that Grok has a really great conversational AI model at this point. So that’s one of the reasons why we picked Grok.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When asked how Razer can ensure user safety, Tan said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think we’re still in the early days. Now, the question, I think, where it’s going to lead to is something that we need to discover, right? And, of course, we need to discover it in a responsible manner to figure out how we do that, and put the right guardrails in. What do we do in terms of AI, in terms of this? That’s something that we’re learning.</p>



<p>Now, maybe it’s even a hardware lock that we need to put in. We don’t know, right? Or it’s more software guardrails that we have to put into place at this point in time. </p>



<p>That’s one of the reasons why we decided to put it as a concept first out there, to get the feedback. And we’re not gonna be able to think of everything, but we would like to be able to get as much thought, concern, and care into the product before we actually launch it.</p>
</blockquote>

            <guid>1410496</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has revealed the group draw for the Six Invitational 2026, setting the stage for one of the largest esports events in the entire business. What has been uncovered reflects a stunning selection that should make for some exciting match-ups straight out of the gate.</p>



<p>As usual, the tournament begins with four groups of five teams competing for spots in the playoffs. The two-bracket split will be populated by these teams, but not <strong>every organization </strong>in the group stage will advance to the final round. Four teams will be eliminated before they can make it anywhere close to the final stage.</p>







<h2 id="h-six-invitational-2026-groups-confirmed">Six Invitational 2026 Groups Confirmed</h2>



<p>The group draw for the Six Invitational 2026 was completed recently by Ubisoft:</p>



<p><strong>Group A:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Weibo Gaming</li>



<li>M80</li>



<li>FEARX</li>



<li>Ninjas in Pyjamas</li>



<li>Project Zero</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group B:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Elevate</li>



<li>Wildcard</li>



<li>Daystar</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group C:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Shopify Rebellion</li>



<li>DPlus</li>



<li>Black Dragons</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group D:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Spacestation</li>



<li>Team Secret</li>



<li>Fluxo W7M</li>



<li>ENTERPRISE Esports</li>



<li>Oxygen Esports</li>
</ul>



<p>It could be argued that Group C is the most energetic and unpredictable of the bunch. FaZe Clan, G2, and Shopify Rebellion are all the most legitimate contenders for the trophy, and we’re sure to see sparks fly in Paris before the playoffs even kick off.</p>



<p>Group D is also bursting with potential. Every team there has a credible playoff claim, with Team Secret especially coming in as the Esports World Cup 2025 champions.</p>



<p>As always, the Six Invitational will remain relatively hard to pin down. It has one of the largest single prizes in the esports space, so you’d best believe every team taking to the stage will fight tooth and nail to secure the biggest chunk of it.</p>

<p>Realising the "simple concept" with limited resources wasn't easy</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8031ea1de504b"><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8031ea1de504b/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon</a> has become a global powerhouse over the past 30 years, the series' beginnings didn't necessarily happen overnight.</p>
<p>In a special video message during the <a href="https://youtu.be/9HNNugGXKQ0">New York Game Awards</a> recently (where Pokémon received the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-to-receive-prestigious-award-at-the-15th-annual-new-york-game-awards">prestigious 'Andrew Yoon Legend Award'</a> for industry impact), The Pokémon Company president and CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara reflected on the origins of the series and the challenges the team faced during the development of the original Pokémon games.</p>
<p>These Game Boy titles started as a "simple concept" where players would be able to catch creatures and trade them with friends. However, making this come to life wasn't exactly easy with such "limited resources" and it actually required a lot of "trial and error" over a six-year time frame, according to Ishihara, who worked as a producer on these titles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tsunekazu Ishihara</strong><strong>:</strong> The development process, however, was not quite as easy. It took a great deal of trial and error to figure out how to actulize this idea with the limited resources we had available.</p>
<p>In the end, it took six years to complete the first games, Pokémon Red and Pokémon Green.</p>
<p>Still, we all felt confident in the main gameplay elements that would become the foundation of the Pokémon video game series: catch, raise, trade, and battle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team believed this formula would work because the elements were tied to "fundamental experiences" everyone had as children when they were out catching bugs, growing plants and raising animals.</p>
<p>Ishihara also admits he was "uncertain at first" about the game being able to appeal to people overseas, but he realises now it's been able to transcend language, cultural barriers and truly has the "power to connect the world". He adds how he's using this as a "major driving force" when it comes to producing the next game, and how to make it "more enjoyable for everyone".</p>
<p>Pokémon will celebrate its 30th anniversary next month on Pokémon Day, which takes place on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

Although fans were informed the team would be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/kirby-air-riders-dev-team-disbanding-soon-game-updates-also-ending">disbanding soon</a>, game director and video game legend Masahiro Sakurai mentioned in December how there might be one more round of adjustments.</p>
<p>Nintendo's Japanese customer support page on social media has now revealed new update data for Kirby Air Riders will be arriving soon. As for what riders can expect, there'll apparently be various bug fixes and balance adjustments.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adjszrtm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>As usual, the latest updates for the game are not compatible with past replays, so be sure to save replay data before downloading this latest patch. Here's a rough translation detailing this next update, and official patch notes will follow when the update goes live.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We plan to release update data for "Kirby's Air Rider" soon. This update data will include bug fixes and balance adjustments. After the update, it will no longer be compatible with replays of the update data Ver. 1.2.0 or earlier, so you will not be able to play replays that have already been saved in "Temporary Saved Data" or "Replay with Data" in "Replay". If you have a replay that you want to keep, please "record" on the playback settings screen of "Temporary Save Data" or "Replay with Data" before downloading the update data, and convert it to a video file. *A microSD Express card is required to use this function."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although this might be one of the last significant updates for Kirby Air Riders, the in-game events have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/kirby-air-riders-in-game-events-are-planned-to-run-for-a-year-after-launch">scheduled to run for a "year after launch"</a>.

</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="fd6f39dd87feb"><a title="Sonic Boom" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd6f39dd87feb/sonic-boom.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>There have already been multiple layoffs and closures in the opening weeks of 2026, and in case you missed it, Meta (formerly Facebook) last week announced the closure of three studios. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/armature-studio-founded-by-metroid-prime-devs-has-been-shut-down">Apart from Armature</a>, one of these developers was Sanzaru Games, which was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/facebook-acquires-sanzaru-games">acquired by Meta in 2020</a> and had been working under Oculus Studios in its Reality Labs division.</p>
<p>If the name doesn't ring a bell, the California-based team was one of the developers who worked on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/sonic_boom_rise_of_lyric">Sonic Boom</a> games. This includes the 3DS titles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/sonic_boom_shattered_crystal">Shattered Crystal</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/sonic_boom_fire_and_ice">Fire &amp; Ice</a>. Before working on these particular games, it had helped out with multiple <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/sly_collection"><strong>Sly Cooper</strong></a> titles, and was founded in 2006 by former Activision developers.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/meta-begins-jobs-cuts-after-shifting-focus-from-metaverse-to-phones?srnd=undefined">reported by Bloomberg</a>, this closure is part of Meta's plans to cut more than 1,000 jobs from its Reality Labs business, which was working on Oculus VR hardware and software. Twisted Pixel (located in Texas and known for games such as <strong>The Maw</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ms_splosion_man">Ms Splosion Man</a> and <strong>Marvel's Deadpool VR</strong>) was also impacted.</p>
<p>Sonic Boom was a spin-off of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mastersystem/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> series. It also included an animated television series, comic series and toy line. Back in 2020, Sonic fans actually got an update about the show, with the executive producer Bill Freiberger mentioning at the time how it wouldn't be making a comeback.</p>
<p>In more recent years, Sanzaru worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spyro_reignited_trilogy">Spyro Reignited Trilogy (Year of the Dragon)</a> and until its closure had been developing new VR titles.</p>

It marks a return to the world of Undecember, this time with more streamlined gameplay built around three core character classes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not already familiar with the series or need a little refresher, Undecember was a quarter-view hack-and-slash game with no classes. It introduced a world created by 12 beings who shared their powers and brought peace and prosperity to the land. In time, they came to be worshipped as gods. But then a 13th being arose, who introduced evil to the world and corrupted mankind.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/dark-december-gameplay-2-1765405948907.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark December brings you back to that world, but many years before the events of Undecember and in an alternate timeline. The camera can now be moved freely, and it also marks a departure from the complex progression systems of its predecessor, instead focusing on timing, skill use, and streamlined growth in three character classes: Berserker, Raven, and Morgana. The system is designed to be more approachable, so players new to the series can feel comfortable jumping into this prequel without missing anything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Berserker is your classic melee-based physical attacker that uses a two-handed greatsword to unleash powerful strikes. It has very high HP and defense, so it’s meant to rush headlong into enemy hordes and take out large groups with its heavy strikes. Their unique ability sends them into a berserk state, which speeds up their attacks and makes them capable of dishing out big damage very quickly.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/dark-december-gameplay-1-1765405948907.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Raven is an archer class that can use multiple different arrow types to take advantage of enemy weaknesses. It’s quick and agile, so it’s designed to constantly stay on the move while keeping enemies at arms’ length and picking them off with precise strikes. Where Berserker is meant to soak up damage, Raven is meant to avoid it altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That leaves Morgana, a spellcasting class that wields a staff and can summon spirits. It uses the staff to unleash poison and fire spells, while summons are infused with elemental energy and can be used for a variety of things. Some deal damage matching its elemental type, while others apply debuffs. So Morgana is all about strategy and versatility, combining their abilities to deliver steady, continuous damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, each of these classes unlock unique skills as they level up, and these can be further powered up through skill upgrades and the Support Rune system. Each skill has two Support Rune slots, where you can equip Support Runes that provide all kinds of different bonuses. Each skill also has its own type and attribute, and Support Runes can only be equipped in slots that are compatible with that type and attribute.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/dark-december-gameplay-3-1765405948907.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Offensive runes provide bonuses like increasing damage, crit rate, or expanding AoE range. Defensive runes can do things like shielding you or reducing damage. And utility runes can enhance status effects, reduce cooldowns, or increase skill usage count. These are just a few examples of each type, there are plenty more options to choose from. And you can freely swap out Support Runes at any time, giving you the chance to test out lots of different builds or change things up strategically for particular fights or situations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While progression has been simplified and combat has been streamlined, that doesn’t mean it’s easy. It’s not about memorizing one ability loop you can simply use over and over to decimate everything. You need to learn what works in what situations, adapt to new things being thrown at you, and use your abilities at the right time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The central narrative of Dark December will take you through several different locations, and a waypoint system allows you to teleport between those areas quickly as well as return to a central hub area.

		<p>The Sims Mobile is no longer playable as EA has turned off the servers for the game, having removed it from the Google Play Store and App Store back in October, along with monetary purchases. It had been a pretty long running game, having launched in March 2018 receiving regular content updates right through to October 2025.</p>
<p>On January 6th 2026, EA had made build mode and create a sim items free, having told players to spend any in game currency before that date as there would be no monetary refunds for unspent currency. Unlocking everything meant those who still had the game installed could try out everything in the game without restriction.</p>


<p>As The Sims Mobile requires an internet connection there is no way to play the game going forward, unless EA decides to suddenly resurrect it. When the announcement was made in relation to The Sims Mobile’s shut down the development team said, <em>“Thank you for making&nbsp;The Sims Mobile such a creative, kind, and imaginative community over the past seven years. We’ve loved seeing everything the community has created, and we hope this final chapter helps complete everything you have planned and more before we say goodbye.”</em></p>

<p>Over the last couple of weeks, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, Nikita Buyanov, busied himself posting cryptic images and brain teasers on social media. Eventually, an entirely new website surfaced, seemingly hosting some minigame teasing <strong>a new project called COR3.</strong></p>



<p>Now, <strong>another </strong>website has surfaced, this one hosting nothing more than a countdown and a blurry video that, when examined, represents a first-person shooter that scales back to show an entire planet. That countdown expires on February 1st, which is when everyone believes we’ll get something tangible about this game.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-cor3-and-why-is-it-exciting">What is COR3, and Why is it Exciting?</h2>



<p>Nikita Buyanov is one of the creative minds who has directed the growth of Escape from Tarkov over the last decade. He has dedicated his life to the extraction shooter, a fact that he pointed out when we interviewed him as part of a recent episode of Access Granted.</p>



<p>He recently took a cryptic turn on social media, posting stacks of enigmatic images and puzzles, which his followers set to decoding.</p>



<p>Before long, <a href="https://os.cor3.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a website had been found</a>, an interactive thing that placed users in some kind of post-apocalyptic bunker with a retro-futuristic computer system bursting with lore, teasers, and world-building elements. As it stands, we have <strong>little idea </strong>what COR3 is, but the best guess is that it’s Buyanov’s new project.</p>



<p>We say ‘Buyanov’ and not <strong>Battlestate Games</strong>, as right now, there’s <strong>no indication </strong>that Battlestate is linked to COR3. The COR3 trademark, dug up by eagle-eyed netizens, is in Nikita’s name, and nobody <strong>but </strong>the man himself has been sharing content related to COR3 online.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>On <a href="https://m7.repnodemassive.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the countdown website</a>, a clock is running out, and it’s set to expire on February 1st at 3 PM GMT / 10 AM EST. Nobody knows what will happen when that countdown hits zero, but it’s a safe bet that something more tangible will be revealed by Buyanov, and whoever else he’s working with (if anyone).</p>



<p>COR3 appears to represent some kind of alternate reality title set in a universe where Earth suffered from a catastrophic event. There’s talk of interplanetary travel, space pirates, and ships adrift in the great beyond, all of which couldn’t be further from Escape from Tarkov, the leading extraction shooter.</p>



<p>It’s set hundreds of years in the future, but the COR3 website that users could interact with boasted grounded elements like modern-day armor items and traditional computers.</p>

          <p>It’s been nearly three years now since <em>Destiny</em> maker (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/01/sony-to-acquire-bungie-destiny-series-for-3-6-billion/">Sony subsidiary</a>) Bungie <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/remember-marathon-bungies-pre-halo-and-destiny-shooter-its-back-kind-of/">formally announced</a> a revival of the storied <em>Marathon</em> FPS franchise. And it has been about seven months since the game’s original announced release date of September 23, 2025 was <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">pushed back indefinitely</a> after a reportedly poor response to the game’s first Alpha test.</p>
<p>But today, in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/bungie-unveils-marathon/">a post on the PlayStation Blog</a>, Bungie revealed that the new <em>Marathon</em> would finally be hitting PS5, Windows, and Xbox Series X|S on March 5, narrowing down the month-long March release window <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">announced back in December</a>.</p>

      Today’s pre-rder trailer revealing the <em>Marathon</em> release date.

<p>Unlike <em>Destiny 2</em>, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/destiny-2-will-become-free-to-play-later-this-year-fully-cross-platform/">transitioned to a free-to-play model in 2019</a>, the new <em>Marathon</em> sells for $40 in a Standard Edition or a $60 Deluxe Edition that includes some digital rewards and cosmetics. That mirrors the pricing of the somewhat similar <em>Arc Raiders</em>, which recently hit 12 million sales in less than 12 weeks.</p>
<h2>A new kind of <em>Marathon</em></h2>
<p>Unlike the original <em>Marathon</em> trilogy on the ’90s Macintosh—which closely followed on the single-player campaign corridors and deathmatch multiplayer of the original <em>Doom</em>—the new <em>Marathon</em> is described as a “PvPvE survival extraction shooter.” That means gameplay based around exploring distinct zones and scavenging for cosmetics and gear upgrades in exploratory missions alone or with up to two friends, then seeing those missions “break into fast-paced PvP combat” at a moment’s notice, according to the game’s official description.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Someone at either developer Build a Rocket Boy or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-hitman-io-interactive-roadmap-update-metacritic-2000623129"><span>publisher IO Interactive</span></a><span> hasn’t given up on </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>, because several high-profile content creators are still being sponsored to play the game following its December 2025 patch.</span></p> <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/mindseye-devs-are-still-sponsoring-streamers-following-mass-lay-offs-and-single-digit-players-on-steam/"><i><span>FRVR</span></i></a><span>, YouTube creator and Twitch streamer </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsJS-SfccUg"><span>Criken</span></a><span>, whose channel currently boasts over 1 million subscribers, recently uploaded a sponsored video of their </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>playthrough on January 14. While Twitch and YouTube are full of sponsored video game playthroughs, Criken’s video has people scratching their heads since </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>has barely peaked above 30 concurrent players on Steam since its disastrous June 2025 release.</span></p>  <p><span>Several commenters on Criken’s video were shocked to discover that the creator isn’t just playing the game as a joke. “Oh I thought you were playing this because it’s basically a meme at this point, I can’t believe they’re still sponsoring people,” wrote Didorial. “They’re still sponsoring? I’m impressed that the company wants to keep this game alive. (7 current players on steam btw),” wrote Dazcoolman.</span></p>

 <p><span>Stranger still, he’s not the only high-profile creator who seems to be getting paid to produce new videos for the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108"><span>lousy open-world shooter</span></a><span> at the moment. A quick browse through the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/mindseyepartner"><span>#MindsEyePartner</span></a><span> tag on YouTube shows that YouTubers like SweeetTails, Blue Thunder Gaming, and Willyrex (the latter of whom has over 17.2 million subscribers) have all been sponsored to play the game in the last month following its version 6.1 patch on December 18. According to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TSq8ZaG7gnY"><span>Blue Thunder Gaming</span></a><span>, the PR team that reached out with the sponsorship even agreed up front to let creators “say whatever [they] want” about the game.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000661015" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661015"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661015">YouTube / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Sponsored streams were also a part of the marketing strategy around <em>MindsEye</em>‘s original launch, but ended up </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-steam-reviews-bugs-glitches-update-refunds-1851784312"><span>resulting in viral moments</span></a><span> that only further solidified the shooter’s reputation for being boring and busted. Twitch streamer CohhCarnage was even asked to cancel his sponsored livestream of the game </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lre7iutssk22"><span>mere minutes after</span></a><span> he’d just told his viewers it was about to begin.</span></p>

 <p><span>This all leads to the inevitable question: why? To be frank, I don’t have an answer for you, as the sponsored videos and streams don’t seem to have made much difference to the player numbers on Steam. Maybe things are going better on console. Admittedly, the game does look to be in a better state now than it was at launch, but I think the damage has already been done. A </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span> turnaround story this is not. At least for now. </span></p>
