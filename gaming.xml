<p>"Joining in solidarity with our fellow members at ZeniMax Workers, OneBGS_MTL, and all of CWA Union, we push for increased job security, compensation transparency, and flexibility to continue creating the games we love."</p>
<p>The statement concludes with: "As we work towards our first contract with Microsoft, we hope you'll join us in voicing your support as we serve as an example for all, into the next era of game development."</p>
<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1814441444624445637">reportedly</a> "recognised the union".</p>
<p>Bethesda is just one of several studios that have moved to unionise in response to more than 15,000 job cuts and studio closures over the last 18 months. Back in April, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-100-avalanche-studios-developers-are-unionising">Just Cause developer Avalanche confirmed plans to enter a collective bargaining agreement with Swedish unions</a>.</p>
<p>GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Dring recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">took a closer look at the layoffs for Eurogamer</a>, offering insight into what, exactly, is going on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24202033/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review-capcom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>When <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/12/23758032/capcom-showcase-2023-news-trailers">debuted during Capcom’s digital summer showcase last year</a>, I didn’t pay much attention. It looked like a high-concept action RPG based in Japanese mythology that took some of its artistic cues from another one of Capcom’s highly stylized games, <em>Okami</em>. And while I have nothing but love for action RPGs and Japanese folklore, nothing in that initial trailer, nor the ones that followed, showed me enough of what the game was about to be interesting.</p><p>It was only after trying the game’s demo at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24180304/summer-game-fest-2024-best-games">this year’s Summer Game Fest</a>, and later getting my hands on a copy, that I finally <em>got it. </em>And damn is this game worth getting into.</p><p>In <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, you play as Soh, the guardian of the priestess Yoshiro who you must protect and guide through the land helping her purge it of evil demons. In an email to <em>The Verge,</em> art and game director Shuichi Kawata wrote that it wasn’t intentional that the marketing surrounding <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> made it unclear what kind of game it was. </p><p>“This title is a mix of several genres,” Kawata wrote. “And we imagined the possibility that there would be a range of impressions people would have.”</p><p><small>I defy you to guess what kind of game this is based on this launch trailer.</small></p><p>Kawata described <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> as a “maiden” defense game. Gameplay is divided into three parts: day, night, and a base-building cycle. During the day, Soh goes about mountain villages blighted by demonic corruption. He cleanses the corruption and rescues villagers who will help him in the night cycle to come. At night, demons attack, hoping to make their way to Yoshiro to kill her. To stop them, Soh assigns villagers different jobs, each with their own abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, and positions them throughout the village to prevent the demons from reaching Yoshiro. Once Yoshiro gets to the end of a village, it is permanently cleansed, making it a new base Soh and the villagers must repair before moving on to the next location.</p><p>I love how <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> cleverly iterates on tower defense games. You assign roles to villagers with crystals, a resource gained through defeating demons at night and cleansing a village in the day. Not every villager can perform every role, and some roles aren’t combat viable, though they have other benefits. During a day cycle, I might assign a couple of my people to the thief role, sending them out to dig up more crystals or rations that act as health potions for Soh and the villagers. But thieves are useless at night, requiring me to burn up precious time and crystals to reassign and redeploy them. Sometimes, I might not have enough crystals, having used them all to buy the expensive sumo wrestler role — who draws demons’ attention to themselves and away from Yoshiro — or the acetic who uses their power to freeze demons in their place, making them easy pickings for the archer’s bow or the woodcutter’s axe.</p><div><p><em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> offered the kind of challenge that makes my puzzle and strategy-obsessed brain sizzle with excitement</p></div><p>In addition to simply completing a stage, each village battle also comes with a set of special parameters that, if met, will get you extra goodies. One parameter required that I use no more than 1,900 crystals. While that initially seemed trivial, that goal got a lot harder to meet because that stage <em>also</em> required that I give 1,500 crystals to Yoshiro to complete it. I was then left with only 400 crystals for my villagers — an extremely tight budget when the basic roles like the archer and the woodcutter are 50 crystals a pop, while the more powerful roles cost between 150 to 300. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</p><div><figcaption>The woodcutter is one of your basic villager roles, specializing in melee attacks.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Capcom</cite></p></div></div><p>I really enjoyed that tension between strategic assignment and deployment. Do I spend the crystals to get the powerful roles, leaving me with fewer defenders? Or do I risk my larger but weaker army getting overrun? <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> is also special in that it never fell into the trap of being too trivial. In other tower defense games, it’s possible to set your defenses so well that you can sit back and watch the game play itself. That never happened for me. No matter if I had a glut of resources and well-placed villagers, I always had to stay on high alert, often coming to Yoshiro’s rescue with one of Soh’s ultimate attacks. At every level, <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> offered the kind of challenge that makes my puzzle and strategy-obsessed brain sizzle with excitement.</p><p>While it’s not a prominent feature, there’s also an interesting bit of narrative to the game. Each villager you rescue has a name and a bio, and I enjoyed reading their stories and how they all intertwined. These people became more than nameless units to throw at a demonic horde, but members of a living, breathing community made up of married couples, family, and friends. It made for a beautiful message that reminded me of the aphorism “we all we got.”</p><p>In <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em>, Soh is the only one with martial training while everyone else is farmers, fishermen, and housewives. Instead of waiting for outside help or succumbing to the relentless demons, those ordinary people took up what little arms they had to defend their homes and families. In a political climate that seems determined to roll back protections for women, queer people, and people of color, it’s nice to see that message. Help isn’t coming — we are the help. It’s a sentiment supported by what Kawata shared as <em>Kunitsu-Gami’s</em> main theme. </p><p>“Challenge is the driving ethos for this game,” he wrote. “We face various conditions seriously and push forward without fear.”</p><p><small><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is out now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Xbox Game Pass.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>House of Golf 2 has been delayed to August 16th, Starlight Games has announced. The reason given for the short delay from the original release date of July 25th is that the team are working on a few more improvements and tweaks. House of Golf 2 features collaboration with Razer too, incorporating things like Razer inspired golf balls. The game features over 100 hundred courses, four player local multiplayer, and online leaderboards.</p>
<p><iframe title="House of Golf 2 Coming 16th August 2024!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RDRcECcicjU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Razer collaboration also includes Chroma, Axon, and Cortex. The Razer Chroma feature in House of Golf 2 creates a visualisation effect that introduces a spectrum of colors from the game’s environments into players’ homes and device setups, when synchronised with lighting ecosystems. Razer Axon brings together various dynamic wallpapers to gamers, which can be<br>
synced to Razer Chroma enabled devices. Razer Cortex is a game performance booster.</p>
<p><em>“House of Golf 2 is a labour of love and we’ve chosen to push back the release of the game across all platforms to ensure that the game is available for all to enjoy and have an entertaining experience,”</em> said Gary Nichols, Founder of Starlight Games. <em>“The slight delay of release allows us to implement a final few tweaks and additions to the development of House of Golf 2, and players be able to put their putting skills to the test across many challenging yet wild courses.”</em></p>
<p>House of Golf 2 is available to wishlist on all available platforms.</p>

<p>In our preview, Stefan said, <em>“The fundamentals of House of Golf 2 are pretty similar to the menagerie of other minigolf games that have teed off in recent years – your Golf With Friends, and your Golf Gang, and all the rest – as you are represented purely by a ball in the game world, pick a direction and strength, then tap to send the ball flying in that direction. It’s far less technical than a PGA Tour game with multi-tap shot power, spin and all the rest – that said, a pull back to power option is there in the options for those that want it.”</em></p>
<p>House of Golf 2 will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

But a Genestealer infestation changed all that. After the engineering feat of building the Dust Wall to surround Hive Secundus to keep the infestation in, it was levelled with orbital weapons and left to rot.&nbsp; Although still sealed off from the rest of <em>Necromunda </em>through the Dust Wall, there are still ways in, and treasure hunters and adventuring nobles brave the ruined depths in the hope of finding wonders. This brand new <em>Neromunda</em> box set opens up Hive Secundus for you and your gangs to explore, and we check out what's in the box, and how to use it in our&nbsp;<em>Necromunda: Hive Secundus</em> review.</p>
<p><em>Necromunda</em> is a skirmish wargame from Games Workshop, and rather than featuring clashes from mighty warriors like Space Marines, it features gang battles with the detritus of humanity battling among the lower levels of a gigantic hive city on the planet <em>Necromunda</em>.</p>

<h2>What's Included In Necromunda: Hive Secundus?</h2>
<p><em>Necromunda: Hive Secundus</em>&nbsp;is a new box set for the gang warfare skirmish game, and it includes everything you need to jump into a game. Included in the box is:</p>
<ul><li>Secundan Incursion Gang (8x&nbsp;Van Saar Tek-hunters, 2x Orrrus Spyre Hunters, 1x Caryatid Prime)</li>
<li>Forces of the Malstrain (6x&nbsp;Malstrain Genstealers, 4x&nbsp;Malstrain Tyramites, 8x&nbsp;Brood Scum)</li>
<li>A rulebook containing a full copy of the rules for Necromunda,&nbsp;a self-contained Underhells Campaign, and the rules for the 2 included gangs</li>
<li>Necromunda Bulkhead Terrain set (containing 5x&nbsp;barricades, 2x&nbsp;doors and 2x gaming mats)</li>
<li>A deck of Hive Secundus cards featuring Archeo-loot cards, Underhells Territory cards, Malstrain Forces fighter cards, and blank fighter cards</li>
<li>Tokens, a ruler, 2x&nbsp;blast markers and a flamer template, 2x&nbsp;rules reference sheets, and 16x Necromunda dice</li>

<p><em>Necromunda: Hive Secundus </em>is technically a starter set for <em>Necromunda</em>. It includes everything that 2 players need to play, including 2 gangs, all the components, and a full set of rules. But Hive Secundus isn't <em>Necromunda</em> in the traditional sense and features a gang battling against the Malstrain forces in an attempt to find loot. It acts as an expansion for <em>Necromunda</em> for existing players, but can be used as a jumping-in point for new players, and we'll tell you how to take Hive Secundus forward as a new player below.</p>

<p><em>Necromunda: Hive Secundus </em>includes a brand new setting for your games of <em>Necromunda&nbsp;</em>and 2 new gangs to use as part of the campaign.</p>
<p>The first gang, the Forces of The Malstrain don't act like a standard gang and each scenario gives a number of Malstrain points with which to build their force. Malstrain points are simplified from gang credits, and a scenario might give the Malstrain player 10 points, with Brood Scrum and Tyramites costing 1 Malstrain point, and Malstrain Genestealers costing 3. The Malstrain Genestealers aren't as powerful as those that stalk the rest of the universe, but they're still extremely deadly for the gangers of Necromunda.</p>

They build their gang as normal, but scenarios have a mix of random and custom fighter selections (but always include the Spyre Hunter) for deploying into the scenario. In the Hive Secundus box, you get a group of Van Saar Tek-Hunters to use. These are specialist gangers with access to specialist equipment and weaponry and a unique post-battle action across the 4 specialist types.</p>

<h2>As A New Player, How Do I Take Necromunda: Hive Secundus Forward?</h2>
<p>If you're coming into <em>Necromunda</em> as a new player with Hive Secundus, then you'll have everything you need to play standard games of <em>Necromunda</em>, except one of the standard gangs to use. The 2 gangs in Hive Secundus can't be used as they come in normal <em>Necromunda</em> games, so you'll need to pick up the 'House of' book for the gang you want, along with the miniatures for the gang you wish to play. For example, if you want to play Escher, you will need the House of Blades and the Escher Gang box.</p>
<p>If you wish to keep playing the gangs in Hive Secundus, the next book, <em>Necromunda</em> Book of Desolation might have more options to continue with the Malstrain and the&nbsp;Secundan Incursion Gang.</p>

<p>The <em>Necromunda Hive Secundus</em> box is a fantastic experience. The 2 included gangs and the campaign work very well together, and while it's not a regular <em>Necromunda</em> experience, it's still very enjoyable. The boxed set comes with a 2d map and the rules for that are great for beginners, who can upgrade to the full gang and 3d scenery experience after. Existing players will be able to test their gangs against the forces of the Malstrain and play through the campaign and earn some new loot in the process.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy Necromunda: Hive Secundus?</h2>
<p>If you're a veteran <em>Necromunda</em> player, this offers a new opportunity to test your gang through a campaign against the Malstrain. If you're a new player, this box gives you everything you need to play Necromunda, but you will have to pick up a gang, their rulebook, and some more scenery to get the full <em>Necromunda</em> experience.</p>

			<p>Except for the UK, Xbox isn't doing well in Europe. This isn't exactly news, but lately, sales of Microsoft's consoles have really <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-flatlining-europe-publishers-questioning-support-ps5-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flatlined</a> in the continent, reportedly leading some publishers to question whether supporting the platform makes sense for them.</p>
<p>Last week, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-considering-ceasing-marketing-of-xbox-consoles-in-emea-shifting-focus-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> a rumor that Microsoft was seriously considering winding down marketing efforts for Xbox consoles in certain EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) markets to focus solely on Game Pass, its subscription service.</p>
<p>Now, Xbox EMEA Marketing Director Michael Flatt has openly spoken about getting much fewer funds than Sony's PlayStation division. In an interview <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/xboxs-marketing-boss-fight-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Marketing Week</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>From a funding point of view, we need to work really hard against our competition. Regrettably, they (PlayStation) outspend us. They’re blessed with marketing funds that we’re just not able to enjoy. But that’s totally fine. We adopt what I would call a more fiscally responsible approach to media investments. We’re not blessed with huge media budgets, so we have to be quite scrappy really, and quite tenacious to fight for funds that would probably go somewhere else.</em></p>
<p>Needless to say, hearing a marketing lead of a Microsoft division talking about having to be scrappy will raise a few eyebrows. After all, Microsoft is a $3.25 trillion market cap company, currently the second in the world after Apple, although the two have traded spots a lot recently.</p>
<p>Moreover, Microsoft has spent a lot of money in the past few years to acquire publishers like Bethesda for $8.1 billion and Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. Why wouldn't they market Xbox appropriately?</p>
<p>Well, it is a bit of a chicken and egg problem. Microsoft probably has evaluated that there isn't enough interest in the consoles, so spending more money on marketing would be futile. Then again, if the Xbox EMEA team had a bigger marketing budget to begin with at the start of the generation, perhaps things could be different now. Either way, it's certainly a bit odd to see an executive speaking plainly about being underfunded.</p>
<p>Xbox is certainly in a tough spot in Europe right now. Will they try to stage a comeback or throw in the proverbial towel, at least when it comes to marketing? Let us know your opinion in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-hotfix-1-0-3-addresses-frame-generation-issues-fixes-memory-leak-addresses-abort-mission-exploit-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nexon has deployed The First Descendant hotfix 1.0.3 across all platforms, addressing frame generation issues as well as an 'abort mission' exploit, and more.</p>
<p>The new patch for the shooter is labeled as a hotfix but contains quite a few fixes and changes. Those playing the game on PC will be happy to learn that the 1.0.3 hotfix fixes a memory leak when using frame generation. In addition, it fixes a memory leak while playing in windowed mode. Also, the patch aims to resolve an issue of temporary frame drops when opening inventory with DLSS Frame Generation as well as an issue where the frame limit was not restored when using frame generation.</p>
<p>Another interesting change is that this new patch adds a new 'Away from keyboard (AFK)' option to the player report menu. "We have been keeping a close eye on recent trends regarding AFK, and we agree that AFK hinders the game play for other players". the developers <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2604920?headlineId=1015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explain</a>. "However, we believe that a cautious approach is required in this matter. This is because AFK judgment mechanisms can sometimes be bypassed with simple shooting or moving actions, and the AFK kick system can be exploited for other purposes."</p>
<p>The First Descendant hotfix 1.0.3 also comes with a fix for an exploit with the party member’s ‘Abort Mission’ system. Following this patch, the Void Shard attribute will now be displayed on the map directly. "<span lang="EN">We discovered and fixed an issue where a party member’s ‘Abort Mission’ system was being exploited to repeatedly play the Void Fusion Reactor without consuming any Shards", Nexon writes. "While addressing this glitch, we also considered why players might resort to using it. We realized that the transition from Shard farming to actual Void Fusion Reactor missions was quite inconvenient and tedious. Therefore, we not only fixed the bug but also increased the amount of Void Shards obtained and improved the farming process to make it more convenient."</span></p>
<p>The full release notes for this hotfix <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2604920?headlineId=1015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>The First Descendant is available worldwide now for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.</p>

No paid character downloadable content or grinding required. We’ll have cosmetics to help sustain the game, but you won’t be able to buy a competitive edge.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We know the typical lifeblood of a fighting game comes from character releases as the game grows, so our plan is to make them unlocked and playable for everyone as soon as they’re available.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/an-experts-guide-to-the-best-model-kits-for-adults-in-2024.932502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-model-kits-for-adults<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Model making is a great hobby, but knowing how and where to start is another story. It can be overwhelming for novices: Injection-molded plastic models have been on the market for close to a century, and there are kits of everything from military vehicles to sports cars and anime robots to household objects. Looking at some of the incredible creations of seasoned model builders, it might seem like you need an entire workshop of tools and equipment, the steady hands of a brain surgeon, and years of practice to make something cool-looking, but that’s not the case.</p><p>To make getting into this delightful pastime a whole lot less daunting, I’ve put together a list of kits that are worth checking out. Quite a few of these recommendations are based on my own firsthand experience. Up top are kits that don’t require glue, paint, or much else in the way of supplies, but keep scrolling for some recommendations if you’re ready to get your hands dirty and possibly stuck together. Head all the way to the bottom for essential tools and supplies you’ll need for model kits and where to buy these excellent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-lego-alternatives">LEGO alternatives</a>.</p><h2>No Paint? No Glue? No Problem!</h2><p>For a very long time, model kits needed to be glued together and painted. Nowadays that’s not always the case. Most model companies offer entry-level kits that come pre-colored and can be easily snapped together. Keep in mind that some kits that advertise themselves as “for beginners” or “entry level” are <em>so</em> simplified it's hard to count them as traditional model kits. However, plenty still offer a satisfying challenge without requiring any messy stuff like paint and glue. Case in point: Gundam! If you’re looking for a beginner route to model kits, and you think giant robots are cool, then either of the following two kits is a good start.</p><div><div id="202708" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Bandai Hobby HGUC RX-78-2 Gundam Revive Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>1:144 Scale. Recommended age: 15 years and up.</p></div></div><div id="202709" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Bandai Hobby MG Gundam RX-78-2 Version 3.0 Action Figure Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>1:100 Scale. Recommended age: 15 years and up.</p></div></div></div><p>Gundam kits are classified by grade, the two most common being High Grade (HG), which are usually $15-30 and about 6 inches tall when complete, and Master Grade (MG), which’ll run you around $30-50 and are a couple of inches taller, but usually a lot more detailed and complex. There’s also Real Grade, which is somewhere between HG and MG; Entry Grade, which is for absolute beginners; and Perfect Grade, which is for advanced builders.</p><div><div id="202710" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby 174 Wing Gundam Zero</h3></p><div><p>The Wing Zero HG kit comes with a twin buster rifle, beam sabers, pile driver shield, and machine cannons.</p></div></div><div id="202711" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Gundam IBO Gundam Barbatos, Bandai Spirits MG 1:100</h3></p><div><p>The Gundam Barbatos 4th form has appeared as an MG, with a reproduced Gundam frame of internal mechanics as well as a recreation of the Suit's Ahab Reactor!</p></div></div></div><p>Gundam modeling (or Gunpla, short for “Gundam plastic models”) has become so massively popular, it warrants its own list of recommended kits. But for anyone who doesn’t care for big anime robots (Why not? Who hurt you?) I've rounded up a bunch of kits that take the same no-fuss appeal of Gundam kits applied to other properties and subject matter.</p><h2>Star Wars Model Kits</h2><div><div id="202715" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Bandai AT-ST 1:48 Scale Star Wars All Terrain Scout Transport Walker</h3></p><div><p>Y-Wing Starfighter kit has an inner cockpit</p></div></div><div id="202716" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Bandai Hobby Star Wars 1:72 Y-Wing Starfighter Building Kit</h3></p><div><p>AT-ST from Star Wars was recreated as a detailed model kit with articulated legs, rotating head and weapon systems.</p></div></div></div><p>Bandai has given the Gundam treatment to a number of other beloved pop-culture properties, most notably Star Wars. A good number of characters and vehicles have been turned into pre-colored snap-together kits. Some lend themselves to this treatment better than others; some of the less colorful subjects may look a little bland without a bit of paint or finishing touches. A <a href="https://youtu.be/1i61SlfOD34?si=e9PDSG4ArZ1XNa9R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>basic wash</u></a> or some <a href="https://youtu.be/raCbD4nkFIc?si=f7ywCKx4JKydISNl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>dry-brushing</u></a> will really make the details pop on the more monochromatic Original Trilogy machines.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><div id="202720" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Boba Fett, Bandai Spirits Hobby 1/12 Plastic Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>Your favorite Star Wars bounty hunter is now a 1/12 scale model kit with a full array of accessories including interchangeable hand parts.</p></div></div><p>Boba Fett is nice and colorful and looks great without a drop of paint, which speaks to the character’s inherently kitbashed aesthetic. The Stormtroopers looked a little too plain out of the box, so my esteemed colleague <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/b-altano-ign"><u>Brian Altano</u></a> and I personalized them a bit:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Bandai Stormtrooper Model Kits</h3></div></output><h2>Anime Model Kits</h2><div><div id="202722" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Son Goku Figure-Rise Standard Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>Recreate iconic scenes from Dragon Ball Z with this standard model kit of Son Goku featuring an upgraded Muscle Build-Up System.</p></div></div><div id="202723" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Uzumaki Naruto Figure-Rise Standard Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>Enjoy another fan-favorite anime build for Uzumaki Naruto, with superior tooling in the joints. Achieve action poses and signature attacks such as “rasen GAN”, “rasen shuriken”, and “shadow Clone jutsu”!</p></div></div></div><p>If full-color injection-molded action figure model kits work for giant anime robots, why not anime people as well? Bandai’s Figure-Rise line has tackled <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/dragon-ball-z">Dragon Ball Z</a>, Naruto, Digimon, and even some of the human characters from Gundam.</p><h2>Giant Robot Model Kits (That Aren’t Gundam)</h2><div id="202725" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Kotobukiya Kotobukiya Metal Gear Solid: Metal Gear Rex (Black Ver.) Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>From Konami's series Metal Gear comes an epic model kit of the nuclear-armed bipedal tank Metal Gear Rex. Buying options vary and range from $154 and up.</p></div></div><p>Currently sitting at the top of my pile of shame is Kotobukiya’s 1:100 scale Metal Gear Rex. Part of my procrastination is because it’s a big beautiful model kit and I don’t want to mess it up, but also because I built the Metal Gear Sahelanthropus, which was an extremely frustrating build. This may have been because I got it partially assembled from a friend and picked up where he left off, but the more intricate and top-heavy design of the Sahelanthropus also doesn’t lend itself as well to a physical kit. From what I’ve read, Rex’s more squat form makes for a more straightforward build. Unsurprisingly, a mech designed for a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps1-games-playstation">PlayStation 1 game</a> literally has less moving parts than one designed for the PS4.</p><div><div id="202874" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Good Smile Company  Horizon Forbidden West: Thunderjaw Moderoid Plastic Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>This giant model kit comes in at 15" in length and will help you get into (mechanical) beast mode. It's an amazing build for Horizon Forbidden West fans and robot fans alike. Prices vary but start at $107.</p></div></div><div id="202875" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Good Smile Company  Aliens: Power Loader Moderoid Plastic Model Kit</h3></p></div></div><p>Good Smile Company’s Moderoid line of kits come pre-painted, which is great if you just want to put something together and display it, but they’re also on the pricier side.</p><div><div id="202971" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Store Bandai Hobby - Imaginary Skeleton – 1:32 Imaginary Skeleton Tyrannosaurus</h3></p><div><p>Who doesn't want to own a cool miniature dino? This 1/32 T-Rex model kit is highly rated for its attention to detail, including impressive skull and two rows of special teeth on the upper jaw. It's posed in a crouching position so it's ready to jump!</p></div></div><div id="202974" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Store Triceratops</h3></p><div><p>If T-Rex isn't your thing, you can build the 1/32 Triceratops version of this Bandai model kit at a similar price point!
</p></div></div></div><p>Like a lot of Bandai kits, these dinosaur skeletons snap together and are molded in all the right colors. However, since they’re a bunch of bones, that's actually only one color. That said, for anyone who doesn’t have much confidence in their painting abilities, but still wants to paint <em>something</em>, this might be for you. I tried out a bunch of weathering techniques on mine to make it look appropriately prehistoric, and then made a custom base.</p><div id="202972" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Store 1:1 Cup Noodle</h3></p><div><p>This is a unique and fun model kit for beginners. The inside is filled with 3D scanned noodles, egg, shrimp, and "mystery meat" to bring the food staple to life.
</p></div></div><p>Not quite the weirdest model kit I’ve built (that honor goes to a 1:24 scale urinating dog), but it’s definitely up there. This is basically a Gundam, but it’s soup. It’s completely snap together, though surprisingly, deceptively complex in how it’s assembled. The finished product, without a drop of paint, is impressively hard to differentiate from the real thing, which is funny but also raises some concerns about how closely instant ramen noodles resemble polystyrene.</p><div id="202976" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Aoshima Aoshima Nissan C110 Skyline GT-R Custom White 1:32 Scale Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>This white 1:32 scale Nissan car model kit is affordable, easy to build (with only 30 parts), and fun to display on any collector's shelf.</p></div></div><p>As the name suggests, Aoshima’s The Snap Kit series of model cars are a *snap* to put together, literally and figuratively. Much like Gundam kits, no glue is required and the majority of the pieces come molded in the correct colors. (Stickers are included for the ones that aren’t.) They’re a great option for anyone who’s looking for a quick project that doesn’t require a lot of tools or materials. Without paint, the end result might look a bit more like a toy than a proper replica, but painting is still an option. If that’s the part of the hobby that appeals to you, these’ll get you off to the proverbial races faster.</p><p>I turned The Snapkit’s 2000GT-R Skyline into a beat-up junker, and kitbashed the Prius into a heavy metal post-apocalyptic monster truck. A “Judas Prius,” if you will. That one’s a work in progress; it looks too Halo, not Mad Max enough.</p><h2>Military Model Kits</h2><div><div id="203002" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tamiya Tamiya 35346 1/35 US Medium Tank M4A3E8 Sherman Plastic Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>Meet the M4A3E8, AKA "Easy Eight" model kit, a perfect build and paint project for history buffs and Fury movie fans alike.</p></div></div><div id="203003" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tamiya Tamiya Models M1A2 Abrams Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>The "worlds' strongest tank" but smaller!

The real, full-size ones are frequently painted just one color, but get caked with dirt, mud, grease and grime, which is immensely gratifying to recreate in miniature with dry brushing, washes, and pigments. If you screw up during constructing, just call it battle damage! Tamiya makes some excellent armor kits, along with just about any other type of military hardware and/or accoutrement you could ask for, including but not limited to <a href="https://zdcs.link/oeYDg?object_uuid=cfd6c3fb-50a7-497a-ae84-c528d48b421d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>1:35 scale farm animals.</u></a></p><div><div id="203007" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Hasegawa 1:72 AV-8B Harrier II Plus</h3></p><div><p>This 87-piece build is great for intermediate builders.

A 1:1 scale model is life size, 1:2 scale is 50% the size of the real thing, and so on. However, different subject matter is suited best to certain scales. Cars are usually 1:/24 or 1:32, and the standard for military ground vehicles, like tanks and trucks and infantry, is generally 1:35. Larger aircraft models are 1:48, but 1:72 isn’t uncommon, and when you get into larger naval vehicles it gets even more fractional. There’s plenty of overlap, so if you want a little truck to go next to your 1:48 helicopter, it probably exists somewhere out there. The scale of railroad models is the gauge of the miniature train tracks being used, which I’m not even going to go into here. The point is: You can get a big Harrier jet or little Harrier Jet, or you can buy two big ones and pretend it’s a mommy and a daddy and a baby jet.</p><h2>Car Model Kits</h2><div id="203011" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Hasegawa 621123 Model Car BMW 2002 Tii 1:24 Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>A classic BMW car model kit that brings a little bit of a challenge.</p></div></div><p>I am admittedly not much of a car guy. My dad, on the other hand, is very much the opposite. As a Father’s Day gift one year, I tracked down Hasegawa’s 1:24 BMW 2002 Tii kit, and painted it to look like a real car he’s been tinkering with and repeatedly repairing for the last few decades. He loved the gift and I had a great time putting it together. The amount of detail and tiny parts in a kit like this might be overwhelming for a novice modeler, but it’ll certainly keep you busy.</p><div id="202999" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Revell Revell of Germany 07051 McLaren 570S</h3></p><div><p>Tip: Get yourself the Revell of Germany kits and not the American ones.

The general consensus among the model building community is that the ones from Germany are excellent and the American Revell kits leave a lot to be desired. I’ve only built the American ones, and I wasn’t impressed.</p><div><div id="203014" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Aoshima Aoshima Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 11 1:24 Scale Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>This Lambo includes exclusive parts for the R-SV such as the body and engine, plus scissor doors you can open up.</p></div></div><div id="203015" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Aoshima Aoshima Volkswagen 13AD Beetle 1303S ’73 1:24 Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>VW fans love this kit based on the classic 1973 Beetle.</p></div></div><div id="203016" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Aoshima Aoshima Bunka Kyozai 1:24 Mobile Sales Series No. 8 Yakitori Ryuho Plastic Model</h3></p><div><p>This realistic reproduction of a food truck is adorable!</p></div></div></div><p>What’s your dream car?

Tools include pliers, a carving knife, blades, sanding tools, and tweezers. Plus, it comes in a plastic case to take on the go and store the tools in.</p></div></div><p>This is a great little set of tools to get started. If you get serious, it’s worth investing in a nice pair of hobby shears, side-cutters or “nippers” for cutting the individual parts off the runners. The cleaner the cut, the less trimming, filing and sanding needed during assembly. I have a pair of Tamiya side-cutters that I swear by, but the God-tier option in this department is the “God Hand” line (not to be confused with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/10/god-hand-review"><u>PlayStation 2 game IGN gave a controversially bad score</u></a> to a million years ago).</p><div id="202991" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>anezus 12inch x 18inch Rotary Cutting Mat Double Sided 5-Ply Craft Cutting Board</h3></p><div><p>Multipurpose craft mat and cutting board for model builds, cutting, engraving and beyond.</p></div></div><p>A sturdy cutting mat is helpful for not ruining your dining room table and getting yelled at, and also for easily moving your entire project away from the dining room table because you have company coming over and you don’t want people to see the funny little things you make in your spare time. </p><div id="202988" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tamiya 87038 Extra Thin Cement Glue Fine Tip 40ml</h3></p><div><p>Ditch the glue! Grab some model cement to fill in tiny gaps in your plastic kits or to fuse two pieces together.</p></div></div><p>Model cement is different from regular glue in that it’s actually a solvent that slightly melts the plastic where applied, letting you fuse parts together. This makes it effectively useless on other materials, but for plastic kits, it’s my favorite. A tiny brush is built into the lid, so you just hold two pieces of your model together and apply a drop where they touch. The cement is so thin it’ll usually flow into the crack on its own. </p><h3>Paint:</h3><p>Without venturing into the messy, expensive, and frequently frustrating world of airbrush operation and maintenance, my preferred method of painting models is with a combination of “rattle cans” and water-based acrylics. Primer is key because it gives the surface a finish that paint will adhere to more easily than bare plastic. It’s possible to use regular spray paint from a hardware store, but it comes out thicker and can very easily ruin any fine details. Cans of hobby spray paint produce a fine mist, which is much easier to apply carefully. </p><div id="202982" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>GSI Creos Mr. Hobby B519 Mr. Surfacer 1000 Large Spray</h3></p><div><p>A go-to primer for model kits, Mr. Hobby is a trusted brand for plastic builds.</p></div></div><p>Mr. Hobby’s Mr. Surfacer is an excellent primer that will even out the appearance of a kit prior to painting, covering up imperfections in the plastic while also providing a nice matte finish that paint will stick to really well.</p><div id="202979" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Vallejo Vallejo Basic USA Acrylic Colors Paint Set</h3></p><div><p>The Vallejo brand brings model builders a non-toxic paint set option for model kits and miniatures. Coming in a pack of 16 assorted colors, this set was made for use on both metal and plastic, leaving no brushstrokes behind.</p></div></div><p>Unlike lacquers or enamels, water-based acrylic paint doesn’t need any special thinners or solvents when it comes to mixing or cleanup. Vallejo’s Model Color line comes in every shade imaginable, and the dropper bottles make it easier to avoid spills. </p><div id="202977" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tamiya Tamiya 86034 PS-34 Bright Red Spray Paint, 100ml Spray Can</h3></p><div><p>This classic red paint comes in a 100ml spray can and brings your model kits a nice, matte finish. It's high quality for its price.
</p></div></div><p>Tamiya has a whole rainbow of hobby-grade spray lacquer, which is a great alternative to hand-painting large areas and worrying about brushstrokes. If the model is mostly one color, laying down a base coat and then doing the details by hand is a good system. It’s unlikely you’ll use an entire can of paint on one kit, so if you grab a color or two per kit, over time you’ll likely collect a nice variety.</p><p>Like any good hobby, model making is basically a bottomless pit of enjoyably wasted time (that’s not actually wasted if you enjoyed yourself). No matter how good you are at it, you’ll inevitably come across someone who’s so much better than you it makes you want to give up entirely. On the bright side, a lot of experts share their work online along with handy tips and tutorials for any skill level. On YouTube, a few accounts you may want to check out are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SpruesNBrews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SpruesNBrews</u></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NightShiftScaleModels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>NightShift</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JunsMiniGarage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jun’s Mini Garage</u></a>.

Happy modeling! </p><h2>Model Kit FAQs</h2><h3>Where is the best place to buy model kits?</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Amazon</strong>: You can find some awesome deals throughout the year, but you’ll also want to be wary of resellers marking up prices. If you find something you like, it’s always worth googling it to see what the going rate is.</li><li><a href="https://www.hlj.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HobbyLink Japan</strong></a>: Model making is a hobby that requires patience, and sometimes that starts before you even get the kit. HLJ is the biggest online Japanese hobby shop and has a flat-out overwhelming selection of model kits and supplies, plus toys, statues, gacha machine prices, apparel, books, and even adults-only stuff you probably won’t find many places outside of Japan. The catch? Shipping is usually expensive, slow, or both. The cheapest option can take four to seven months to arrive. Cost is generally calculated based on size rather than weight (model kits are big, but light) so it often makes sense to save up and order a bunch of stuff at once.</li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.megahobby.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>MegaHobby</strong></a><strong>:</strong> I haven’t used this one personally, but it’s also got a great selection and it seems like most stuff ships out in six months or sooner.</li><li><a href="https://store.ign.com/collections/model-kits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>IGN Store</strong></a><strong>:</strong> We've got a modest but solid selection of kits on there, generally of the anime/pop-culture variety. (The best-sellers from HLJ occasionally show up on the IGN Store.) New items are added regularly, and older stuff goes on sale, so it’s worth checking back regularly. </li><li><strong>Your local hobby shop:</strong> No, really! See if there’s a hobby shop near you, and go support it. Those are a dying breed and the people who work there will often actually know what they’re talking about, and it’s also a great place to meet fellow builders of small things. Bear in mind that model building is a broad hobby, and hobby shops usually cater to one particular corner of it. The 80-year-old WWII diorama builder might not know what a Perfect Grade Exia Gundam is, and the kid with a Char Aznable tattoo may not know what a Panzerkampfwagen is, but they both can most likely tell you about drybrushing, panel lines, and gunk wash.</li></ul><p><em>Max Scoville is a senior writer, host and producer for IGN covering video games, movies, toys and collectibles.

One such fan is my wife, who doesn't seem to like any video games at all but absolutely <em>loves </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/super-monkey-ball">Super Monkey Ball games</a>. She played the first Super Monkey Ball game on the Gamecube obsessively and talks about it every time we have any sort of discussion about gaming. So naturally, as soon as I found out Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble was on sale, I immediately picked it up.</p><p>Truthfully, I too am a fan of these games and am very much looking forward to playing it as well. While I coudn't get myself to pay full price for any Switch game, the price of $34.99 feels just right.</p><h2>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble Deal - 30% Off</h2><div catalogid="4e60cab1-e9be-44c0-8a59-b67cb3bd6459" id="205004"><div id="205004" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Super Monkeyball Banana Rumble</h3></p></div><p>While I haven't yet had the pleasure of playing Banana Rumble myself, I have read the IGN review of the game and it convinced me that it is absolutely worth playing. With an impressive set of 200 courses across 20 worlds, we've concluded that this is the best Monkey Ball has been since the GameCube era. Our own Nintendo expert <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/MrHurgy">Logan Plant</a> had the chance to go hands on with the game and here's a quick snippet of what he thought in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review">our review</a>:</p><p>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble was release just last month on June 25 and this is the first and biggest discount we've seen on this game. It's especially surprising after a rather lackluster showing of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-prime-day-nintendo-switch-deals">Prime Day Switch deals</a> earlier this week. If you've been hoping to pick up this game at a discount, now is the time to do so.<br>

<p>After the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ftc-criticizes-xbox-game-pass-price-hike-labeling-it-consumer-harm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly stated that the recent price increase</a> and tier changes to Xbox Game Pass would inflict “consumer harm”, Microsoft has come back with a message of their own.</p>



<p>In a new filing (via <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24888929-20240719-filed-ecf-appellees-microsoft-corporation-and-activision-blizzard-inc-citation-of-supplemental-a?responsive=1&amp;title=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>), Microsoft says that the FTC’s letter is “misleading” and gives an “extra-record account of the facts.”</p>



<p>“It is wrong to call this [Xbox Game Pass Standard] a “degraded” version of the discontinued Game Pass for Console offering,” Microsoft says.</p>



<p>“That discontinued product did not offer multiplayer functionality, which had to be purchased separately for an additional $9.99/month (making the total cost $20.98/month). While Game Pass Ultimate’s price will increase from $16.99 to $19.99/month, the service will offer more value through many new games available “day-and-date.” Among them is the upcoming release of Call of Duty, which has never before been available on a subscription day-and-date.”</p>



<p>The letter adds that the FTC “barely mentioned” during the trial surrounding Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The focus of the trial as that Microsoft could keep Call of Duty off of PlayStation consoles. That, Microsoft says, has nothing to do with the price and tier changes to Game Pass.</p>



<p>“While the FTC has now tried to shift focus to its alleged subscription market, its letter does not map onto its arguments below,” Microsoft said. “Setting aside that it is common for businesses to change service offerings over time, the FTC’s case in all of its alleged markets has always been premised on vertical foreclosure, i.e., that Microsoft would withhold Call of Duty from rivals and therefore harm competition. But even in the alleged subscription market, Call of Duty is not being withheld from anyone who wants it.”</p>



<p>The letter closes with the company saying that there is “no evidence” to harming competition. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>How quickly can you get that very first mushroom in Super Mario Bros. World 1-1? I’m talking down to the millisecond. Shaving off each mushroomy-millisecond, or tackling similarly bite-sized challenges like killing four Oktoroks on a single screen of The Legend of Zelda or leaping to the top of an alien-infested shaft in Metroid, is the most fun I’ve had in Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition, which once again remixes the legendary 1980s library. Unlike WarioWare, NES Remix, and Super Mario 99, though, this time it’s solely focused on speedrunning, and though lacking in challenge variety, it’s still a fun to play these old games in a new way.</p><p>The challenges range from short – such as beating the entire first level of Super Mario Bros – to shorter, and surprisingly the shortest ones are the best. You are ranked on a scale and rewarded with letter grades for the slightest of gains, so repeating the three jumps it takes to collapse boss Wendy O. Koopa into her candy shell in Super Mario Bros. 3 can be reduced to a series of twitchy arcs, mesmerizingly burned into your eyeballs and muscle memory, repeated endlessly to get that precious S rank. It’s fun to challenge yourself, especially knowing that you’re developing skills that can be tested online against others.</p><p>That beautiful precision of Mario’s jump (but not Luigi’s, in both versions of Super Mario Bros. 2) lends itself to speedruns. So, in a different way, do Link’s squat little jabs on The Legend of Zelda’s mathematically rigid, grid-based layout that allow you to race through a dungeon by finding just the right path to swat each enemy before moving on. The best games allow for methodical refinement through repetition. </p><p>On the other hand, there’s Kirby: the slowest, least-maneuverable blob Nintendo has invented; well, besides maybe the Ice Climber or Balloon Fight Guy. All three of them are here, and while the speedruns based around these characters aren’t hard, per se, they just aren’t as fun to repeat. Movements are imprecise and make you feel sloppy – not ideal for an aspiring speedrunner, and that means refining skills in those games is tedious. Thankfully, some of the stinkers like Balloon Fight and Ice Climbers have very few challenges to overcome, so they aren’t much of an obstacle to 100%-ing Nintendo World Championships. However, Kirby’s Adventure, inexplicably, has the most of any game in this collection save SMB3, as if it is some sort of speedrunning icon we should all be aspiring to conquer. It simply is not.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest impediment to aspiring speedrunners is the Switch’s Joy-Con controllers.</p></div><p>The biggest impediment to aspiring speedrunners in Nintendo World Championships is the Switch’s Joy-Con controllers. NES games require precision button presses, and the lag-free Switch handheld mode should be a perfect match (turn on your lag-free Game Mode on that TV when docked!) but the Joy-Cons’ terrible analog sticks, A and B button placement, and whatever those <em>not-a-D-pad buttons </em>are supposed to be, render Nintendo World Championships’ challenges all but unplayable on an out-of-the-box Switch. A clean pair of jumps up that blocky pyramid at the end of Super Mario Bros. World 1-1 at mach speed with the Joy-Con is either impossible, or so unlikely I’ve yet to pull it off once. They simply do not respond to the quickness or accuracy of button pressing the way you need. Luckily, a Pro Controller or other respectable third-party gamepad solves these issues, although the analog stick is still much better than the <em>not-a-D-pad</em> on the Pro. Perhaps the NES controller accessory is the best and most authentic way to play these NES-based games, but I haven’t been able to test it, and the Pro served me well enough.</p><p>The meta goal of Nintendo World Championships is to unlock large grids of things through your speedrun scores and online victories. You can unlock more microgames (there are 156 in total) and cosmetics like pins and pixelated avatars which appear alongside your character in multiplayer. Unlocking everything in a single game’s category unlocks a Legendary challenge, which range from beating an entire dungeon in Kid Icarus or Zelda II, to just straight up beating Super Mario Bros., top to bottom. </p><p>Now, beating Super Mario Bros., even taking it slow, is no small feat – World 8-3 and 8-4 are difficult levels by yesterday’s <em>and </em>today’s standards. But in Nintendo World Championships' runs, dying only sends you back a few seconds to try again. Even though you lose precious time, you won’t need to replay from the start to complete a run – and if you fail to zoom under Bowser’s weird little feet in the end of World 8-4 on the first attempt, you can try again and likely still get the grade you were going for. In this way, I was able to brute force completion of every mission, allowing me to unlock everything and pick and choose what I wanted to replay and refine. I did, however, have to grind for a few minutes occasionally in the online modes to get all the points I needed to unlock every offline microgame quickly (I unlocked and played all 156 in about four hours), and you should be aware that anyone without the required Nintendo Online subscription won’t have access to the online modes (which are some of the fastest point gains) and will have to grind by repeating microgames offline instead.</p><p>Speaking of online modes, there are two: World Championship and Survival Mode. World Championship selects five microgames once a week, giving you seven days to submit your best time across them. The times are ranked world-wide and by your birth year, which sure is amusing – I feel better being judged against my OG NES gamer peers and not the hot new child prodigies with superhuman reflexes. It’s fun to log your best scores, but I wish it would show me what the current leaderboards look like rather than holding them until the end. Competing against a black box (and not being able to watch competitors until after the challenge week concludes) seriously dampens the thrill. </p><p>Meanwhile, Survival Mode is an elimination round that has you playing against the ghost data of other players – basically previously recorded videos of other players that happen on your screen at the same time you’re playing – that you have to best to proceed. The three rounds are always made up of the same games (in alternating orders) that, you guessed it, refresh weekly. This weekly cycle seems oddly limiting – in this competition you at least get results immediately, but after you play the two weekly Survival Mode challenges, all that’s left to do is play them again for points to spend on unlocking items. </p><p>If online modes are a bit stunted by the weekly waits for leaderboards and new challenges, at least the couch competitive mode that allows for up to eight players (sorry anyone stuck with sideways Joy-Cons!) has more immediately accessible content at the ready. In this mode you can compete on one-off games or pre-packaged sets of microgames where points are doled out and a victor declared at the end. The main issue with these is, like in multiplayer WarioWare or Mario Party minigames, those who have practiced the microgames ahead of time will inevitably have a leg up. So inviting seven friends over to watch you win every time is a party foul until they catch up – it’s unlikely that anyone will get the exact pattern right to kill four Oktoroks in the most efficient manner possible on some random The Legend of Zelda screen without having practiced. Luckily, you can choose to practice each microgame as the competition proceeds. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Like NES Remix and WarioWare before it, Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition offers a good way to revisit challenging moments from a selection of classic NES games. The small library has more winners than losers – the shorter and more instantly repeatable the better – and even the silliest of tasks (like refilling Kid Icarus’s life by wallowing in a hot spring) can be goofy fun. Challenging yourself to improve or competing with your friends has some lasting appeal, but the weekly cycle of the online events artificially limits the fun. With its lovingly portrayed and accurate pixel art, music, and gameplay, these sample-sized portions of chopped up ROMs can serve as a good entrypoint for discovering and understanding their appeal for the first time.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s just not every character’s death throw voice line would reveal a possible familial tie. Apparently, eliminating Mei as Juno triggers a voice-over exchange in which the Martian hero says, “Sorry, Auntie!” in response to Mei’s dying gasp. </p><p>This tidbit of gameplay lore is significant not only in that it might confirm the hero shooter’s fourth familial tie among its heroes, but it also seems to debunk a key fan theory about Juno’s identity.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">AUNTIE?! <a href="https://t.co/LYlwwoVNCu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LYlwwoVNCu</a></p>— Hazelet (@HazeletOW) <a href="https://twitter.com/HazeletOW/status/1814361289537495229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 19, 2024</a></blockquote> <h2>Juno and Jiayi</h2><p>Late last year, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/17nfh6j/space_ranger_is_99_jiayi_meis_friend_that_works/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>r/Overwatch</u></a> thread theorized that Juno—then known as Space Ranger—was a woman named Jiayi. According to the thread’s original poster, Mei had a new voice line that would trigger while at Lijiang Control Center, where she would reminisce over a friend named Jiaya, who she went to grad school with. </p><p>Seeing as how this voice line cropped up a month prior to Juno’s reveal at Blizzcon 2023, fans quickly began theorizing that Jiayi was the government name for Juno. At the time, the theory seemed solid, considering Lijiang is the location of Overwatch 2’s in-universe Chinese space station, and Juno’s whole gimmick is that she’s an astronaut hailing from Mars. </p><p>This theory took on new life a day before Juno’s limited-time release when X/Twitter user Pampurins posited that <a href="https://x.com/pampurins/status/1813975199458775106?t=yhhk2G2um7mPg7mZqKKKYQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jiayi could actually be the name of Juno’s mother</u></a>. Pampurin’s revised theory sounds like it's right on the money thanks to the newly discovered voice line interaction.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Shroomiiee (@mushroomiiee) <a href="https://twitter.com/mushroomiiee/status/1814366135648920000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 19, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>While the voice line appears to be considered hard proof that the two are aunt and niece, there’s also a high probability that it is also just a term of endearment, seeing as how the word aunt is commonly used to address older women. IGN has reached out to Blizzard for comment. Regardless, players will likely get an earful of the special voice line interaction during Juno’s weekend of play before her full release comes Season 12 on August 20.</p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

            <p>
Pleasingly bizarre four-wheeled survival game Pacific Drive has officially sold 600K copies, and its developer Ironwood Studios has announced it's celebrating that milestone with a series of content updates throughout the rest of this year. And the first of those updates is now live, offering a bunch of free additions, as well as a bit of daft cosmetic DLC.
</p>
<p>
Pacific Drive's first free update lets players document their travels across the anomaly riddled forests of the Olympic Exclusion Zone using a new photo mode. It's available right from the pause menu and gives player access to various camera settings - including depth of field, focus control, and exposure - as well as numerous aesethetic filters. It's also possible to change weather conditions and time of day while you're in there.
</p>
<p>
Photo mode arrives alongside the new Juke Jet car ability which, once mounted on your station wagon's side rack, provides a horizontal boost that should be handy for dodging and drifting. There're also two new upgrade nodes to be found in the garage's Fabrication Station, unlocking the Smart Matter Deconstructor and Vargas Auto-Pac-Vac. The first lets players toss junk into the Matter Constructor from anywhere in the garage, while the latter deposits materials into the transfer trunk before being filling the rest of the vacuum storage.

<p>
Elsewhere, there's a new performance mode specifically for the PS5 version of Pacific Drive, new points and interest and worldbuilding details in Junctions, a new Coastal Highway map, a new Believer Sticker and Golden Hood Ornament, and more - as outlined in Ironwood's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1458140/view/4370264092250152801">patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
The free update (officially version 1.6.2) arrives alongside a new bit of paid DLC known as the Friendly Dumpster Customisation Pack. This features a selection of trash-themed cosmetic items for decorating your station wagon, including the Re-Cycled Steering Wheel, Dumpster Devotee decal kit, Gift Shifter, Air Trashener, Dumpster Idol, and Cuddle Can.
</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/pacific-drive-roadmap.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Ironwood Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
As detailed in Pacific Drive's new 2024 post-launch roadmap, this selection of summer DLC will be followed by two more releases before the end of the year. This autumn, players can expect a free update featuring new difficulty modes, game customisation settings, and cosmetics, alongside another paid cosmetics pack. That'll be followed by a winter update, but details around that remain under wraps. More will be revealed "in the coming months".
</p>
<p>
And if you've not yet taken Pacific Drive and its sentient station wagon for a ride through its gorgeous weird rendition of the Pacific Northwest, it's well worth investigating. Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell called it an "exhausting, oddly lovable nightmare" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pacific-drive-review">four star review</a>, and there's currently 40 percent off, meaning you can pick it up for £14.99 on PS5 and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-has-no-plans-to-delay-star-wars-outlaws/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After posting an exclusive 10-minute gameplay video of Star Wars Outlaws <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-M1Lu6iVhg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to IGN's YouTube</a>, Ubisoft has come under a tirade of negative feedback and commentary on what they have seen in the game. The video received more dislikes than likes, which is troubling. In just 24 hours of the video being uploaded to YouTube, the video received 13,000 dislikes to a ratio of 8,000 likes.</p>
<p>However, Ubisoft seems highly confident that people will love Star Wars Outlaws and has no plans to delay the game in any capacity. Despite the negativity being spread online, Star Wars Outlaws is still set for the August 30 release.</p>
<p>The negative commentary was so severe that a financial analyst from Bank of America commented on the situation and asked Ubisoft during yesterday's earnings call whether they were considering delaying the game. While the answer of a firm "no" is in place, they have assured the audience that there is more gameplay footage to come, and it will showcase the game and the wonders players have to look forward to.</p>
<p>From experience, Ubisoft has delayed games to improve them after receiving negative feedback from the audience. However, Star Wars Outlaws has already gone gold, so there is no chance of the game being delayed for further polishing or adjustments.</p>
<p>The feedback for the game seems to be mixed. While there's a general discomfort about Star Wars's fate as a franchise and how it is seeping into every part of the entertainment industry with multiple spin-offs and stories, there are also those who are incredibly excited about a new way to jump into the Star Wars universe.</p>
<p>However, judging by the feedback on YouTube, some feel that Ubisoft has recycled<a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-wont-feature-ubisofts-open-world-house-style-swears-massive/"> the typical open world experience</a> and slapped the Star Wars label onto it. Others felt that the visual effects present in the gameplay video just weren't up to scratch. For a game so close to release, the gameplay video suggests an air of unpolished environments, and the AI for the enemies is shaping up to be quite janky.</p>
<p>Granted, YouTube commentary often veers on the negative, especially against certain companies and franchises. Star Wars is one of those, particularly after the highly controversial The Acolyte Disney Plus series, which has an astoundingly low 3.8/10 score from user reviews on IMDB.</p>
<p>The final reception to the actual game has yet to be seen. While we wait for the verdict, you can find everything we know about Star Wars Outlaws <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/star-wars-outlaws-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-open-world-game-in-the-far-far-away-galaxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this article</a>.</p>

Given the massive video game industry's highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle, there's always something to talk about. Unlike most news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic instead of recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>
