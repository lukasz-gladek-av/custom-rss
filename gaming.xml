              <p>The Nintendo Switch became the best-selling console because you can take it anywhere. But here’s the frustration: playing on that small built-in screen, especially when two people are huddled around it, can strain your eyes and diminish the experience. Portable monitors solve this problem by giving you a bigger display that weighs barely more than a notebook: The <em>Forhelp</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4202/">15.6-inch portable monitor is now on sale for $59, down from its typical price of $79, during Prime Big Deal Day</a>. This screen lets you display your Switch games on a much larger canvas and makes multiplayer sessions actually enjoyable. The same monitor works with your laptop for dual-screen productivity, your PlayStation or Xbox for gaming sessions without hogging the TV.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4202/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD Display for Everywhere You Go</h2>
<p>The 15.6-inch screen features <strong>1920×1080 Full HD resolution from an innovative IPS matte panel</strong>. This kind of panel technology provides you with a 178-degree viewing angle so colors and contrast do not suffer even if you’re looking at the screen off to the side. This matters if more than one person is looking, or if you’re in a room that doesn’t put you right in front of the screen. This technology produces accurate and vibrant colors that make games and movies appear real life with high detail. The matte finish reduces glare from lights or windows above.</p>



<p>The monitor has various <strong>display modes that adjust to varying circumstances</strong>. Copy mode reflects your main screen, ideal for presentations when you have to display your laptop screen to others in the room during meetings. Extension mode uses the portable monitor as an additional screen, greatly expanding your display real estate for use in productivity activities such as documenting comparisons or having reference materials up and see while you work. HDR mode delivers improved image quality with higher highlights and more natural color reproduction and improves your viewing for video and games.</p>
<p>The screen is equipped with <strong>blue light blocking technology</strong> that eliminates hazardous wavelengths without it having any impact on colors. This is useful in long gaming sessions or if you’re using the screen as another screen for working during the day. Flicker-free tech eliminates the imperceptible screen throb that contributes to eye strain, and you’re able to effortlessly look at content or game for long periods without experiencing that burning, tired feeling that low-end displays create.</p>
<p>Aluminum alloy build is employed for the body that maintains the <strong>overall weight at only 1.52 pounds</strong>. With a measurement of 0.3 inches thin, this screen fits seamlessly in your backpack along with your laptop or Switch. You get to use the magnetic smart cover that does two jobs: it safeguards the screen from scuffs when you’re carrying it and doubles as a stand with two positions for varying the viewing angle. The cover incorporates sturdy PU leather on the outside that gives it that premium look and delivers full coverage protection.</p>



<p>What’s more, there are two full-featured USB-C ports and one mini HDMI port on the monitor. Both video signal and power transmission result from the USB-C connection via a solitary cable and minimize cable mess. You must have equipment that supports Thunderbolt 3.0, Thunderbolt 4.0, or USB 3.1 Type-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode in order for the USB-C connection to function. There is universal compatibility with game consoles, older model laptops and non-USB-C video output equipment on the mini HDMI port.</p>
<p>Dual built-in speakers render the use of external audio redundant when on the move. These speakers handle dialogue well and provide adequate volume for personal use, although hard core gamers might still desire the immersion that only headphones provide. These speakers prove handy when rapidly setting up in the case of a hotel room or even in a coffee shop.</p>
<p>Right now for Prime Day, this transportable display is cheaper than many premium competitors and gives you a full second display outcome.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-wont-admit-it-needs-discounts-so-its-quietly-offloading-macbook-airs-through-amazon-2000631829</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here’s something you likely know: <strong>Apple never goes on sale</strong>. The tech giant carefully guards its premium image by refusing to slash prices on its official website or in its retail stores. But here’s the thing—even Apple needs to boost sales, and that’s where authorized retailers like Amazon come in.</p>
<p>For this October’s <em>Prime Big Deal Day</em> (essentially the fall version of Prime Day), Amazon is offering record-low pricing on the 2025 MacBook Air lineup, and these deals are too good to ignore. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">13-inch model with the new M4 chip and 256GB storage has dropped to $897, down from $999</a>, and<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/"> the 15-inch 256GB version is available for $1,078, reduced from $1,199</a>.</p>

<h2>The M4 Chip Changes Everything</h2>
<p>At the heart of this 2025 MacBook is Apple’s M4 chip which represents a significant leap forward in performance and efficiency. The M4 delivers big improvements when you’re juggling multiple applications or running graphics-intensive games. The chip’s architecture allows for seamless multitasking without the fans kicking in (because there aren’t any) and without draining your battery. Speaking of which, you’re getting up to 18 hours of battery life which means you can work through an entire day and well into the evening without hunting for an outlet.</p>



<p>The screen warrants particular admiration: Both t<strong>he 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch Liquid Retina displays handle one billion colors</strong>, translating to extremely lifelike photos, videos bursting with deep contrast and text that’s crisp enough to minimize eye strain when working for long stretches. The larger 15-inch variant provides additional screen real estate for productivity applications such as working on spreadsheets or designing projects in which you desire multiple windows in sight at all times. When it comes to video conferencing and content creation, the 12MP Center Stage camera automatically positions you in the center of the picture when you’re in motion.</p>
<p>Connectivity is another aspect in which the 2025 MacBook Air excels: <strong>You have two Thunderbolt 4 ports</strong> that manage blazing-fast data transfer rates of up to 40Gbps which is ideal for external storage or high-end monitors. There’s the MagSafe power port that ensures you won’t pull your laptop off the desk if you kick your foot against the cable—the cable automatically disconnects magnetically without causing damage. Wi-Fi 6E support prepares you for the newest router tech with increased speeds and less traffic, and Bluetooth 5.3 ensures seamless connections for wireless peripherals. You’re connectable to up to two external displays as well.</p>



<p>Apple Intelligence is the company’s new personal intelligence system and it is baked right into the MacBook Air. This feature helps streamline your writing, creative expression and daily tasks with groundbreaking privacy protections that ensure your data stays yours (even Apple can’t access it). The system integrates with macOS to make common tasks faster and more intuitive. If you’re already in the Apple ecosystem with an iPhone, the integration becomes even more powerful: iPhone Mirroring lets you control your phone directly from your Mac screen, while Universal Clipboard means you can copy text on your iPhone and paste it on your Mac.</p>
<p>The audio system is backed with <strong>six speakers for Spatial Audio and three microphones</strong>, and it produces an immersive listening experience for music, movies, and games. Speakers deliver exceptionally deep bass and crisp highs for such thin case depths. Both models come with 16GB unified memory and 256GB SSD storage in this configuration, and unified memory architecture allows the system to distribute resources back and forth between processor and render tasks dynamically.</p>
<p>At <strong>these all-time-low Prime Big Deal Day prices</strong>, you’re getting the best laptop technology from Apple at a discount that doesn’t originate from an authorized dealer. They won’t stay on sale like this forever.</p>

<figure data-uuid="6436fa114057f"><a title="eShop Selects September 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6436fa114057f/eshop-selects-september-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Phew</em>. What a month, hey? It's time for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a>, and it's a doozy.</p>
<p>As we approach the holiday season, we're practically drowning in games, with two of the biggest indies of the year hitting within weeks of each other. A <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct ensured</a> we'd be swimming in more titles for a while on both Switch 1 and 2. Who needs free time? Not us!</p>
<p>We have a lot to get through, so let's run over the rules: Nintendo Life writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop exclusives for the month (note that some of these <em>may</em> get physical releases in the future) from a list of games that we've reviewed. We then score those games, with 1s getting the most and 3 the least, tally up the numbers, which then determines the final top three.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qptgoh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>So, let's get to September's best eShop games then!</p>

<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>Now, there are two very big elephants in the room — and yes, you're probably wondering which one made number one. Note that a few games here are getting physicals later down the line, whether it be a late or limited release, but they're eligible for the vote here as they're not out yet.</p>
<p>But, for this month, there are some other lovely little gems that launched this month, around the same times as those behemoths. So, here they are — and for this month, all games that scored 7/10 and above were eligible.</p>

</ul>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earthion">3rd Place - Earthion (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>Shmups are having a hell of a year, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earthion">Earthion</a> — from Ancient Corporation, Yuzo Koshiro, And Makoto Wada — might be at the top of the pile.</p>
<p>Keeping the gameplay simple by giving you just two weapon types to control, which can both be upgraded, Earthion lets everything shine. Form the level design to the chaotic waves of enemies to the boss encounters, this is a decently-challenging, extremely fun shmup.</p>
<p>It <em>finally</em> came to Switch in September 2025, and we gave it an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/earthion">excellent 8/10</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:187905 @ 1759701187 -->
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">2nd Place - Hades II (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Okay, so we all predicted this month's 1st and 2nd, right? Well, there was a <strong>single point</strong> separating these two games. There has to be a runner up, and this time, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>.</p>
<p>Supergiant Games are complete wizards, and the team has managed to conjure up a superb sequel that builds upon the mechanical brilliance of the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a>. Melinoë's fight against the Titan of Time is endlessly replayable, with new boons, new weapons, and a whole host of new characters and romance options. You'll want to kill time all the... time with this one.</p>
<p>Hades II easily deserved <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">its 9/10 score</a>, <em>just</em> missing out because of its weaker story. In this humble writer's mind, anyway.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">1st Place - Hollow Knight: Silksong (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Potentially a controversial number one, given the chatter about difficulty and size, but there's no doubt that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was well worth the wait in our eyes.</p>
<p>Going above and beyond expectations, Hornet's adventure through Pharloom expands on Hollow Knight's toolset exponentially. A bigger map, even more equipables, different playstyles, tough enemies with patterns to learn, and healthy challenges. It's not going to be for everyone, but for those who can face up to the challenge, Silksong is marvellous. Play it at 120fps if you can on Switch 2; it's silky smooth.</p>
<p>It got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">a 10/10 from us</a>, <em>and</em> it's our eShop Selects winner of September 2025.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:187456 @ 1759698828 -->
</div></div><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-august-2025"><strong>&lt; Nintendo eShop Selects - August 2025</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-september-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has denied reports that it has been lobbying Japanese lawmakers against generative AI, insisting it "has not had any contact with the Japanese government" about the highly controversial emerging tech.</p>
<p>The denial comes after Japanese politician Satoshi Asano <a href="https://x.com/Asano__Satoshi/status/1974758362157035573">posted an apology on social media</a> after claiming Nintendo was lobbying the Japanese government. This was followed by <a href="https://x.com/Asano__Satoshi/status/1974758362157035573">a further apology</a> earlier today, after which Satoshi deleted the original post.</p>

<p>While the megacorp typically declines to comment on speculation, on this occasion Nintendo was keen to shoot the rumour down and stressed that while it was not lobbying, "whether generative AI is involved or not, we will continue to take necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights".</p>
<p>"Contrary to recent discussions on the internet, Nintendo has not had any contact with the Japanese government about generative AI," the company wrote.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-boss-discusses-ai-use-says-games-will-always-have-a-human-touch">Nintendo recently shared its thoughts on generative AI, and assured fans that its games will always have "a human touch"</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> president Doug Bowser saying: "We still believe that what makes our games special is our developers, their artistic capabilities, their insight into how people play. So, there's always, <em>always</em> going to be a human touch, and a human engagement in how we develop and build our games."</p><p>Nintendo's position is at odds with many of its contemporaries. Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-intends-to-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai-says-ceo">Square Enix CEO Takashi Kiryu stated the company would be "aggressive in applying AI"</a>, with developers admitting they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-dabbled-with-ai-technology-for-foamstars">"dabbled" with AI</a> for the ill-fated shooter Foamstars, Professor Layton studio <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20231213-24326/">Level-5</a> has used AI tool Stable Diffusion, and even <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/capcom-is-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-help-generate-the-hundreds-of-thousands-of-ideas-needed-for-game-development/">Capcom</a> has admitted experimenting with generative AI too. <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999104/20250808042/">Sega</a> also has an in-house AI team.</p>
<p>In fact, a recent survey conducted by the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA), the organiser of Tokyo Game Show, showed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI in their development</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p><em><strong>Editor’s note: </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/782478/october-amazon-prime-day-deals-guide">Amazon’s fall Prime Day event</a> kicks off on October 7th; however, if you want to shop ahead of the two-day sale, we’ve rounded up the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/783008/amazon-october-prime-day-sale-best-early-deals-2025">best early Prime Day deals</a> you can already get.</em></p></div><p>If you choose to get an extra controller for your Nintendo Switch 2, you can spend a lot — and get a lot in return. Buying Nintendo’s own <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-SwitchTM-2-Pro-Controller-Switch/dp/B0F3VTFD6J/ref=ast_sto_dp_puis?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$89.99 Switch 2 Pro Controller</a>, for instance, will net you the console’s only wireless controller with a 3.5mm headphone jack, not to mention great rumble and a slick design. It’s not perfect, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">it’s the total package</a>.</p><p>But it’d be a disservice to you to call it a day there. There are several third-party offerings that are significantly cheaper, yet don’t make too many compromises in terms of features. I’ve spent time testing a handful of them, and there’s a small batch of models that I think will satisfy most people, with a range of styles, prices, and features.</p><p>Every controller I’ve included in this guide is compatible with both the Switch 2 and original Switch (some can even remotely wake the Switch 2), as well as platforms like PC and mobile. Each offering also includes better, longer-lasting joystick technology than you’ll get with Nintendo’s flagship controller; the Switch 2 Pro Controller’s potentiometer-based joysticks are prone to degradation over time, after all, but our picks include either Hall effect or TMR joysticks.</p><div><h2>What I’m looking for</h2><section><p>I put my pricey Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller away and cycle in each of these candidates for multi-session tests with a mix of games for the Switch 2. I spend time assessing their ergonomics, button location, and the quality of each button press and trigger pull. I also strive to test each controller’s unique functions. </p></section><section><p>Most people would rather spend $89.99 on a game or two, not a single controller. We sought cheaper alternatives to Nintendo’s fantastic Switch 2 Pro Controller, but we hate compromising on features and quality as much as anyone. We aim to include wireless gamepads that can remotely wake the Switch 2, as well as offerings that feature good-feeling rumble and controllers that sport a few extras, such as amiibo support.</p></section><section><p>Our top picks are just as comfortable to use as Nintendo’s flagship gamepad — perhaps more comfortable, depending on your taste. We’ve included picks with Xbox- and PlayStation-style stick layouts, as well as one that feels similar to the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller.</p></section><section><p>Nintendo opted for potentiometer-based joysticks with its pricey Switch 2 controller, which may result in “stick drift” later on, if its last-gen controller tech is anything to go by. Every pick in this guide builds upon that technology with either Hall effect or tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks, which are drift-resistant by design.</p></section></div><div><p id="the-best-switch-2-controller-for-most-people"><h2>The best Switch 2 controller for most people</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6Nzg2NTg5"><p><span>$<!-- -->50</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>TMR joysticks</li><li>amiibo support</li><li>Great rumble</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Clicky buttons are divisive</li><li>The grips might be too grating for some</li></ul></div></div></div><p><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes, two / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes, HD / <strong>NFC:</strong> Yes / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable 1,200mAh battery / <strong>Console wake-up:</strong> Yes</p><p>The EasySMX S10 is nearly as capable and comfortable as the Switch 2 Pro Controller, yet it’s $30 cheaper at $59.99. It’s full of surprises, too, including the best adaptation of Nintendo’s HD rumble that I’ve felt in a third-party controller. It’s also one of the few options that can remotely wake the Switch 2 from sleep mode via Bluetooth. Lastly, it includes amiibo support — another rare feature to find in a third-party gamepad.</p><p>However, the S10 isn’t a Switch 2 Pro copycat; it’s a lot grippier, both around the grips themselves and on its stick caps. Button presses and trigger pulls feel different from most other controllers, too, yielding a softer press and shorter travel, which is likely to be the most divisive aspect of the S10. One of my favorite aspects of the S10’s design is its swappable eight-way (circular) D-pad, making diagonal attacks in <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> considerably easier to execute than with a four-way D-pad.</p><p>If I could change one thing about the S10, it’d be the system-level buttons (screenshot, GameChat, and home). They’re crammed awkwardly just below the D-pad and right stick.</p><div><p id="honorable-mentions"><h2>Honorable mentions</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6NzkxNjEw"><p><span>$<!-- -->30</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Incredible value in terms of specs and comfort</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Lousy rumble</li><li>Lacks a C button</li></ul></div></div></div><p><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, mobile / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons: </strong>No / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable 950mAh battery / <strong>Console wake-up:</strong> Yes</p><p>Gulikit’s ES Pro is a love letter to the Xbox controller, but for Switch 2. It’s just $29.99, which is a steal considering this gamepad features an eight-way D-pad that’s great for fighting games, Metroidvanias, and retro titles where it’s an advantage to easily be able to aim diagonally (a setting can make it so that it only registers inputs for the cardinal directions, if you prefer).</p><p>The ES Pro doesn’t need to do much to justify its price, but it does so anyway. It features tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks that are resistant to drifting and offer improved power efficiency compared to Hall effect tech, just like the EasySMX S10. Similarly, it can be set up to remotely wake your Switch 2 or OG Switch console from across the room using its own set of strange, one-time-only instructions that you can view in its instruction manual.</p><p>I’ve got almost no qualms with this controller, except for its bad rumble. It just has no subtlety, rumbling in an all-or-nothing manner. I was happier using the ES Pro with the vibrations off, which isn’t any fun. Additionally, it’s far less complete than the S10, as it lacks built-in amiibo support and a C button for GameChat; however, depending on your needs, those omissions might not matter to you.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6NzU1MzE4"><p><span>$<!-- -->63</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Includes dock and 2.4GHz dongle</li><li>Highly customizable</li><li>Comfortable for small hands</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Bad rumble</li><li>Can’t wake Switch 2</li></ul></div></div></div><p><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, 2.4GHz, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes, two / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable 1,000mAh battery / <strong>Console wake-up:</strong> Yes (but only original Switch)</p><p>8BitDo’s Pro 3 is a great yet pricey Switch 2 Pro alternative with a PlayStation-style stick layout. At $69.99, it’s not as affordable (nor as value-packed) as the top contenders. However, the Pro 3 offers a lot of customization, some being cosmetic, while other aspects can impact gameplay.</p><p>It has a lot going for it, with TMR joysticks, two back paddles, and a total of three shoulder buttons per side thanks to new custom M buttons. Its analog stick caps can be popped off in favor of glossy arcade stick-style nubs, which were my preferred choice in fighting games (plus, they just look cool). Its ABXY buttons can be suctioned off with an included tool to swap the layout as needed, and for visual flair, each controller includes colored buttons to evoke a retro Nintendo console. Also, it has trigger locks, letting you set triggers to have a short, clicky pull or the default travel distance.</p><p>However, I’d skip the Pro 3 if you want good rumble feedback. It’s pretty lousy on that front, to the point that I preferred to turn off rumble entirely in games. Also — and this is a small nitpick — but the Pro 3 can’t remotely wake up the Switch 2, so you’ll need to walk over to press the console’s power button before jumping on the couch.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6NzkxNDMz"><p><span>$<!-- -->42</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Comfortable, sleek design</li><li>Buttons are easy to swap</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Buttons don’t feel good to press</li><li>Can’t wake Switch 2</li></ul></div></div></div><p><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, mobile / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, 2.4GHz, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes, two/ <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable 1,000mAh battery / <strong>Console wake-up:</strong> No</p><p>GameSir’s Super Nova is a passable Switch Pro copy that I had a tough time warming up to, even if there’s a lot about it that sounds great on paper. It’s comfortable, with rubbery grips and decent rumble, and it uses Hall effect joysticks. However, it has, by a wide margin, my least favorite D-pad and buttons to press out of all the controllers on our list. The underlying tech is responsive, but it feels cheap to hammer on.</p><p>That’s a shame, as it’s a slick-looking controller with a magnetic faceplate that pops off, allowing you to easily swap the buttons around without the need for an extra tool. The rear triggers also have trigger stops, which can reduce the travel of each pull, and the two back paddles are easy to press. It even includes a charging dock — as well as a dazzling set of RGB LEDs, which you can turn off — along with a USB-A 2.4GHz transmitter that lets you easily connect the gamepad with your PC.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6NzkxNjMz"><p><span>$<!-- -->30</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Cute, compact design</li><li>Can wake Switch 2</li><li>Hall effect sticks</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Sticks and triggers have limited range Lacks features from the ES Pro</li></ul></div></div></div><p><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> No/ <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable 800mAh battery / <strong>Console wake-up:</strong> Yes</p><p>Gulikit Elves 2 is a compact, Sega Saturn-inspired controller I wanted to love a little more than I do. The affordable gamepad shares some of the same benefits as the identically priced ES Pro — including Switch 2 wake-up and multiplatform support — but it’s smaller, which could make it a great pick for kids or small-handed folks who have a difficult time wrapping their digits around larger gamepads.</p><p>There isn’t much wasted space in this controller, either, as it comes with a rechargeable battery, rumble motors, a gyroscope, and an eight-way D-pad that feels nice to use. Even for my medium-sized hands, its grips turn the small gamepad into something that’s satisfying to hold. I don’t like it as much for a handful of minor reasons relating to long-term comfort, button and trigger feel preferences, and some missing functionality. Compared to the ES Pro, it lacks TMR sticks (it has Hall effect), the Pro’s better triggers, and swappable buttons.</p><div><p id="whats-next"><h2>What’s next?</h2></p></div><p>A company called GG-Gear (Good Game Gear) is sending us its GG wireless Switch 2 controller, and it seems like it might give the EasySMX S10 a run for its money. It’ll cost $44.99 and will feature TMR joysticks, a 1,000Hz polling rate, amiibo support, gyroscope support, a C button for GameChat, and what the company calls “HD” vibration, among other competitive features. It also comes in an array of fun colors, to boot.</p><p>The hunt continues for gamepad contenders that pack in a bunch of features without breaking the bank. They’re rarer than you might think they are! For instance, PowerA recently launched <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Advantage-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FS147SDG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">a $69.99 Switch 2 controller</a> called the Advantage Wireless Controller. It features Hall effect joysticks, but seemingly lacks rumble and the ability to wake the Switch 2. Hori also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/791438/hori-wireless-horipad-turbo-nintendo-switch-2-controller">recently launched the Turbo Switch 2</a> in some nice colors, each with TMR joysticks. Its highlight feature is a button that can disable the screenshot, home, and plus / minus buttons.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/791574/best-switch-2-controllers]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A third-party customer service system used by Discord's support teams has been hacked, compromising some user personal data, including government IDs.</p>
<p>Discord has written to some users confirming that on 20th September, personal data was obtained by "an unauthorised party" which gained limited access, including "a small number of government‑ID images such as driver's license and passports from users who had appealed an age determination".</p>
<p>Discord – which is used by millions of gamers across the world – says information shared by users with its Customer Support or Trust and Safety teams was "exposed", including real names, Discord name, email, contact address, limited payment information – including payment type, last four digits of credit cards, and purchase history – IP addresses, and messages and attachments sent to customer support. Limited corporate data, including training materials and internal presentations, was also exposed.</p>
<p>Full credit card numbers or CCV codes, Discord activity or messages, and passwords or authentication data were reportedly not compromised, but Discord has not revealed how many of its millions of users may have been impacted.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service">blog</a> post, Discord insisted that just "a limited number of users who had communicated with customer support" were impacted, and the authorised party did not gain access to Discord directly. It also claimed to have taken "all appropriate steps" by notifying data protection authorities, law enforcement, and "reviewed our threat detection systems and security controls for third-party support providers".</p><p>"Looking ahead, we recommend impacted users stay alert when receiving messages or other communication that may seem suspicious. We have service agents on hand to answer questions and provide additional support," Discord said. "We take our responsibility to protect your personal data seriously and understand the inconvenience and concern this may cause."</p>
<p><em>An earlier edition of this story referred to the breach as "authorised", not "unauthorised". This has been amended. Apologies for any confusion.</em></p>

		<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is running its first beta, and we’ve had the chance to go hands-on over the last couple of days. While it feels like another incredible addition to the FPS genre, there will be those COD fans who are once again starting to feel that familiar sense of fatigue.</p>
<p>For the past several years, Activision and its cadre of development studios have managed to pump out back-to-back blockbuster instalments while juggling the behemoth success of Warzone. Under the hood, these teams have continued to tweak and refine the COD formula. While some experimental changes haven’t gone down too well with the community, other features—like weapon mounting and Black Ops 6’s omnidirectional movement—are now woven into the template.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Beta Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43pdTk_1voA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>From what we’ve played of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s multiplayer, it feels like an advanced version of last year’s instalment. The big changes this year are “overclocked” loadout options, high-tech killstreaks, and the return of wall-running. Let’s start with the latter first, which is more akin to a wall bounce rather than the kind of parkour-like movement systems we’ve previously seen in Black Ops III and Infinite Warfare. It’s more subtle, allowing players to quickly and easily reach higher points of a map without drastically changing the pace of COD’s trademark shooting gameplay.</p>
<p>Speaking of maps, the arenas on show during the beta suit the evolved omnidirectional movement introduced in Black Ops 6, most of them consisting of two lanes that intersect with plenty of ledges and vantage points, but very few places for campers to entrench themselves. With the game taking place in a near-future timeline of the 2030s, nothing about the map or operator aesthetics are out of this world – there’s nothing we haven’t really seen before but then again, anything too trippy or cyberpunk-esque would likely add too much noise.</p>


<p>What most players come to Call of Duty for is the tried and tested, ultra-smooth gunplay. Black Ops 7 doesn’t disappoint and has a diverse enough arsenal of weapons to suit every kind of player, from crafty snipers to kamikaze shotgunners. As always, there are plenty of weapon modifications and perks to help further customise your playstyle, with some interesting quirks this time around.</p>
<p>First, we have the new “overclock” feature that allows players to level up and augment gear such as scorestreaks and equipment. For example, when overclocking the UAV you can either lower its score cost or equip it with a flare to counter the first rocket fired at it by an enemy player. Similarly, the Stim Shot can be overclocked to remove debuffs or grant a temporary speed buff upon use.</p>

<p>In true COD fashion, just about everything you do earns you XP and almost every part of your loadout can be customised or levelled up in some way. Perks, a Call of Duty multiplayer mainstay, now have an advanced feature where equipping a certain perk colour combination will bestow extra “Combat Speciality” bonuses. Equipping three blue Recon perks will allow you to see the direction of the closest enemy on the minimap each time you respawn.</p>
<p>Despite being a snapshot of next month’s full release, the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 beta is definitive proof that Activision is still on a hot streak with its flagship series. Small factions within the community will always find a bone to pick but there’s no arguing with how well the sequel’s multiplayer offering has been put together, even if it’s a bit overfamiliar in places. Unless the singleplayer campaign or Zombies modes truly drop the ball, Black Ops 7 will mark another triumphant triple threat for Activision.</p>

            <p>As it gears up for what it calls an "exciting day of the Black Ops 7 Early Access Beta coming later today", Treyarch has some "important multiplayer playlist changes" to share with us as the beta continues.</p>
<p>As the developer explains, beta tests are run ahead of full launch to "gather critical in-game data and feedback" to ensure games – especially those with heavy multiplayer aspects – provide "the best experience possible".</p>
<p>That's why the team is working with the community to address early issues and making "some updates" to its playlist plans.</p>

<p>That's why this weekend, in the Open Moshpit playlist, you'll find "skill consideration is drastically reduced when matchmaking, with the goal of providing more varied match experiences and outcomes". As Treyarch explains, this playlist will "match players with and against players of more varied skill differences than in the current Multiplayer matchmaking system". This'll apply to all maps and modes across that playlist.</p>
<p>While not explicitly confirmed, this suggests that the other playlist, Moshpit, will feature more traditional skill-based matchmaking. You can also expect additional Perk changes – "including slot assignment" – when the game releases next month.</p>
<p>"While these updates will not be in the Beta, we’ve heard your feedback and will be sharing more about them on the road to launch," the developer said. "We can also confirm that we will be making reloading while Wall Jumping default behaviour for launch."</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, the team has been "closely following feedback" from Black Ops 7 players on time-to-kill (TTK), which is why you'll see changes to the Dravec 45 and M8A1.</p>
<p>"We currently see these weapons well ahead of the pack in our TTK data, and they also have very high usage, which means they are contributing heavily to combat pacing right now in the Beta," the update continued. "The goal of the changes outlined below is to bring their average performance closer to the other weapons currently available.</p><p>"Time-to-Kill (TTK) and overall weapon balance has been a conversation we've been keeping an eye on, along with evaluating in-game data from day one of the Beta. While we’re starting the Beta with a TTK in the range of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>, we’re aware that some players feel it may be slightly faster than desired. As a result, we'll be releasing a weapon balance pass in the coming days to adjust TTK and ensure all weapons available in the Beta are competitive within both their class and their intended role within Black Ops 7."</p>
<p>Here's the rest of the patch notes:</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/791353/sausage-legend-steam-launch-interview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-developers-behind-a-hit-sausage-dueling-game-hope-steam-launch-will-take-it-furter.1316881/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Life is a series of battles, and I just lost my last one against four gyoza on a skewer. It was an unexpected blow, because honestly, who could have expected me — a springy, respectably proportioned hot dog — to lose against a seemingly inflexible spear of small, unassuming dumplings? This is my struggle in <em>Sausage Legend: Arena</em>, a mobile game with a very simple premise: duel with other players’ sausages and win.</p><p>On the surface, it looks like a garden-variety mobile game riddled with bugs (it is). But the difference between <em>Sausage Legend</em> and a fleeting idea you had after overdoing it on edibles is that 3.5 million people have played <em>Sausage Legend</em>, it has been on Japanese national television, and it is shockingly fun. And with an upcoming release on Steam, it’s poised to get even bigger.</p><p>As befits combat that demands swatting two wieners at each other, <em>Sausage Legend</em> is a heavily physics-based game. Each sausage is thrust onto the battlefield by a fork; players flop their sausages around to bludgeon each other to death. As someone with the vestigial sensibilities of a 13-year-old shitposter, I love this ballet of well-timed jabs and opportunistic ripostes, all while I admire the resilience and elasticity of my humble meat sword.</p><p>I fight lightning-infused cocktail sausages and weisswurst. There are brats and goteborgs, as well as pickled cucumber and a slice of pepperoni pizza (which, I guess technically contains sausage). There are more than 50 different sausages and other food items, each with different advantages — length, strength, special powers, and so on. My health bar smugly refuses to replenish between rounds. I learn that at some point, I will encounter a chrome-covered metal sausage that looks like something out of the deepest pit of T-1000 <em>Terminator</em> fanfic. There are barely any instructions, there are tedious ads, and when I reopen the game, it has not saved my meager progress. And yet, I crave more sausage.</p><p>For developer Tadaki Tani, the inspiration behind <em>Sausage Legend</em> didn’t come from playing with his food. “In the beginning, we found <a href="https://thekidshouldseethis.com/post/the-etiquette-of-a-giraffe-fight">giraffes fighting</a> on YouTube and the giraffes were ‘hanging’ their heads around and round, and that’s how we got the first idea [for the game],” he explains through a translator. The first prototype of the game used giraffes, but the fighting scenes didn’t quite work out. Why not try sausages? And <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krishrach/theres-a-new-game-where-you-fight-with-sasusages-and-its-act">so, in 2016, <em>Sausage Legend</em> was born</a>.</p><p>Tani is the CEO of MilkCorp, a studio he founded in 2009 that offers meme-y mobile games like <em>My Grizzly Bear</em>, <em>Sleep In Office</em>, and <em>Pollen Heaven</em>. <em>My Grizzly Bear</em> is exactly what it sounds like — a free grizzly bear care simulator whose <a href="https://milkcorp.com/app/my-grizzly-bear/?lang=en">official page (correctly) reads</a>, “The only people who would think of doing something like that are Youtubers desperate for views.” <em>Pollen Heaven</em> is a self-described “<a href="https://milkcorp.com/app/pollen_heave/?lang=en">silly game</a>” based on Tani’s own hay fever. <em>Sausage Legend: Arena 2</em>, its Japan-only sequel, features a medieval story world where slaves must sausage-duel for their freedom. The development team consists of Tani, and one other person.</p><div><p>“There are a lot of people playing because of her.”</p></div><p>The biggest boost to <em>Sausage Legend</em> came from a niche corner of the internet: a Hololive vtuber named Oozora Subaru, who became besotted with the original game and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVHLS_2Ai2w">plays it obsessively</a> to the delight (or chagrin, in some cases) of her fans. (We did reach out to Hololive’s parent company Cover for comment, but it did not respond.) In 2021, Subaru <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0zw-fplbc0">got her own legendary sausage</a> in <em>Sausage Legend 2</em>, styled like a duck, which is her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=cmUnxqcY-zE">informal mascot</a>. Her fellow vtuber Hakui Koyori also got a special sausage: the “Koyori Skin of the Large Intestine” sausage which sported a fluffy pink tail. “There are a lot of people playing because of her,” Tani says, noting that it took around 10 of her streams to see a noticeable uptick in players.</p><p>Later this year, Tani is going to release an expanded version of <em>Sausage Legend: Arena</em> on Steam — essentially a more filled-out <em>Sausage Legend 2</em> story mode with added features. Slaves must take up arms (sausages) to fight for their freedom in a spectacular pastime favored by nobles: the sausage duel. There will be a deckbuilding mechanic to help you strategize the duels a little better — “the character doesn’t heal itself, but the cards will help you do that,” Tani says — as well as a few new modes and moves.</p><p>“We want to expand the game, and we want [more] people to know about it,” Tani says earnestly, before presenting me with a little acrylic standee of a hot dog. <em>Sausage Legend</em>’s upcoming release on Steam is poised to bring the game to a wider audience, one that I fervently hope will include avid modders. Half of the playerbase is Japanese, while the rest are overseas in the US and Taiwan, with France coming in fourth. Tani and I are both surprised that Germany isn’t in the top five; his favorite sausage type is weisswurst, which seems appropriate in the canon of <a href="https://gabrielknight.fandom.com/wiki/Wurst_Lady">significant video game sausages</a>.</p><p>After the successful collaborations he’s had — crossovers with the 2016 movie <em>Sausage Party</em>, Morinaga Pino ice-cream, and Hololive — I ask if he would consider working with Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest, perhaps even the Olympics of sausages. “If there is a chance, we would love to,” he says with a smile. “Just eating a hot dog is the best way to eat a sausage.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIxNzQ="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Alexis Ong</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/791353/sausage-legend-steam-launch-interview]]></content:encoded>

<p>You didn't think we'd let Zion go without one last chat, did you?</p>
<p>Nah, he's not getting away that easily. So before our beloved video producer departs, we thought it would be nice to have one last chinwag and go over some of our happiest memories with Mr. Grassl.</p>
<p>So yes, the chaps reminisce over some key memories together over the last six years, including their first in-person meeting in London, the response to some of Zion's most ambitious videos, and their work on what might be their very best April Fools joke.</p>
<p>So if you have about 40 minutes to spare, do give it a watch. It's a lovely little sendoff for Zion, and as we mentioned in our previous article, we're very sad to see him go (but also very happy for his new, currently very secret role!).</p>
<p>So once again, from all of us at Nintendo Life, good luck on your next venture Zion, and don't be a stranger!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-fire-tv-sticks-amazon-is-blowing-out-roku-devices-at-their-cheapest-price-ever-2000631824</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-fire-tv-sticks-amazon-is-blowing-out-roku-devices-at-their-cheapest-price-ever.1316863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cutting the cord on cable TV has never been easier, but choosing the right streaming device can feel overwhelming with so many options flooding the market. Amazon launched its Fire TV Stick lineup years ago to compete directly with established players like Roku and Google’s Chromecast, and the battle for your living room has been fierce ever since.</p>
<p>Here’s the twist: while Amazon’s own <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-just-launched-new-gadgets-yet-the-fire-tv-stick-4k-is-practically-free-at-50-off-2000630324">Fire TV Sticks are hitting record low prices</a> during Prime Big Deal Days, <strong>the retail giant is pushing Roku devices even lower</strong> to clear out remaining inventory from its biggest rival. The Roku Streaming Stick HD has dropped from $29 down to $17, the Streaming Stick 4K fell from $49 to $29, and the Streaming Stick Plus landed at $24 instead of $39.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4492/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Roku Streaming Stick 4K at Amazon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3957/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Roku Streaming Stick Plus at Amazon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4493/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Roku Streaming Stick HD at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Understanding the Differences in Roku’s Lineup of Streaming Sticks</h2>
<p>The <strong>entry-level Roku Streaming Stick HD</strong> is the least costly model at $17, ideal if <strong>you’re working with an older TV that tops off at 1080p resolution</strong> or just don’t worry about 4K content. It streams high-definition content effortlessly on all major platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and thousands of other channels. Its included Roku Voice Remote allows you to search for shows by speaking instead of painstakingly entering using an on-screen keyboard, averting frustration when you’re trying to locate that one film whose name you just couldn’t quite manage to recall. It hooks up via HDMI and is powered from your TV’s USB port or from the included adapter.</p>



<p>Upgrading from the base model to the <strong>Roku Streaming Stick 4K</strong> for $29 unlocks significant visual gains if you own a 4K TV. This model is HDR (High Dynamic Range) and Dolby Vision capable, two technologies that achieve massive picture quality improvements beyond resolution bumps. HDR provides greater dynamic range between blacks and whites which results in more realistic pictures with higher-contrast levels. Dolby Vision does one better and adjusts brightness and colour dynamically on a scene- or even frame-by-frame basis, and it looks fantastic in supported content from services like Apple TV Plus, Netflix, and Disney Plus. Long-range Wi-Fi in the specs means that this stick should maintain stable connections even if your router is in another room or on another floor, reducing infuriating buffering that ruins key narrative points.</p>
<p>The <strong>Streaming Stick Plus</strong> at $24 is a tempting compromise with 4K and HDR support but no support for Dolby Vision, so it is relatively less capable in its ultimate picture quality compared to the Streaming Stick 4K, but importantly still much more capable compared to the HD-only base model. There is only real-world practical differentiation in the non-Dolby Vision versus HDR pictures largely on high-end TVs with excellent panel technology, so if your 4K TV is an economy or mid-range model from several years ago, you’re unlikely to see much differentiation in the pictures versus the Plus model and the full 4K model. The Plus model does, however, come with the Voice Remote and has the same massive library of streaming services, free live TV services in the form of the Roku Channel, and private listening in the form of the Roku smartphone app.</p>
<p>Each of these three models gives you access to the Roku platform which is still one of the best streaming interfaces. Installation takes just a minute or two: <strong>stick the stick in your TV’s HDMI port, connect it to your network and start viewing</strong>. compact size makes these sticks disappear completely behind your television with no apparent clutter.</p>
<p>With these aggressive discounts and the fact that non-Prime members have access to these deals, now is truly the perfect time to upgrade your streaming setup.</p>

Not disappointed, definitely excited, but concerned all the same.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_kart_8">Mario Kart 8</a>, you see, has become such an all-encompassing thing over the years, a sprawling collection of tracks and characters all brought together in a package that stands out for its no-nonsense focus on excellent karting action. And so it's hard, or it was hard, to see how on earth Nintendo would or could elevate it in any meaningful way.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qptgoh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, the big gamble to attempt this necessary evolution is the open-world aspect. However, this addition breaks with the straightforward approach I so admire about past entries. I want to race first and foremost when I turn these games on. I want into a solo or multiplayer race as quickly as possible, in fact, and Mario Kart has always given me this, with Battle modes and side stuff out of the way, and the racing front and centre.</p>
<p>With the introduction of an open world, I feel like the series has been infiltrated to some extent by modern nonsense that it shouldn't feel the need to kowtow to. The slick and precise aspects that I enjoy most have been sunk in a mire of clutter and noise that I don't care for at all, that degrades and confuses the experience unnecessarily.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I'm not hating on Mario Kart World, let's be clear. On the track, it's an incredibly beautiful thing...But it's a game I've stopped playing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I'm not hating on Mario Kart World, let's be clear. On the track, it's an incredibly beautiful thing, with racing that undoubtedly puts it up top as the best-feeling of the entire franchise. That's worth your time, and then some. Of course it is, and I still rate it highly.</p>
<p>But it's a game I've stopped playing. I stopped playing fairly quickly, in fact, because the busy-ness of the open world — the feeling of having unfinished business and things to be done and checked off which an open world brings — puts me off. It wears me down, and it makes me feel like I'm...not playing the game properly? I probably need to chill out, but I can't; I'm a box-ticker and there are too many boxes needing wearily ticking.</p>
<p>Now, in this moment of very personal inner turmoil, as my worldview suddenly and irreversibly collapses under the weight of the knowledge that "maybe the new Mario Kart isn't really my cup of tea", who should present themselves as an unlikely hero? It could only be that wee guy. The wee blue hedgehog guy. From the movies. What's his name? Ah, yes, Sanic. Sanic the Hedgehogs.</p>
<h2>Skew-Whiffs Sonically Sorted</h2>
<p>Not for one second — and as much as I love me some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/sonic_and_all-stars_racing_transformed">Sonic Racing Transformed</a> — did I ever think that Team Sonic could bring it this good. But bring it this good is exactly what they've done.</p>

<p>If you're like me, a connoisseur who appreciates the handling of a car in ways in which most humans simply cannot, you may have an issue with previous Sonic karting efforts. There's always been something slightly off, something skew-whiff (like yer Eggman's moustache), about the handling of the vehicles. It's very slight — not game-ruining at all — but I've always felt a tankiness, a <em>heaviness</em> in the rear of the various karts that makes drifting, and switching directions whilst drifting, come off as a little undercooked and clunky compared to Mario's perfect handling. It was an issue that meant this series could never top the Italian smart-arse in my mind. Until now.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, you see, Team Sonic has finally resolved its handling woes. I can't find fault with the mechanics or handling here at all. Furthermore, as you play, you begin to realise that what at first can seem like messy chaos when transferring from the measured, 'opulent' vibe of Mario's races, is actually massively addictive, rewarding, and competitive karting that has Mario Kart World beaten all day long, thanks to those handling tweaks and a bunch of other things that make for races with bigger hooks to keep me engaged.</p>
<p>Now, before I dig in here, and for full transparency, as you'll be aware, the Switch 1 version of Sonic Racing Crossworlds is the only available version at the moment, with the Switch 2 port due to drop around "Holiday 2025". As a result, I purchased the PS5 version first off, and that's where I've spent most of my time with the game, so it's hardly surprising that I'm being dazzled a little by the fancy graphics, which Mario Kart World can't really compete with. I'm taking this factor into account, be sure of it.</p>

<p>I've also picked the game up on Switch, where it doesn't look quite as nice (still looks fair enough, mind) and targets 30fps, which, for me personally, is perfectly fine. Even with these concessions, though, it's still beating MKW (and should do even more so when the Switch 2 edition drops) because it gives me races and an overall setup that keep me way more involved and interested.</p>
<h2>Mini Motivations Make Motoring Magic</h2>
<p>I've mentioned the open world not being my cup of tea, and that's an obvious sort of criticism to make - it's also a part of the game that's very easy to ignore, so MKW can survive that impact, but there's more to it than this. The real surprise has been that, on the track, Sonic is also doing more for me this time out, too.</p>
<p>Sonic Racing Crossworlds presents races which are split into an opening and final lap raced on the currently chosen course, with the middle lap seeing racers teleported to another track entirely. The racer in first position at the end of lap one gets to choose from either a random Crossworlds portal to any of the game's circuits or one that's been selected by the CPU in advance.</p>
<figure data-uuid="ad416a712da10"><a title="Sonic Racing Crossworlds vs MKW" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ad416a712da10/sonic-racing-crossworlds-vs-mkw.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / SEGA</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, immediately on starting a race, you've got this well-observed gameplay loop where you focus on getting a nice boost start, just like Mario Kart, and then you careen around corners, drifting and shooting off the game's fun assortment of items, with designs on being numero uno, so you get to choose where lap two occurs.</p>
<p>It creates a nice drive (no pun intended, I would never), a focus for the opening lap, which is then replaced by the fun of navigating whatever is thrown at you for lap two. It helps, as well, that the teleporting crossovers between worlds just look and feel cool to drive into, and they even managed to get all this tastiness looking and running okay on Switch. I've got high hopes for the Switch 2 upgrade.</p>
<p>There's an excitement created by the switching of venues, then, and it's enhanced further by excellent track design that cleverly digs down deep into Sega's unique, arcade-heavy vibe. These are the sorts of circuits I expect to race on when I'm inside a huge moving arcade unit, pumping my coins in for another shot. You know the sort of thing, great big dinosaurs running into the screen one moment and jets taking off the next.</p>
<p>All of this is offset by the exact kind of cheesy arcade announcer I could listen to all day. It feels urgent and exciting, retro and modern all at once. Oh, and the soundtrack! I don't have time or space here, but it's a perfect accompaniment to that '90s SEGA arcade vibe I'm harping on about. It just screams "VIDEO GAMES!!!" very loudly from every pore.</p>
<figure data-uuid="754afe2764a6e"><a title="Sonic Racing Crossworlds vs MKW" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/754afe2764a6e/sonic-racing-crossworlds-vs-mkw.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Drivin' In A Tweaker's Paradise</h2>
<p>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds then goes on to dominate when it comes to customisation and strategising. You have licence cards that upgrade and unlock to give you a total of six slots, and these slots can be filled with unlockable boons and boosts. Kickstart your race in Monster Truck mode to crush everyone at the starting line, give yourself a trio of boosts to get going, or spend the spaces tweaking your speed, acceleration, power, and handling to give yourself an edge. There are loads of options.</p>
<p>These four categories are also how the myriad car parts, which can be freely mixed and matched, are organised to browse through. Sonic, as an example, starts the game with his signature fast blue car, firmly in the speed category. As you play, you earn tickets to spend on front and back parts that can be combined to mix up traits and create cool-looking vehicles. There are also custom jobs, paint sets, and a surprising variety of decals.</p>
<p>As a result of all of this, and only a few days after having picked the game up, I've already cleared every single stage and cup, and grabbed every red coin along the way. I haven't even tried all the cups in Mario Kart World yet, and this is all the concrete proof that I need. I'm enjoying Crossworlds way, way more than World.</p>
<figure data-uuid="18b3732c2b292"><a title="Sonic Racing Crossworlds vs MKW" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/18b3732c2b292/sonic-racing-crossworlds-vs-mkw.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, and I must mention, in Crossworlds' cups, if I screw up in a race, I can pay a small fee to restart that race, rather than painfully replay the whole cup again. This is big news for angry people and/or anyone short on time. (I believe there is an overlap between these two groups of people.) More seriously, though, I can make actual progress thanks to this, which again keeps me committed to playing. I haven't mentioned the online stuff, or the play park where you can do battle modes and races that tweak the rules, and that's because I haven't really touched that yet - certainly not enough to comment on.</p>
<p>But that's the thing, even without comparing and contrasting every facet of these two games in-depth as we could do, Crossworlds easily wins out for me. There are no big, long, straight tracks to get bored on here, no being pulled out of the parts that excite and make you sweat to go complete a puzzle. I'll take speedy and slick Crossworlds portal action over the rallies' weirdly bland transitional phases and open world of Mario's latest all day.</p>
<h2>This Ain't No Roster Imposter</h2>

<p>In the interests of being fair, I will currently give Mario Kart World a win in its character roster. It's very hard to beat Mario and co. However, this is something which may also change, as Crossworlds has a whole bunch of very silly DLC characters en route, each with their own vehicle parts to add to the mix.</p>
<p>So, you see, there is a future to look forward to for Sega racers. A future in which Ichiban Kasuga speeds around Kronos Island in SpongeBob SquarePants' burger car. If that doesn't get your pulse racing, you may well be dead.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Of course, everyone's gonna have their favourite between these two, and we'll see plenty more debate when the Switch 2 version eventually shows up, I'm sure. But what's your favourite between the pair so far? Are you veering on the side of Mario and his open-world fanciness, or Sonic and his portals to other dimensions?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops usually come at high prices, and for anything decent in the market below $1,500, it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack. These systems have powerful hardware to support demanding games and creative tasks and that’s why they’re normally that costly. But if you need the best of everything without wasting your savings, Amazon’s <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> is the place to make it happen.</p>
<p>This Lenovo gaming laptop that is equipped with an <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/">AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor, 40GB DDR5 RAM, and 1TB PCIe SSD is literally amazing today: It was lowered from its regular price of $1,699 to only $649</a>, translating to a <strong>massive 62% off</strong> and setting an all-time low for the configuration.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gaming That Challenges Higher-End Machines in Performance</h2>
<p>The AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor is the power behind this laptop’s fantasstic performance. With <strong>6 cores and 12 threads running at 3.3GHz base clocks that turbo up to 4.55GHz</strong>, this chip edges ahead of Intel’s i7-11800H in several use cases. What does it mean for you? High-definition video editing becomes doable instead of infuriating, programming development environments launch and respond quickly even with multiple programs launched at once and tasks such as rendering in interior design or 3D modeling become doable. The 3MB L2 cache and 16MB L3 cache enable the processor to quickly call up frequently used data and minimize lag when you’re in the middle of intense multitasking sessions.</p>



<p>Complementing this processor is <strong>40GB of DDR5 SDRAM</strong> which is a huge improvement from previous DDR4 technology. DDR5 is faster for data transfer and more efficient with power so your laptop stays cooler and more quickly processes information. With 40GB readily available, you can use memory-intensive programs such as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/adobe-premiere-pro">Adobe Premiere</a>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/adobe-photoshop">Photoshop</a>, or several virtual machines and never see slowdowns. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/google-chrome">Chrome</a> users who have dozens of tabs up will love never again confronting that nasty “page unresponsive” message. The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD is storage that is blazingly fast</strong>, boots Windows in seconds, loads games near-instantly, and leaves you plenty of space for your entire game library.</p>



<p>The 15.3-inch display provides 1920×1200 resolution for a little more vertical screen real estate compared to typical Full HD displays. This additional vertical screen real estate is priceless when editing documents. Color accuracy is ensured from wide viewing angles with the IPS panel and you work just fine in brightly lit rooms or in front of windows due to the 300 nits brightness rating. Eye strain is lessened during long gaming sessions or working marathons with the anti-glare finish. With 45% NTSC color gamut coverage and a refresh rate of 60Hz, the display navigates daily gaming effortlessly. C<strong>asual to intense gaming, esports games, and creative programs are taken in their stride by the built-in AMD Radeon 660M processor</strong>.</p>
<p>Port selection accounts for all contingencies: two USB-A ports functioning at USB 3.2 Gen 1 levels (5Gbps) for the traditional accessories, one USB-C that doubles for both USB Power Delivery 3.0 for fast charging and DisplayPort 1.2 for attaching high-resolution external displays, an HDMI 1.4 for more display connections, a headphone jack for audio equipment and an SD card slot for speedy file imports from cameras.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Professional is backed up by enterprise-grade features such as BitLocker encryption and remote desktop, while the built-in Copilot AI PC feature is your intelligent aide available from its dedicated keyboard shortcut. There is even a 720p HD camera that has a privacy shutter for users who value their security.</p>
<p>With this Prime Day deal on Amazon, you’re getting gaming-level performance at a cost below that of the majority of business budget laptops.</p>
