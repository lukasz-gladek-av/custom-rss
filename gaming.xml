<figure><a title="Glory Hunters Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/148285/large.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>We originally published this review in June 2024 with a note that we'd flag if the game ever came to Switch. Well, it did! Published by Ogre Pixel, Glory Hunters lands on Switch today with various extras, including artwork</em> and sketches, a markable world map, and a live performance soundtrack.</p>
<p><em>For this review, George played and captured screenshots on an Analogue Pocket.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The release of GB Studio in 2019 has resulted in a flurry of games available for Nintendo’s lovely big brick over the last few years, but few have been as ambitious or as widely covered as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/glory_hunters">Glory Hunters</a> – the debut game of Mexico-based 2think design studio. Billed as "a unique Game Boy action-adventure RPG", Glory Hunters smashed its crowdfunding target on Kickstarter in 2022 and launched recently in both downloadable digital (via <a href="https://2think.itch.io/glory-hunters">itch.io</a>) and <a href="https://nintendolife.com/p/26837/167139" rel="sponsored noopener">physical form</a>, the latter coming courtesy of Bitmap Soft. But does it live up to the hype?</p>
<figure><a title="Glory Hunters Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/148296/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>During the build-up, Glory Hunters was often likened to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>, and right off the bat we see a large, celestial body (<em>not</em> a moon!) on a collision course with the land, followed by a positively <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker_hd">Wind Waker</a>-esque slideshow detailing an ancient tale - imploring a hero to rise up and summon a slumbering God to avert disaster.</p>
<p>But the similarities with Nintendo’s iconic franchise more or less end there. We’re thrust straight into the action. Sort of. We have a sword but there are no enemies, just some bushes and a path blocked by a suit of armour and a friendly little NPC, who lays out the premise that sets Glory Hunters apart from its forebears. The suit of armour is called a ‘Glory Knight’ and progression in the game is achieved through the collection of ‘Glory Points’ (GP) awarded by completing ‘glorious deeds’. We can use these to pay off the Glory Knights and open up new areas of the map. It’s a sort of levelling up, map expansion, and currency system rolled into one.</p>
<figure><a title="Glory Hunters Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/148298/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>At an impasse and with little else to go on, we do what any action-adventure veteran would. We start chopping bushes. Once five bite the dust, a notification pops up - we’ve achieved a glorious feat (apparently) called ‘Cut Starter’ and have a shiny GP for our troubles. We could pay up and move on but instead we keep chopping, curious as to what’s necessary to further this achievement. In doing so we unearth, to our delight, a different feat by picking up a certain amount of item drops.</p>
<p>Learning by doing is something of a lost art in modern games but Glory Hunters excels at this. It knows the tropes — we’re going to read signposts, peer down a well, relentlessly chop grass — and it rewards us for it. But it also steers us effortlessly toward more obscure feats, drip-feeding points to encourage repetition and exploration, constantly fuelling the compulsion to keep probing and trying new things. It’s setting us up to understand the deal from the very beginning – everything in this world is transactional. Succinct tutorial over, we’re then free to explore the open world of Glorianta any way we want, constrained only by the number of points in our possession and armed with the knowledge that reaching one of its four corners will allow us to complete our quest.</p>
<figure><a title="Glory Hunters Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/148284/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Easier said than done. Glorianta is a behemoth. At a grid size of 17x19 it’s more than four times bigger than Link’s first pocket adventure - and just as gorgeous as Koholint, too. In fact, the whole visual and audio presentation of the game is sublime. The boss designs are a particular highlight and there are cute cutscenes scattered throughout the adventure. The different regions of the world have a strong sense of identity while the music underscores each area perfectly, thumping anthems akin to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/mega_man">Mega Man</a> power us through the overworld while cosy relief is provided as we bustle about towns meeting inhabitants. It’s never overbearing and most importantly, <em>very</em> hummable. It’s not all work either, with some excellent minigames dotted about to both waste time on and collect GPs. Double win!</p>
<p>Exploration is hampered by the fact that the overworld map is only accessible in said towns. With such a huge space to explore, it’s a little overwhelming not to have a reference point at our fingertips; fortunately, the enemies are varied enough in pattern and design and the puzzles and hidden secrets sufficiently engaging to keep exploration interesting – though it does chug a bit if there’s more than two foes on the screen.</p>
<p>Saving the game and replenishing health is also restricted to specific areas and for a game that relies on repetition to drive exploration, this can be a real problem. Remember those bushes we chopped down at the start of the game? We chopped them down <em>a hundred times</em>, then died before finding a save point, which meant chopping them down 100 times again. This was quite discouraging at times – particularly at the start of the quest.</p>
<figure><a title="Glory Hunters Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/148293/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Another gripe we have is death resulting in us being returned to the world with the amount of health we had at the last save point, instead of replenishing it. More than once we came through a hard stretch, saved, then faced a tough challenge or needed to go back and became locked into a pretty dire situation where advancing or retreating punished us over and over again.</p>
<p>Having said that, the balance of GPs earned/required is pretty well judged, with minimal amounts of grinding necessary to press on. But GPs are also used as a currency to upgrade your armour, sword, amount of health, or give hints, so you're playing a constant guessing game about spending without knowing if a big blockade of Glory Knights lay ahead that would require hard-earned GPs and if amassing more would be achievable or even enjoyable should that be the case.</p>
<p>Over time, our thinking adjusted to the idea of chasing points to bolster ourselves, instead of bolstering ourselves and then chasing points, but this involved a lot of backtracking and there were definitely times when we just wanted to get on with it. There’s a whole host of other collectibles which felt a little underused and we couldn’t help but think maybe those might have been better suited to the role of currency.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Glory Hunters is a package that has had a lot of love poured into it while remaining a little rough around the edges. We weren’t always sure when we were taking damage or even dishing it out – particularly when facing larger, noisier bosses, and some beats within the game felt a bit flat. Some translation quirks and grammatical errors also popped up, but these were never substantial enough to bother us (we actually thought they added a bit of charm to proceedings). <em>[Update: These have reportedly been addressed in the Switch version.]</em></p>
<p>All in all, Glorianta is a rich, deep world that is enjoyable to explore and successfully taps into nostalgia for Game Boy experiences while providing a fresh and interesting take on the formula. Proof, if there was ever any doubt, that there’s life in the old Boy yet.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/25/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review.1364590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It’s pretty staggering just how consistent the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> franchise has been over the last two decades. A new game every single year, bouncing back and forth between studios and sub-series, it’s remained at the top of the FPS genre for three console generations. But maybe that crown is slipping? Maybe we need to start thinking of them in terms of even and odd-numbered <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-trek">Star Trek</a> movies? <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> is not an even number…</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Launch Trailer (PC Features Spotlight) [UK]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yX8T2nqPjno?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Black Ops 7 Multiplayer</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the real heart of the Call of Duty franchise and Black Ops 7’s multiplayer. A year on from <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>, and this is largely a continuation from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">the highs</a> of that game. You still have the omnidirectional movement that keeps everything fast and fluid, you still have the solid loadout system with perk synergies building to specialisations, and you’ve got plenty of maps that generally lean in on <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/treyarch">Treyarch</a>‘s strong lane-based design style.</p>


<p>Many of the maps also take advantage of the main addition to this year’s gameplay: wall-jumping. We’re far from the excesses of the jetpack era of Call of Duty, but this is a nice nod to those sci-fi infused titles, giving a little more verticality, a snifter of additional movement flexibility. Of course, the near-future setting means you’ve also got more turrets, robot DAWGs, active camo, and a killstreak that gives you a gun to shoot through walls – it’s feels filthy to see yourself get sniped like this on a deathcam, but compared to other killstreaks, it’s really no more or less lethal.</p>


<p>In general, the TTK does feel a little faster again, which combined with the speed of motion could be pushing this game out of your comfort zone, but if the 6v6 Call of Duty multiplayer is all you want in life, then Black Ops 7 has you covered. But what if you want something bigger, with vehicles and more tactical? No, please don’t leave! Uh, there’s the 20v20 Skirmish mode!</p>
<p>This tries to cover off that large-scale battle angle, with two big maps, vehicles and a rolling set of capture, destroy, takeover and escort objectives. If anything, it ramps the pace up even further, since you spawn high in the sky and can wingsuit to pretty much wherever you like on the map, even barrelling straight through windows and into objective zones. Far from being an antidote to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, though, it’s all too often just madcap and finds itself in this no-man’s land between these rival franchises.</p>

<h2>The Co-op Campaign &amp; Endgame</h2>
<p>After the good, even great showings in the last two Black Ops games for their single player campaigns, Black Ops 7 is a major misstep. We’re jumping ahead from the Cold War and Gulf War to a decade after the events of Black Ops 2 and returning to David Mason and his team. The story tugs on narrative threads from across the series, mixing in the Cradle from Black Ops 6 for a twisted sci-fi psychological thriller. Except it’s just not even remotely thrilling.</p>

<p>The campaign bounces back and forth between sections set in the open world map of Avalon, which is filled with bland human and robot soldiers for The Guild, and then nightmare reimaginings of events from each character’s past. That means revisiting plot points from Black Ops 2, such as a version of the Battle for LA with roads twisting through the air all Inception-style, or fighting a giant version of Harper on the deck of an aircraft carrier, but it even goes back to fighting zombies in a rerun of the Vorkuta prison break.</p>
<p>I’m all for Call of Duty experimenting with the format of the campaign, and the Black Ops series has done this more often than not, with narrative branches, side missions, hubs, and more. Black Ops 7 just misses the mark, from enemies having health bars, to not having AI buddies when playing solo, and just how bland The Guild are as enemies and how rote the horror monsters are.</p>

<p>It soon becomes clear that this was, in part, about leading into the Endgame co-op mode, taking the template from Modern Warfare III’s Zombies in a different thematic direction. This gives you the full map of Avalon to play in as an extraction shooter, gating areas behind the level and gear of your chosen Operator, doling out missions and then having you get out safely with everything you’ve found.</p>
<p>It’s purely PvE, with dozens of other players able to team up on the fly and take on the higher-level missions and scenarios, and there’s some fun Cradle effects, like a random little game of prop hunt. But it’s really not exciting building up to the end of the Endgame events, as you’re largely fighting against fairly boring enemies and completing basic missions. There’s also the tonal whiplash you felt throughout the campaign, as zombies and other fantastical elements are thrown in for the heck of it.</p>
<h2>Black Ops 7 Zombies</h2>
<p>The more traditional home of co-op in Call of Duty is its Zombies mode, with Black Ops 7 picking up the convoluted Dark Aether narrative from last year’s game. The Ashes of the Damned map is huge, with six key areas to reach and explore, joined up by a bunch of roads and other smaller points of interest shrouded in The Fog. It’s big enough, in fact, that you need to hop into a pick-up truck –&nbsp;nicknamed Ol’ Tessie –&nbsp;to get around. She’s a battered workhorse of a truck, able to smash through hordes of zombies, but only for a limited time before she takes too much damage and needs repairs. Later upgrades, though, put a mean turret on top and Abomination Heads that can blast streams of zombie-frying lightning.</p>

<p>The problem with this, of course, is that it means your co-op party really needs to be on the same page. Anyone can jump into the truck and just drive off, leaving others with a sprint through the danger-filled Fog, unless they happen to be at the garage in the Ashwood area, where you can summon Tessie back or teleport to her for a fee. You really want to play this mode with friends and voice chat, especially if you’re trying to follow the Easter Egg story path.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there’s other ways to play. If you prefer the classic Zombies feel, you can play Cursed mode and start off with just a pistol, while a Directed mode for the main quest is coming soon. There’s also a pure Survival mode, which takes the Farmyard section of Ashes of the Damned, and simply gives you waves to battle through. No frills, no nonsense, just classic Zombies on a pretty confined map, and since I’m really not invested in the story, it’s really my preferred way to play this mode.</p>

<p>There’s also the return of Dead Ops Arcade, the top-down zombie shooter which puts over-the-top weaponry in your hands at every opportunity and progresses through a nonsensical quest with apes and chickens. You can actually play it in first person the whole time now, and some power-ups will still switch you to this view anyway. There’s tons of rooms to battle through, tons of excess, and it’s easy to slide into, but it doesn’t really feel novel anymore. Dead Ops Arcade was a secret mode for a secret mode just as indie games and retro aesthetics were coming into their own in the early 2010s, but 15 years later and the indie scene has moved on to explore many more genres, mash-ups and riff on these ideas in more engaging ways.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Since releasing in February 2022, Valve’s Steam Deck has become the most popular gaming handheld on the market. One of the first accessible ways to play your PC games on the go, the Steam Deck is close to being a perfect device for many, but there are some ways it can improve. One way specifically that you can make your Steam Deck experience better is with some accessories and add-ons.</p>



<p>Whether you want to protect it, upgrade the comfort, or just get more out of the device, there are tons of great accessories available. Some are even on the more affordable side, as well. These are the best Steam Deck accessories available for the 2025 holidays.</p>



<p>Below, you’ll find a list of the best options available today, from protective shells and screen protectors to docking stations and thumb grips. Everything here is compatible with both the Steam Deck LCD and OLED models. If you want to get more out of your handheld, these are the accessories worth checking out this year.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-best-steam-deck-accessories-for-2025">The Best Steam Deck Accessories For 2025</h2>



<p><strong>JSAUX PC0104 Shell Case</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The first Steam Deck accessory to check out is one that brings durability to the handheld. This shell case from not only protects it when in use, but it comes with a full shell cover for transportation that protects the screen, joysticks and face buttons. There’s even a kickstand for those that want to plug it in simply via the USB-C port and a strap if you want to attach a power bank. It’s <strong>available for $23.99 for the holidays</strong>, and costs $30 throughout the year.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Syntech Soft Case</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>When shopping for a case, sometimes you want something practical. This case will cost you <strong>less than $25</strong>, and goes around the entire Steam Deck without adding too much bulk. It doesn’t interfere with any of the buttons and sits as snug as any chase you’ll find—it’s been used by senior editor Mike Straw for a few months now, actually. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Cooling Fan</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you feel like the Steam Deck runs a little too warm, there are options to keep it on the cooler side. One option comes from JSUAX. This cooling fan snaps right on and helps with overall circulation. It even has a kick stand, allowing you to set it up nicely on your table or desk. If it’s something you’re interested in, you can pick it up <strong>for $30 on sale</strong>, or <strong>$40 at regular price. </strong></p>











<hr>



<p><strong>Back Button Enhancements</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Feel like your fingers slip off the back panel buttons? These rubber grips come in two different sizes to make the buttons feel thicker on the fingers and avoid any possible slip or mis-click. Currently they are <strong>on sale for $12</strong>, but regularly run <strong>about $14.</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Thumb Grips</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sometimes the grip on the handheld isn’t what you want it. These Skull &amp; Co thumb grips come with three styles in a pack to help match your preference. They are <strong>available for $10</strong>.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>IVANKY Docking Station</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are a lot of docking stations for the Steam Deck, but this one might be one of the best. It features a USB-c connection that goes to the device while the dock itself has HDMI 2.1 output that supports up to 4K@144Hz, three USB-A 3.0 ports, a 1GB Ethernet port, and a rapid-charging USB-C port to keep your device fully juiced. It’s normally $39.99, but you can<strong> buy it now for $28.</strong></p>











<hr>



<p><strong>PlayVital Rubber Pads</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want to add some style to your Steam Deck while improving functionality? These rubber pads come in different varieties and not only look great, but they give you added grip as well. <strong>For less than $15</strong> you can get designs ranging from basic black hexagons to waves and space. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong><strong>Sony INZONE E9 Wired In-Ear Monitor</strong></strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sony built these IEMs specifically for competitive gaming, so they’re all about clean, accurate sound and great positional audio. They’re lightweight, block out noise surprisingly well, and come with a small USB-C DAC that lets you tweak EQ and surround settings through the INZONE software. If you want gaming headset-level detail without wearing a bulky headset, these are a fantastic pick.</p>



<p>One underrated feature of the earbuds is just how good they are at blocking out the outside noise. It’s absolutely perfect when on a long flight that happens to have children on it that are a little bit upset. That alone is worth <strong>the $149.99</strong> price point.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Screen Protecto</strong>r</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With any portable device, the last thing you want to do is damage the screen. These tempered glass screen protectors cover the screen from edge to edge and protect both the LCD and OLED models. The best part is that you can still use the touch screen despite the thickness. Right now, a <strong>two-pack is $10</strong>, but you can often find it for <strong>as low as $8</strong>.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Samsung PRO Plus microSD</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those on the go that need more space in their Steam Deck or Xbox Ally X, the Samsung PRO Plus microSD is one of the best cards on the market without completely breaking the bank. This card offers read/write speeds up to around 180 MB/s for reading and 130 MB/s writing. The card starts at <strong>$26.99</strong> for 256GB but is also available in 512 GB for<strong> $49.99</strong> and <strong>$79.99</strong> for 1TB.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Treyarch said it heard the feedback from players, and the new update adds a disconnect protection. Now when players drop into matches of Endgame, the game snapshots the player's Combat Rating at the start of the match. This means players will keep their progress that was snapshotted at the start of the match even if a disconnect or crash occurs.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're exploring additional and more robust forms of disconnect protection and will look to share more in the future," the developer said.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes can be found below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-preseason-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">as shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This update arrives ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-7-and-warzone-season-1-adds-more-maps-weapons-and-warzone-integration/2900-7281/#2">Call of Duty Season 1</a>, which adds new world events to Endgame. Treyarch has confirmed the zombie T-Rex from Black Ops 6 and the giant Origins robot from Black Ops 2 Zombies as new boss battles for Endgame.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 1 of Black Ops 7 and Warzone arrives on December 4. The update is packed with new content, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-black-ops-7-and-warzone-season-1-weapons-and-how-to-unlock-them/2900-7284/#1">seven new weapons</a> to unlock, more maps, seasonal events, and Black Ops 7's integration into Warzone.</p><h2>CO-OP CAMPAIGN / ENDGAME</h2><h3>Disconnect Protection</h3><p>We’re thrilled with the response to Endgame so far and have enjoyed watching new players deploy to Avalon to explore, complete quests, and begin the journey toward the Genesis Mastery Camo. We’ve also seen the feedback: disconnect / crash protections are needed to help protect your Combat Rating.</p><p>So, now when you deploy to Avalon, we'll snapshot your Combat Rating at the start of the match. Earn progress and extract to grow your Combat Rating; fall in combat or fail to escape, and you'll lose it all. However, in the event that a disconnect does occur, you'll now begin your next match at the Combat Rating that you entered your previous match in to continue back on your path of reaching CR 60.</p><p>We’re exploring additional and more robust forms of disconnect protection and will look to share more in the future. Until then, keep growing your Combat Rating and get ready for World Events coming in Season 01.</p><ul><li>A new Disconnect Protection mechanic has been added to Endgame.  <ul><li>Players who deploy to Avalon in Endgame will have their initial Combat Rating snapshotted at the start of the match. Players who disconnect will be able to start their next match at that previous Combat Rating.</li></ul></li></ul>

		<p>The first episode for Subnautica 2’s tie in audio drama Voices from Beyond is now available to listen to, and this episode is called Don’t Fear. The Voices from Beyond story follows a family from the universe who are settled in a Mongolian settlement, as they work out how to live in a constantly shifting world unaware there is a big threat hurtling towards them.</p>

<p>Subnautica 2 Voices from Beyond stars Griffin Puata as the Dad/Mongolian Politician, Hester Lee as Mom/Alterra Engineer, Jessika Van as the Daughter/Singer, Nell Barnes as Baby/Young Daughter, Dan Gordon as Ryley Robinson/Podcast Host, Emily O’Brien as Radio News Host #1 / PSA Announcer / Admiral Rathine Studaber, and Townsend Coleman as Radio News Host #2 / Alterra Advertiser.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/10/subnautica-2-delayed-to-2026-just-a-week-after-krafton-fired-studio-co-founders/">Subnautica 2 early access was delayed to 2026</a>, a few months ago with lots of drama surrounding the studio and the game. Krafton replaced the co-founders and leaders of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> developer Unknown Worlds. Krafton accused studio founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire of effectively abandoning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2’s</a>&nbsp;development to focus on other projects – including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abyssal.co/nutmeg-mistletoe">an independent movie by Cleveland with a podcast and… uh… AI-generated movie posters</a> – despite repeated requests by Krafton for them to return to work. But in another twist, &nbsp;Jason Schreier suggested that along with the Christmas film, Cleveland was also working on a Subnautica film for Krafton. “In the lawsuit, they argue that Krafton was aware of their roles and that Cleveland was working on a Subnautica film — that Krafton requested.”</p>

<p>All of this has ended up with Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire suing Krafton, with new allegations that the Krafton CEO used ChatGPT to find ways to avoid paying a £250 million bonus, and also discussed a company takeover in Slack. It will be a little while before we know the final outcome of the court case.</p>

			<p>KO_OP, the studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/goodbye-volcano-high/">2023's Goodbye Volcano High</a>, has just revealed and released its latest game, Young Suns. The new title is an early access release that's been shadow-dropped on Xbox Game Pass as a Game Preview title, though it'll arrive on other platforms at some point in the future.</p>



<p>Like Goodbye Volcano High before it, Young Suns is a narrative-driven game, though this time it is a 1-4 player narrative sim that takes place in space, in a distant future where you step into the space boots of Sundog, one of the last remaining ship owners following a revolt that drove back a predatory corporation.</p>



<p>Now, with the people of Jupiter recently freed, you have to step up to try and build the better world they all just got done fighting for, and meet the 30 "<em>full realized</em>" characters to learn what problems they're dealing with and how you can help them.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>On the game's <a href="https://www.youngsuns.com/roadmap">official website</a>, on its roadmap, KO_OP says it'll focus on new features like character and friendship tracking, an overhaul of the workbench, new cosmetic items like clothing and furniture, and, of course, bug and balance fixes. </p>



<p>Releases on new platforms like Steam, which is currently the only other platform we know it'll be coming to, as there's no word on a PlayStation or Nintendo release, are left for the "<em>In the future"</em> section of the roadmap.</p>



<p>Ahead of that, even more features, like introducing wildlife on the planets you explore, mini games, new story quests, and a photo mode, are currently planned to arrive shortly after the initial friendship tracking and workbench updates.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/act-fast-to-snag-the-microsoft-office-professional-2021-at-a-180-discount-at-stacksocial-today-2000647013</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-goes-beyond-laptop-deals-ms-office-pro-2021-lifetime-license-is-nearly-free-at-90-off-for-black-friday.1364551/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Top tech, kitchen appliances, outdoor gear, and games aren’t the only things going for less during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. It’s also a great time to grab some useful subscriptions and software for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">StackSocial has dropped the price of Microsoft Office Professional 2021 for Windows to just $35, after a massive 84% discount.</a> It’s a lifetime license, so you won’t have to worry about paying an additional monthly or yearly fee after your purchase, ever.</p>
<p>It’s one of the many early Black Friday deals by the retailer, but it’s selling out fast. At the time of writing, over 20,000 licenses have been sold at the discounted rate. We don’t know how long it’s going to stay around, so it’s best to grab it quickly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Instant Access to All the Essential Programs</h2>
<p>It’s more of a one-and-done purchase. You’re going to receive access to your software license keys and download links instantly after you complete your purchase. The code needs to be redeemed within 7 days, or it’s going to expire. The licensing type will be connected with your actual device and not your Microsoft account, so you won’t exactly be able to transfer it across multiple machines.</p>
<p>There are some system requirements you need to know about. It runs on Windows 10 and 11, and doesn’t support older systems like Windows 7 or 8. The retailers recommend installing it on a device with at least 16 GB of RAM, plus having 4GB of available storage and a screen resolution of at least 1280×800. Most standard PCs already have these built in, but we still suggest peeking at your system settings before you proceed.</p>
<p>Once installed, you’ll have access to the full Microsoft Office Professional 2021 suite. This includes Microsoft Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Whether you’re someone who needs to write a bunch of documents or create long, never-ending spreadsheets at work, it’s all covered. PowerPoint lets you create stunning, professional-level presentations with a whole bunch of useful tools built right in. Accessing your emails and communicating with the team will be just as easy with Outlook. You can even use it to manage your everyday calendar and stay on top of your tasks for better productivity throughout the day.</p>



<p>Support for Teams (free version) lets you take meetings on the go. Students will appreciate OneNote, a program that makes it both fun and easy to take notes, mark documents, create diagrams, and organize everything into different categories. Publisher and Access are available, too. The former can be used to develop your very own publications, while the latter is great for creating databases and automating tasks. The entire suite is great for work professionals looking to manage tasks better, students wanting to study more efficiently, creatives who need to organize their workflows, and even casual users who want to enjoy better efficiency.</p>
<p>This isn’t the latest version of Microsoft Office, but it still delivers all the basic features you can possibly need to get through your busy, demanding days. Just note that it does not work like Microsoft 365, so you won’t get access to cloud-based storage or features like real-time collaboration. It’s more suited for solo, offline use.</p>
<p>On a regular day, this Microsoft Office Professional 2021 for Windows license would set you back around $220. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">The current deal takes $180 off and offers it for just $35, which is practically nothing for the convenience it brings.</a> You also don’t have to worry about entering any long coupon codes or following complicated checkout processes to score the drop. Just add it to your cart, receive the credentials, and follow the suggested steps to complete the process.</p>

                <p>Recently, actor Charlie Cox <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-star-reacts-to-tga-nomination-says-he-doesnt-deserve-all-the-credit/1100-6536464/" data-ref-id="1100-6536464">reacted to his nomination for Best Performance in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> by saying the credit should also be shared with the performance-capture actor, Maxence Cazoria. Now, Cazoria has <a href="https://x.com/maxence_cazorla/status/1993339680608465405?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> he's receiving an outpouring of support after Cox spoke up, saying what Cox said about him was "incredibly generous."</p><p>"Thank you for all the messages these past few days. Charlie's words were incredibly generous, and I'm truly grateful," Cazoria said. "Bringing Gustave to life was a team effort, and I'm honored to have played my part in it. Thank you all so much for the love and support. Tomorrow comes."</p><p>Cox said he was "thrilled" to be nominated, adding that Cazoria should get the credit. "I believe the performance of that character is really down to him and my voice was just a part of that process," he said.</p><p>Cox was nominated for Best Performance alongside two other Expedition 33 actors, including Ben Starr and Jennifer English. Erika Ishii was nominated for Ghost of Yotei, Konatsu Kato for Silent Hill f, and Troy Baker for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p><p>The Best Performance award is not just for voice-acting, as it also includes motion- and/or performance-capture. Given that, it would appear that Cazoria would have been eligible, too.</p><p>Expedition 33 led all others this year with 12 total nominations, including a nod for Game of the Year. With 12 nominations, that makes it the most-nominated game in the history of The Game Awards.</p><p>The Game Awards take place on Thursday, December 11, but it's expected there there will be teases ahead of that, so keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/earliest-known-super-mario-bros-cartridge-to-go-up-for-charity-auction-next-month.1364518/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The earliest known cartridge copy of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, which may also be the iconic platformer's master copy, is going up for auction next month, with the proceeds entirely going to benefit a major gaming preservation charity.</p>

<p>Auction house <a href="https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6566468" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Christie's</a> will play host to the auction, in which a 1985-era&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>cartridge will be up for grabs. The price will be pretty steep, though; Christie's estimates the cart will cost you somewhere in the region of £100,000 to £150,000 (about $130,000 to $200,000).</p>

<p>The auction is being held to benefit the Video Game History Foundation (VGHF), a charity organization that's involved with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/simcity-nes-prototype-digitized-and-dissected-by-video-game-history-foundation" rel="nofollow">preserving</a> some of the most <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/video-game-history-foundation-computer-entertainer" rel="nofollow">important</a> (and esoteric!) artifacts from throughout gaming history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-bros-cartridge-auction-shot.jpg?itok=5q1pvI1f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-bros-cartridge-auction-shot.jpg?itok=SeT4JrqA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It may not look like much, but this could be the master copy of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The Video Game History Foundation says that this cartridge was created at Nintendo before mass production on&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>began, and that while the charity can't be certain, "it is possible that this was the original master copy of the game", i.e. the one on which all retail copies were based.</p>

<p>Of course, given the cartridge's age, it's possible that the game wouldn't work if you were to slot it into a Famicom console, but I don't suppose anyone picking this up will be buying it so they can play&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.</em>; it's more of a collector's item.</p>

<p>This is far from the first&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.</em>-related retro gaming auction. During 2021 alone, two&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-sells-for-over-600k-at-auction" rel="nofollow">cartridges</a> sold for eye-watering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-copy-sells-for-record-breaking-price" rel="nofollow">amounts</a>, and other games in the franchise have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-3-most-expensive-game-ever-sold" rel="nofollow">commanded incredible prices</a> at auction as well.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>itself, well, the game needs no introduction; as the Christie's lot essay for the above cartridge says, it's "the most influential video game of all time", or at least a strong contender for that title.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-bros.-wonder-charity-auction-original-game.jpg?itok=BKtxOInJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-bros.-wonder-charity-auction-original-game.jpg?itok=9XclmwQg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>franchise is still going strong today.</figcaption></figure><p>If you'd like to bid for what may very well be the&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>master copy, bidding begins via the Christie's website on December 11th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-python-commandos-warbond</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-python-commandos-warbond-brings-a-minigun-and-more-next-week.1364515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead and Sony have announced Python Commandos, a brand new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and it's bringing an honest-to-god minigun and more next week.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Python Commandos launches on December 2nd (that's next Tuesday at time of writing), and as has been the case with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-force-of-law-warbond" rel="nofollow">Warbonds</a>, you can expect new weapons, new armor, and new emotes to bring with you into the field.</p>

<p>First off, the M-1000 Maxigun is a belt-fed, ultra-high-capacity minigun that should let you tear through bugs, bots, and whatever else gets in your way with aplomb. Just try not to turn it on your teammates.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-python-commandos-warbond-minigun.jpg?itok=Z7NgMf0G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-python-commandos-warbond-minigun.jpg?itok=Uhnai22j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Warbond has a minigun for you to lay waste to your enemies with.</figcaption></figure><p>A new Guard Dog drone equipped with a flamethrower is also being added, but once again, you'll need to make sure it doesn't accidentally set your teammates on fire (or perhaps they'll need to make sure they're not in its way).</p>

<p>Hacking your way through&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s jungles just got a lot easier, too, as the aptly-named CQC-9 Defoliation Tool (which, yes, is basically a machete) can cut through everything, be it brush, bugs, or, uh, buddies.</p>

<p>You can also get to grips with a brand new primary weapon in Python Commandos, namely the AR/GL-21 One-Two, a "combination assault rifle and grenade launcher" that lets you switch between these two modes depending on what you need.</p>

<p>All of this is, of course, in addition to brand new armor sets with a passive that makes your Helldiver harder to ragdoll, as well as two new capes, a new emote, and a brand new camo pattern for your gear.</p>




<p>You'll be able to get your hands on <i>Helldivers 2</i>'s Python Commandos Warbond when it arrives across all platforms on December 2nd. The game is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" rel="nofollow">review right here</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>This week’s most popular game is not a robovoiced extraction shooter or a buggy martial arts RPG, but Guess The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a> Price: a well-meaning (if largely speculative) timepasser wherein whoever most accurately converts <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-confirm-the-steam-machine-will-be-priced-like-a-pc-with-similar-specs-rather-than-a-console">Valve’s teasing</a> into a final street price for the resurrected SteamOS mini-PC wins. In 2026, when it launches.</p>
<p>I feel left out, so will have a go myself below, though there’s quite a serious kink in mine or indeed anyone’s plan to ticket the Steam Machine by speccing an equivalent DIY PC. Alas, RAM prices have gone stratospheric, in a manner not seen among computing components since the Great Graphics Card Dumpster Fire of 2020.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As then, but now, the cause is an industry-wide shortage, only this time trigged by – <em>you again</em> – artificial intelligence. In short, AI data centres are rapidly expanding, eating up memory output and leaving scant RAM supplies for consumer PC building. What’s left has, broadly since October but this past week especially, been slapped with obscene markups: this unremarkable <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CTHXMYL8?th=1">Crucial DDR5 32GB</a> kit, for example, was £88 a month ago. Now it’s £206. A bog-standard Corsair Vengeance DDR5 32GB set? Was £100 in September, now yours for just <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CBRJ63RT?th=1">£350</a>. This premium 64GB kit was already pricey at £210, again back in September, and now sits at <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0C5M9P5GK/">£557</a> – more than an RTX 5070, a base PS5, or 1,011 packets of M&amp;S extra cream Bourbon biscuits. 1,011! Makes me <em>sick</em>.</p>
<p>Hardware manufacturers can purchase at scale, and may have enough RAM sticks squirreled away to maintain production, potentially for the several months that shortages are expected to continue. But those who haven’t stockpiled parts will end up feeling the crunch – Microsoft are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-could-be-forced-into-raising-the-price-of-xbox-consoles-again-given-global-ram-shortage-leaker-claims">allegedly considering yet another price hike</a> for their Xbox Series X/S consoles to cover the higher memory costs.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>None of this bodes well for the Steam Machine. Worst case, Valve must pay top dollar for its DDR5 modules (these are smaller, laptop-style sticks rather than desktop DIMMs, but the type in question still appears affected) and bump up the Machine’s price to compensate. Best case, they have enough memory from the pre-crisis days for a more affordable launch. But, at some point that stock will run out, and Valve will need to choose between supplying more Steam Machines with this AI tax in play or wait it out while those digital shelves grow cobwebs.</p><p>For now, though, nobody actually knows what the situation will be in early 2026, likely including Valve themselves. Indeed, it wouldn’t be remotely surprising if fluctuating parts prices are among the reasons why they didn’t just announce pricing for the Steam Machine, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a> as part of the initial reveal. In any case, I wouldn’t put too much weight on anyone’s Steam Machine price estimates just because they’ve totted up the cost of a similar home-built PC.</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s my Steam Machine price estimate, based on totting up the cost of a similar home-built PC. I’m specifically going for parts that would closely replicate the Steam Machine’s <em>performance</em>, based on my testing of it at Valve HQ last month, and not necessarily its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">on-paper specs</a>. Partly because it has something akin to a custom-built laptop CPU and nobody’s going to bother putting something like that in a DIY desktop.</p>

<p>Hope that was helpful. It won't be. But I hope.</p>

              <p>Valve is running a big Black Friday sale for the first time in Steam’s history. Normally, around this time of year, we get a Fall sale and a Winter sale. Now Valve has decided to join in with every other online retailer and treat Black Friday as a week-long sales event. But hey, cheaper games are always nice, especially when they are new releases.</p> <p>On November 25, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/specials/?flavor=contenthub_topsellers&amp;offset=74">Valve surprised many by announcing a large Black Friday sale</a> on its hugely popular PC gaming storefront, Steam. The sale runs from now until December 1 and features a large list of games across basically every genre and sub-genre you can imagine. Better yet, a lot of the discounted games include titles, both big and small, that launched in 2025.</p>

 <p>For example, you can grab <em>Battlefield 6,</em> one of the biggest games this year, for $10 less than usual. If you are looking for something big to sink into over Thanksgiving, the remastered <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> is just $34 this week. Or maybe you want some puzzles to solve with your family and friends? Well, good news: <em>Blue Prince</em> is discounted to just $20 during Steam’s big sale. And if you crave a fun zombie game, this year’s <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> is excellent and even better at $45.</p>

 <p>And it’s not just games that are on sale. <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-black-friday-sale-discount-pc-gaming-2000647222">Valve has also marked down the Steam Deck, too.</a> You can get the base LCD model for $80 less than usual. It might be a bit old now, but the Steam Deck is still a damn fine way to play most indie games and smaller titles in 2025.</p> <p>Of course, with a sale this big, we here at <em>Kotaku</em> want to help you find a good deal. So our crack team of experts (me) used advanced algorithms (I spent an hour digging through deals) to assemble a handy database of big discounts worth checking out. (I made a list for you.)</p>  <ul> <li><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> – $56 ($70)</li> <li><em>Silent Hill f</em> – $56 ($70)</li> <li><em>Split Fiction</em> – $40 ($50)</li> <li><em>EA Sports FC 2026</em> – $35 ($70)</li> <li><em>Of Ash &amp; Steel</em> – $24 ($30)</li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> – $34 ($50)</li> <li><em>Blue Prince</em> – $20 ($30)</li> <li><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> – $49 ($70)</li> <li><em>Battlefield 6</em> – $60 ($70)</li> <li><em>Moonlighter 2</em> – $25 ($30)</li> <li><em>Dying Light The Beast</em> – $45 ($60)</li> <li><em>Borderlands 4</em> – $56 ($70)</li> <li><em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</em>– $21 ($30)</li> <li><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> – $26 ($40)</li> <li><em>Hellclock</em> – $14 ($20)</li> <li><em>Mars First Logistics</em> – $13 ($20)</li> <li><em>Metal Eden</em> – $20 ($40)</li> <li><em>Wildgate</em> – $15 ($30)</li> <li><em>Camper Van: Make It Home</em> – $11 ($15)</li> <li><em>Chip ‘N Clawz vs. The Brainioids</em> – $21 ($30)</li> <li><em>Time Flies</em> – $12 ($15)</li> <li><em>to a T</em> – $13 ($20)</li> <li><em>Tron Catalyst</em> – $17 ($25)</li> <li><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> – $70 ($35)</li> <li><em>Jackbox Party Pack 11</em> – $24 ($30)</li> </ul>

              <p>Following the success of the Steam Deck PC gaming handheld, Valve announce an all-new lineup of gaming hardware including a Steam Controller, a VR kit called the Steam Frame, and the Steam Machine. The last of those is a retread of Valve’s attempt at having a home gaming console, but the company is in a much better position to be an Xbox killer now given current hardware capabilities along with the work put in to make the Steam OS into what it is now. That said, the big question is price. We currently have no clue what it will sell for nor when it will come out. So if you’re aching to get some gaming in right now, maybe go with a gaming laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5674/">This Asus ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop is currently on sale at Amazon Black Friday, for 19% off.</a> It’s normally listed at $2,100 but the discount ends up bringing it down by a full $400. You end up only having to pay $1,700 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5674/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Diving into the specs, this 2025 premiere gaming laptop is working with the AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX processor alongside an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Laptop GPU. You can expect cutting-edge performance all on a portable device. It’s packed with 32GB of DDR5-5600MHz memory and a storage capacity of 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD for your gaming library.</p>
<h2>Stunning Visuals</h2>
<p>The laptop is employing a premium ROG Nebula display, capable of ultra-fast 240Hz refresh rates with an input time of just 3ms. The screen measures across at 16 inches and has a 90% screen-to-body ratio to help maximize it’s workable area. It’s covered with an ACR film which helps to both enhance contrast as well as reduce glare when gaming in brightly lit spaces. NVIDIA G-Sync is supported, helping to eliminate screen tearing while playing fast-action games such as a first person shooter.</p>



<p>Advanced thermals work to keep your system cool and quiet during intense gameplay. The unit features three fans working in unison along with a heatsink the full width of the laptop and vents on all sides, all helping to keep the Asus ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop cool.</p>
<p>And it wouldn’t be a capital-G Gaming laptop without customizable RGB. The light bar can be set to synchronize with your keyboard and other ROG peripherals. And with the touch of a button, switch it to stealth mode to turn off the RGB lighting. Great for professional settings.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware are teaming up at least one more time to deliver Elden Ring Nightreign’s anticipated The Forsaken Hollows DLC. If you thought you were done beating the night, you can think again.</p>



<p>The Nightreign updates and content haven’t stopped since launch. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-is-about-to-get-even-harder-in-new-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got even harder</a>—which was brutal—and then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-expansion-dlc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first expansion was revealed.</a> The developer has no intention for you to go outside and see the light anytime soon.</p>

<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign’s The Forspoken Hollows DLC is currently scheduled to release on December 4.</strong></p>



<p>This would be quite apt as it would be nearly one year on from Nightreign’s announcement at The Game Awards 2024. With no word on how much content Nightreign is expected to get—especially with FromSoftware resources being diverted to The Duskbloods—this could end up being the only major DLC expansion for Nightreign.</p>



<p>This guide will be updated if any late announcements indicate a delay to The Forspoken Hollows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This product is an additional&nbsp;DLC&nbsp;for&nbsp;ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN. It includes&nbsp;2 additional Nightfarers,&nbsp;2 new Bosses, and&nbsp;1 new Shifting Earth, and more.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The two new Nightfarers are <strong>Scholar </strong>and <strong>Undertaker</strong>. Here’s a brief explainer provided for each new character:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Scholar:</strong> “An&nbsp;academic&nbsp;who walks the&nbsp;Lands Between.&nbsp;Boasting impressive arcane levels, he gains incredible advantages through battlefield observation.”</li>



<li><strong>Undertaker:</strong> “An&nbsp;abbess&nbsp;who was mandated to slay the&nbsp;Nightlord.&nbsp;Boasting impressive strength and faith, she sends enemies to the afterlife with ruthless efficiency.”</li>
</ul>



<p>Whereas the Shifting Earth brings about gorgeous crystals in an enchanting locale. The rest remains to be seen on December 4. As usual, the content is playable on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Indie horror game Horses is preparing to launch on December 2 on the Epic Games Store, GOG, Itch.io, and the Humble Store. But one place it won't be is on Steam, because Steam has banned the game for, according to the developer, reasons that remain unclear even after two years of back-and-forth with Valve. And according to the developer, this ban seems likely to result in the shutdown of their entire studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke with Pietro Righi Riva of Italian studio Santa Ragione (Saturnalia, Wheels of Aurelia, MirrorMoon EP), who explained their side of the story. According to Riva and a <a href="https://horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">detailed FAQ</a> shared with IGN, Santa Ragione first submitted Horses to Steam in 2023, when the game was in a <em>very</em> unfinished state. "We were only about halfway through development and had scrambled together a build that could be played start to finish, solely to satisfy Steam’s request for a playable version to open a Coming Soon page, something we had never been asked for before," Riva explains. It was at this stage that Valve rejected the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Riva goes on to say that Valve did not offer any explanation as to why the game was rejected, nor was there any opportunity for the team to change whatever the offending content was. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't get anyone at Valve to work with them to reverse the decision. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Steam’s decision came without detailed feedback, and the ban notice did not cite any specific scenes or elements," Riva says. "For months we repeatedly asked what triggered the ban and received no answer. We also offered, unsuccessfully, to change any content deemed unfit, especially since the game was still early in development at the time of submission."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Chasing Wild Horses</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">So what triggered the ban? Riva still doesn't know. While minds may jump to Steam's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-censorship-of-adult-games-highlights-how-payment-processors-wield-immense-power-that-even-nations-cant-control-says-japanese-politician">recent banning of a number of adult games</a> to comply with sudden crackdowns from payment processors, Riva says this ban took place long before that was even a conversation, and all the content in the game is fully legal. He does have a theory, though. The automated review sent by Steam in 2023 included a link to <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam's Onboarding Documentation</a>, as well as the following sentence: "Regardless of a developer’s intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses, Riva says, does not contain any such content. All characters in the game are older than 20 "as communicated by their appearance and through dialogue and documents that you will encounter in the game." He also asserts that the game is not pornographic. It is, per the studio, "about the burden of familial trauma and puritan values, the dynamics of totalitarian power, and the ethics of personal responsibility." From the FAQ sent to IGN:</p><blockquote>While it does contain some sexual elements, the intent is never to arouse. It uses challenging, unconventional material to encourage discussion. It invites players to examine why something feels the way it does, what it says about the characters and systems at work, and where their limits lie. It is about tension, not erotic content. (We apologize if we got your hopes up for horse porn.)</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">What Riva thinks triggered the ban is a scene that existed in the game during the initial Steam submission, where a man and his young daughter visit the farm. As the FAQ explains:</p><blockquote>The daughter wants to ride one of the horses (in the game the “horses” are humans wearing a horse mask) and gets to pick which one. What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders. The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag. We have since changed the character in the scene to be a twenty-something woman, both to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of Horses, works much better when delivered by an older character.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Riva says he has tried everything. He has tried speaking to contacts at Valve who had previously worked with the studio on past games. According to him, they claimed not to know the specific reasons for the ban and said it would not be possible to find out and tell them. He's reached out to Valve again and again, but has yet to receive any official explanation of what content was offensive, nor an opportunity to resubmit it without that content. IGN also reached out to Valve for comment for this piece, but did not hear back in time for publication.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Horses Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Riva also says he's had no issues with any other platform: GOG, Itch.io, and the Humble Store had no issues with it. Epic asked the studio to update just the screenshots on the game's store page so as not to include nudity, which Riva says they complied with, and the game was accepted. As for consoles, he says he's shown the game to console partners and hasn't heard any concerns about content. Horses also has received PEGI and ESRB ratings that would be required for console distribution. "The only reason we haven't actively started porting the game is lack of funds."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Reining It In</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, Horses is unsettling to say the <em>least</em>. I watched a colleague play some of it at a demo at Day of the Devs in 2023, and it's not for the faint of heart. It's about a young man who comes to a farm to work a summer job caring for horses, only to discover the horses are actually naked adult humans wearing horse head masks, chained up in the yard. Snippets from trailers show the "horses" watching what seems to be horse propaganda, being ridden by other people by carrying them on their shoulders, being fed carrots, and being on the receiving end of humiliation and violence. It challenges the player to either accept what they're seeing and continue to participate in it, or try to subvert what's going on at the horse farm, a process that seems like it will be utterly terrifying and unpleasant in some way. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Santa Ragione also has a solid track record of making and publishing artistic, esoteric, disturbing games with poignant messages, many of which have been up for awards for that very reason. Their board game Escape From The Aliens In Outer Space was nominated for the Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming. MirrorMoon EP was a finalist for the Innovation Award at the Independent Games Festival after its launch in 2013. More recently, in 2024, Santa Ragione published Mediterranea Inferno, which won the Excellence in Narrative Award at the Independent Games Festival. And Mediterranea Inferno is just one of a handful of games published by Santa Ragione as part of its efforts to promote the work of up-and-coming Italian creators, with Horses being another example.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again from the FAQ:</p><blockquote>We are committed to producing challenging, adult storytelling. Horses uses grotesque, subversive imagery to confront power, faith, and violence. We reject subjective obscenity standards and believe this kind of moralizing censorship evokes a darker past in which vague notions of “decency” were used to silence artists. Games are an artistic medium and lawful works for adults should remain accessible. We respect players enough to present the game as intended and to let adults choose what to play; lawful works should not be made unreachable by a monopolistic storefront’s opaque decisions. Steam publicly downplays human curation in favor of algorithmic sales optimization, yet intervenes with censorship when a game’s artistic vision does not align with what the platform owners considers acceptable art. Steam’s behavior passively shapes which titles developers feel safe creating, pushing preemptive censorship.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet, the verdict stands. Riva and Santa Ragione are stuck: one week until launch, and no ability to publish their game on the most massive PC storefront in existence. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Long Faces</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Riva, the inability to release on Steam almost certainly means that Santa Ragione is done for. The studio already was struggling with financial troubles: it initially invested $50,000 when they signed the game with its creator, Andrea Lucco Borlera. They were hoping that sales of the team's previous game, Saturnalia, would help make that money back, but it didn't do as well as they'd hoped. Riva says they even lined up "a great bundle opportunity" for Saturnalia, but had to cancel it when Valve refused to give them Steam keys for again unclear reasons.</p><blockquote>Around the same time, we were informed that Horses had been banned and would not release on Steam, which completely erased our ability to find an external supporting publisher or partner to fund the rest of the game, as no one in the industry considers an indie game that cannot be released on Steam to be viable. After two years of seeking these funds through traditional venues while trying to get the game unbanned, we had to seek private funding from friends to complete development, which puts us in a completely unsustainable financial situation unless the game somehow recoups its development costs.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopeless as this seems, Riva isn't closed to the possibility that Santa Ragione could be saved. He says if it manages to sell "tens of thousands of copies" without being on Steam, they'd be able to break even and keep working on future projects. But he's not banking on that. Ideally, he says, Valve would revert its decision and reconsider the game, but after two years, that doesn't seem likely to happen either. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This double standard suggests Steam does not treat games as art on par with film.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Riva says their team won't fully disappear from gaming. The team has funds set aside for six months to support Horses post-launch with bug fixes and quality of life updates. Riva also tells me that the studio has known this was a possibility for a while now, and has been preparing accordingly. Its members have all found other gigs, some of which are in games. Riva himself says he's always worked multiple jobs in teaching, consulting, and curation while directing Santa Ragione, so he plans to "do more of that." And Horses director Borlera is already pitching new projects elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Riva would love to see a miracle leading to Horses recouping its costs and saving the studio, he says what he actually wants more than anything is for Valve to be transparent about its policies on mature content, which have fluctuated over the years and never really been clear. From the FAQ:</p><blockquote>Alongside ultraviolent titles, Steam distributes explicit pornographic games; some of these listings acknowledge the legal grey area Steam mentioned in the HORSES ban message, by stating “All characters depicted are over the age of 18” in their store descriptions, and yet non-pornographic works like HORSES can be banned without context. By contrast, mature works with comparable or stronger themes routinely appear on mainstream streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, where controversial directors are an accepted part of the catalog. This double standard suggests Steam does not treat games as art on par with film, and intervenes with censorship when an artistic vision does not align with what the platform owner considers acceptable art.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">As a final word, Riva urges game developers to stand up together to demand transparency from Steam. "I know developers are understandably scared of voicing their complaints about Steam, but I hope we can collectively ask for better conditions to make our work more viable and more creatively free," he says. "The current landscape is one where very few actors control the distribution of almost all games that are produced, and that should mean they are responsible not just for the commercial sustainability of the industry, but also for the growth of games as an artistic medium."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/valves-steam-machine-looks-like-a-console-but-dont-expect-it-to-be-priced-like-one/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve%E2%80%99s-steam-machine-looks-like-a-console-but-don%E2%80%99t-expect-it-to-be-priced-like-one.1364482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>After Valve announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">its upcoming Steam Machine living room box</a> earlier this month, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/are-you-ready-for-a-1000-steam-machine-some-analysts-think-you-should-be/">some analysts suggested to Ars</a> that Valve could and should aggressively subsidize that hardware with “loss leader” pricing that leads to more revenue from improved Steam software sales. In <a href="https://youtu.be/yvu66Y2VLq8?si=SskFh89ieBarjGmu">a new interview with YouTube channel Skill Up</a>, though, Valve’s Pierre-Loup Griffais ruled out that kind of console-style pricing model, saying that the Steam Machine will be “more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market.”</p>
<p>Griffais said the AMD Zen 4 CPU and RDNA3 GPU in the Steam Machine were designed to outperform the bottom 70 percent of machines that opt-in to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">Valve’s regular hardware survey</a>. And Steam Machine owners should expect to pay roughly what they would for desktop hardware with similar specs, he added.</p>
<p>“If you build a PC from parts and get to basically the same level of performance, that’s the general price window that we aim to be at,” Griffais said.</p>
<p>The new comments follow similar sentiments relayed by Linus Sebastian on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dnKy4UEdiyo">a recent episode of his WAN Show podcast</a>. Sebastian said that, when talking to Valve representatives at a preview event, he suggested that a heavily subsidized price point would make the Steam Machine hardware into “a more meaningful product.” But when he suggested that he was imagining a console-style price in the range of $500, “nobody said anything, but the energy of the room wasn’t great.”</p>
<h2>Forget about $500</h2>
<p>Based on these comments, we could start estimating a potential Steam Machine price range by speccing out a comparable desktop machine. That would likely require building around <a href="https://www.newegg.com/amd-ryzen-5-7600x-ryzen-5-7000-series-raphael-zen-4-socket-am5/p/N82E16819113770">a Ryzen 5 7600X CPU</a> and <a href="https://www.newegg.com/asrock-challenger-rx7600-cl-8go-radeon-rx-7600-8gb-graphics-card-double-fans/p/N82E16814930093">Radeon RX 7600 GPU</a>, which would probably push the overall build into the $700-plus range. That would make the Steam Machine competitive with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/sony-joins-xbox-and-nintendo-in-hiking-playstation-5-prices-in-the-us/">the pricey PS5 Pro</a>, even though <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1oxg6r0/a_hardware_engineer_from_the_canal_moores_law/">some estimates</a> price out the actual internal Steam Machine components in the $400 to $500 range.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saturnalia">Saturnalia</a> and Wheels of Aurelia developers Santa Ragione have announced that they will "wind down operations and face a high risk of closing the studio", following Valve's refusal to allow their upcoming horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horses">Horses</a> on Steam, PC gaming's largest digital storefront by some distance. They say they have the funds to support and update Horses after launch for around six months, but claim they "will not be able to start new projects unless Horses somehow recoups its development costs without access to more than 75% of the PC gaming market".
</p>
<p>
The studio have published <a href="https://horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/">a FAQ on their official website</a> explaining the situation in depth. They claim that Valve rejected Horses based on an unfinished build from 2023, at which time Steam's approval teams commented that "this title features themes, imagery, or descriptions that we won't distribute", with the specific addition that "we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor".
</p>
<p>
We'll return to that last line. Firstly, some context. Horses, if you've yet to have the displeasure, is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-is-an-absolutely-cursed-horror-game-from-the-creators-of-saturnalia">an unholy cauldron of surreal body horror and silent cinema techniques</a>, now due to release via Epic, GOG, the Humble Store and Itch on 2nd December. It casts you as a young man who must spend two weeks working on an isolated farm. After meeting the Farmer - a lumpen gargoyle whose lips and teeth get far too much screentime - you're introduced to the titular Horses, who turn out to be naked human slaves in horse masks, their private parts blurred out.
</p>
<p>
Around two years ago, Santa Ragione submitted a "rough, incomplete" version of Horses for Steam approval. "We were only about halfway through development and had scrambled together a build that could be played start to finish, solely to satisfy Steam's request for a playable version to open a Coming Soon page, something we had never been asked for before," the developers comment. 
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione say they received an "automated" review statement from Valve in June 2023, rejecting the game on the grounds that it infringed Steam's content policies. Find it in full below.
</p>
<blockquote>After review, we will not be able to ship your game HORSES on Steam. While we strive to ship most titles submitted to us, we found that this title features themes, imagery, or descriptions that we won't distribute. Regardless of a developer's intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor. While every product submitted is unique, if your product features this representation--even in a subtle way that could be defined as a 'grey area'--it will be rejected by Steam. For instance, setting your game in a high school but declaring your characters are of legal age would fall into that category and be banned. This app has been banned and cannot be reused. Re-submissions of this app, even with modifications, will not be accepted.</blockquote>

<p>
The developers spent the following months asking for more details about the ban, while offering to change anything Valve deemed unfit for publication - something that would have been relatively straightforward, given that Horses was still being made at the time of Steam review submission. They say that Valve have yet to reply, but they believe Steam's content reviewers may have had misgivings about one particular scene when another man and his daughter visit the farm. 
</p><p>
"The daughter wants to ride one of the horses (in the game the "horses" are humans wearing a horse mask) and gets to pick which one," the developers explain. "What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders. 
</p>
<p>
"The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag," they continue. "We have since changed the character in the scene to be a twenty-something woman, both to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of HORSES, works much better when delivered by an older character."

The developers note that all characters in the game "are clearly older than 20 years old, as communicated by their appearance and through dialogue and documents that you will encounter in the game." They also comment that while Horses "does contain some sexual elements, the intent is never to arouse. It uses challenging, unconventional material to encourage discussion." Valve have, of course, already rejected the argument from intent in their alleged statement above.
</p><p>
I've now played through Horses myself - look out for a review next week - and as regards the final version of the game, at least, nothing about the scene with the young woman strikes me as some kind of child pornography. It's disturbing material, but it's also very clearly a commentary on abuse and exploitation rather than an endorsement, with appropriate dialogue, and yes, the characters are depicted as adults (the young man protagonist is elsewhere described as 19 or 20 in a letter from his parents). Still, it's not clear that this is the scene that has triggered Valve's ire. We've mailed them to ask for comment on Santa Ragione's claims.
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione say they have invested around $100,000 making Horses. The developers invested $50,000 initially after signing the game with its primary developer, Andrea Lucco Borlera, and had hoped to cover the remaining costs based on sales of their previous, very good horror game Saturnalia. The latter has not sold as well as hoped, however, something Santa Ragione attribute partly to Valve's refusal to give them Steam keys for a "great bundle opportunity" - this came around the time they were told that Horses had been banned from Steam. 
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione say that the ban has "completely erased our ability to find an external supporting publisher or partner to fund the rest of the game, as no one in the industry considers an indie game that cannot be released on Steam to be viable". They have raised the remaining $50,000 via private funding from friends, "which puts us in a completely unsustainable financial situation unless the game somehow recoups its development costs". 
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione perhaps merit some criticism on this last count - if you know that your videogame project is not "viable", isn't it more responsible to hedge your bets rather than continuing to raise funds? Still, I'm sympathetic to the developers' predicament otherwise.
</p><p>
Given that it dates back to 2023, the Horses ban pre-dates the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy">swathe of "adult" game delistings</a> on Steam and Itch.io precipitated by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">a payment processor crackdown</a>. In their FAQ, Santa Ragione are careful to draw lines between the situation and wider efforts to restrict access to sexual material online.
</p>
<p>
"It's important to note that HORSES' ban has nothing to do with the recent restriction on adult content pushed by payment processors," they write. "This decision was solely in the hands of Steam's curatorial team." In other words, they're putting the blame for all this squarely on Valve. 
</p>
<p>
"Alongside ultraviolent titles, Steam distributes explicit pornographic games," the developers comment. "[S]ome of these listings acknowledge the legal grey area Steam mentioned in the HORSES ban message, by stating 'All characters depicted are over the age of 18' in their store descriptions, and yet non-pornographic works like HORSES can be banned without context. 
</p>
<p>
"By contrast, mature works with comparable or stronger themes routinely appear on mainstream streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, where controversial directors are an accepted part of the catalog," the developers go on. "This double standard suggests Steam does not treat games as art on par with film, and intervenes with censorship when an artistic vision does not align with what the platform owner considers acceptable art."
</p>
<p>
Again, we'll ask Valve for a comment.
