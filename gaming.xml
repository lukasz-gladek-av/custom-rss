            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Samsung 990 Pro 2TB is the <strong>best-seller among internal SSDs on Amazon this Black Friday</strong>, and that makes total sense given what you’re getting. Storage speed is the single greatest determinant of whether your computer feels snappy or sluggish, as fast SSDs eliminate boot delays, application loading, and file transfer bottlenecks. This drive delivers flagship performance at pricing that makes it the best value proposition in the SSD market right now. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4513/">has it down to $169 for Black Friday, down from $229</a>, which marks a record low that places professional-grade storage well within reach of anyone building or upgrading a PC.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4513/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>7,450 MB/s Read Speed Eliminates Storage Bottlenecks</h2>
<p>The s<strong>equential read speed of 7,450 MB/s</strong> represents the ceiling of what PCIe Gen 4 technology can do. You boot Windows in under 10 seconds, fire up applications in an instant, and transfer large files between drives in a matter of seconds-not minutes. In-game loading, when the game is loaded on this drive, is faster than on SATA SSDs or hard drives, with some titles eliminating loading screens altogether through DirectStorage support. It makes a big difference in day-to-day use, where everything from opening folders to extracting compressed files happens faster than you expect.</p>
<p><strong>Sequential write speeds reach 6,900 MB/s</strong> to handle large file creation and modification with ease. For video editors working with 4K or 8K footage, timeline scrubbing remains smooth, while render times significantly decrease. Content creators exporting large projects onto this drive find transfers complete in a fraction of the time that SATA drives normally would take.</p>



<p>The 2TB capacity allows for installing your OS, applications, and a substantial game library without relying on secondary storage. Modern games take up 50-150GB each, and with this capacity, you can store 15-40 titles depending on how large the files are. You keep the most played games installed and ready, instead of always having to reinstall and uninstall based on which one you want to play.</p>
<p>To achieve these speeds, the PCIe Gen 4 interface uses four lanes of bandwidth on compatible motherboards. The M.2 2280 form factor fits into the standard slots on modern motherboards without the need for adapters or special mounting hardware. This drive will work in older systems that have PCIe Gen 3 slots but will run at reduced speeds limited by that interface. Most motherboards from the past five years support PCIe Gen 4, making this drive compatible with the majority of current builds.</p>



<p>The <strong>thermal solution involves a heat spreader</strong> that radiates the heat during continuous operation. High-speed SSDs generate thermal energy during continuous intensive read and write operations, and proper cooling keeps performance within limits. The included spreader does its work quite effectively in most scenarios, but it’s even better with systems that have dedicated M.2 heatsinks or motherboard cooling solutions. The drive implements thermal throttling, which drops the speeds temporarily when temperatures exceed safe limits, ensuring hardware protection while continuing operation.</p>
<p>Drive management tools such as performance optimization, firmware updates, and health monitoring are available through<em> Samsung Magician</em> software. You manage remaining drive life, securely erase data, and optimize settings for different workloads. The software normally runs in the background, usually alerting you to firmware updates or potential issues before they can become a problem.</p>
<p>At $169, you get Samsung’s flagship SSD with PCIe Gen 4 speeds for 26% off, dropping pro performance down to the mid-range drive price class.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Full screen capabilities for playing Xbox on PC has been added to Windows 11. Furthermore, it’s available to all Windows Insiders with the latest preview.</p>







<p>These days, like the marketing says, everything is an Xbox. Many of the exclusives Microsoft has racked up, like Halo, Gears of War, and Forza make their way to PCs in many forms. Plus, with Game Pass Ultimate having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-game-pass-40-new-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Game Pass</a>, you can easily play any game with a simple tap. However, even with playing on PC, it never felt like a replacement for the seamless console experience. Well, that’s about to change with the latest update for Windows 11.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-screen-for-xbox-on-pc-available-to-windows-insiders-now-via-new-update">Full Screen for Xbox on PC Available to Windows Insiders Now via New Update</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/11/21/full-screen-experience-expands-to-more-windows-11-pc-form-factors-for-windows-insiders/?ocid=Platform_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Video_lrn_11.21.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog from Windows</a>, the team reveals that, along with Preview Build 26220.7271, <strong>Windows 11 is getting Full Screen support for Xbox</strong>. Now, you can easily switch between desktop and Xbox’s Full Screen Experience via the task bar or Win + Tab. When in full screen, your desktop will switch to the Xbox page and you can play any game without distractions. <strong>You can also have multiple open games at once and switch between them with your controller</strong>. </p>



<p>No date was given as to when everyone will get Full Screen for Xbox on Windows 11. Still, it is a pretty neat concept and one many people on the go will enjoy. If you don’t own Windows 11, there is the new ROG Xbox Ally, which brings your Xbox to a portable device. Now, with other games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved going to PS5</a>, you can pretty much play Xbox wherever and however you want.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-wanted-to-balance-pvp-tryhards/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-devs-always-wanted-balanced-pvp-to-avoid-%E2%80%98tryhards%E2%80%99.1361212/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new documentary episode uploaded to showcase the origins of ARC Raiders, Embark Studios took a deep dive into where the game came from. It walks viewers through the original PvE title that saw players team up against enormous robotic enemies, to the extraction shooter with intense PvP mechanics that we know today.</p>



<p>It was revealed in one segment that the team at Embark wanted to balance PvP so perfectly that it would placate players who didn’t <strong>want </strong>to fight other users for fear of stumbling upon ‘tryhards’ who could defeat them in every engagement.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-was-very-different">ARC Raiders Was Very Different</h2>



<p>In the documentary uploaded on YouTube today, we get a glimpse behind the curtain at the development lifecycle of ARC Raiders, which unfolded over more than seven years. It started as a PvE-exclusive game that would see players team up to take down extremely threatening ARC enemies, and it evolved into a PvPvE extraction shooter out of necessity and to become more marketable.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Evolution of ARC Raiders EP1 - Finding ARC Raiders" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tdorU3sjt_0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In one segment of the documentary, David Dixon, Embark Studios’ Animation Director, explained how PvP was addressed to ensure that <strong>all comers </strong>could have as much fun as possible, even when fighting tougher opponents:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That’s why PvP is such an important addition to the game. A lot people have a strong reaction to what that might mean, but if you think about what happens when you play against other humans, you just realize that the finite distance gets closer to infinite, because now you have all the permutations of human behaviour in the session.</p>



<p>Some players might not like playing another person because they’ll get tryhards that are very, very good, but if we do our job well, then you’ll have something that feels balanced and fun, even if you’re not the best at aiming or the best at shooting.</p>



<p>You should still be able to find something rewarding in that experience of extracting stuff back out of the world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When ARC Raiders hit the market, it felt like a positive and refreshing title that had everyone collaborating to explore this new world. Within a matter of days, the PvP theme had spiked, and every engagement felt heated and ‘on sight’. There are still positive interactions to be found, but as players became more capable and better equipped, the collaborative aspect mostly went out the window.</p>



<p>But fans accept that’s part of the PvPvE loop. It’s still not as bad as games like Escape from Tarkov, in which you have almost no chance whatsoever of collaborating with other random players.</p>



<p>Do you think ARC Raiders has good PvE, or is there something you’d change? Let your thoughts be heard on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-nuketown-2025-map-goes-live-tomorrow-see-it-in-action-now/1100-6536356/" data-ref-id="1100-6536356">new version of Nuketown arrived on November 20</a>, and one of the first things people tried on it was shooting off all the mannequin heads to unlock the long-running Nuketown Easter egg. Unfortunately, it doesn't work in Black Ops 7, at least not yet. This isn't a huge shock, though, as Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown didn't unlock the Easter egg right away, either.</p><p>A popular video from the Detonated account shows that the mannequin heads on Nuketown 2025 cannot be shot off, thereby not allowing the Easter egg to unlock once they're all blasted away. People are theorizing that the new version of Nuketown does indeed carry forward the Easter egg that's been in every version of Nuketown since 2010, but it's just not active yet.</p><p>In Black Ops 6, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-easter-egg-breathes-new-life-into-nuketown-in-the-creepiest-way-possible/1100-6527796/" data-ref-id="1100-6527796">zombified mannequins sprung forth from the ground</a> for the Easter egg. And <a href="https://screenrant.com/call-duty-black-ops-nuketown-easter-eggs-ranked/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as ScreenRant reminds us</a>, when Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown launched, it also didn't have the Easter egg unlocked, but it arrived around a week later. If the same pattern holds for Black Ops 7, fans can expect the latest version of the Easter egg to be here soon. Season 1 is expected to launch in early December, and this could be when the Easter egg gets unlocked for Black Ops 7, but that's just a guess.</p><p>The Nuketown Easter egg debuted with the first Black Ops game in 2010 and has showed up, in different forms, for every version of the map since. For the first game, shooting all the mannequin heads would trigger the game to start playing the Rolling Stones song "Sympathy for the Devil." In Black Ops 2, the Easter egg makes classic Activision games playable on an in-game sign.</p><p>In other Call of Duty news, Treyarch made <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1991220426618597519" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black Ops 7's Endgame available to everyone</a> today, November 21. Before, players had to complete the campaign to unlock it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ps5-campaign-review-better-together/">is officially out if you haven't noticed</a>, and frankly, if you didn't, no one could blame you since this has felt like one of the most muted launches from Activision in years. Muted or not, however, it's still a new Call of Duty, which means that sales should already be skyrocketing, right? Well, at least right now, that doesn't seem to be the case. According to the latest weekly GSD Sales Data report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european">The Game Business,</a> while Black Ops 7 was at the top of the charts for the week of November 10-16, it's far behind last year's Black Ops 6 launch numbers, and far behind Battlefield 6's launch numbers for EU sales.</p>



<p>According to GSD Data, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's launch week sales in the EU fell short of Battlefield 6's first week EU launch sales by 63%, and according The Game Business's estimates, it fell short of last year's Black Ops 6 first week launch sales by over 50%. </p>



<p>So even though it still made it to the top of the sales charts for premium game sales in the EU for its launch week, which means it was able to sell quite a lot of copies, potentially in the millions, by Call of Duty standards, this launch missed the mark.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the chart include Anno 117: Pax Romana, which launched just two days ahead of Black Ops 7, and, according to The Game Business, more than doubled the launch numbers for the last major Anno game, Anno 1800.</p>



<p>Football Manager 26 remains in the top-10 list for revenue earned, though it dropped from the copies sold list. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-26-knocks-battlefield-6-out-of-eu-sales-charts-top-spot-with-the-biggest-launch-in-gsd-weekly-charts-history/">it had an incredibly impressive first week</a>, it seems that the game's technical issues at launch and the poor word of mouth around that are impacting its sales.</p>



<p>And speaking of Battlefield 6, it remains in both the revenue top 10 and copies sold top 10. It's behind fellow EA title EA Sports FC 26 in both lists, but it is still in the top five. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is another title that was able to keep its spot in the top 10 for both the revenue earned and copies sold list as it continues to ride the wave of momentum from <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-free-on-steam-xbox-for-next-four-days/">the release of its third and final DLC, lined up alongside a free trial weekend and major discount to the game on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Per The Game Business, here's the list of the top 10 games in the EU by copies sold for the week of November 10-16:</p>



<ol>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Anno 117: Pax Romana</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Pokemon Legends Z-A</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li>
</ol>

Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Deals on Sony’s PlayStation 5 are much more common than those on its <strong>PlayStation Portal</strong>, the handheld that can remotely stream games from the console via Wi-Fi. But for Black Friday, the Portal just got its first major discount to around $178.99 ($21 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJT5DJ16?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-Portal-Remote-Player-for-PS5-Console%2F5060699568" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsony-interactive-entertainment-playstation-portal-remote-player-midnight-black%2FJXHQ3C2H3K%2Fsku%2F6614840" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. Additionally, you can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/824326">save up to $100</a> on every configuration of the PlayStation 5, including the more powerful PlayStation 5 Pro.</p><p>The PlayStation Portal launched to relatively tepid reviews back in 2023, with <em>The Verge</em>’s Antonio G. Di Benedetto ultimately concluding the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">device is flawed, but fun</a> if you have fast internet. However, Sony has made strides to improve the experience over recent months, highlighted by a recent update that adds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/814078/playstation-portal-ps5-cloud-streaming">cloud streaming</a>. The feature allows PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers to stream select PlayStation 5 games, including <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year">Astro Bot</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23642938/resident-evil-4-remake-review-xbox-ps5-steam">Resident Evil 4</a></em>, directly from the cloud instead of from their consoles over Wi-Fi. Additionally, PlayStation Portal users can stream select titles from their own library without needing to connect to their PS5 console.</p><p>In terms of hardware, the PlayStation Portal is essentially a standard DualSense controller split in half with a crisp eight-inch 1080p display in the middle. It supports DualSense haptics, too, so you get the full experience of the adaptive triggers and tilt controls in games that support the features. It’s great for playing PS5 games around the house; however, the overall experience is dependent on the quality of your Wi-Fi. If you plan to stream games from your PS5, we highly recommend connecting the console to ethernet.</p><p>While Sony has improved the overall experience of the PlayStation Portal, it still has some notable limitations. For instance, it only supports the wireless Pulse Explore earbuds and Pulse Elite headset. That means you can’t just connect any Bluetooth headphones you have lying around. It does, however, feature a 3.5mm headphone jack, allowing you to easily connect wired headphones.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/825985/sony-playstation-portal-black-friday-deal-sale-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/oneplus-13-reaches-record-low-amazon-turns-it-into-serious-iphone-17-rival-this-black-friday-2000646239</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oneplus-13-reaches-record-low-amazon-turns-it-into-serious-iphone-17-rival-this-black-friday.1361179/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Flagship iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones rule the premium space, but OnePlus challenges both with specs that match, if not outpace, most of their offerings at significantly lower costs. OnePlus 13 has a real shot at going head-to-head with the iPhone 17 and Galaxy S25 and offers flagship performance without that flagship price tag.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5808/">dropped the 256GB model to $699 for Black Friday, down from its usual $899</a>, which is <strong>an all-time low</strong> that makes this Samsung and Apple rival affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5808/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Industry-Leading Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>Snapdragon 8 Elite is Qualcomm’s high-end chipset, fabricated on a 3nm node</strong>. It strikes an excellent balance between high performance and energy efficiency. It handles demanding tasks from 4K video editing to high-end gaming without any thermal throttling or slowdown. Benchmarks peg it above Apple’s A18 Pro in multi-core operations and somewhere around Apple in single-core tasks. In reality, apps open instantly, multitasking remains fluid even with several dozen apps open, and games run smoothly at the highest settings available with stable frame rates.</p>
<p>The 12GB RAM makes sure everything runs smoothly from casual use to pro workflows. You can switch between apps without reloading them, keep extensive browser sessions running, and open demanding apps together with no performance degradation. This amount of RAM is more than what the majority of its competitors offer in this price bracket, not to mention that Samsung demands a much higher price for the same amount of RAM in its S25 series.</p>



<p>The <strong>80W SUPERVOOC fast charging</strong> fills the battery from empty to full in about 30 minutes, eliminating the anxiety of low battery during busy days. You plug in during a quick break and gain hours of usage. This is much faster than the iPhone 17’s 27W and Galaxy S25’s 45W, giving the OnePlus a substantial practical advantage. The 50W AIRVOOC wireless charging brings fast charging convenience without cables, matching what flagship phones typically offer through wired connections.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hasselblad camera partnership works with color science and image processing</strong> to ensure pictures appear natural instead of oversaturated social media-ready. The primary sensor takes vivid photos in bright daylight or challenging low-light situations. The camera system features ultrawide and telephoto lenses that maintain consistent quality across focal lengths. Hasselblad’s involvement shows in the nuanced color reproduction and dynamic range that gives photos a more refined look compared to typical Android processing.</p>



<p>The<strong> 6.82-inch AMOLED display features a refresh rate of 120Hz</strong> which smooths out scrolling and makes touches super responsive. The screen brightness goes as high as 4500 nits under very particular conditions, well enough that it’s readable in direct sunlight when other phones would wash out. It supports HDR10+ for better contrast while watching compatible video content.</p>
<p><strong>OxygenOS offers a clean Android experience (our favorite)</strong> with some very useful customizations that don’t bloat the interface. It also comes with three years of major Android updates and four years of security patches, keeping your phone current and secure. Additional features include game mode, parallel apps that allow running multiple accounts, and expansive gesture controls to enhance daily usability.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life reaches a full day of heavy use</strong> with screen-on time exceeding 7 hours for most users. With the combination of efficient processor and large battery capacity, you are not hunting for chargers in the middle of the day. The phone handles heavy tasks such as navigation, video streaming, and gaming without frequent power management.</p>
<p>You get here flagship spec with Snapdragon 8 Elite and 80W charging at $699 which is $200 less than Samsung’s equivalent S25 and $300+ below the iPhone 17. Leading performance meets extremely fast charging and Hasselblad camera processing for true value that makes the traditional flagship pricing from Apple and Samsung increasingly hard to justify.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-fps-temmates-genai-nfts-gameplay-snowdrop-reveal-2000646251</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-shows-off-new-ai-powered-fps-and-hopes-you%E2%80%99ve-forgotten-about-its-failed-nfts.1361176/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite the fact that many gamers seem to dislike or even outright hate AI-generated content in games, Ubisoft is pushing forward with it and now playtesting a shooter experiment built around AI-powered NPCs that can react to voice commands in real-time. Will it help the publisher regain some stability as it continues to struggle? I’m not sure. <a href="https://kotaku.com/we-live-in-hell-and-this-ubisoft-nft-that-requires-you-1848202326">All I can think about is the last time Ubisoft jumped on a tech fad with NFTs</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3mWlITIuWuu0MoVuR6o8ps/ubisoft-reveals-teammates-an-ai-experiment-to-change-the-game">On November 21,</a> after <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-ubisoft-sold-ai-2000646161">a delayed earnings call</a>, Ubisoft revealed <em>Teammates</em>, which the company refers to as its “first playable generative AI research project.” Built in the Snowdrop Engine, the same tech that powers games like <em>The Division 2</em> and<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Teammates</em> is a first-person shooter that includes an AI assistant named Jaspar and two AI-powered squadmates called Pablo and Sofia. Players can command these two to help them solve puzzles or engage in combat using “natural” voice commands.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Jaspar can help track missions, offer advice, and provide guidance when needed.</p>

 <p><em>Teammates</em> is built by the same team behind <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs">Ubisoft’s Neo NPCs</a>, which the company showed off in 2024 at GDC. The main goal of those AI-powered NPCs was to provide characters who can “dynamically” react to players in real-time, but within guidelines established by Ubisoft designers. The company said that it had guardrails in place to help stop the AI companions from hallucinating, being overly toxic, or going completely off script. But even Ubisoft admitted <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-s-first-playable-generative-ai-experience-is-an-r-d-experiment-called-teammates-">in an interview with <em>Game Developer</em></a> that <em>Teammates</em> and its tech were still rough around the edges.</p>

 <p>In interviews about <em>Teammates</em>, Ubisoft tries to make the case that this tech won’t remove the human element from video game development. I find that hard to believe, considering that over the last two years or so, the studio has <a href="https://www.blog.udonis.co/mobile-marketing/mobile-games/ubisoft-layoffs">laid off over 600 employees</a> as it cuts costs and struggles to ship games people get excited about. I’m not sure NPCs that sort of listen to you when you tell them to do something is going to turn things around for Ubisoft, but it could potentially let them gut even more of the company while pivoting to AI moonshots at a time when the company’s future has never been more uncertain.</p>

 <p>“Games of tomorrow will listen, understand, and react to players far more than today, and our research gives a glimpse of what adaptive, generative play could add on top of proven game systems,”<a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/ubisoft-generative-ai-game-teammates-neo-npc-developers-1236588038/"> Ubisoft director of GenAI gameplay Xavier Manzanares told <em>Variety</em>.</a> “It’s the first time we’ve shared an experiment this early with players, but our goal is to pave the way with a strong technology layer so our creators can start imagining the value it could bring to their project and players.”</p> <p>And who even knows if Ubisoft will still be developing AI-powered content and tools in a few years? Remember, it wasn’t that long ago that Ubisoft was all in on NFTs and the metaverse. Sure, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-captain-laserhawk-the-game-nft-crypto-1851726108">Ubisoft technically hasn’t</a> completely <a href="https://x.com/EdenOnline_exe/status/1989025366669701411">given up on either</a>. But it’s pretty clear now that the company is moving on to AI as the next big thing that it hopes can convince investors that it is on the cutting edge of the future and deserving of more money, please.</p>

              <p><span>Oscar Isaac, star of Guillermo del Toro’s </span><i><span>Frankenstein </span></i><span>film, signs a lot of autographs. Prior to his role as the titular doctor in del Toro’s take on the Gothic horror classic, he was Poe Dameron in </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span>, Duke Leto Atreides in </span><i><span>Dune</span></i><span>, and one of the alternate Spider-Men in</span><i><span> Across the Spider-Verse</span></i><span>. This man has been made into a Funko Pop several times over, and he clearly feels some type of way about them.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>He can probably spot an autograph reseller a mile away, too. That may be what happened when someone approached him outside of the Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles yesterday and asked him to sign some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/funko-pop-starnger-things-bitty-bankrupt-2000642395"><span>Funko Pops</span></a><span>, to which Isaac replied, “Nah, man, I’m not doing those Funkos.” </span></p>

 <p><span>The POV recording, from the perspective of the Funko Pop wielder, showed the stranger holding out a </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2099</span></i><span> Funko Pop after Isaac signs a </span><i><span>Frankenstein </span></i><span>poster from the back of a truck, then stepping away, slightly dejected after the denial.</span></p>

 <div><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique/video/7574866863277100319" data-video-id="7574866863277100319" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@eladiioenrrique" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique?refer=embed">@eladiioenrrique</a>  <p>11/16/2025 – On Sunday, I got a last minute tip that Oscar Isaac was going to be at the Egyptian Theatre, (I know I told you this through DM but thank you again!), (you know who you are lol), so I tried to get him to sign my Spider-Man 2099 Funko Pops along with a Moon Knight Funko and a Spider-Man 2099 mini poster for my sister, of course in the video you only see the pops, but unfortunately Oscar stopped for the kid Grapher to sign Frankenstein items but he didn’t want to sign Marvel items. It was great to see him in person and honestly I don’t blame him at all, it was a long shot especially after hearing that he isn’t on good terms with Disney after that whole Kimmel incident but I was hoping he would sign the merch at least because imo he is still the most badass Miguel O’Hara and Moon Knight out there, he makes both characters, I’m sorry lol. I’m definitely going to get backlash for that lol. But anyways, thought I would share my interaction with him, and if Oscar sees this somehow, Oscar I understand and hopefully one day I can still get your autograph on the Spider-Man 2099 as well as my sister’s mini poster&nbsp;! Oh and if Disney sees this, please fix things with Oscar, we need him back in marvel, there is no Moon Knight or Spider-Man 2099 without him. <a title="spiderman2099" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/spiderman2099?refer=embed">#spiderman2099</a>  <a title="oscarisaac" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oscarisaac?refer=embed">#OscarIsaac</a>  <a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed">#fyp</a>  <a title="disney" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/disney?refer=embed">#Disney</a>  <a title="frankenstein" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/frankenstein?refer=embed">#Frankenstein</a> </p> <p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - eladiioenrrique" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7574866731131292447?refer=embed">♬ original sound – eladiioenrrique</a> </p></section> </blockquote></div>   <p><span>The Funko Pop collector, known as </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique?lang=en"><span>EladiioEnrrique on TikTok</span></a><span>, alleged in the caption of his video that Isaac “didn’t want to sign Marvel items.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was a long shot, especially after hearing that he isn’t on good terms with Disney after that whole Kimmel incident,” he wrote, referring to Isaac’s recent </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XciB_FC2fzs"><i><span>GQ</span></i><span> interview</span></a><span> in which he said he’d consider reprising his role as Poe in </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span> only “if they can kinda figure out [how], you know, not [to] succumb to fascism.” He was referring to ABC and Disney’s brief suspension of their late-night show host back in September after Jimmy Kimmel joked about the Trump administration’s reaction to the assassination of Charlie Kirk.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s not clear if Isaac was refusing to sign Marvel merch specifically or if he was just refusing to sign Funko Pops in general, as they’re incredibly popular on the autograph reseller market. There are nearly 100,000 results for “signed Funko Pop” on eBay, with many of them going for a few hundred dollars. It’s now not uncommon for people like the owner of the aforementioned TikTok channel to follow celebrities around with several pieces of their respective merch in hand and ask for autographs, only to later try to flip them online for thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>A </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique/video/7570077334158511390?lang=en"><span>different video from EladiioEnrrique’s account</span></a><span> shows a horde of people waiting for pop star Miley Cyrus to sign autographs. One person has all of her vinyls taped together in a vertical stack, while another has several items hung from a hangar, all to make a mass-signing as quick and painless as possible.</span></p>

 <p><span>Most of EladiioEnrrique’s channel is just first-person POV videos of him getting celebrities to sign records, CDs, and, of course, Funko Pops. His latest video says that he got a “last-minute tip” that Isaac would be at the Egyptian Theater before rushing over to get the signatures. But he’s not a reseller. “I am a collector,” he told <em>Kotaku</em> via TikTok DM. “I don’t resell my signed items simply because I don’t see it as right.”</span></p> <p>“It’s definitely not my job, I know a lot of the graphers do actually do this for a living and go to eBay immediately to sell it,” he said when asked if he did this for a living. “I know this because I’ve seen their posts at times, but I can’t do it for a living, hell no.”</p> <p><span>After Isaac refused to sign his toys, EladiioEnrrique stepped away politely and wrote a very understanding but hopeful caption for his video.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“If Oscar sees this somehow, Oscar I understand and hopefully one day I can still get your autograph on the Spider-Man 2099 as well as my sister’s mini poster! Oh and if Disney sees this, please fix things with Oscar, we need him back in Marvel, there is no Moon Knight or Spider-Man 2099 without him.” it read.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>May all superfans be this well-adjusted.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Reveals AI-Driven Research Project, Teammates]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-ai-teammates-reveal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-reveals-ai-driven-research-project-teammates.1361170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new AI-driven research project from Ubisoft, called Teammates, has been revealed. The news comes after the company’s earnings call earlier today, which bolstered <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-hits-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong numbers for Assassin’s Creed: Mirage</a>.</p>







<p>AI in video games isn’t anything new, though the way it’s being used is. In the past, AI would play the role of NPCs, doing commands by code and filling the screen. Now, the process can replace art design, voice acting, and even entire games. Still, it does further exacerbates the lack of human touch to a project, which is never a good thing. Now, it seems Ubisoft is keen on getting in on the AI bubble with a new research project, aptly called Teammates.</p>



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-s-teammates-uses-an-ai-voice-assistant-self-programmable-npcs">Ubisoft’s Teammates Uses an AI Voice Assistant, Self-Programmable NPCs</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Today we’re unveiling Teammates, an AI-driven research project exploring how new tech can deepen the player experience.</p><p>More than just talk, this brand-new experiment adds depth to gameplay by going beyond AI chatbots and turning NPCs into real teammates. Find out more:… <a href="https://t.co/SyISwjJ5af">pic.twitter.com/SyISwjJ5af</a></p></div>— Ubisoft (@Ubisoft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1991930899252810021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3mWlITIuWuu0MoVuR6o8ps/ubisoft-reveals-teammates-an-ai-experiment-to-change-the-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a>, as well as Twitter/X, Ubisoft shared a look at the AI-driven Teammates. While we don’t know how it’ll play, we do get some insight into the project. Framed as an FPS, Teammates has you and two AI NPCs go to an enemy base and save five members of your resistance. To aid you, you’ll have Jaspar, an AI voice assistant who provides tips on gameplay, story, and can tamper with settings with a simple voice command. </p>



<p>The blog goes a bit into detail on the gameplay and your AI NPCs, Pablo and Sofia. Via voice commands, you can tell them where to go, who to shoot, and build the narrative. Teammates’ Narrative Director, Virginie Mosser, spoke on the NPCs in the blog, saying,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>We hope players will feel like they’re shaping the story themselves, not just following it,</strong>” states Mosser. “<strong>When I talk to [my AI squad mate] Sofia, she reacts to what I tell her and it changes my experience. For me, this is a real breakthrough and allows players to experience the story in their own way.</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As of now, there are no plans to do anything with the public just yet. An explainer video is set to come soon, but no date as to when. Playtests did happen earlier this year and more will come soon. The team stresses throughout the piece that human creativity and ingenuity is at the heart of Teammates. Whether or not that statement is accurate does tip a bit to the side given the abundant usage of AI and chatbots. </p>



<p>Interestingly enough, Insider Gaming did release a story on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-multiplayer-shooter-project-scout-rumor-2025/">Project Scout</a>, an in-the-works multiplayer shooter at Ubisoft. From the looks of the screenshots and UI, Teammates could be the basis for the leaked title. Should Project Scout come to be, perhaps you’ll be fighting alongside programmable AI and not your friends.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and Battlefield 6 clash was always going to be a fun narrative at the end of 2025. The player count for both games could determine their long-term success, and tell us which game is ‘winning.’</p>



<p>There’s a point to be made that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-names-battlefield-6-best-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> was going to have the edge with it being the first new release in several years. Then again, Call of Duty is a never-ending behemoth that continues to conquer the gaming world. The Black Ops 7 hype wasn’t great, but again, it’s Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Let’s break down their player count stats and see how each game is faring.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-people-are-playing-battlefield-6">How Many People Are Playing Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big battle. Credit to EA and Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 is currently averaging 150,000 to 200,000 players daily, almost two months after its launch.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, Battlefield 6 hit a peak of <strong>747,440</strong> players (according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>) early on. This is when the hype for the game was otherworldly. Games always drop off as time goes on, but retaining well over 150K players daily is impressive.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s 24-hour peak—on November 21—was <strong>215,985</strong>, showing how much the community is still invested in the shooter. Also, if you didn’t know, SteamDB is considered the leading metric for player counts on PC, and there’s no software to accurately track console data.</p>



<p>With Season 1 launching, following up the RedSec addition, there’s plenty for Battlefield 6 players to enjoy and look forward to. The game will likely get another huge player bump around Christmas as many are inevitably gifted the FPS for the holiday season.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-breaks-franchise-sales-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 has broken franchise sales records</a>, and positive player count numbers will probably carry on.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-people-are-playing-black-ops-7">How Many People Are Playing Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s much harder to track Black Ops 7’s player count data, but we know for a fact that it’s not averaging more than roughly 70,000 players daily, and this figure is likely far fewer.</strong></p>



<p>Individual CoD games are not tracked on SteamDB. Instead, it tracks ‘Call of Duty,’ and multiple CoD titles fall under this banner. This means that even though Steam shows a daily figure for Call of Duty, this is adding up several games: Black Ops 7, Black Ops 6, Modern Warfare 3, etc.</p>



<p>On November 14—Black Ops 7’s launch—SteamDB reported a 24-hour peak of <strong>84,319</strong>. Don’t forget that this stat counts other recent Call of Duty games as well. Meaning the Black Ops 7 player count was probably closer to 70K or 60K at launch—maybe lower! </p>



<p>One week after launch, its 24-hour peak was already down to <strong>72,886</strong> players. Like Battlefield 6, the player count could easily rise over Christmas, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Season 1</a> hasn’t launched yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-people-playing-battlefield-6-or-black-ops-7-more">Are People Playing Battlefield 6 Or Black Ops 7 More?</h2>



<p><strong>Right now, people are declaratively playing Battlefield 6 more than Black Ops 7.</strong></p>



<p>Using the data above, you can see that even with seven weeks extra on the clock, Battlefield likely has between two and four times the player base Black Ops 7 does on Steam. Figures could be different on PlayStation and Xbox, but with reports that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sales-are-down-50-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Sales Are Down 50% In Europe</a>, the story might be a similar one.</p>



<p>Are you playing Black Ops 7 or Battlefield 6? Could this be a wake-up call for Activision? The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> is where you can let the world know your thoughts.</p>

Black Ops 7 launched with a new right-stick aiming requirement for achieving maximum rotational aim-assist strength, meaning that when the right-stick isn't used or isn't tracking a target effectively, players experience minimal rotational aim-assist strength. This minimum aim-assist is a 35% reduction from what players experienced in the beta.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In the patch notes, Treyarch says the studio "slightly overshot" its target balance, and a small tuning change is made to reduce this aim-assist penalty from 35% to 25%.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our goal for this new mechanic and our other aim-assist range changes is to provide the most competitive experience for all players and inputs," the developer says. "Aim Assist is one of the most integral components of gameplay feel, so it's crucial for us to settle on tuning that both feels great to play with and hits our balance goals."</p><p dir="ltr">To help provide better balance with Black Ops 7's assault rifles and submachine guns, Treyarch has included a damage range buff across all submachine guns in the game, and all of the assault rifles will feature slightly increased flinch.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer says this is just the beginning of the weapon tuning players can expect in the coming weeks.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the game's powerful Drone Pod field upgrade is now nerfed with the following changes:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Increased Drone Pod charge time from 2.5 to 3 minutes</li><li dir="ltr">Reduced Drone Pod active drone duration from 10 to 8 seconds</li><li dir="ltr">Reduced Drone Pod damage from 60 to 50 damage</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The update includes Zombies changes meant to improve the main Ashes of the Damned Easter egg experience for all players, including adjustments to the difficulty of the boss fight. The boss fight's Hoard Husk will now regenerate after a minute of collection and give 25% more health, and the boss's missile barrage has reduced effectiveness. It also reduces damage to passengers riding in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-zombies-how-to-repair-and-upgrade-ol-tessie/1100-6536336/" data-ref-id="1100-6536336">Ol' Tessie</a> and removes the repair cooldown.</p><p dir="ltr">To improve the Zombies quest for solo players, Zursa the zombie bear will no longer spawn in solo boss fights before round 100 and will have reduced speed.</p><p dir="ltr">This new update also unlocks the campaign's Endgame mode for all Black Ops 7 players to enjoy. Those who unlocked Endgame naturally by beating the campaign will receive a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-endgame-will-soon-be-playable-for-everyone-right-away/1100-6536359/">variety of Black Ops 7 rewards</a>.

Now that we've had time to collect data and player feedback, we're making a slight adjustment as we do with all aspects of gameplay over time to hit our targets and address the wide range of feedback.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launched with a new right-stick aiming requirement for achieving maximum Rotational Aim Assist strength. When the right-stick isn’t used, or isn’t tracking a target effectively, players now experience a minimum Rotational Aim Assist strength. At launch, the minimum Rotational Aim Assist was a 35% reduction from the Beta. Our goal for this new mechanic and our other Aim Assist range changes is to provide the most competitive experience for all players and inputs. This slightly overshot our balance target, so we’re making a small tuning adjustment to the minimum Rotational Aim Assist.</p><p>Aim Assist is one of the most integral components of gameplay feel, so it’s crucial for us to settle on tuning that both feels great to play with and hits our balance goals. As always, we'll continue to closely examine game data and player feedback.</p><ul><li>Minimum Rotational Aim Assist penalty reduced from 35% to 25%.</li></ul><h3>Weapons</h3><p>We are pushing an early round of weapon tuning that aims at addressing some of the common pieces of feedback we have been seeing at launch. The main area of feedback has been SMG balance, particularly in relation to Assault Rifles. Most of our changes today aim to reduce the versatility of our highest performing ARs, and improve the mid-range performance of SMGs. You can find more details below. Aside from the SMGs, we have a handful of other individual weapon and prestige attachment adjustments. In general we really like the class variety we have been seeing so far.</p><p>This is just the beginning for weapon tuning in the opening weeks of Black Ops 7. We’ll be continuing to dial things in across weapons, prestige attachments, and the general attachment portfolio as we roll into our first season.</p><h4>Assault Rifles</h4><p>Assault Rifles are receiving a small flinch nerf so that they flinch harder than SMGs. This is not a huge adjustment, as we also don’t want to introduce lucky headshots into our full-auto gunfights. This flinch increase is small enough that it may affect players aiming for headshots and not well centered, but still not force most torso shots into headshots unintentionally.</p><p>Weapon Class Adjustment</p><ul><li>Received Flinch increased from .15N to .18N.</li></ul><h4>SMGs</h4><p>SMGs are receiving a similar list of buffs across the board. Baseline, they are all receiving an improvement to their final damage range to add a handful of meters to some of their mid-range power. In addition, multiple attachments are receiving substantial improvements to their damage range traits. Our goal here is to help SMGs to contend with ARs more effectively out into medium ranges, but also require some build investment to do so especially well. We still want players to make some choices between creating ultra-fast SMG builds and those that have higher range capabilities, but Gunfighter shouldn’t feel like a requirement.</p><p>Similarly, the Rear Grip attachments that improve recoil are seeing a buff. There’s a tough handling tradeoff when taking recoil in that node, so we felt there was room to push these further. A few of the SMGs are receiving additional, baseline improvements to recoil as well.</p><p>Overall, we think this will give SMGs a more solid footing in Black Ops 7. We’ll continue to fine tune to make sure both SMGs and ARs have a role to play across our map portfolio.</p><p><strong>Weapon Class Adjustment</strong></p><ul><li>Received Flinch reduced from 0.17N to 0.12N.</li></ul><h4>Marksman Rifles</h4><p>The Warden 308 and M34 Novaline are both very high-power, precision weapons that we see doing very well so far in Black Ops 7. Our sentiment here is the same as the X9 Maverick, in that we are excited to have Marksman Rifles in the mix and want to keep it that way. For now we want to make sure there’s some counterplay to these weapons, and that playing aggressively with them requires attachment investment. Upping the flinch they receive and hitting the handling and mobility is the approach we’re taking for that.</p><h2>MULTIPLAYER</h2><h3>UI</h3><ul><li>Increased viewable minimap area an additional 10% on top of previous 15% increase.</li></ul><h3>Field Upgrades</h3><ul><li>Drone Pod  <ul><li>Increased Drone Pod charge time from 2.5 to 3 minutes.</li><li>Reduced Drone Pod active drone duration from 10 to 8 seconds.</li><li>Reduced Drone Pod damage from 60 to 50 damage.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Scorestreaks</h3><ul><li>Hand Cannon  <ul><li>Increased ammo for the Hand Cannon Akimbo Overlock from 5 to 7 rounds per gun; reduced hipfire spread by 44%.</li><li>Reduced ammo for the Hand Cannon Extended Mag Overclock from 12 to 10 rounds.</li></ul></li><li>LDBR  <ul><li>Increased missile count for the LDBR Second Strike Overclock from 9 to 13 missiles per target.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Modes</h3><ul><li>Adjusted FFA spawn influencer size for all maps to address bad spawn issues.</li></ul><h3>Challenges</h3><ul><li>Changed the following camo challenge requirement:  <ul><li>“Kill enemies affected by your Tactical Equipment” to “Kill enemies affected by your Tactical or non-lethal Scorestreak”.</li></ul></li><li>Fixed an issue where the Popcorn Medal wasn’t being awarded when getting 2 or more kills with the Needle Drone or Semtex Lethal Equipment.</li></ul><h3>Stability</h3><ul><li>Various crash and stability updates.</li></ul><h2><b>ZOMBIES</b></h2><h3>Maps</h3><ul><li><b>Ashes of the Damned</b><ul><li>Reduced difficulty for the Boss fight in Ashes of the Damned.  <ul><li>Hoard Husk will regenerate after a minute of collection and give 25% more health.</li><li>Missiles have reduced effectiveness and will no longer fire while a Beam Attack is charging.</li><li>Interrupting the Beam Attack no longer reduces its cooldown before round 100.</li><li>Reduced damage to passengers riding in Ol' Tessie and removed repair cooldown.</li><li>Increased cooldown on the boss ramming Ol' Tessie in its immune phase.</li><li>Zursa will no longer spawn in Solo before round 100 and has reduced speed.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Gameplay</h3><ul><li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to stand on a light fixture at Vandorn Farm.</li><li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to block zombie pathing with Ol' Tessie.</li></ul><h3>UI</h3><ul><li>Addressed a rare issue when entering Ol’ Tessie that could cause the HUD to refresh or the boss to spawn without a health bar.</li></ul><h3>Challenges</h3><ul><li>Increased the amount of Dead Wire Ammo kills required to unlock the Pathfinder Camo for the DS20 Mirage from 5 to 300.</li><li>Changed the following camo challenge requirement:  <ul><li>“Get Kills shortly after using a Field Upgrade” to "Get Kills while a Field Upgrade is active”.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Stability</h3><ul><li>Various crash and stability updates.</li></ul><h2>CO-OP CAMPAIGN / ENDGAME</h2><h3>General</h3><ul><li>Endgame is now available for all players who own Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</li></ul><h3>Loadouts</h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where some attachments on weapon builds would not be present after loading into a match.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii has been designing games for upwards of 40 years, and though he's 71 today, he still remains heavily involved in the development of the long-running RPG franchise that began in 1986. During our <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">cover story </a>trip to Tokyo, Japan, to play <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>, <em>Game Informer </em>had the opportunity to interview Horii for 90 minutes and asked him about the differences between game development in the 1980s and in 2025.</p><p>He says the entire landscape is completely different.&nbsp;</p><p>"You know, the development landscape is just completely different compared to back then," Horii tells <em>Game Informer</em>. "On the original Dragon Quest, we had a team of less than 10 people, but now we have a team of 300 to 400 spending years and years making one game; not to mention the rising development cost, too. So it's just completely different."&nbsp;</p><p>Horii says back in the early years of Dragon Quest, he recalls doing the programming, some of the art – "I would just do everything by myself," he recalls, reminiscing on his early development days leading up to Dragon Quest.&nbsp;</p><p>"People would just do that, and that [game] actually got sold as a finished product back then – just one person working on a single game," he adds. "That's just not something that can happen today."&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, games developed by just one person release all the time, and there's an argument to be made that the growth within the indie scene proves it's not only possible, but easier than ever. But Horii is likely thinking within the Dragon Quest franchise, and in that regard, he's right – making something like Dragon Quest XI or the in-development Dragon Quest XII as a solo developer sounds like a much more challenging, if not impossible, task compared to the 1980s.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches on February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet to access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/21/yuji-horii-on-early-days-in-game-dev-i-would-just-do-everything]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-era-100-falls-to-new-record-low-now-cheaper-than-speakers-with-mediocre-sound-quality-2000646231</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonos-era-100-falls-to-new-record-low-now-cheaper-than-speakers-with-mediocre-sound-quality.1361137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For years, Sonos made its name with WiFi streaming alone, avoiding Bluetooth at all costs to keep audio quality high. It finally relented with portable speakers, realizing convenience does matter for some use cases without invalidating the core WiFi basis of what makes Sonos so great. The <strong>Era 100</strong> competes directly with Bose and Sony’s premium offerings while it currently sells for mid-range pricing that makes no sense given its capabilities. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/">dropped this to $169 for Black Friday, down from $199, which is a record low</a> that puts exceptional audio within reach of anyone looking for Bluetooth speakers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>47% Faster Processor Powers Dual-Tweeter Architecture</h2>
<p>The next-generation processor handles more complex audio processing in real time and enables features that previous Sonos speakers couldn’t support. Dual tweeters create genuine stereo separation from a single speaker, placing instruments and vocals in distinct left and right positions. This architecture produces a soundstage that fills rooms rather than feeling like sound emanates from a single point. The <strong>25% larger midwoofer extends bass response deeper than the previous generation</strong>, and gives kick drums and bass lines actual impact without needing a separate subwoofer for most music.</p>
<p>This compact design fits easily on bookshelves, kitchen counters, desks and nightstands. You place the speaker wherever you really spend time, rather than arranging furniture around audio equipment. <strong>The size makes it truly portable inside your home</strong>&nbsp;and moves from room to room as the day progresses with you. It weighs enough to feel substantial yet remains light enough to carry easily in one hand.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi streaming provides lossless audio quality from the likes of Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music. The connection also remains stable throughout a home without the dropouts that plague Bluetooth in larger spaces. You control playback through the Sonos app which aggregates all of your streaming services into one interface. AirPlay 2 support adds another streaming option for Apple users who want to send audio directly from their devices.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth connectivity handles quick pairing with phones</strong>, tablets, and laptops when you want simple wireless playback. You press a button on the back of the speaker, and instantly, your device finds it. This mode is great for playing podcasts, audiobooks, or music from apps that aren’t integrated into the Sonos ecosystem. The implementation of Bluetooth maintains decent quality, though Wi-Fi streaming sounds noticeably better when that option is available.</p>
<p>The Line-In Adapter includes <strong>a 3.5mm auxiliary input to connect turntables</strong>, CD players, or other analog sources. This adapter is available separately but turns the Era 100 into a powered speaker for vinyl setups or legacy audio equipment. It combines digital streaming with analog input flexibility that pure Bluetooth speakers simply can’t compete with.</p>



<p>Trueplay tuning uses your iPhone’s microphone to <strong>analyze room acoustics and then automatically adjust the speaker’s EQ</strong>. You wave your phone around the listening area for about a minute, and it makes a custom sound profile optimized for your particular space. This calibration compensates for room characteristics, such as hard surfaces that create reflections or soft furnishings that absorb sound. The difference between tuned and untuned sound is immediately noticeable, with vocals becoming clearer and bass tightening up.</p>
<p><strong>Alexa integration enables voice control</strong> for music playback, smart home commands, and general queries. The built-in microphones pick up voice commands clearly even when music plays at moderate volumes. You can add the Era 100 to multi-room setups with other Sonos speakers, creating a whole-home audio system that plays synchronized music everywhere or different content in each room. This ecosystem approach means starting with one speaker and expanding over time as budget allows.</p>
<p>For $169, you’re getting Sonos premium audio engineering, with both WiFi and Bluetooth for less than mid-range speakers elsewhere that can’t compete on sound quality. Similarly priced Bose and Sony speakers rely exclusively on Bluetooth and don’t have the multi-room capabilities that make Sonos special.</p>

                <p>For years, Sony focused almost exclusively on releasing its games for PlayStation platforms, and while the company's focus remains in the console market, it has expanded to PC in recent years. A new report says Sony is having plenty of success with these efforts, with its PC releases thus far collectively bringing in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.</p><p>A <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-selling-playstation-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from Alinea Analytics</a> put forth this number, based on its own research. The best-selling PlayStation game on PC is Helldivers 2, the report said, selling more than 12.7 million copies.</p><p>In total, the report said Sony's five top-selling PC releases on Steam have passed 43 million copies sold collectively. The gross revenue from these sales reportedly amounted to $1.5 billion. This includes $1.2 billion for Sony and Valve's cut of $350 million or more. Valve takes a 30% cut of PC game sales on Steam, falling to 25% after $10 million in revenue and $20% after 50 million.</p><p>The report added that Helldivers 2 players are seriously engaged with the game, with a reported one-fifth of players logging more than 100 hours total. More than 200,000 people who own the game on Steam play it every day, the report said.</p><h2><strong>PlayStation's top-selling PC games on Steam</strong></h2><ul><li>Helldivers 2 -- 12.7 million</li><li>Horizon: Zero Dawn -- 4.5 million</li><li>God of War -- 4.2 million</li><li>Days Gone -- 3.4 million</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man -- 2.7 million</li></ul><p>While Sony is obviously enjoying success with its PC releases, the report said there are signs that show interest in PlayStation games on PC may be slowing down.</p><p>"All of Sony's major franchises have already landed on PC. The audience that was once excited to experience these games for the first time has largely been served. Later releases naturally face smaller potential audiences, and our estimates clearly show this," the report said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4608722-helldivers2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608722" data-ratio="0.57978723404255" data-width="1128" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4608722-helldivers2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608722"></a><figcaption>Helldivers 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4608722-helldivers2.jpg"></figure><p>Looking ahead, Alinea said the challenge PlayStation faces is landing on the right window for PC releases that "protects PS5 software sales while still satisfying a PC audience that increasingly expects timely releases."</p><p>Sony does not have any strict schedules for when a PlayStation game may come to PC, except for the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-reveals-why-sony-doesnt-release-most-ps5-games-on-pc-day-and-date/1100-6523804/" data-ref-id="1100-6523804">commitment to launch live-service games simultaneously for console and PC. </a>The company's marquee first-party PS5 games will not come to PC for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-wont-bring-first-party-titles-to-pc-for-at-least-a-year-except-live-service/1100-6508026/" data-ref-id="1100-6508026">at least a year</a> after they originally debut on console.</p><p>PlayStation boss Hermen Hulst said Sony doesn't release those games day-and-date across console and PC as part of an effort to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-reveals-why-sony-doesnt-release-most-ps5-games-on-pc-day-and-date/1100-6523804/" data-ref-id="1100-6523804">protect the PlayStation console ecosystem</a>. "Our single-player, narrative-driven titles that are the backbone of what PlayStation Studios has delivered in recent years and in our history--we take a more strategic approach," he said.</p><p>The Alinea report also raised the question of if Sony might look to shift its strategy in response to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">Steam Machine</a> launch in 2026. The console-like six-inch cube PC could shake things up.</p><p>"If Steam begins to function as a competing ecosystem with its own dedicated hardware that plays PlayStation titles, the relationship changes," Alinea's Rhys Elliott said. "PlayStation may soon face pressure to rethink its timing and release strategy as Steam evolves from a distribution platform into a rival platform with broader reach and fewer constraints."</p><p>Microsoft has been embracing PC releases for a long time already, and the company has indicated that its next Xbox platform <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-says-hardware-is-core-to-the-xbox-ecosystem/1100-6536289/" data-ref-id="1100-6536289">could embrace more PC sensibilities</a>. The other big platform-holder, Nintendo, does not release any games on PC.</p><p>Strauss Zelnick, the head of Rockstar owner Take-Two, recently made headlines when he said the gaming industry is "moving towards PC."</p><p>"I think it's moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed," Zelnick told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a>. "But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen--that's never going away."</p>

			<p>Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord is now more than three years removed from its 1.0 release in October 2022 (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-early-access-preview/">five years removed from its early access launch</a>), and developer TaleWorlds Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-gameplay-trailer/">is set to release the game's biggest expansion so far.</a> War Sails adds naval combat to the game for the first time, brings back a beloved faction with the return of the Nords from the original Mount and Blade, adds a whole new biome to explore, new skills for players to master, and a slew of tweaks and changes to the base game with a free update.</p>



<p>Ahead of its launch, I got the chance to play some of the coming expansion and hear from the developers about everything coming in War Sails. I also got the chance to speak to Falk Engel, senior producer at TaleWorlds Entertainment on Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord and Gökçen Karaağaç, the team lead on the game's design team.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>Firstly, I'd like to hear about the key upgrades to ship combat in War Sails, and the impact it has on the rest of the game.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>I mean, the biggest, I guess, would be the ram [ramming ships] and the balistas, because they kind of open up new ways of ship destruction</em>, <em>but the primary method of ship destruction, as you can see in the gameplay, is fire. The other things that end up being more impactful are the campaign upgrades that get you to carry more troops or for your troops to have higher morale or your ship having a higher sea burton so you can handle the storms or simply travel faster, those upgrades end up having a bigger impact on your gameplay overall.</em> <em>Also, the other note to that is not all ships have access to all upgrades. Some ships are more customizable or more all-rounder ships, while others are more purpose-built. They make up for that [lack of customization] by being really specialized ships. They are really good at what they try to do.</em></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>To add to that, there's also the option to increase your cargo holds, so that you can be more oriented in your upgrades towards travel and trade or more combat oriented.</em></p>



<p><strong>Is it possible to do coordinated land and sea attacks from two different armies?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>Not in the way you're asking, no.</em> <em>We don't have a hybrid combat system, where you can have some troops at sea</em> <em>and some troops at land interact, but we do have methods to land in the naval</em>, <em>especially when you are trying to conquer towns, especially coastal towns, you need to be ready for both naval and land battles, as the defenders might attack you on both sides, so there is that, but no hybrid missions.</em></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel: </strong><em>In terms of the campaign side of this, there is no way for you to directly tell another party or army to go somewhere and do something at that exact moment, but of course, as a player, you have the ability to observe what the other army is doing, and then coordinate with that action</em>. </p>



<p><strong>Will the skills of troops affect the ship that they're on during combat or is it only the captain's skill that matters?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>It's only the captain's skill that matters;</em> troops use their own skills. Apart from if they are a Mariner or not,<em> if they are not, they kind of get hampered in their combat abilities, but their skills do not affect the ship's stats or abilities</em>.</p>



<p><strong>The three new skills that are being added, Mariner, Boatswain, and Shipmaster, are those replacing the old skills, or do players get an additional attribute?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>You don't get additional attributes, but each of the skills kind of corresponds to two different attributes. I'm not certain at the moment, but it's like Vigor and Control is the Mariner, for example. Previously, each attribute, each skill was combined to a single attribute, but these new naval skills are touching two of the other ones. So, if you're already a good tactician and a decent warrior, if you use those attributes, you will be a good Mariner anyway. Not right away, but it will be easy for you to be a good Mariner.</em></p>



<p><strong>What does the new Nord faction add to the game? Why did you want to bring the Nords back in?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>I mean, there's definitely nostalgia. It is one of those factions, as a culture, that's easy to justify</em> <em>coming in. 'Oh, they were always up there, and now they've started to pick up their ships and come here.' So, story-wise it makes more sense</em> <em>to bring them back. That is one part of it; the other one is what they are bringing to the table, land battle-wise. They also give us room and reason to put more effort into infantry combat. They are bringing the heaviest and highest-tier level</em> <em>infantry in the game</em>, <em>which kind of crushes through almost every infantry, and whatever it can't crush it trades quite well into. Beyond that, of course, whatever the other factions get naval-wise, Nords can do it better, in almost every aspect. Except trade, they're kind of okay-ish in that one, so that's their gimmick.</em></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>Aside from this - trade is a nice keyword - they do produce some trade items that you can engage with. When you go to their lands, they'll have different environments, biomes, architecture, etc. So there's just more to explore; they look quite interesting. When you go into their towns, you'll see that their housing is inspired by ships. They have this kind of unique layout on the map, where there's Nordvik, the large portion that is kind of interacting down with Sturgia, and then you have towards Vineland, this island area, where there's another town, and that's not something that we had before.</em></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>One unique aspect to them is that they're a lot less town-focused, but they have a lot more castles, so they have like four well-supplied towns, but most of their lords are just ruling over castles, so their economy is a bit more military focused in a sense and less...not as powerful as Aserai for example, but also not as fragile. They have a more safe economy, compared to other factions</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Will the politics of the game get any big changes with this new expansion?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>We already introduced some in the Beta branch and in the base game update, and we are going to improve upon it. We're going to improve on the alliances and how we conduct them, but inner kingdom-wise, there are new policies that are both naval-related, for the base game as well, that inspire some</em> <em>different roleplaying opportunities as well as some new strategies</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>And maybe even beyond this, I mean, war is an extension of politics</em>. <em>The design team, Gökçen</em> <em>and others, have spent quite a bit of effort on improving the way in which factions consider wars, whether they're making progress, if this war is sensible,</em> <em>distance, the exposure in terms of the settlements and so forth, so even if that's not an outright addition, it changes the politics.</em></p>



<p><strong>While this expansion and naval combat are single-player only,</strong> <strong>there's also a big update releasing alongside War Sails for all players. Are there any multiplayer improvements coming in this new update?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel: </strong><em>There are some improvements that are included, they are not the focus, and I think we should be clear on that to not mislead anyone.</em> <em>You've seen, as part of the beta, significant visual improvements that we've done through the atmosphere, and I think that's something that we're looking to take to the multiplayer as well. We're also looking at potentially including a new multiplayer team. With regards to what the future holds, that's something we're not discussing at the moment.</em></p>



<p><strong>So, no word on future DLC plans beyond War Sails?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>Yes, that as well. Essentially, our approach tends to be that we want to be very sure about what we're doing before we bring it to players, because we don't see the benefit in creating false hope.</em></p>



<p><strong>Is cross-play functionality potentially on the horizon for Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>I don't want to say something wrong, I mean, I think I can say that there's no active work on that right now. We have to consider some aspects of it, like there are some aspects of it that are internal, the challenges associated with such a change. But there's also just the simple, 'would it actually add to the player experience to have cross-play</em>,' <em>'is it fun to play the game on controller versus someone who's on a mouse and keyboard.</em> <em>Especially with our multiplayer community, which is extremely, I mean, - </em></p>



<p><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>Dedicated [laughs]</em></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel: </strong><em>Dedicated, yeah [laughs], I mean, I can't beat them. I don't think I would do better with a controller.</em></p>



<p><strong>I noticed in the notes about the big update coming for all players alongside War Sails' release includes "<em>expanded modding capabilities," </em>can you go into what that means? Is there anything modders should look out for in this update?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>There is a long list of things <a href="https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/e1-6-0-v1-3-1-modding-changes.443896/">that are part of the patch notes</a></em>. <em>I think one of the most buzzword-y things related to modding is the ability to crouch and use weapons at the same time. You know, anything with muskets, those kinds of mods, [modders] are really excited about, and I think are already interacting with as part of the beta. The [live] release itself, I don't think we'll see substantial additions there because we've already shared the vast majority of what we have done in the beta. Our modding community tends to engage with that early on so that their mods are ready when we push it live. When it comes to War Sails in and of itself, of course the support for naval gameplay, for pathfinding across the sea on the world map, for using ships. I think there are probably already some mods that have some level of seafaring, but if they have an interest in the DLC, I think that will both expand the capabilities that they have in that regard, as well as the existing content that they can co-opt or utilize in their mods as well.</em></p>



<p><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>Part of this effort on our end for modding capabilities is kind of to compensate for the changes coming into the base game. For example, even the way the water is rendered is changed, and we want to make sure that it is an easy effort for people who make their own world map to switch to the new system. So, some of these efforts also coincide with the new work we are kind of creating for our modders, to build up and continue supporting their creations.</em></p>



<p><strong>Is there still work being done on the Claimants that were shown a few years ago?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel: </strong><em>So, we can't comment on the Claimants themselves at this point, but we can maybe say that there are some features that relate to them that we are still working on. I think we might have mentioned some of them previously. They do relate to other topics people care about such as making trades</em> <em>or valuables, but we don't want to talk about features that may still take quite a bit of time, because the moment that we make them more tangible, people tend to get very excited and then potentially very disappointed that it takes that amount of time before they get the answers.</em></p>



<p><strong>Is support for DLSS Frame Generation still on its way?</strong> <strong>Can you provide an update on when it might arrive?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel: </strong><em>I can't give you an update now, I will check with the engine team and get back to you.</em></p>



<p><strong>Switching to consoles, are there any plans to take advantage of the more powerful hardware in PS5 Pro?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>We don't have anything specific to mention on that currently. We can say, of course, that the work on the DLC has seen a lot of optimization in terms of memory, in terms of performance and so forth, which will also benefit consoles, both in the base game as well as the DLC.</em></p>



<p><strong>Do you have anything else you'd like to say to the community?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>As always, our heartfelt gratitude for the long journey we've walked together and the support that people have given us over the years. It's awesome to see that people are still very excited. Personally, I come from the community, so it's always kind of fun to still have that engagement for a lot of our developers. It's great to see people talk about the DLC, talk about the game, give us feedback, and share their excitement for what's coming, and it will be very cool to see how they enjoy the DLC.</em></p>



<p><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>Have fun, enjoy the game, do not sail a ship that you can't afford to lose.</em></p>



<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-tuf-f16-gaming-laptop-rtx-4050-takes-a-black-friday-price-hit-that-makes-zero-sense.1361110/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s no shortage of laptops in the market, but not every powerful laptop is a gaming laptop. Standard laptops (made for everyday work and casual use) prioritize features like battery life, decent display, and lower costs. Gaming machines, on the other hand, pack high-performance components that can let you game and work on creative projects without slowing down. These options typically have stronger dedicated GPUs and CPUs, faster RAMs, and a bigger storage capacity, but as you’d expect, they can cost a pretty penny.</p>
<p>Most solid options out there with all this and more sit well over $1,500, but that changes today. Amazon has kick-started its Black Friday and Cyber Monday celebrations already with some impressive early deals across a range of categories.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/"> As part of that, the retailer has also dropped the price of the 16-inch ASUS TUF gaming laptop by 32%.</a> On a regular day, it would run you around $1,100, but you can snap it up for just $750 today. Honestly, that’s what most entry-level machines cost nowadays, which makes this offer no less than a steal. Of course, the stock is selling out fast, so there’s not much time left to save. If you have been wanting to upgrade your gaming experience for less, today is the day to make the move. In fact, this laptop can also be a great Christmas gift for a player in your life!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful GPU, Immersive Visuals</h2>
<p>There’s nothing too crazy going on with the design. The laptop looks and feels sturdy, plus comes with a subtle embossed TUF logo on its cover. The brand has thoroughly tested it to meet Military Grade testing standards, so you can expect it to handle everyday wear and tear well. Harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures, high humidity, and dirt won’t affect its performance one bit. But despite the sturdy, don’t-mess-with-me build, it’s lightweight enough to carry around easily. Take it to your office, nearby cafe, and even on some adventures without a worry.</p>
<p>Open it up and you’re greeted with a 16-inch Full HD display, which pushes immersive, detailed visuals. The 90% screen-to-body ratio gives you plenty of space to work and play. Color accuracy is excellent in all lighting conditions, making the content appear lifelike. The display also supports a 144Hz refresh rate to keep everything running smoothly, while the Adaptive-Sync technology actively reduces lag and minimizes stuttering for ultra-smooth gameplay.</p>



<p>Power is handled by an Intel Core i5 210H processor that’s paired with the underrated NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050. The GPU offers a significant performance boost over its predecessor and is a great entry-level option for those on a budget. Then there’s a modest 16GB RAM for increased efficiency. It’s not massive, but does a good job of handling everyday multitasking and most modern titles without throwing a fit. You will also be able to store all your favorite games and creative programs without feeling limited, thanks to the massive 512GB PCIe Gen4 SSD. And since SSDs offer much faster system boot and load times, you won’t have to wait long to get on with your day.</p>
<p>Best of all, despite powerful performance, the laptop does not overheat. ASUS has packed it with Arc Flow Fans, 4 exhaust vents, 5 dedicated heat pipes, and an anti-dust filter; all of which come together to keep things cool and quiet in the background as you teach some bad guys a lesson. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/">There’s a lot more to like about this laptop, especially now that it’s going for just $750. The discount won’t be around forever, so it’s best to get your orders in fast.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It appears that the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 hasn’t been one to write home about for Microsoft and Activision. According to a new report from The Game Business, Black Ops 7 sales numbers are down compared to both Battlefield 6 and last year’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>In data <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">provided to the outlet</a> by GSD, Black Ops 7 sales—both physical and digital—are down 63% compared to Battlefield 6. Obviously, it’s important to note that Battlefield 6 isn’t available on any subscription service, meaning that people need to buy the game if they want to play. So, while the sales numbers for Battlefield 6 are higher, it’s still probably that the overall player count for Call of Duty is actually higher.</p>







<h2 id="h-sales-are-down-compared-to-last-year">Sales Are Down Compared To Last Year</h2>



<p>Where things get a little dicey is when you look at the comparison to last year’s release, Black Ops 6. According to the report, physical and digital sales are down over 50% compared to last year. Again, many can, and will, point the game being available on Xbox Game Pass for Ultimate and PC subscribers. But so was Black Ops 6. </p>



<p>Despite all the numbers being down, Black Ops 7 was still the best-selling game in terms of units and revenue in Europe for the week ending November 16 (its launch week). Battlefield 6, it’s main competition right now, came in fourth in both units sold and overall revenue.</p>







<p>At the end of the day, it’s not like Call of Duty is a dwindling franchise as it’s still generating revenue for its developers and publishers. Still, it’s interesting to see how far sales have fallen and if it’s simply a case of more people playing on Xbox Game Pass, or is there a real drop off in actual interest in the 22-year-old franchise.</p>

<p>On the surface, this looks like a bartop arcade cabinet, but in reality, it's a cradle for your Switch console that allows you to use authentic arcade-style controls with games that benefit from digital input – such as old-school titles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-shmups">shmups</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-fighting-games">fighting games</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kzhrqj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>The iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro doesn't come preassembled, but putting it together (and taking it apart) is a straightforward process. Two caddy sections are included, one for the original Switch / Switch OLED, and one for the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Ensuring compatibility with both generations is a nice touch, but this really feels like it was designed for the newer variant; the cut-out for the screen is designed with Switch 2's larger display in mind, so the original Switch ends up looking like a toddler in a teenager's clothing.</p>
<p>The good news is that the Mini Arcade Pro's arcade-style controls are excellent regardless of which system you own. The clicky stick and buttons are smaller than you'd find on your typical bartop arcade cabinet, but they're a joy to use; within moments of booting up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, I was pulling off special moves with the minimum of effort.</p>
<p>Shmups also benefit massively from this accessory — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r-type_delta_hd_boosted">R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</a> is a particular joy to play — and I also enjoyed romping my way through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a85ebc9a58b26"><a title="Review: iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a85ebc9a58b26/review-imp-gaming-mini-arcade-pro-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>There's space on the rear of the unit for 12 Switch Game Cards and 12(!) MicroSD cards — <em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The central panel has all of the usual inputs (including a Home button which wakes your console from its sleep mode), as well as a switch which allows you to toggle the functionality of the stick – you can choose between the D-pad, left analogue stick, and right analogue stick. There's a 'C' button to bring up GameChat, but no 'Capture' button, oddly.</p>
<p>Spin it around, and there's space for you to clip in 12 Switch game cards and 12 MicroSD cards – a nice touch if you want to keep your software close at hand. My only reservation with this system is that the Game Card slots don't seem to grip all that well, and it doesn't take much to knock them out of the slots by accident.</p>
<p>My other major issue with the iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro is the artwork that has been printed onto the marquee, side panels, and the main control panel. The lettering is a <em>little</em> too childish for my liking, and while I'm not entirely sure, I think I detect the use of Generative AI to create the art itself. This obviously has no impact on the controller's performance, but it makes it look a little cheap, in my opinion.</p>

<p>The Switch's recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/poll-is-your-third-party-switch-2-dock-still-working-after-this-weeks-system-update">firmware update</a> actually broke the Mini Arcade Pro's ability to wake the console via the Home button and the functionality of the 'C' button, but, in a move which hopefully shows how committed the manufacturer is to making this device a success, it has <a href="https://impgaming.uk/v21/">received a firmware update</a> to fix the problem.</p>
<p>While I think the iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro's cheap-looking artwork counts against it, I can't fault the controller when it comes to delivering that old-school arcade experience. At £45, it's not likely to break the bank, either (although it's $90 in the US).</p>

						<h5>ARC Raiders</h5><p><span>October 30th, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, PC</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Get in, get loot, get out, and don't get shot. Those are the core tenets that extraction shooters live and die by. If the gameplay loop is solid and you can bring along friends for the journey, that's a recipe for success. Embark Studios is no stranger to unique takes on familiar competitive genres, with The Finals having been released nearly two years prior. The team is back with a new spin on the extraction shooter genre, one where antagonistic and automated robots have taken over the landscape, and players can only survive above ground for thirty minutes at a time before an unstoppable threat rolls in. This is ARC Raiders.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Few extraction shooters have frustrated me in the same way as ARC Raiders, and perhaps that can be a testament to its distinctive yet disruptive nature in the market. Dying on a run results in losing everything you brought with you, minus the one or two items you might have squirreled away in your prison pocket; the safe space is determined by whichever combat augment you've equipped. The poverty loadout that players can opt to start a run with doesn't have the luxury, so you're at the mercy of other players and ARC bots not to put a bullet in your back as you're trying to extract from the surface safely.</p>



<p>Another downside to jumping into the free loadout is the poor quality of the starting weapons. Of the variety of cheap beginner weapons, only the Ferro (single-shot rifle) and Stitcher (short-range SMG) felt like they were enough to keep me alive in a firefight, while the others felt like the developers were trolling me with how ineffective they could be. With these loadouts, you get one stack of ammo for your weapon, bandages, and one shield recharger. If you survive and make it back home, you can cash in that freebie for a proper augment with a safe pocket, although you might want to sell the gun and craft something more useful.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>ARC Raiders' gunplay remains what could be the tipping point for whether it draws in or turns players away. Again, the beginner rank weapons are such a handicap when going out to scavenge, and it isn't until the next tier of weapons that players might actually find a gun that's enjoyable to use (unless you feel like using the ammo-sink Kettle). Once I could craft the Anvil pistol or Il Toro shotgun, those remained a part of my loadout whenever I felt like actually hunting down bots (and players) and not just being a sneaky scav using the free loadout to loot and scoot.</p>



<p>Compared to the armored shells on the ARC enemies scattered about, raiders themselves feel like they're wearing paper rather than a shield meant to take a hit. Getting ambushed by one of the small rolling Pops can completely shred through the basic shield and take a player down to half health. Many of the flying ARC bots can also harass and chase down players just trying to escape with a modest collection of loot.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The ARC is supposed to be the main threat, not the players, but that doesn't always hold true. Players should be wary any time they hear the sound of a nearby raider trying to breach and search a locked container or the telltale sounds of gunfire that might be closer than expected. Run into another player and you're at the mercy of their temperament and whether they even consider you a threat. If you're not a fan of hopping on voice chat and announcing your presence, there's a handy emote wheel where a callout asking the other player not to shoot will be one of the most commonly used phrases during your entire time playing through ARC Raiders. Of course, just because someone declares a truce doesn't prevent them from putting two in your back when you least expect it. Throughout most of my runs, the ones that ended in deadly gunfights were in squads of three; playing solo usually resulted in playing with like-minded players who just wanted to explore or complete the quests they had in their log.</p>



<p>To incentivize players to want to go topside into Toledo, there's a plethora of loot to fill your pockets with of various rarities, not all of which is simply fodder to recycle into base materials or sell for a little extra pocket change. Part of the problem is knowing exactly what is worth taking back and when. Depending on where you are in developing/upgrading the various crafting stations, you might need to seek out and gather different parts. A random cat bed you come across might not seem like much now, but it is one of the crucial components you'll need to bestow upon your rooster companion so that they can passively gather raw materials on your behalf. Each potential upgrade or craftable can be added to your wishlist, so I've tended to include every single crafting station and the usual assortment of Anvil handgun, tier 2 shields and loadouts, and other items I try to bring with me on every run of ARC Raiders so that if I find these materials out in the wild, I'll know to stash those away and save any extra pocket space for rare blueprints or other garbage I can simply sell to expand my storage chest back home.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As I was writing this, I wanted to wait until Stella Montis opened up for players as the latest zone to explore and bring the roster of explorable locales up to five. Embark Studios has had to make some emergency updates and nerf a particular skill at the end of one skill tree, which allowed players to breach and loot security lockers for rare gear (it's since been toned down to reduce the typical rarity of scrap discovered). Stella Montis is a massive enclosed complex with a variety of ARC threats (some unique to the map as well) scattered throughout, but players should also be wary of other players because I've routinely found myself with a bullet to the back after greeting and passing by a fellow raider.</p>



<p>After a brief introductory tutorial mission that results in the player getting shot in the back, the few remnants of the story left to ARC Raiders are told by way of quests and brief interactions with NPCs who never leave their respective shops. If you're looking for some grand story about why the world is constantly besieged by the ARC threat, you'll be left out in the cold. These NPCs also speak with an inhuman, robotic tone that expresses itself with inflections at unnatural times and a cadence that doesn't match what an actual human actor would portray. This is because of Embark Studios' usage of generative AI for these NPC interactions and perhaps all of the vocal callouts out in the world as well. While the NPCs might have been trained off of real human actors, it nevertheless mars what would otherwise be a really solid audio presentation. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Audio is also one of the highlights of ARC Raiders that should get recognized all on its own, minus the aforementioned disgust with the generative AI vocals above. Each weapon sounds distinctively different from afar, and each threat or point of interest has its own audible hum or trill that the player will instinctively pick up over time. Pick up the subtle clicking of a clock off somewhere unseen? The 3D audio on PlayStation 5 will help guide you to its exact location as you turn and run towards a buried raider cache full of useful loot. Sometimes I can even tell what sort of ARC threat I'm about to encounter topside just by the mechanical sounds scattered throughout. The vocal callouts can be adjusted to be either a subtle or loud callout (or you can just leave it on automatic), depending on whether you want to alert any other players in the immediate vicinity to your discovery. The classic Don't Shoot callout will always be shouted out to prevent players from perhaps hearing the message before bullets start flying.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders is also a graphical powerhouse on PlayStation 5 Pro, leveraging the power of Unreal Engine 5 to great effect and better than other games that might use the standard UE5 featureset. It does target a solid 60 FPS and achieves it almost all of the time, thanks in part to a dynamic resolution scaling that Embark Studios themselves have confirmed as ranging between 720p and 2160p on the PlayStation 5 Pro to help sustain that 60 FPS target. Below is a little bit of what players should anticipate for performance:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PS5: Scalability settings</strong>&nbsp;– High Quality; Dynamic Resolution range – 720p-1600p</li>



<li><strong>PS5 Pro: Scalability settings</strong>&nbsp;– Epic Quality; Dynamic Resolution range – 720p-2160p
<ul>
<li>Scalability settings affect rendering quality in aspects such as Global Illumination, Shadows, Reflections, Post Processing, Texture resolution and filtering, VFX, View Distance, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>All in all, ARC Raiders is a phenomenal entry in the growing loot-and-scoot genre, or extraction shooter if you want to be more technical about it. While the gunplay suffers in the early stages with inferior tier one weaponry, it shines through once you start developing squad tactics and learn the ins and outs of besting the array of lethal ARC threats throughout Toledo. I wanted to wait until the first major content push from Embark Studios before finalizing my thoughts, and the inclusion of Stella Montis has brought a new flavor of psychological warfare to escalate this extraction shooter to greater heights.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>, which is a game about, er, navigating a tricky post-colonial climate, is making its way to consoles next month, developer DoubleBee and publisher rokaplay have announced.</p>

<p>The game, which has been available on PC since February, will be launching on current-gen machines (and Nintendo Switch, although not the Switch 2, apparently) on December 9th.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why <i>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</i>is getting a console release, it's probably because the indie hit managed to rack up 250,000 sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-250k" rel="nofollow">inside its first week</a>, so it stands to reason DoubleBee and rokaplay would want to expand its audience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-console-pit.jpg?itok=-60Hu0ZV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-console-pit.jpg?itok=ogsfsPov 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>is coming to consoles soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Since then, rokaplay says&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>'s audience has expanded to encapsulate more than 1.2 million players, describing it as an "unassuming indie title" that will be stepping "onto the biggest stages in gaming" next month.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>is, well, it's a game about digging a hole, funnily enough. You have a spade, and you must dig a hole in your back garden, beneath which you'll find all manner of secrets and other things buried.</p>

<p>Over the course of your time digging your hole, you'll be able to upgrade your equipment and sell the resources you gather. As rokaplay and DoubleBee say, "there's no rush, no pressure, just the pure joy of discovery as you dig deeper and deeper".</p>

<p>That'll be reflected in&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>'s price point; the game retails for just $5 on PC, which, as the two studios point out, is "less than a takeaway coffee". Hopefully, the console price point will reflect that as well.</p>
