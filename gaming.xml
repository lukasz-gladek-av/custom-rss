<figure><a title="Metroid Fusion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7dc67aedaf6b/metroid-fusion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has added two new batches of Switch Online icons from the <strong>Metroid</strong> series – specifically <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/metroid_fusion">Metroid Fusion</a>.</p>
<p>You'll need to boot up and play both games in order to unlock the icons. Super Metroid is part of the SNES app on Switch, and Metroid Fusion is part of the GBA app. The latter will require a membership to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, so make sure you're all signed up if you're particularly keen on these.</p>
<p>The Super Metroid icons include Samus herself alongside iconic enemies like Ridley, Kraid, and the Metroid. Meanwhile, the Fusion icons include Samus in her lovely blue and yellow Fusion Suit, flanked by enemies like the X Parasite and the Core X.</p>
<p>Bizarrely, Nintendo has opted not to include S-AX in any of its forms, which seems a bit odd to us, but never mind.</p>
<p>This is nice little treat for fans while we await more news on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, that's for sure. The game is scheduled to launch this year, but we've yet to receive a specific date. A recent blunder saw Nintendo install a giant poster in the London Underground stating that Beyond was "Out Now", but this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-fixes-its-metroid-prime-4-blunder-and-its-no-longer-out-now">has since been replaced</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Praise the Omnissiah.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> is set for a second year of DLC, and we have the first details on its huge 10.0 update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Breakout hit Space Marine 2 has sold 7 million copies, so it’s no surprise to see Year 2 support confirmed by publisher Focus Entertainment and developer Saber Interactive. In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500577186633221225" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community update</a>, the companies said Year 2 will bring new PvE missions, enemies, weapons, and more unannounced content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 came out in September 2024, and as part of its first anniversary, a “large-scale” update is planned to release in September. Patch 10.0 sounds like a big one for Space Marine 2, but it’s worth noting that Patch 9.0 is due out beforehand. 9.0 was meant to add a new PvP mode, but that’s now delayed to 10.0, which means 9.0 will add only balance changes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We do know a little about this new PvP mode, however. The twist here is it’s Chaos vs Chaos set on a new map, and, most interesting of all, you’ll be able to take control of the Helbrute. The Helbrute, for the uninitiated, is a variant of the Chaos Dreadnought, an evil death-dealer piloted by a Chaos Space Marine trapped within its plated metal chest. You might remember the Helbrute from the Space Marine 2 campaign, where it came off worse in a scrap with the Ultramarines’ Brother Valtus. Alongside this new Chaos-themed PvP mode are new Chaos armours, which are much-requested by fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, 10.0 adds the new Power Axe melee weapon, which has its own moveset and execution animations. We have a first look below:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/01/b9d4da70b5f382d137a5fc2c8a7c87556b8e5053-1751353725644.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Space Marine 2's upcoming Power Axe.

And let’s remember, in December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-modders-put-the-axe-from-secret-levels-warhammer-40000-episode-into-the-game"><u>IGN reported on Space Marine 2 modders who put the axe from Secret Level’s Warhammer 40,000 episode into the game</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>THIS is why I’m a fan of Warhammer 40k!

We don’t have a first look yet, but it’s advanced enough in development to be announced. Expect more on the Techmarine in the next community updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Techmarine perhaps doesn’t come as a huge surprise given it was also strongly hinted at in datamines (the files mentioned a perk called ‘shoulder gun bolter,’ which is a clear indication that Techmarines are finally in play). For the uninitiated, a Techmarine is a Space Marine engineer-type class who's a big fan of the Cult Mechanicus as well as their Chapter. They’re big on technology and specialize in fixing and maintaining vehicles and other big stuff, such as Dreadnoughts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a lot of new Space Marine 2 content coming down the line, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive"><u>despite the surprise announcement that development of Space Marine 3 development had begun</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has announced that prices of original Nintendo Switch systems and associated products in Canada will change on 1st August 2025, “based on market conditions.” The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> line up is unaffected.</p>
<p>While they don’t say so in quite so many words, the implication is that prices are rising for the previous generation of Nintendo console – they wouldn’t pre-announce a price drop like this.</p>


<p>This looks like a full readjustment of pricing in Canada, including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/nintendo-switch-oled-review-it-all-comes-down-to-the-screen/">Nintendo Switch – OLED Model</a>, Nintendo Switch, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/nintendo-switch-lite-review/">Nintendo Switch Lite</a>, physical and digital Nintendo Switch games and Nintendo Switch accessories. Amiibo and Nintendo Switch Online will also see price changes.</p>
<p>A lot of this could be put down to the fallout from trade wars and disputes with Canada’s closest neighbour, the United States of America. Since the start of the current administration, Canada has repeatedly tussled with Trump over tariffs, with new levies being announced, paused, pulled back, reannounced and more. That’s in addition to the global tariffs that Trump put in place as well. This uncertainty has had a huge impact on pricing around the world, but while <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/01/xbox-series-xs-console-prices-are-jumping-up-around-the-world-games-to-hit-80-this-winter/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/ps5-price-increases-hit-uk-eu-aus-nz-but-at-least-the-disc-drive-is-getting-cheaper/">Sony</a> announced price increases earlier this year, Nintendo has avoided making similar changes in the run up to the Switch 2’s launch – not least because of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">how much criticism they took</a> over pricing the new console, games and upgrades.</p>

<p>Could this herald more price increases for other countries? Certainly, and we’ll just have to wait and see what these price changes actually end up being.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you regularly browse Amazon US, you might have noticed that some Nintendo products sold directly by Amazon have seemingly disappeared from the online store. Now, Bloomberg has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/amazon-lost-right-to-sell-nintendo-switch-2-amid-sales-dispute?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTMzNDU2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzUxOTM5MzY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWURHWDRUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.E71nPDnc5HCRuSL_hpDTIu53pBJ6k8Jxef68-H6UgOs&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> a report on why that's happened.</p>



<p>According to Bloomberg's sources, the issue presented itself when Nintendo noticed that certain third-party sellers on Amazon were undercutting official products. They would essentially purchase the products in Southeast Asia, where they were presumably cheaper, and then sell them in the United States via Amazon.</p>



<p>In an attempt to reassure Nintendo, Amazon offered to attach labels to products to guarantee their authenticity. However, the proposal wasn't deemed enough of an assurance to Nintendo, and the Japanese company ultimately decided to remove its products from Amazon in the US.</p>



<p>When Bloomberg asked Amazon for a comment prior to publishing the story, a spokesperson simply commented, “The claims made by Bloomberg regarding our relationship with Nintendo are inaccurate,” without providing any further details on the subject.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, the fact remains that the issue prevented Amazon from participating in the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, which turned out to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fastest-selling console in history</a> with its over 3.5 million units sold in the first four days since the launch date (June 6), going <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">twice as fast</a> as the original Switch when considering the same timeframe. </p>



<p>What's perhaps even more impressive is that even without selling directly on Amazon US, by far the biggest online store in the country, the Nintendo Switch 2 still <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-set-another-record-by-selling-1-1-million-units-in-its-launch-week-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a> 1.1 million units across the United States in the launch week, beating the record previously established by Sony's PlayStation 2 in October 2000. By the way, Nintendo products (Switch 2 included) are regularly available in several countries, such as Japan itself, the United Kingdom and Canada. However, Amazon US makes up two-thirds of the store's global sales.</p>

<p>The Switch title received a free update last month</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Alongside Switch 2's launch last month, Nintendo rolled out multiple free Switch game updates. One of these was for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/game_builder_garage">Game Builder Garage</a> – which not only included visual optimisations but also added Joy-Con 2 mouse support.</p>
<p>Now, timed in with this update and the game's fourth anniversary, the Game Builder Garage community has held its very own "fan-made Nintendo Direct" <a href="https://youtu.be/4XpotaYRQRY">hosted by VideoDojo on YouTube</a> (<em>thanks for the heads up, Giovani Vitti</em>).</p>
<p>It showcases 20 minutes of community-made games (and demos) available now and coming soon, and even features an entire segment dedicated to Game Builder Garage creations made by the game's community in Japan.</p>
<p>Some of the games here channel Nintendo's IP and there's even a recreation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and many other fan-made surprises. You can see just how far the community has pushed this game-maker in the full video above.</p>
<p>And here's a quick list highlighting some of these games. You can find out more about each project by scanning the QR codes displayed throughout the presentation.</p>

<p>Natsume previously announced it would be releasing a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/harvest_moon_the_lost_valley_and_harvest_moon_skytree_village">Harvest Moon</a> double pack on the Switch at the beginning of this month, but it seems there's been a slight delay.</p>
<p>Instead of the 3rd July 2025 release, it seems farming and life simulation fans will now have to wait until <strong>31st July 2025</strong> for this game to arrive. Natsume didn't reveal the reason behind the delay but did <a href="https://x.com/Natsume_Inc/status/1939746378286039510">issue an apology on social media</a>.</p>
<p>Here it is in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hi, farmers. We are very sorry to share that Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley &amp; Skytree Village will now be released on July 31. We are very excited to bring these 3DS titles to the Switch and hate to make you wait. Thank you for your patience and understanding!"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wzrvkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As mentioned, this two-in-one bundle will contain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/harvest_moon_the_lost_valley_and_harvest_moon_skytree_village">The Lost Valley</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/harvest_moon_the_lost_valley_and_harvest_moon_skytree_village">Skytree Village</a>, which originally debuted on the 3DS. These new versions on Switch will be "optimized" for the system and each game includes the DLC.</p>

On one side, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a> cards are going through a steep correction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Crown Zenith</a> cards are showing early signs of what could be a long-term value surge. The bottom line? If you're a collector or investor, <strong>now is the time to buy into both.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m picking up what I can from both sets. The current dip in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundle-shining-fates-amazon-restock-latest">Sparks</a> is a glimmer of hope for long-suffering 2024-2025 collectors. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-card-packs">Crown Zenith</a> is a train I want to be on before it leaves the station. Let's go into more detail:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/pixel-9-15-1751288444113.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Game Freak / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with Surging Sparks. A handful of top cards have taken noticeable hits in the last few weeks. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJB7d?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Pikachu ex - 247/191</strong></a>, for example, has dropped a whopping 51% since early April, falling from $113.38 to just $56. That’s a steep decline, no doubt, but it's important to put it in context. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re seeing more sealed product become available every week, and as supply rises, prices are naturally correcting. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l37AE?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Hydreigon ex - 240/191</strong></a><strong> </strong>has also taken a 34% hit, now sitting at $49.60, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1ODK?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Milotic ex - 237/191</strong></a> is down 26% to $99. Even the alternate-art <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoGOLg?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Pikachu ex - 238/191</strong></a> is feeling the pressure, dropping 22% to $294.99, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWY75n?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Latias ex - 239/191</strong></a> has slipped 23% to $193.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this isn’t panic selling or lost interest in Surging Sparks, it’s the result of increased availability. Collectors and resellers aren’t willing to overpay for cards that are easier to find. If anything, that creates opportunity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These aren’t bad cards; they’re just correcting from an inflated early market. For anyone who missed the initial wave or hesitated at launch prices, <strong>this correction is your window</strong>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/pixel-9-17-1751289091092.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Game Freak / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Crown Zenith</em> is telling a very different story. Cards from this set, particularly the stunning Secret Rare VSTARs, are starting to heat up. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJn7r?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Giratina VSTAR (Secret) GG69/GG70</strong></a> has jumped 24% this month, climbing from $152.78 to $199.99. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwnAG?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR (Secret)</strong></a> shot up 22% in just a few days, now holding at $84.99.

The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review">Scarlet and Violet</a> era is drawing to a close, and with the Mega Evolution era moving in after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a> sets later this year, we’re about to enter the next generation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That transition turns <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/13/pokemon-sword-and-shield-review">Sword and Shield</a>-era sets like Crown Zenith into the odd category of not-so modern Pokémon cards. If historic price climbs tells us anything, <strong>cards become more valuable two generations out</strong>. We’ve seen this pattern with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-x-y">XY</a> and early <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/15/pokemon-sun-and-moon-review">Sun &amp; Moon</a> sets, and I expect Sword and Shield to follow suit alongside old <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-mega-symphonia-sets-announced-for-2025">Mega Evolution</a> Pokémon.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Sealed Product Price Comparison</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the pricing here by Amazon is insane, but there's some deals to be had when comparing these products to TCG Player. For example, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7YM4?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions Super-Premium Collection</a> is a massive 56% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xEG5?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">market value</a>, so go with Amazon on that one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other end of the scale, TCG Player has <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnm1k?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Premium Collection</a> at a massive 48% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpXZv?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon's current price</a>, which is very close to MSRP. I've compared all the prices in the carousel above, but another pro tip is clicking through to eBay to see if there's any new bargains to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the Scarlet &amp; Violet era winds down with the upcoming <em>Black Bolt</em> and <em>White Flare</em> sets, collectors are already looking backward in anticipation of what’s next—namely, the long-awaited return of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-mega-evolutions-fast-charging-and-a-few-smart-picks">Mega Evolutions</a>.

<p>Part of a new event feat. Aespa</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following its Switch 2 release and the news of "five million global sales", <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> has now announced its latest collab.</p>
<p>It's teaming up with the South Korean K-Pop group Aespa. Fighting fans can expect themed collab items, a limited-time Outfit 4 for Juri, and last but not least the virtual artist and idol Naevis, who will be added to the game as a new commentator.</p>
<p>These collab items will be made available across all versions of the game including the Switch 2 on <strong>4th July 2025</strong>. Juri's new outfit is available for "one year only", so get it while you can.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Starting Friday, July 4, 2025, a special collaboration outfit with aespa will be released as Outfit 4 for Juri, available for one year only!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of this special collaboration, the game's online Battle Hub will also be getting transformed with aespa-themed decorations. And if you log in during this event you can receive special times like new titles, device wallpapers and photo frames.</p>
<p>Last week, Capcom confirmed Sagat would also be returning in August, with his Fighting Pass content scheduled to be made available on the same date as this new collab. Capcom has also revealed its next batch of outfits, which you can take a look at in our previous coverage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Think Peekaboo with bullets.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pubg-blindspot"><u>PUBG: Blindspot</u></a> is a cheeky little <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pubg-battlegrounds"><u>PUBG: Battlegrounds</u></a> spin off that's currently in development, and was playable on the show floor at IGN Live. It's a 5v5 top-down tactical shooter that has a classic team deathmatch mode - one we got hooked on even in the chaos of the gaming show floor - and a Demolition mode, that will see teams using traps and obstacles to outwit the enemy. It's been compared to a top-down Rainbow Six Siege and with good reason: to rack up the kills you're going to need to use your brain as well as your trigger finger. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>1. Think 'Peekaboo with bullets'</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Forget all your FPS muscle memory, this is a top-down strategic PvP game where your cunning is as important as your reaction times. You're dropped into a map full of corners, windows, doorways - basically anything you can think of to make line of sight a key part of gameplay - and you have to hunt down your opponents before they pop one in your back. You can see the whole map, but you'll only see enemies if they're in your cone of vision or your teammates, which sounds simple until someone snipes you through a window while you're focused on the doorway at the end of a corridor. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2. Demolition Mode is on the way </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While we didn't get to play the Demolition Mode, it sounds like a step up in complexity from the 5v5 deathmatch, adding a greater need for planning and teamwork. Production Director Seungmyeong Yang explained more about it at IGN Live. "Demolition Mode can commonly be found in other games such as Counter Strike or Valorant," he said. "In this Demolition Mode there is an attacking team and a defending team, and the defense team basically tries to block the attacking team from coming in and the attacking team tries to breach the building. It was really fun to see how the gamers react, they seem to really enjoy the game!" Demolition Mode is the inspiration for those Rainbow Six Siege comparisons, albeit it from a whole new top-down perspective. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PUBG: Blindspot at IGN Live</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>3. Start your WASD warmups </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The keyboard and mouse controls are more like a twin-stick shooter set up, and it's going to take your brain a second to catch up to how they work. You control movement with WASD and your cone of vision with the mouse, while to aim and fire weapons you hold down the right mouse button. That will slow your movement, though, so it's always a balance between moving quickly to avoid enemy detection and choosing when to take your shots. Once you've mastered that you can focus on being more accurate, using the mouse wheel and keyboard to go for head shots, body shots, or aiming specifically at any crouched enemies. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>4. Character choice is key</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any team game, who you have in your five-person kill crew is going to matter. The build I played had 10 characters to choose from, each with pleasingly distinct looks and loadouts to keep things interesting. I'm not exactly a subtle operative, so I gravitated towards those with weapons that could cause carnage up close and personal, like bearded cowboy Collision, who packs a Winchester 1300 shotgun and booby traps; or Kayak, who has a semi-automatic O12 combat shotgun and a remote sticky bomb. Support players can go for Fanatic with her P90 and First Aid Kid, or sniper Buddy with her scanning drones. Some you might want to play just because of their character designs - I'm not usually one for Toxic Gas Grenades, but Dropdown has a sort of Dystopian Harley Quinn vibe that's hard to resist. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>5. You can play it in August</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no official release date for the full game, but there is a PC beta planned for August. Keep an eye on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/PUBG_BLINDSPOT/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official Steam page</u></a> for updates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial. She's been a professional nerd since 2006 when she got her start on Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK, and has since worked for GamesIndustry.Biz, Rolling Stone and GamesRadar. She loves horror, horror movies, horror games, and French Bulldogs. Those extra wrinkles on her face are thanks to going time blind and staying up too late finishing every sidequest in RPGs like Fallout and Witcher 3.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-pubg-blindspot]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve has added a new performance monitor to Steam that can help you understand why a game may or may not be running smoothly. Not only does it break out a game’s overall frame rate, it can tell you how many of those frames were generated by techniques like Nvidia’s DLSS or AMD’s FSR, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500576552635859540?utm_source=SteamDB">according to a post</a>.</p><p>The change is included as part of an update to the Steam Client that’s available now, though Valve notes that this “first version” focuses on “Windows users and on the most common GPU hardware.”</p><p>The company says the new performance monitor currently offers up to four different levels of detail: a single FPS value, FPS details, CPU and GPU utilization, and “FPS, CPU, GPU &amp; RAM Full Details.” The more you choose to show, the more of your screen will be taken up by the performance monitor.</p><p>Steam previously offered a simple FPS counter, but separating out generated frames from the frames fully rendered by your graphics cores can help you better understand key differences between what you see and how a game feels. “Frame generation can’t help with things like input latency that matter to competitive gamers, but it can make things look visually smoother on today’s high refresh rate monitors,” Valve says <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3462-CD4C-36BD-5767">in a detailed support document</a> about the performance monitor. </p><p>In practice, what that should mean is that you can see whether your game feels like it’s running at just 30 fps because it actually is running at 30 fps inside the game engine, even though you’re seeing a visually smoother image due to Nvidia and AMD’s added “fake frames.” (It’s a whole debate in the PC gaming community, and it appears Valve isn’t taking sides here.) </p><p>Valve has already given handheld gamers a taste of these quick insights by building tools <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud">like MangoHud </a>into the Steam Deck and SteamOS, which similarly let you monitor your CPU, graphics, RAM, and carefully ration out your battery life. But having a way to do so built into desktop Steam will make the insights much more accessible to many more gamers.</p><p>Valve says that it has plans to “add some additional pieces of data to the performance overlay going forward, to detect certain common bad hardware performance scenarios, and to show a larger summary of your game’s performance in the overlay itself when you hit shift-tab.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/695543/valve-steam-performance-monitor-frame-generation-frame-rates]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some video games have been trying to use generative AI for years now,<a href="https://kotaku.com/hawken-reborn-impressions-steam-pc-505-games-mech-1850447998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and for the most part people simply have not been having it</a>. Why would we? It's lazy, it's ugly, it's an ethical black hole and it's being driven by an executive class desperate to lay off even more workers. While earlier and more brazen attempts at employing the tech were obvious, lately it's becoming more common for studios to slide a little AI-generated content in without drawing attention to it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em><a href="https://aftermath.site/jurassic-world-evolution-3-ai-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> launched with some AI-generated character portraits, then got bullied into removing them</a>. <em>Clair Obscur</em>, which will be a lot of people's game of the year, appeared to<a href="https://x.com/nyanomancer/status/1917435885429150176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> quietly launch with some AI-generated art then just as quietly patch it out</a>. I was <em>going </em>to review the city-building grand strategy game <em>Kaiserpunk</em> until I saw they were using AI-generated images for their dialogue sections, after which I promptly uninstalled it.</p><p>The latest culprit is <em>The Alters</em>, which has found to have shipped not only with AI-generated placeholder text in-game, but also employed AI-generated translations in some of its side content as well. None of this was disclosed prior to the game's release; it was all discovered later, by players, and has prompted an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explanation </a>of sorts from the developers which <em>tries </em>to calm everyone down, but which has just made things worse, because if it took people discovering these specific instances to find that 11 Bit had used AI-generated content in the game's development, how do we know there's not more of it?</p><p>This is a HUGE BUMMER.<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-alters-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I really liked this game</a>! And obviously didn't notice any of that on my playthrough, because I never stopped to read those screens and I played the game in English. To which I guess you could say, well, does it really matter if they slipped some AI stuff in there if I didn't notice it? Especially when, as developers 11 Bit <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">say</a>, it only constitutes "0.3%" of the overall text in the game?</p><p>Yes, it fucking does. I am not just against the employment of this tech for obvious, superficial reasons. All generative AI content is built on theft; surely writing some gibberish, or pasting some lorem ipsum, would have been preferable here? And <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying there were "time constraints"</a> involved in rushing AI-generated translations into the game is no excuse, either. Translators are highly skilled workers; using reputable ones costs a studio money, and takes time, but it avoids situations like <em>all</em> <em>this</em>, not to mention it’s just the right and professional thing to do.</p><p>Any studio making use of generative AI is sending a very clear message: they don't care about the cataclysmic effects AI is having on their own industry, they don't care that so much of AI content is slop, they don't care that millions of people out there who are their prospective fans and customers are <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/generative-ai-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wholly opposed</a> to its use. I don't want to write about a game with AI in it, I don't want to support studios that use it and I don't want to spend a second of my time on it.</p><p>What's particularly grating about the situation with <em>The Alters</em>, aside from the fact it's absolutely coloured my enjoyment of what's an otherwise smart and interesting video game, is that the practice is becoming more common and harder to spot, and it’s increasingly just wearing us down.<a href="https://newsocialist.org.uk/transmissions/ai-the-new-aesthetics-of-fascism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Much like the nascent fascism that it has quickly grown to be the representative aesthetic of</a>, it feels like the hope with generative AI is that no matter how much you may hate it, the goal is to bombard you with its horrors and its excesses so frequently that you become numb to it. The more you see of it, the more you'll accept it as normal and the more you'll grow to if not enjoy then at least tolerate it, no matter how reluctantly.</p><p>Where you used to be able to spot generative AI a mile off, we're now needing days and even weeks after release for its use to become known. In some cases you can't even<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> rely on Steam's AI disclaimers</a>, because neither <em>Clair Obscur</em> or <em>The Alters</em> used them. It's getting to the stage where I just can't trust video games, and it means I'm starting to approach every game I play dubiously, every piece of key art and character portrait guilty until proven innocent, clouds hanging over every image and line of dialogue.</p><p>This isn't wearing down my opposition to AI-generated content, but it <em>is</em> wearing me down when it comes to approaching and enjoying video games. It is deeply unhealthy to bring so much scepticism into every new game I play, but if I'm going to take a principled stand here, what choice do I have? I do not want this shit in my games, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/generative-ai-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you don't want it either</a>, and I don't want to play or talk about games that contain it as a result. Yet I just did, and after really liking the game too, and so here I am writing <em>this</em>.

                <p>While getting review-bombed likely felt terrible at the time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> developer Arrowhead has apparently reached the point where it can laugh about the situation. After a long wait, it has finally sent all players a free in-game cape to commemorate the time when the community turned <em>hard</em> against the otherwise very popular game.</p><p>In what might be a first, the cape literally depicts a frequency graph of postive vs. negative reviews during the review-bombing campaign. If you squint at the image in the embed below, you can see that there are small light blue bars at the top of the cape; these are the bars for positive reviews, which are clearly and massively outweighed by the red bars representing the negative reviews. While it was announced <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1801636341362393548" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">over a year ago</a>, the cape is finally out and available for free for all Helldivers 2 players.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1938573095230390728" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">COMMEMORATIVE CAPE ISSUED<br>In honor of their unquestioning commitment to the defense of Managed Democracy, the Helldivers have been awarded a commemorative cape.

In essence, not long after the game launched in early 2024, Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-be-forced-to-link-a-psn-account-sarting-this-month/1100-6523147/" data-ref-id="1100-6523147">attempted to require that PC players create or link a PlayStation Network account</a> to keep playing. As the PC gaming culture tends to look unfavorably on efforts to mandate new accounts or launchers, players were outraged and eventually managed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">to convince Sony and Arrowhead to reverse course</a>.</p><p>This decision caused an intense, albeit short-lived, downturn in Helldivers 2's otherwise stellar reviews, driven by coordinated review-bombing. Following the reversal, players banded together to try to do a review-boosting campaign, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's recent Steam reviews have fully recovered</a>. But the outrage and temporary cratering of the game's reputation seem to have left a strong impression on the developer.</p><p>Arrowhead has had to work hard to build back toward the heady heights of its early days, though. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-update-sees-players-returning-in-droves/1100-6531700/" data-ref-id="1100-6531700">Recent content updates have been received quite well</a>, with peak concurrent players reaching close to 200,000 last month. Having <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/#3y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hit a low point back in April</a>, Helldivers 2 has been reinvigorated by the Heart of Democracy update.</p>

The creatures that dominated Earth ages ago, populating our world for 165 million years, will always be fascinating. And, on screen, as part of movie history, dinosaurs have always been a go-to genre for incredible spectacle and chilling thrills - whether you're into t-rexes, pterodactyls, raptors, or gentle giant brontosauruses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dinosaur movies transport us back in time to the era of these wondrous reptiles, while other instances show dinosaurs living among us, either on a secluded island lost to history or as cloned beings brought back by science for our amusement (and dismemberment). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Jurassic Park/World franchise has raked in over $6 billion in box office bucks over the past 30 years, proving that these glorious beasts can bring home the bacon. But which dinosaur films are the best?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are our picks of the 10 best dinosaur movies, from trampled theme parks to warring prehistoric titans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Looking for more movies featuring giant lizards?</strong> </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dragon-movies">The best dragon movies</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/godzilla-movies-in-order">Godzilla movies in order</a></li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Dinosaur Movies</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Jurassic Park (1993)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/nllhr4ja4wstlcbfb2bbwu-1681955831135.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Um, duh. Yup, not only is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/jurassic-park">Spielberg's Jurassic Park</a> one of the best "dinosaur movies ever," it easily doubles as one of the "best movies ever." Adapted from Michael Crichton's novel (and <em>second</em> story about a futuristic amusement park gone lethally haywire), Jurassic Park is endlessly entertaining and infinitely quotable, providing equal parts laughter and horror. Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum star in this tyrannosaurus-sized tale about scientists evaluating a - er - unique family attraction before it opens to the public. Hold onto your butts, because this appraisal winds up with a body count.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">See our guide on how to watch the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-park-movies-in-order">Jurassic Park movies in order</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Jurassic World (2015)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/chris-pratt-bryce-dallas-howard-jurassic-world-1681955850181.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More than 20 years after the original Jurassic Park (which wound up becoming a trilogy), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/jurassic-park-iv">Jurassic World</a> kicked off a new segment of the franchise, with greedy corporations and opportunistic scientists learning nothing from previous tragedies and opening "Jurassic World" to patrons everywhere. Naturally, things go horribly awry and carnage ensues and Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard anchor a budding dino-apocalypse. The films would eventually bring back the original three stars but the first World installment stands tall as a formulaic but fun feast for the senses.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Land Before Time (1988)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/we-1681955967848.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, this Don Bluth animated classic blossomed into a decades-spanning franchise featuring 13 sequels, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/the-land-before-time">several video games</a>, and a TV series. The story of a young orphaned dinosaur named Littlefoot, who embarks on a great journey to find a paradise called the Great Valley, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-land-before-time">The Land Before Time</a> is a beautifully animated '80s staple. The saga teaches kids about the importance of friendship, the dangers of prejudice, and the power of hope. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Dinosaur (2000)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/s-1681956084110.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Buena Vista Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/dinosaur">Disney's Dinosaur</a>, the company's 39th animated feature, finds a lot in common with The Land Before Time as it also follows a young orphaned dino, this time on a trek to discover to the idyllic Nesting Grounds after a meteor shower devastates their island. A mix of live-action, many of the backgrounds were filmed on location while the dinos themselves were computer-generated, making it the most expensive computer-animated film at the time. Voiced by D.B. Sweeney, Julianna Margulies, Alfre Woodard, Ossie Davis, Joan Plowright, and Hayden Panettiere.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Good Dinosaur (2015)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/nycu8byhvifswllfwdyd-1681956104324.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Walt Disney Studios</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though it's technically the first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ranking-pixar-movies">Pixar film</a> to not quite meet profitable expectations, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-good-dinosaur">The Good Dinosaur</a> is wacky, charming family entertainment, supplemented by the voices of Sam Elliott, Anna Paquin, Jeffrey Wright, and three-time Oscar-winner Frances McDormand. Like most animated dino films, the story involves a thrilling, meaningful journey, though this time it's within an alternate history where reptilian dinosaurs never went extinct. In The Good Dinosaur, a shy Apatosaurus, Arlo, meets an unlikely human friend while traveling through a dangerous and mysterious landscape in order to return home.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>King Kong (1933)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/movie-king-kong-1933-wallpaper-preview-1681956195912.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: RKO Radio Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Most King Kong films are good for a ravenous dino or two, so why not revisit the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/king-kong-1933">1933 original</a> and watch humans discover Skull Island, home of not only Kong but prehistoric life of all kinds: including the Tyrannosaurus-rex, the Stegosaurus, the Pteranodon, and more. King Kong is a classic, famous for being a true spectacle at the time with game-changing special effects, from stop-motion pioneer Willis O'Brien. Kong is still thriving today, as part of Legendary's MonsterVerse, with the latest entry, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/godzilla-x-kong-the-new-empire">Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</a>, worth checking out too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Kong: Skull Island (2017)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/21/ymvm3eiygs303nvwjl0n-1682103563791.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Warner Bros.

Jackson, and John Goodman as a part of a mix of scientists, soldiers, and scholars trapped on Kong's dreaded isle of terrifying creatures. In a twist though, the island's usual dinosaurs have been beaten and eaten by new giant monsters, unique to the film and the MonsterVerse itself. And it totally works. Separating itself from the Jurassic Park/World franchise, Kong: Skull Island gave viewers a fresh batch of nightmare fuel to fawn over.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>One Million Years BC (1966)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/one-million-archelon-1681956482588.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Warner-Pathé Distributors</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This '60s British fantasy-adventure, from Hammer Films, starred Raquel Welch as a cavewoman struggling to survive in a fictional past where humans and dinosaurs coexisted. A remake of a film from 1940, One Million Years BC is a largely enjoyable, kitschy featuring dinosaurs (and giant sea-turtles) roaming a scortched Earth, brought to life by stop-motion genius, and Willis H. O'Brien apprentice, Ray Harryhausen (Jason and the Argonauts, Clash of the Titans).</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Valley Of Gwangi (1969)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/ew-1681956529069.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Warner Bros.-Seven Arts</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Harryhausen home run was cult dino-Western, The Valley Of Gwangi, as the stop-motion pro took over the project from mentor Willis O'Brien after O'Brien passed away before production. The story itself was conceived by O'Brien and combined cowboys and dinosaurs as a rodeo horse is revealed to be a fifty million-year-old, prompting members of a Wild West show to venture into Mexico's Forbidden Valley in search of fame and untold wealth. There, however, they confront prehistoric monsters, including "Gwangi," a giant dinosaur that decimates their ranks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Land of the Lost (2009)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/90-1681956714215.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Ferrell and Danny McBride turn a 1970s Sid and Marty Krofft TV series (which itself got a short-lived '90s revival) into a comedic romp in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/land-of-the-lost">Land of the Lost</a>, where a mysterious vortex sucks a disgraced scientist (Ferrell), his assistant (Anna Friel), and a survivalist Will (McBride) into a world populated by marauding dinosaurs and fantastically bizarre creatures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's it for our pick of the best dinosaur movies of all time.

He further explained that “A New Dawn” was “just the beginning” and that at this year’s <em>Halo </em>WC, the team “look(s) forward to continuing the conversation.”</p><p>“Speculation is always fun, but if you want the official scoop on what Halo Studios has been working on, you won’t want to miss this year’s<em> Halo </em>World Championship,” said Tashi. “We really hope you’ll join us in Seattle this October!”</p><p>So <em>Halo </em>might be coming to PS5. There might be a remake of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> happening. There might be more to share beyond that. But we have to wait until October to find out. Ironically Tashi’s post, meant to address speculation, will likely lead to even <em>more </em>speculation<em> </em>and rumors appearing online. October can’t come soon enough. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/halo-wc-october-remake-remaster-news-trailer-rumor-xbox-1851785384]]></content:encoded>

Now, a fan has released a new Oblivion Remastered mod that gives players a Glock they use to shoot up Cyrodiil's creatures. You can see it in action in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9CRpe6UlEE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b9CRpe6UlEE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A user going by CosmicBoogaloo posted the Oblivion Remastered Glock mod on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4681" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>, and humorously added, "Mehrunes Dagon owes me some money and I'm gonna get it one way or another."</p><p>CosmicBoogaloo went on to explain that the mod was created by making changes to the game's archery system to mold the shape of the weapon. But it took a second mod--Dicene's <a href="https://github.com/dicene/OblivionMods" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SlickArchery</a>--to reproduce the rapid fire of a gun. From there, bullets were swapped in for arrows, gun sound effects were added, and there's even a holster for the gun.</p><p>To use the Glock mod, players will have to download a few additional mods including <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UE4SS for ObRem</a>, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UE4SS TesSyncMapInjector</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1331" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Runtime EditorIDs</a>. CosmicBoogaloo also recommends adding <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NL_Tag Remover</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/3098" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Auto-Hide Gear</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dicene/OblivionMods" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Returning Arrows</a> for a smoother experience. For the future, CosmicBoogaloo notes that "more NPC gun replacements are planned," which presumably means they'll be packing heat as well.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-gets-its-first-update-with-a-whole-bunch-of-fixes/1100-6532121/" data-ref-id="1100-6532121">first update for Oblivion Remastered</a> arrived earlier this month, and fixed a number of issues with the game. So far, Oblivion Remastered is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">the third-highest-selling game in the US</a> of 2025, with only <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> ahead of it as the No. 1 and No. 2 games, respectively. The response to Oblivion Remastered has been so positive that even Skyrim Grandma, aka Shirley Curry, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrim-grandma-ends-streaming-retirement-to-play-oblivion-remastered/1100-6531994/" data-ref-id="1100-6531994">came out of her streaming retirement</a> to play the game.</p>

Conceived by visionary psychologist Mark Tyburn, Daisy's Ark was eventually canceled following a pattern of "unexpected and disturbing results." A decade later, the project is unearthed and development resumes.</p></div>                      </div><p>As mentioned, the book is adapted from the narrative audio series of the same name. The series debuted last June and ran for 12 episodes. Each episode features an ensemble cast of performers, including The Walking Dead's Andrew Lincoln, Shamier Anderson, and Paterson Joseph. You can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/A-Better-Paradise/dp/B0D487TCVW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">listen to the audio series for free</a> on podcast services.</p><p>The novel version of A Better Paradise expands the narrative by providing more background on the early days of Tyburn Industria's video game project and the people who made it.</p><p>As the title suggests, this is the first novel in a series by Houser. It's unclear how many volumes are planned, but we do know A Better Paradise will eventually be home to a real video game. The first game set in A Better Paradise's universe is in development at Absurd Ventures.</p><hr><h3>Novels about video games and game studios:</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4523489-tomorrowandtomorrowandtomorrow.png" data-ref-id="1300-4523489" data-ratio="0.50909090909091" data-width="1100" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4523489-tomorrowandtomorrowandtomorrow.png" data-ref-id="1300-4523489"></a><figcaption>Novels about video games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4523489-tomorrowandtomorrowandtomorrow.png"></figure><p>If you're interested in reading more fiction centered around games and the people who make them, check out the list of novels below.

                <p>We finally know what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a> looks like. On the heels of several extensive written overviews of the game's changes and additions, EA Sports has published a first look at CFB 26's gameplay.</p><p>In a new 17-minute video, EA gives an overview of some of the core mechanics updates that are coming to CFB 26. Among the highlights is a discussion of dynamic substitution, which allows you to substitute players on the fly, providing more flexibility in between plays and reducing the need to go into main menus. On defense, you can also now adjust safety alignments right before the snap, providing the ability to temporarily change to more of a "prevent" defense (to take away deep passes) or play more aggressively, closer to the line of scrimmage.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ua9AZ66C1tQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ua9AZ66C1tQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>EA also provides more depth about how it is overhauling quarterback play from last year's game. The developer is emphasizing more realism and accuracy in how it represents different throwing motions; as many quarterbacks have quite distinctive mechanics in the real world, EA explains that enhancing the accuracy was crucial in improving the game's presentation. Additionally, quarterback height is now taken into account; shorter quarterbacks will need to more carefully throw through lanes, while taller quarterbacks can more safely throw over the top of linemen.</p><p>Players who enjoy taking control of defense backs and playing in pass protection will notice some changes, as well. EA explains that there are refinements coming to the hit-stick options and animations for when defensive players are contesting catches in mid-air. In addition, defensive players will get worn down and lose effectiveness when they fail to successfully execute a hit-stick pass breakup.</p><p>There's a lot more detail contained in the video, which you can check out in the embed above. In addition to these gameplay mechanics, EA is also significantly expanding features related to school spirit and traditions. More schools will have their unique run-outs and band formations featured, there'll be a larger roster of mascots, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cfb-26-adds-the-internets-favorite-mascot-the-pop-tart/1100-6532658/" data-ref-id="1100-6532658">the Pop-Tart Bowl's edible mascot will even be included</a>.</p><p>CFB 26's release date is rapidly approaching; it comes out on July 10, but people who preorder special editions of the game can get access three days early. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-26-preorder-bonus-ps5-xbox-series-x-releases-july-10/1100-6531106/" data-ref-id="1100-6531106">Check out our preorder guide</a> for all the info on the different versions you can buy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Rematch</a>, Sloclap's new football game, is already a huge hit for the independent French developer, with more than 1 million copies sold and over 3 million unique players jumping in to try the game days after it launched.</p>
<p>Part of its success comes down to how accessible it is, whether you're a football veteran or a newcomer to the pitch. With no fouls, offsides, or practically any of the regular rules of football that exist in professional play, it's easy for anyone to pick up the game and start running the ball to the net.</p>
<p>If you are a newcomer though, you might want a few tips to help you score a goal or two so you can secure the win before the game's clock winds down.</p>
<p>This guide will take you through five beginner-focused tips that will help lead you to the winner's circle practically every time.</p>
<h2>Rematch - A Beginner's Guide To Winning</h2>
<h3>Pass the ball.</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Realistically, based on how I see the Rematch community playing when I jump into a game, whether it's a ranked match or not, this whole guide could just be the words 'pass the ball' repeated again and again.</p>
<p>It's become <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rematch/comments/1lhwe8s/please_just_pass_the_damn_ball/">a meme within the game's community</a> that players try to rainbow kick around every opposing player, and are seemingly shocked when it doesn't work out two or three times in a row, leading to a scoring chance for the other team.</p>
<p>Passing is a fundamental element of team sports, football being absolutely no exception to that fact. Even in an arcade version of the game, where the ball bounces off a holographic wall and lightning bolts shoot out of your feet when you hit that 'extra-effort' button to run a little faster, passing is still paramount to how you play the game.</p>
<p>Passing can help you move the ball forward by sending the ball towards your teammate who is open ahead of you on the pitch. It can give you a wide-open net to shoot at by forcing the keeper out of position. It can help you maintain possession and control the pace of the game by passing to a teammate behind you.</p>
<p>You can do more with your teammates than without them. Pulling off a solo-effort where you make the other team look foolish and cap it off with an acrobatic goal via rainbow flick or other means can make for a nice clip, but you'll be unsuccessful more often than not. And it'll never look as smooth as a great passing play where multiple players touch the ball before it hits the mesh.</p>
<p>If you're not able to see where your teammates are because of where your camera is pointing, try to glance at the mini-map in the bottom corner of your screen to get a sense of where they could be. Hogging the ball is more likely to lead to a turnover, with the opposing team heading the other way. At least if you try to pass, even if it misses, you'll have an opportunity to keep possession and direct the flow of the game.</p>
<h3>Crank your FOV to the max</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>A simple way to give yourself a better chance at winning on the pitch is being able to see more of the game. Adjusting your FOV slider to the max does just that. Sloclap's commitment to its focused, third-person gameplay means you won't be able to see the whole pitch, but if your running up the side and have your camera angled slightly in front of you, you'll be able to see the majority of half the field.</p>
<h3>Use the boards (walls)</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Part of Rematch's arcade elements is the fact that the whole pitch is encased in invisible holographic walls. These are there partly for show, since you can unlock customization features for them, but they're also a key element of gameplay.</p>
<p>'Use the boards' is a mantra I heard time and again growing up playing hockey, and now that there's a version of football that has walls that serve the same function, it's just as viable here. There's even an achievement for passing it off the wall to a teammate to get a goal.</p>
<p>That's the obvious way to use the walls for offense, but don't forget them when playing defense as well. If you're chasing the ball into the corner on your side, launching it high and off the wall towards the opposing teams side can take the pressure off and give you a chance to recover if you're trying to wind down the clock or just put an end to heavy offensive pressure that's gone on too long.</p>
<h3>Manage your stamina for offense and defense</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>As much as Rematch is an arcade football game, it's not so arcade-y that you can sprint for infinity across the pitch. You have a stamina meter you have to watch, and just holding down the sprint button will leave you out of breath and unable to help your team, no matter the situation.</p>
<p>That's why it's important to watch your stamina and to use your 'extra-effort' sprint as tactically as you can. For example, you'd be smart to use your extra-effort sprint after moving the ball up the field to your teammate, in order to be ready in a scoring position for a potential cross or rebound.</p>
<p>Likewise, you'd also be smart to use the extra-effort sprint if there's suddenly no one on defense and the ball is quickly turned over and going the other way. In either scenario, you're better off using it when you <strong>don't have the ball</strong>. When you do have the ball, activating that extra-effort sprint will cause you to lose control as you kick the ball ahead of you. If you don't press the A/X button to dribble the ball, you run the risk of accidentally running past the ball and losing possession.</p>
<p>Use your regular sprint when you have the ball and want to maintain control. If you want to give some space between yourself and an opposing player, you can use your extra effort to kick the ball ahead of you, to set up a pass or a shot with your next touch.</p>
<p>You also don't have to use your slide tackle at every turn, and not using it constantly will help keep your positioning and keep your stamina bar full for when you need to use it in more desperate situations. Holding the left trigger on your controller to be in defensive mode, and just tapping the B/O button will help you keep your positioning and prepare you to stop a player from trying to just rainbow kick the ball over your head.</p>
<h3>Practice</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Lastly, the best thing to do to help you win as many matches as possible is to just practice. The prologue and the practice section of the menu have drills that can help you master different skills in the game, and while those can be helpful, it's also important to take some time in the free play mode you get into from the main menu, to run around the pitch and work on your skills.</p>
<p>Work on your dives as a goalie by firing the ball above the net against the wall and diving towards it. Do the same outside of the keeper's box to practice the timing of your touches and corralling the ball as it comes towards you. It's not ideal that you have to essentially make up your own drills to practice scenarios you'd face in a game, but that's the state of play for the moment. For now, we can only hope that Sloclap will add a better practice mode and better drills in the future.</p>
<hr>
<p>Following these five tips and guidelines in Rematch will help you win nearly every game in Rematch. It's not a guarantee, of course, but after all, it's football, not rocket science. Passing, playing good defense, and making good use of your environment will lead to strong scoring chances and the chance for you to boot the ball into the back of the net for a goal. See you on the pitch!</p>

I know I struggled at first trying to understand what was different or better. Luckily, it’s easier than you think! Let’s go over Alpha, Beta, and the new Gamma armors.</p><h2 id="h654"><a id=""></a>Alpha vs Beta Armor</h2><p>Aside from a handful of armor sets, most have an Alpha set and a Beta set. Discerning the differences between the two can be hard at first glance. Although they have slightly altered colors, that doesn’t matter as you can customize your armor pigments. They even share the same defense and resistance values.</p><p>Skills and slots are where the armor types differ the most. <strong>Alpha armor will give you more preset equipment skills, while Beta armor will instead give you extra and/or higher-level Decoration slots.</strong> Beta pieces are the preferred option for creating a custom build. If you don’t have any worthwhile decoration pieces for your proposed build or simply don’t enjoy going super in-depth with these mechanics, sticking with Alpha can be a viable option. As an example, let’s compare the same Rey Dau armor piece across both variants:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Rey Sandgreaves Alpha:</strong> Provides a single level-three Decoration slot and both Latent Power and Maximum Might as level-one skills</li><li><strong>Rey Sandgreaves Beta:</strong> Provides a single level-three Decoration slot, two level-one Decoration slots, and the Latent Power skill at level-one</li></ul><p>You’ll receive a different Group Skill depending on which set you use. Rey Dau Alpha Armor has the <em>Inspiration</em> Group Skill, while the Beta Armor has the <em>Resuscitate</em> Group Skill. Both of these do have the same Armor Set Bonus Skill with <em>Rey Dau’s Voltage</em>.</p><h2 id="h655"><a id=""></a>Is Gamma Armor Better?</h2><figure id="" data-id="817ca5fd2a9b4f48309f1027a69c2432" data-recommend-id="image://817ca5fd2a9b4f48309f1027a69c2432" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Forge/Upgrade Armor screen, showing a hunter in Rey Dau Gamma armor and highlighting the Rey Sandgreaves Gamma piece." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Forge/Upgrade Armor screen, showing a hunter in Rey Dau Gamma armor and highlighting the Rey Sandgreaves Gamma piece." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="817ca5fd2a9b4f48309f1027a69c2432" data-recommend-id="image://817ca5fd2a9b4f48309f1027a69c2432" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Forge/Upgrade Armor screen, showing a hunter in Rey Dau Gamma armor and highlighting the Rey Sandgreaves Gamma piece." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Depending on the monster, you might have more armor options than just Alpha or Beta. Arch-Tempered monsters, for example, can reward you with a unique material to forge Gamma Armor. The only example of this so far is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762">Arch-Tempered Rey Dau</a></span>, so we’ll be using that monster’s set to estimate what’s different.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ Electric Wyvern Is Harder To Beat IN Its New Form, But It Can Be Done</a></span></p><p><strong>Gamma Armor can best be described as a set that stands out with higher defense values, higher-level equipment skills, and a brand-new Group Skill.</strong> Let’s go over how it changes the same leg piece that we compared before:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Rey Sandgreaves Gamma:</strong> Provides eight more defense, a single level-three Decoration slot, the Stun Resistance skill at level three, and the Stamina Surge skill at level two.</li></ul><p>It seem like Beta Armor is still the best for personal builds. If you love to get into the nitty-gritty of customizing decoration slots, I can’t argue with that. However, I will point out that the entire Rey Dau Gamma Armor set still has the same equipment skills as the prior versions. They even match the highest levels or exceed them from either set. The only difference is that they’re spread out differently among the five pieces.</p><p>Even though the enhanced defense and skills are great, one of Gamma Armor’s will always give you more options. Pairing pieces from Alpha and Beta sets can feel pretty monotonous since they share the same equipment skills. Gamma Armor genuinely feels different due to the mixed skill placements, allowing for more variance with entirely separate pieces or even some from the beta set. I know I’ve had a lot of fun running a mix of Gamma and Beta Rey Dau armor.</p><p>It all depends on how you like to play at the end of the day. Some hunters like using precise skills, and others just like seeing big damage numbers. Choose the pieces that fit you best and have some fun!</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-armor-alpha-beta-gamma-arch-1851785351]]></content:encoded>

Specifically, the text includes the line, "Sure, here's a revised version focusing purely on scientific and astronomical data:" followed by a Captain's log, which suggests that someone prompted an AI for the text and forgot to delete the AI's lead-in response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the English-language version of the game, that was the end of it. However, players of other language versions <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:o7fzbrxgcaoek5sjkxq3acq3/post/3lsm3lzvb3s2b" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">began to point out</a> that some of the game's translations include lines like, "Sure! Here is the translated text into Brazilian Portuguese.", suggesting that 11 Bit Studios had used generative AI to localize at least some portion of the game. The Alters does not include a disclosure on its Steam page stating that it includes generative AI, which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve makes mandatory</a> for all games that use the technology.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement sent via email to IGN and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published across social platforms</a>, 11 Bit Studios offered an explanation for the generative AI text and translations. The studio explained that the Captain's Log text was intended as a placeholder and simply got missed during final release, and that no other such instances appear in the game. As for the localization, 11 Bit says that generative AI translations were limited to a few cutscenes added very late in development that needed last-minute translations, and that it always intended to replace them with professional translations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the studio's statement, in full:</p><blockquote>We’ve seen a wide range of accusations regarding the use of AI-generated content in The Alters, and we feel it’s important to clarify our approach and give you more context. AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary WIPs during the development process and in a very limited manner. Our team has always prioritized meaningful, handcrafted storytelling as one of the foundations of our game.</blockquote><blockquote>During production, an AI-generated text for a graphic asset, which was meant as a piece of background texture, was used by one of our graphical designers as a placeholder. This was never intended to be part of the final release. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game. We have since conducted a thorough review and confirmed that this was an isolated case, and the asset in question is being updated. </blockquote><blockquote>For transparency, we’ve included a screenshot to show how and where it appears in the game. While we do not want to downplay the situation, we also want to clearly show its limited impact on your gaming experience.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition to that, a few licensed movies that the alters can watch in the social area of the base were added at the final stage of development. While those were externally produced, our team was not involved in the creative process, and these required additional last-minute translations. Due to extreme time constraints, we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localized using AI to have them ready on launch. It was always our intention to involve our trusted translation agencies after release as part of our localization hotfix, to ensure those texts would be handled with the same care and quality as the rest of the game. That process is now underway, and updated translations are being implemented.</blockquote><blockquote>To give you a better understanding of what a small part of the overall scope of the game’s narrative layer they are, those few external movies are approximately 10k words out of 3.4 million across all languages in the game, or just 0.3% of the overall text. The alternative was to release those specific dialogues in English only, which we believed would be a worse experience for non-English speakers. In hindsight, we acknowledge this was the wrong call. Even more so, no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know. </blockquote><blockquote>As AI tools evolve, they present new challenges and opportunities in game development. We’re actively adapting our internal processes to meet this reality. But above all, we remain committed to transparency in how we make our games. We appreciate your understanding and continued support as we work towards that goal.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">11 Bit Studios is just the latest company to come under fire for generative AI usage. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-no-longer-includes-generative-ai-portraits-following-fan-backlash">Just last week</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 developer Frontier Developments had to walk back its use of generative AI characters portraits after widespread criticism. Activision has been skewered repeatedly for its generative AI use, including recent examples of an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-once-again-under-fire-over-alleged-generative-ai-use-now-for-a-fake-guitar-hero-game">ad for a Guitar Hero game that doesn't exist</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">certain Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assets.</a> Other games, such as Palworld, have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood">accused of using generative AI</a> but have gone to great lengths to prove the accusations were unfounded and that no generative AI was used.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of generative AI usage, we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-alters-review">gave The Alters an 8/10 in our review</a>, calling it "a highly atmospheric sci-fi character study mixed with simple but effective resource and base management that cleverly builds existential and interpersonal pressure throughout its story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
