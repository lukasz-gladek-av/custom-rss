He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Fortnite’s</em> new <em>Star Wars</em>-themed season will add new locations, weapons, skins, vehicles, and even new Force powers to the game when it kicks off on Friday, <a href="http://fortnite.com/news/strap-in-starfighter-star-wars-is-taking-over-in-fortnite-galactic-battle">according to a blog post</a>.</p><p>The <em>Fortnite</em> island’s new <em>Star Wars</em> spots include a First Order base, a smuggler hub called the Outpost Enclave, a Resistance base with X-Wings, and a dedicated location where you can find Darth Vader Samurai (a <a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Vader_Samurai">real and very good skin</a> in the game). The locations seem like they’ll be worth dropping at; you’ll be able to fly the X-Wings, for example, and defeating Darth Vader Samurai in battle will net you a red lightsaber and a Force power that lets you throw it.</p><p>Speaking of Force powers, a hologram of Rey will also be on the island, and she can give you a Force push power. Find the hologram of Emperor Palpatine and you can get Force lightning. If you want to actually <em>play</em> as <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Sidious">Sheev Palpatine</a>, he’ll be one of the skins you can unlock in the season’s battle pass, which also includes Poe Dameron and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/656281/general-grievous-is-coming-to-fortnite">General Grievous</a>.</p><p>Throughout the season, Epic will make changes to the map like adding more <em>Star Wars</em> characters to find or letting you use a Star Destroyer’s turbolaser to blast your opponents. And on June 7th, there will be a live, in-game event where players will “take the fight to Emperor Palpatine.”</p><div><p>The new season, first teased <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/651258/fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle-darth-jar-jar-binks">in April</a>, will also feature <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-darth-jar-jar-theory-explained/">Darth Jar Jar</a>. It all builds upon <em>Fortnite’s</em> previous <em>Star Wars</em> tie-ins, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20966222/fortnite-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-crossover-event-stormtroopers">many</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21019726/fortnite-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-rey-finn-sith-trooper-skins-buy-now">other</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24148086/may-the-fortnite-be-with-you">skins</a> and the debut of an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/13/21020843/fortnite-star-wars-the-rise-of-sykwalker-clip-exclusive-premiere-risky-reels">exclusive clip of <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em></a> before the movie hit theaters.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s release date remains a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xbox-stop-trying-to-make-silksong-happen-its-not-going-to-happen">shitpost</a>, beyond that it'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-release-date-confirmed-for-2025">fall in 2025</a>, but we do at least now know that you'll be able to play it in September, as long as you go to one particular museum in Melbourne, Australia. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The museum in question is the National Museum of Screen Culture, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-in-september-2025-at-an-australian-museum">IGN</a>. A playable version of Team Cherry's long-awaited <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> will apparently be on display there from September 18th, together with materials from the game's development. Will the exhibited version be the finished version, and if so, can we assume that Silksong will be on sale before then? Reader, your guess is as good as mine. Team Cherry do love to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-has-been-delayed-because-its-gotten-quite-big">lead their fans a merry dance</a>. There are gods and oceans more knowable than Team Cherry. There are fairy queens less fey. Mind you, it doesn't help that people keep coming up with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unless-this-cake-is-lying-to-you-silksong-will-reappear-in-april">conspiracy theories about cake</a>.
</p>
<p>
Silksong will form part of an exhibition called Game Worlds, which features levels from 30 games including World Of Warcraft, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neopets">Neopets</a>. Co-curators Bethan Johnson and Jini Maxwell have this to say: "From the hundreds of sprites that animate Hornet's different movements and attacks, to the logic behind the game's most challenging boss fights - and of course, having the game playable in-gallery - our Silksong displays delve deeply into the details of the game's artistic direction and design. We're so grateful to Team Cherry for trusting us with their work, and so excited to share that work with you!"

They've also shared the above sheet of the aforesaid hundreds of sprite animations. I'm pretty sure my body isn't capable of that many sprites. I risk putting my hip out if I go over 30. Anyway, I wonder how many <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> players are even now booking airline tickets. Perhaps the secret agenda here is to get more gamers into museums?

It’s not clear how much of the price increases can be blamed on tariffs in the U.S. versus Microsoft trying to capitalize on Nintendo’s high price for the Switch 2 and recently breaking the $80 seal with <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Microsoft declined to comment on whether prices might come back down in the U.S. if President Trump abandons his trade war with China.</p><p>The news led “thanks Nintendo” to start trending on X today as some people blamed the Switch 2 maker for getting the ball rolling on higher prices at the start of its next console generation, while others pointed out that the bulk of gaming price hikes in the U.S. from both companies are the fault of tariffs alone. It also seems like only a matter of time before Sony follows suit, though it recently confirmed <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> will remain $70 in an April blog post, with pre-orders set to begin on May 2. Will it change its mind or take the opportunity to have one of the more competitively priced blockbusters this holiday season?</p><figure id="" data-id="83bcd5d698ddcaa87f09ae784dc211aa" data-recommend-id="image://83bcd5d698ddcaa87f09ae784dc211aa" data-format="png" data-width="720" data-height="615" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A post talks about game prices going up because of tariffs.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Xbox pricing changes are especially jarring for fans who have seen the PlayStation competitor more or less captivate this generation and seen Microsoft porting some of its biggest franchises to PS5 and Switch. <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> just arrived there this week, plus <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> are all day-and-date on multiple platforms. Once <em>Halo</em>, <em>Gears of War</em>, or<em> Starfield</em> make the jump, the prospect of paying $600 for a five-year old console with limited exclusives will be a tougher sell than ever. </p><p>Even before the Trump tariffs went into effect, the price of gaming has steadily risen throughout this console generation, due to inflation and ballooning game budgets. Sony had already raised the price of the all-digital PS5 by $50 and and subscription services like Game Pass have had multiple cost increases. It’s the first hardware cycle in memory where being there on launch day was actually <em>cheaper</em> than waiting a few years. </p><p>And what does that mean for the next Xbox and PS6? Will they be $600-700 at launch? Will new games cost closer to $100? Or will the higher cost of entry simply drive more players to cheaper alternatives like mobile and cloud gaming while sinking more time into free-to-play hangouts like<em> Fortnite </em>and <em>Roblox</em>? </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

physical games as a problem regardless. "Even when a cartridge does contain data on day one of release, games are so often patched, updated and expanded through downloads that the cart very often loses its connection to the game, and functions more like a physical copy protection dongle for a digital object," said Newman, who's also a professor at Bath Spa University in England.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has pointed out that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/">Game-Key cards aren't tied to any account</a>. That means you can actually share the cartridges with friends or even trade them into stores. An internet connection is needed at first to download the game, but afterward one isn't required as long as the cartridge is inserted into the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">There is clearly concern about how long Game-Key cards will work in the future, especially considering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u-eshop-stores-will-shut-down-march-2023/1100-6500734/">Nintendo closed down the 3DS and Wii U eShops</a> in early 2023. However, keep in mind that players can still re-download content they already purchased on those systems--and that goes all the way back to <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/27560/~/wii-shop-channel-discontinuation" rel="nofollow ">the Wii Shop currently</a>. So there is precedent that Game-Key cards will work for 15-plus years, though only Nintendo can control that.</p><p dir="ltr">Switch 2 is set to launch June 5 for $450 in the US. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">System preorders are sold out, but games and accessories are available</a> at major retailers.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> Season 25 has announced Prodigy, the 25th season of Respawn's battle royale, which introduces a brand new bow-toting Legend called Sparrow. Additionally, Arenas make a return, the Bocek gets some love and Pathfinder receives a few buffs. There are also a couple of ranked updates on the way.</p>
<p>This news comes amid a week of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-lays-off-over-300-employees-cancels-new-titanfall-game">layoffs that have impacted numerous EA studios</a>, including team members who worked on Apex Legends at developer Respawn. Incredibly, the writer of the game's new Legend introduced in this update, was among those impacted, just days before today's announcement that showcases their work.</p>
<p>Apex Legends' Sparrow will be the first archer to grace the games and, for the first two weeks of the season, everyone can test out this new addition for themselves. If you want to keep Sparrow, however, you will need to complete the set challenges to have him permanently added to your roster.</p>
<p>Sparrow, like all Legends, has three abilities unique to him. His Tactical ability is 'Tracker Dart', which will highlight and reveal any nearby enemies. Sparrow's passive is the self-explanatory 'Double Jump', meanwhile. Finally, his Ultimate ability is 'Stinger Bolt', which lets Sparrow hit multiple enemies at once with six energy blasts in a row, meaning if two squads try to cross you, they'll all become targets at the mercy of your Ultimate.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Respawn</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Speaking of Legends, Pathfinder has seen some changes to bring him back into the Fight. The cooldown for his Tactical ability 'Grapple Hook' now has a 15-30 seconds cooldown and Zipline Zen returns with a 50 percent increased damage reduction. That's not all though, he's got new upgrades to make use of too. You can trade a Double Tactical Charge for the Variable Grapple cooldown, and a Double Ultimate Charge has been added too.</p>
<p>Arenas make a return this season, with three-versus-three fast-paced battles and a new one-on-one Arena: Duels mode coming later. As in previous Arena appearances, your team of Legends needs to win a total of three rounds first to be dubbed the winners.</p>
<p>As for the game's weapons, the Bocek has been boosted with the ability to add Frag Grenades, then energise the weapon to create Explosive Arrows that detonate on impact. The Bocek also returns to ground loot for season 25, but there’s a catch - there’s no ammunition to be found on the ground.  To reload it, you’ll need to collect arrows from deathboxes of deceased players or, if brave enough, grab arrows that have been fired by another Bocek user.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Respawn</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finally, ranked players will see a brand new ranked ladder for Prodigy and climbing the ladder won't affect regular ranked progression. Players can progress through the Leaderboard for different rewards by taking part in normal ranked matches this season.</p>
<p>Apex Legends Prodigy launches on Tuesday, 6th May 2025 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/video-game-predictions-for-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-half-life-to-return-major-ubisoft-changes/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was first revealed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c">six years ago</a> now, in 2019, two years after the original Hollow Knight came out and set a new standard for 2D Metroidvanias. Since then, players have been keenly waiting for any news about the coming sequel, and when we'd finally get the chance to play it.</p>
<p>If you're incredibly keen, you might get your first chance to play it this coming September 18, 2025, because a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-in-september-2025-at-an-australian-museum">IGN</a> has confirmed that it will be playable by then. As part of an exhibit inside a museum in Australia, that is.</p>
<p>Australia's National Museum of Screen Culture, ACMI, is hosting a game-focused exhibit in September called Game Worlds, which will include a playable build of Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>
<p>The hope now, is that this news means that it'll be playable outside of an Australian museum by then. Surely it wouldn't be available in this museum's exhibit, and not already be out everywhere in the world, right?</p>
<p>It would be a strange situation if that ended up being the case, but it feels very unlikely. We know that developer Team Cherry is targeting a 2025 launch, so then the museum exhibit's September 18 date means we should be looking at a release date for Silksong arriving at least a little before that.</p>
<p>It could arrive in August, or perhaps the exhibit will be part of Silksong's launch. Team Cherry is based in Southern Australia, so it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if the studio wanted to put its home on the map a little more with the launch of one of the world's most anticipated indie games.</p>
<p>If a summer release date is what we have to look forward to, then that means we could be looking at a Summer Game Fest release date reveal. Not that Silksong needs a larger event around it to bring eyes to any news about the game, but it would fit the kind of big reveals Geoff Keighley strives to include in his annual showcases.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-star-wars-crossover-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic Games is releasing a new&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Star Wars&nbsp;</em>crossover just in time for the May 4th celebrations, and it's bringing new map areas for you to explore, new character skins, and more.</p>

<p>This won't be&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s first&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>crossover; the two have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-fortnite-may-2024" rel="nofollow">clashed lightsabers</a> on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-star-wars" rel="nofollow">number</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-comes-with-fortnite-skin" rel="nofollow">prior occasions</a>, but this one's got some all-new stuff for you to enjoy. First up, you'll find four new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>-themed map areas to explore: the First Order Base, the Outpost Enclave, the Resistance Base, and Vader Samurai's Solitude, a modified version of the Shogun's Solitude area.</p>

<p>The new lightsaber weapon should give you new opportunities to get up close and personal with your enemies, although you'll have to train in the Force to use one (or loot one off a dead player, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-star-wars-2025-darth-jar-jar.jpg?itok=kyxV5h9- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-star-wars-2025-darth-jar-jar.jpg?itok=8epLuFOk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Truly, a terrifying scene from a nightmare.</figcaption></figure><p>New character skins will also be added in this <i>Fortnite Star Wars&nbsp;</i>crossover, including the likes of the truly terrifying Darth Jar Jar, an alternate interpretation of everyone's (least) favorite Gungan.</p>

<p>Others include Mace Windu, a Mandalorian you can customize, and General Grievous, and any&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>event that allows you to play as General Grievous is automatically above criticism. I don't make the rules.</p>

<p>Excitingly, this event also gives you the chance to pilot an Imperial TIE Fighter, as well as take part in a range of time-limited events that will drop as the month of May goes on.</p>

<p>It'll all culminate in the Death Star Sabotage event, a final showdown with Emperor Palpatine that takes place on June 7th. Let's see him "somehow return" from this one.</p>




<p>It's all go in the world of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>gaming right now. Recently, Respawn and Bit Reactor revealed&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Zero Company</em>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-zero-company-respawn-bit-reactor" rel="nofollow">turn-based tactics game</a> set during the dying days of the Clone Wars. It doesn't have a release date yet, though, unfortunately.</p>

<p>In addition, five classic games from the franchise's long and storied history were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-star-wars" rel="nofollow">recently added to GOG's Preservation Program</a>, by which the storefront swears to keep certain titles updated in perpetuity even if their developers or publishers haven't made the same commitment.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Star Wars&nbsp;</em>crossover event lands tomorrow, and you can read a full breakdown of what to expect from the event <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/strap-in-starfighter-star-wars-is-taking-over-in-fortnite-galactic-battle?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

The update also introduces a casino minigame for the El Cobra location, and a new location in the form of Junkyards, where you will presumably find leftover bits for your car. Wash that down with some borderless fullscreen, campsite sidestops where you can rest for free, new decals, and the ability to refuel jerrycans at gas stations. Witness it all in motion in the below celebratory trailer.

I was happy that Brendy got to review Keep Driving, because Brendy is often tasked with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-summer-car-review-a-sordid-sim-of-piss-and-pistons-that-wont-hold-your-disgusting-little-hand">reviewing car games that are cruel to him</a> - car games in which the car is secretly an incontinent cougar that pisses all over your dreams, even as you strive to render it roadworthy. Keep Driving, by contrast, is "a hypnotically involving game of picking up hitchhikers and battling tailgaters, a pixel art drivealong with tactile, chunky buttons and perfectly suited sound effects, as much fuelled by nostalgia as it is by gasoline". My goodness, that sounds almost uplifting. Barely any pissy cougars at all!
</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2756920/view/538852710067208281?l=english">a post on Steam</a>, developers YCYJ Games assert that the gamepad support scrubs up well on Steam Deck, but stress that "if you play on Steam deck, make sure to not lock your FPS for best possible performance". This is the first of four planned updates for 2025: there's a "smaller content update" coming in May,  some additional new bits and localisation features in late summer, and console support by winter. 
</p>
<p>
The roadmap post concludes with some reminiscences on "how important it is to appreciate the fleeting beauty of the world, and the fleeting beauty people you stumble upon, and the fleeting beauty of now". Which is both on-brand and atypically poignant for a roadmap post. Imagine if every Call Of Duty changelog ended by telling the player to touch grass and remember the taste of strawberries.

The only way to have a chance at getting either is by requesting an invite to purchase on each collection's product page.</p><div id="219954" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="e7a2ca72-8b53-4acf-aa19-29433e5325a0"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Prismatic Evolutions Accessory Pouch Special Collection</h3></p></div><div catalogid="e7a2ca72-8b53-4acf-aa19-29433e5325a0" id="219955"><div id="219955" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Blooming Waters Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After doing this ourselves, we got an email notification for both right away stating that the invitation requests were received. If you end up being picked within the next 12 months to purchase either collection, you will then be emailed a link that's valid for 72 hours, of which you can use to buy your new cards and accessories. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Within those 12 months, you won't need to request an invite again whenever Amazon UK makes any restocks, as yours will still be connected to each collection's product page. Essentially, it's a lottery where a decent amount of luck is required in order to grab one for yourself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In return, however, you'll have the chance to buy a collection that's actually at a fair price compared to the higher prices for Prismatic Evolutions and 151 collectors have been having to deal with over the recent months, in light of their low supply vs demand. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Prismatic Evolutions Accessory Pouch Special Collection includes both five booster packs and an Eevee accessory pouch for just £29.99. With Amazon's current price of £16.49 for just <a href="https://zdcs.link/QV7pMN?object_uuid=aa77d810-c462-43ff-91c0-654a1d35db2b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one Prismastic Evolutions booster</a> — on open, no-invite-required listings — you would need to pay £82.45 for five packs individually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same goes for the 151 Blooming Waters Collection. Charging you £79.99, you'll get 12 booster packs, individual foil cards; Squirtle, Bulbasaur, Blastoise ex, and Venusaur ex; and an oversized Blastoise ex card for display as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even when only taking the packs into account, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3w2g?object_uuid=aa77d810-c462-43ff-91c0-654a1d35db2b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">individual boosters for 151</a> cost a massive £19.49 at Amazon UK — meaning you would have to put up £233.88 just to buy 12 without getting an invite. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon TCG's major supply issues around sets like 151 and Prismatic Evolutions don't seem like they'll be letting up anytime soon. With that, keeping an eye out for invitation listings like these is one of the best ways to get new cards from them without needing to refresh retailer pages 24 hours a day, or applying for a bank loan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With other new sets like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-destined-rivals-preorder-guide-2025">Destined Rivals</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-booster-bundle-in-stock-for-just-39">Journey Together</a> selling out almost instantly to scalpers as soon as they're in stock, we wouldn't be surprised if other retailers didn't start applying an invite system as well, to give everyone a fair chance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

The studio, which is based in Adelaide, South Australia, has yet to say when Silksong will be released beyond a vague 2025 window, but we at least know it will be playable for those who can be at Australia’s national museum of screen culture, ACMI, from September 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silksong will be playable at the Melbourne museum as part of a video game exhibition called <a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/whats-on/game-worlds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Worlds</a>, which will also include displays that delve into the game’s design and artistic direction.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">ACMI co-curators Bethan Johnson and Jini Maxwell commented: “Since Hollow Knight: Silksong's initial announcement in 2019, it has been one of the most anticipated indie games on the planet – and we are thrilled to celebrate the design of this South Australian-made game as a centrepiece of Game Worlds in September.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From the hundreds of sprites that animate Hornet’s different movements and attacks, to the logic behind the game’s most challenging boss fights – and of course, having the game playable in-gallery – our Silksong displays delve deeply into the details of the game's artistic direction and design. We’re so grateful to Team Cherry for trusting us with their work, and so excited to share that work with you!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the announcement, ACMI shared a sprite sheet from Silksong, below, one of several design elements from the game that will be on display in the Game Worlds exhibition.

You’d imagine it will come out before September 18, if it’s going to be playable from then at a museum. Perhaps we’re looking at an August launch?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the case, things are certainly ramping up in the world of Hollow Knight. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-makes-brief-appearance-during-nintendo-switch-2-direct-to-secure-2025-release-window">Silksong made a brief appearance at Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct last month</a>, and soon after Team Cherry nailed down the 2025 release window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game showed up for the hardware-focused presentation in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment that included little more than a few seconds of new gameplay and confirmation of Team Cherry’s updated launch plans. It was the most meaningful update on Silksong in years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally confirmed for just Nintendo Switch and PC, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-trailer"><u>Xbox (and Game Pass)</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-ps4-and-ps5"><u>PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5</u></a> versions being added later, Silksong has been at the center of a number of bizarre teases over the years. Team Cherry kicked off 2025 with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake"><u>a mysterious tease related to a chocolate cake recipe</u></a>, leading desperate fans to hope that a re-reveal would arrive in April.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a> Season 25 kicks off May 6. Titled Prodigy, the season brings back the battle royale's beloved round-based 3v3 mode, Arenas, for a limited time, and gives a lot to archer-lovers--the Bocek Compound Bow has returned to ground loot with some explosive changes and the new playable legend, Sparrow, is a trick-arrow recon specialist. The season launches on the heels of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-studio-cancels-two-incubation-projects-lays-off-staff-amid-big-ea-shakeup/1100-6531200/">big layoffs for Electronic Arts' studios</a>, including about 100 people at Apex Legends developer Respawn, and the reported dissolution of several unannounced projects, like an extraction shooter set in the Titanfall/Apex Legends universe.</p><p dir="ltr">Arenas is the big focus of Season 25, as the mode has not been seen in the game since the conclusion of Season 15 in February 2023. May is quickly proving to be the month when fan-favorite modes in Apex Legends make a surprising comeback--last year, Solos briefly returned to the game after developer Respawn had already said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-solos-returns-in-season-21-despite-respawn-saying-it-would-never-happen/1100-6523118/">"we're not bringing it back."</a> It seems like any long-lost mode <em>can </em>make a potential return, if only for a limited time.</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly to when Solos briefly returned, Arenas is coming back with several changes that are aimed at addressing shortcomings with the once-permanent mode. Lead modes designer Clément Bachellerie told me that the team "simplified the win condition to the first team winning three rounds to have faster matches." Previously, to win an Arenas match, your team not only had to win three rounds but also have two more total wins than the other squad. So if both teams had two wins each, the winner of the next round would then have to win <em>again </em>to win.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485586-4tdh8ick.png" data-ref-id="1300-4485586" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485586-4tdh8ick.png" data-ref-id="1300-4485586"></a><figcaption>Arenas is a 3v3 mode in which the victor is determined by whichever squad earns three wins first.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485586-4tdh8ick.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">This would cause some Arenas matches to go on for... a while, with Round 9 always graciously acting as a take-all tiebreaker so both teams could finally go their separate ways. Under this new ruleset, matches will never go beyond Round 5. "The fact that matches were dragging and could become frustrating, [led] sometimes to players even dropping out early," Bachellerie said. "We simplified the win condition to the first three rounds won to help with the pacing."</p><p dir="ltr">"Later in the season, we're going to update the game mode with a few [more quality-of-life] changes that we hope will address some of the pain points the experience originally had," Bachellerie added. "Some of the store choices were a bit cumbersome, notably around healing items. We now give them by default, focusing the purchasing space on more interesting items, like weapons and abilities. [Also], Arenas meta could become a bit stale, with everyone choosing the same few guns. For this, we'll introduce a ban and a discount system. The former prevents you from choosing the same weapon every round; the latter tempts you to buy/try a weapon that is outside of your comfort zone. The mix of the two, we hope, will help with the overall game mode meta health. Lastly, some of the secondary objectives, like Care Packages, weren't very enticing [in the original mode]. We did a pass on [those] rewards to take it up a notch."</p><p dir="ltr">When I asked how long Arenas will stay in Apex Legends this time around, Bachellerie said it will be for a few weeks, transforming into something new when Season 25's first major patch drops. "The [traditional] 3v3 game mode is meant to support 25.0 until 25.1, so a bit more than a month. In 25.1, a new game mode variant called Arenas: Duels [which will be 1v1] will take the place of Arenas in the [Limited Time Mode] slot. These game modes may come back in the future as well, a lot will depend on how the season plays out for those modes' actual popularity."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485591-mdoljmf2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4485591" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485591-mdoljmf2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4485591"></a><figcaption>Pathfinder gets a few nice buffs in Season 25, which are intended to let him grapple faster and more often.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485591-mdoljmf2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Those who prefer to only play the mainstay battle royale mode of Apex Legends will have new stuff to look forward to as well. Season 25 feels like a love letter to those who have been clamoring for the return of the Bocek Compound Bow--the weapon has returned to the ground loot pool and the new playable legend is an archer with a soft spot for the weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">To fix the ammo problem that originally saw the Bocek removed from ground loot and stuffed into Care Packages (the bow was the only weapon to use the "arrow" ammo type, so very little of it spawned in comparison to every other ammo type), the weapon will behave like a Care Package firearm without actually being one--it will come pre-equipped with a number of arrows, removing the initial need to look for ammo. It's just grab and go! Replenishing your ammo works much as before--collecting loose arrows from the world that failed to make their target--with one fun exception: An enemy that has been damaged by arrows will transform into a deathbox riddled with arrows upon their death. This lets you run by the deathbox and grab the arrows passively, removing any need to actually spend time looting to replenish ammo for the Bocek.</p><p dir="ltr">When I asked the team if it was possible for a player to pull arrows that have been shot into <em>them </em>out of their own body, replenishing ammo by tanking damage, design director Evan Nikolich said, "Unfortunately not at launch but that's a fun idea we'll look into!" So if that gets patched into Apex Legends in a future update: You're welcome!</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485592-7ce4ti1k.png" data-ref-id="1300-4485592" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485592-7ce4ti1k.png" data-ref-id="1300-4485592"></a><figcaption>You can now equip frag grenades to the Bocek Compound Bow to make explosive arrows.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485592-7ce4ti1k.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In a fun and explosive change for the Bocek, Season 25 adds the option to attach any frag grenades in your inventory to an arrow, transforming it into a bomb arrow. So far, these bomb arrows have been a great way to match Fuse's distance in launching frag grenades, with the added benefit of the piercing nature of the arrow meaning the frag grenade sticks to the target, like an arc star grenade. It's going to be a lot of fun to use this to scare enemy teams and make them scatter as they abandon the one teammate with a bomb suddenly stuck to their neck.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's a noticeable difference from the delay and way frag grenades detonate [in comparison to the bomb arrows, and] we've done a lot of work on the presentation so it should be abundantly clear when you or an ally has been stuck so that players can try and make the best decisions they can," Canavese said.</p><p dir="ltr">No one likes the Bocek more than Season 25's new legend, Sparrow, who has unique pick-up animations and voice lines with the bow, akin to Mad Maggie with the Mastiff shotgun and Vantage with the Sentinel sniper rifle. A recon legend, Sparrow is primarily geared toward mapping spaces and locating enemies, like Bloodhound, Seer, Crypto, Valkyrie, and Vantage. Sparrow leans closest to the last of those comparisons, in that his abilities make him an ideal marksman and long-range combatant.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485583-bod7bfjl.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4485583" data-ratio="0.5561017929439" data-width="3458" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485583-bod7bfjl.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4485583"></a><figcaption>Sparrow's Tracker Dart can watch your squad's back to notify you of invading parties.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485583-bod7bfjl.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Sparrow's passive ability is Double Jump, which lets him do exactly what it sounds like. The only time this ability doesn't work is when Sparrow goes off a Launch Pad, which already gives a character a double-jump. "[Sparrow's double-jump] does have a unique sound so you should be able to pick it out versus the other ones," Sparrow legend designer John Ellenton told me when I noted that Sparrow is the third legend to have an ability that lets a player double-jump (Octane's Launch Pad and Vantage's Echo Relocation), which could create audio confusion in the midst of a match if a team is trying to figure out who is moving in on them.</p><p dir="ltr">Sparrow's tactical ability, Tracker Dart, is why he's a recon legend. Once Sparrow launches it into a surface, it emits a constant scan--any enemy that wanders into that space is marked, allowing Sparrow and his allies to track their position for as long as they remain in the dart's sight lines. These darts can be destroyed by the other team, encouraging Sparrow to place them in hard to discover spots. Additionally, Sparrow can fire a Tracker Dart into a Survey Beacon, allowing him to bypass the lengthy hacking process to instantly access the beacon's information and discover the location of all nearby squads. "His tactical can really give your team some great awareness of the battlefield," Ellenton said. "Placing it in chokes or behind your team to cover your backs makes it a great anti third party tool. So many times in playtests, we were about to jump on a team when a trap [would go] off--this allowed us to change strategies and not get caught out in a bad push. It's also great to throw out at teams you know are there; this will give you more direct moment-to-moment tracking if you can catch them with it."</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Sparrow's ultimate ability is Stinger Bolt. Using a high-tech bow affixed to his gauntlet, Sparrow fires a bolt that, upon landing, emits a pulse that targets and electrifies any enemies in the vicinity, both weakening them and slowing their movements. This makes it far easier to catch and kill enemies trying to escape an ambush. Both Sparrow's Tracker Dart and Stinger Bolt are small, making them far easier to fit through barred windows and partially opened doors than most legend abilities--together, the two abilities can give a team the layout of a room and weaken any potential threats without even having to go inside. "They are actually both great tools [for] flushing enemies out of a room," Ellenton confirmed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485582-nfj-hz6v.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4485582" data-ratio="0.5561017929439" data-width="3458" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485582-nfj-hz6v.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4485582"></a><figcaption>Sparrow's Stinger Bolt is a great way to weaken enemy teams before jumping in.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485582-nfj-hz6v.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">So far, we don't know much about Sparrow's story, other than having strong Ezio Auditore energy--he's an Italian with a sarcastic and good-natured personality who descends from a family that belongs to an order of assassins with avian motifs, including beaked hoods. It's unclear how, or if, Sparrow's inclusion in the game will push Apex Legends' narrative forward, which has stagnated and hasn't seen much momentum in over a year. "The narrative goals for Sparrow would be to explore a legend whose entire world and identity was rigidly defined by them [for] their entire lives by their family, but is now living on his own terms and learning what it is he wants, all while under the microscope of the public eye," narrative director Amanda Doiron told me. "His good nature allows him to navigate this better than many people, but it's not without its struggles, especially because he does still love his family and desires their acceptance even if they have never quite accepted him as he is."</p><p dir="ltr">To that end, Sparrow will have some connections with other legends in the Apex Games. "While he has no previous history with the legends before joining the Games, I think a number of them could relate to how much the Games allow him to express himself fully and also surround himself with a found family," Doiron said. "Fuse, Seer, and Octane are just a few that come immediately to mind." Admittedly, I was surprised Vantage wasn't one of those that Sparrow has camaraderie with, given their similar set-ups: Both are very young marksmen-focused legends with a criminal parent, signature weapon, and a cute pet (Vantage has a bat named Echo and Sparrow has a cat named Artemis). "We don't currently have [any] special dialogue between them, but that's not to say we won't in the future," Doiron said, as she noted to add lines between them in the future. Once again, if this change happens in a future update: You're welcome.</p><p dir="ltr">Apex Legends is available for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Switch, and PC. The battle royale is free-to-play and supports both cross-play and cross-progression.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-deep-dive-details-new-vault-hunters-open-world-changes-loot-shakeups-and<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Gearbox Software gave us our first big deep dive into Borderlands 4 courtesy of its own dedicated PlayStation State of Play. The 20-minute presentation revealed two of the game’s four new vault hunters, broke down its new loot and progression systems, and new streamlined approaches to co-op.</p>

<p>The State of Play introduced us to Vault Hunters: Vex the Siren and Rafa the Exo-Soldier. Vex is a winged mercenary capable of conjuring ghost-like minions to fight alongside her while empowering her own abilities. Rafa is a former Tediore soldier proficient in a variety of firearms. Vault Hunters are accompanied by Echo 4, a new robotic companion that guides players toward objectives, can hack terminals and machines, and scan the environment to find useful objects. Confirmed returning characters include Claptrap, Moxxi, Lilith, and Borderlands 3’s Vault Hunters Zane and Amara.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KlRBwf3sjY" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The game’s setting of Kairo is a new planet boasting four distinct biomes players can travel between seamlessly. This world had been kept hidden for thousands of years by its ruler and the game’s antagonist, the Timekeeper. This dictator rules his citizens by implanting them cybernetic parts called Bolts and polices Kairos using his own personal army of synthetic soldiers called The Order. Regarding the series’ signature comedic tone, Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford noted that Borderlands 4 will return to “a more grounded tone” reminiscent of the first two games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking a page from live service titles like Destiny, the open world features dynamic weather and events, such as world bosses and border patrols. Players can even spawn their own speeder bike-like vehicle (which can be customized) to cruise across the terrain quickly. Speaking of getting around, new traversal abilities include Glide, which allows players to float through the air to cover long distances. Characters also sport a wrist-mounted grapple hook to quickly scale vertical platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each Vault Hunter sports three Action Skills, class-specific abilities. Each Action Skill has its own skill tree and can be further bolstered by augments and capstones to change or improve its properties. Vault Hunters also sport passive abilities called Traits.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="dc570153-ecc5-46cb-8132-5cdbab245677" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Borderlands is all about loot, and the fourth entry features weapons from eight manufacturers, three new to the series: Jakobs, Maliwan, Vladof, Tediore, Torque, and the newly added Order, Ripper, and Daedalus. Each brand sports various perks and traits, and a new Licensed Parts system combines various abilities from multiple manufacturers into a single weapon.</p>

<p>Enhancements replace Artifacts and act as gear slots to augment weapons based on the manufacturer. An example would be an Enhancement that deals extra firepower for using a Tediore gun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grenades and heavy weapons like rocket launchers no longer take up slots in your gun rotation. Instead, they occupy a new shared slot called Ordnance and now operate on a recharging cooldown meter. This means you can use these more explosive weapons continuously in any encounter.</p>

<p>Overall, Gearbox is responding to player feedback by overhauling loot drop rates to ensure rarities matter again. To that end, it states Legendaries now drop far less frequently than in Borderlands 3 to ensure they feel special again. The ability to replay entire missions and boss fights has also been added, meaning players can easily re-run bosses without reloading saves.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>Fight For Your Life returns as the last-chance opportunity to save yourself when downed. However, a new piece of gear called Rep Kit lets players heal themselves or activate temporary buffs to raise their odds during firefights.</p>

<p>The four-player online multiplayer has been simplified with an improved lobby system for easier matchmaking. Co-op players can also set their difficulty individually without affecting everyone else, meaning one player can play using an easier setting while another plays on a more challenging mode. Loot is also instanced for each player, meaning no one misses out on any drops. Borderlands 4 also features two-player local splitscreen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Borderlands 4 is getting its first hands-on event sometime in June (possibly during Summer Games Fest) and launches on September 12 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The game will also be coming to Switch 2 later this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The upcoming party game, which pits 32 players against each other as various Sonic characters in platforming-focused challenges, has been pushed to an undetermined date. Sega <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000145/">states</a> the reason is due to player feedback from the ongoing pre-launch period, as well as the impending introduction of new modes arriving in Update 1.2. These modes are:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Rumble Ranking</strong> - Compete within the league you belong to based on the scores you earn during the period and get rewards according to your final ranking.</li>
	<li><strong>Crews</strong> - Create a Rumbler group with your in-game friends, and achieve score missions together.</li>
	<li><strong>Skills</strong> - Equip characters with unique abilities, adding a new layer of gameplay depth.</li>
</ul>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ve3OC40IxvQ" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Sega claims these additions will “fundamentally reshape the game,” necessitating the delay. It’s holding a Discord Q&amp;A tomorrow, May 1, to answer any questions players may have about the release update and the game overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whenever Sonic Rumble does arrive, it will be available on PC and mobile via iOS and Android.</p>

<p>Though distinct from the mechanics of Wordle, Letter Lock certainly seems poised to capitalize on the existing player base of that game, which launched in 2021 and was purchased by&nbsp;<em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>New York Times Games </em>in 2022. Similar to Wordle, Words With Friends: Letter Lock gives you vertical columns of letters with which to make words. As you make more valid words, you inch closer to completing that day's puzzle, and additional letter columns can unlock more word possibilities. Each wrong word takes a heart away, and if you lose too many hearts, you lose.</p>

<p>You can see the full trailer of Words With Friends: Letter Lock below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JR1ihNmFpgo" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Though Words With Friends is known for its multiplayer content that borrows heavily from the iconic board game Scrabble, Zynga has committed to introducing multiple single-player puzzles and word games since November 2024. Since then, the game has added Mini Crosswords, Word Wheel, Guest Word, and Word Search. According to Zynga, up to 70 percent of the Words With Friends player base has started its play sessions by playing Word Search before accessing the competitive multiplayer side that the game is known for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The new Letter Lock daily puzzle feature is a testament to Zynga's continued creative investment in Words With Friends that's informed by feedback from our dedicated fan base," executive vice president of mobile games at Zynga, Yaron Leyvand, said in a press release. "I strongly believe delivering fresh experiences for players is the key to continuous engagement and the long-term success of the title as an entertainment phenomenon."</p>

<p>Words With Friends is available as a free download with microtransactions on the iOS and Android stores.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/despelote-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I don’t play many sports games (we can’t all be Luke) but I’m always intrigued by a game that does something more than just recreate a sport’s mechanics. Soccer game <a href="https://despelote.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Despelote</em></a>, out today, captures both the physical and emotional side of the game from the perspective of a young fan.</p><p>I first played a version of <em>Despelote</em> years ago at the NYU Game Center, where its unique look stuck with me. The game is in first person, with key objects and characters rendered in line drawings over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/arts/despelote-soccer-ecuador.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">photographs</a> of its location of Quito, Ecuador. Its story is a fictionalized version of the childhood of its creator, Julián Cordero, who is eight years old in the early 2000s. Ecuador’s soccer team is vying to qualify for the World Cup, and Julián, like the rest of the country, is obsessed. The sport provides a distraction and sense of hope from the country’s political and financial upheaval; as you wander Quito, you can overhear adults swapping between these topics in realistic, meandering conversations.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Despelote - Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oVdmFEG_MuI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Despelote </em>wonderfully captures the sense of being a child in a world of adults. Distractions are everywhere: the game’s opening tutorializes its mechanics by having you play a soccer video game, while a conversation with Julián’s parents slowly filters in. I found myself trying to split my attention, only to mostly miss what his parents were saying thanks to the draw of the in-game game. Throughout the story, Julián’s attention drifts to soccer: matches on in-world TVs, his friends kicking a ball around outside his classroom, the video game in the family’s living room. Many of the game’s scenes involve an adult telling Julián to sit still or come home at a certain time, only for him to get distracted by the city, its residents, or a soccer ball.</p><p>The first-person soccer mechanic lets you dribble and kick with different intensities. There are a few more structured matches, but mostly you just run around with a ball. This casual play inspires you to explore Quito, as you look for things to kick a ball against or open spaces to play. With only the occasional pressure to do something specific with the ball or score a goal, you instead just get to just have <em>fun</em> with it, creating your own little games or just passing the ball back and forth. The city is a place to play soccer in, and this again makes the world feel like a backdrop to your youthful interest, while still pushing you to engage with the setting and story.</p><p>That story is loose and meandering, more of a feeling than a narrative. But anxiety and hope are everywhere, alongside the creeping pressure of the country’s political situation and of growing older within it. In one conversation with Julián’s mother at a teenage party, she asks about the soccer league you’re on or if your knee is bothering you; this felt like growth, turning Julián’s hobby into something more, but also like a loss of the freedom of his younger years. As we talked, I was suddenly struck by the fact that I was taller than his mother, when I’d spent so much of the game in a child’s waist-high perspective or following behind her as she tugged my hand. </p><p>Throughout the game, the constancy of soccer stands against all the change that swirls around Julián. Sometimes it's a comfort, sometimes a pressure, and sometimes just something joyful. But it always stays true to the core of just being people and a ball, a space for both the game's characters and the player to make their own meaning.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><em>Despelote</em> is out today for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, with Switch coming later.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/evil-dead-the-game/">Evil Dead: The Game</a> is being delisted from digital storefronts, publisher Saber Interactive confirmed on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1493750/view/501697399294526021">Steam page</a> before delisting it on Steam. Players noted on <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/evil-dead-the-game-is-no-longer-on-the-epic-games-store-and-ps-store-sparking-fears-it-could-be-shut-down/">Reddit</a> earlier in the week that it had been removed from the Epic Games Store and the PlayStation Store, raising suspicion that it had been delisted.</p>
<p>Saber confirmed those fears today, removing it from Steam and the Xbox Store, where it was still available for a short time after being removed from the Epic and PlayStation storefronts.</p>
<p>"<em>We can confirm we've begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts</em>," Saber wrote in its statement.</p>
<p>"<em>Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone. We want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support.</em>"</p>
<p>The game's developer, Boss Team Games, stopped making new content for Evil Dead: The Game in <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/09/evil-dead-the-game-ends-new-content-development-switch-version-cancelled">2023</a> and canceled a previously planned Nintendo Switch version at the time. Unfortunately, that it is being entirely delisted now is just the next step in what's become the standard for online-only games with no offline mode.</p>
<p>Perhaps by the time servers go offline, Saber and Boss Team Games will have finished work on an offline mode so that those who do own the game can continue to play it in some fashion. Saber didn't provide a timeline for when servers will be taken down, but it would be surprising to see them last longer than the rest of the year, now that the game is officially off storefronts.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-hardware-and-software-prices-going-up-due-to-market-conditions.1178712/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-prices-raised-hardware-software<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has announced that it's raising the prices of both of its consoles currently on the market, as well as "some" of its upcoming first-party games, in response to "market conditions".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Xbox says the changes have been made due to the aforementioned conditions, as well as the "rising cost of development". From today, you'll be paying $550 for a digital Xbox Series X and $600 for the version with a disc drive, while the Xbox Series S will set you back $380 and $430 for the 512GB and 1TB models, respectively.</p>

<p>In terms of software prices, Xbox will be raising the price of some of its games to $80 "starting this holiday season", although Xbox doesn't specify which games this will apply to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-xbox-price-increases.jpg?itok=09JB4ePR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-xbox-price-increases.jpg?itok=KIg3cQmZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some upcoming Xbox Studios games will cost $80, although Xbox hasn't stated which ones yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Pricing for other regions, including the <a href="https://cms-assets.xboxservices.com/assets/39/48/394840bc-a7da-4c52-bd06-c8b5d19240dc.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">UK</a> and <a href="https://cms-assets.xboxservices.com/assets/40/a2/40a23424-36f7-43ee-a1b1-418ce55d17a4.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Europe</a>, will also be changing, so bear that in mind if you're planning to pick up a new Xbox console this year. Judging by the way Xbox hardware <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-revenue-continues-to-tumble-but-gaming-revenue-is-up-microsoft-reports" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sales are going</a>, though, there's a pretty good chance you're not.</p>

<p>Microsoft isn't the first company to announce that some of its games will get this kind of price jump. When the Nintendo Switch 2 was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">revealed last month</a>, Nintendo announced that certain first-party games, including launch title&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, will cost $80, although not every first-party Nintendo game will set you back that much;&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, for instance, will retail for $70.</p>

<p>Given that both Nintendo and Microsoft have taken these steps, and that Sony also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-prices-rising-europe-uk-australia-new-zealand" rel="nofollow">raised the prices of the PS5</a> in certain territories recently, it's probably only a matter of time before some PS5 games retail for $80 as well.</p>

<p>Of course, in the background of all of this are the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow">tariffs</a> recently introduced by President Donald Trump. While many countries have received a 90-day reprieve from said tariffs, China, which is a manufacturing hub for much of the gaming world, is a notable exception from said reprieves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-xbox-price-increases.jpg?itok=eAMtl019 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-xbox-price-increases.jpg?itok=kdsZOUDb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The tariffs are hitting other studios as well as Microsoft.</figcaption></figure><p>We'll have to wait and see how folks respond to Microsoft's pricing changes, but given the widespread criticism aimed at Nintendo for the same decision, I can't imagine this will go down well. Stay tuned for more.</p>

While you can request that the Support Ship prioritizes certain items for its next visit, its stock cycles through a pool of items. This means that Commission Tickets are not always guaranteed. It can feel like quite the rare sight to see even one at times.</p><p>Thankfully, there are ways to cheese through this and collect them all. <strong>Commission Tickets have a chance to show up when you’ve requested Equipment Materials or Misc. Items</strong>. You’ll want to request goods from those categories first. The next step to increase your chances is to purchase all the weapons you see. These are one-off items that are never replaced in stock, which means you can filter them out of the pool and make it more likely for Commission Tickets to show up.</p><p>All of this is dragged out by how long it takes to see new Support Ship stock. <strong>If you’re not feeling patient and want these materials sooner than later, you can always choose to </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094"><strong>skip ahead by resting</strong></a></span><strong>.</strong> The Support Ship weighs anchor for three days and then leaves for another three to gather items for you. It will take up to 3000 Guild Points to keep using the Rest mechanic, but it’s a lot faster than hunting for six in-game days to pass the time.</p><p><strong>My final suggestion for farming Commission Tickets is to do a bit of save scumming</strong>. Keep track of when the Support Ship will dock and save the day before. Rest in your tent to advance the day, and then go out and check what’s in stock. If there are no Commission Tickets available, return to the main menu without saving and reload your save. Keep checking the newly generated stock until it includes what you need.</p><h2 id="h460924"><a id=""></a>How to use Commission Tickets</h2><figure id="" data-id="cc71a3575eec8414e7e900de5c88d993" data-recommend-id="image://cc71a3575eec8414e7e900de5c88d993" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Lance Weapon Tree screen, showing off the Paladin Lance I." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Lance Weapon Tree screen, showing off the Paladin Lance I." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc71a3575eec8414e7e900de5c88d993" data-recommend-id="image://cc71a3575eec8414e7e900de5c88d993" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Lance Weapon Tree screen, showing off the Paladin Lance I." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All you’re told is to take these to the Smithy, which isn’t a helpful suggestion with how many options Gemma has. There isn’t any special interaction to look out for–<strong>Commission Tickets are just used as materials to forge specific weapons and armor</strong>. To be more precise, it’s used for two weapons, both of their upgraded forms, and a full set of armor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/microsoft-raises-prices-on-xbox-hardware-says-some-holiday-games-will-be-80/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Microsoft is increasing the recommended asking price of Xbox hardware and accessories worldwide starting today and will start charging $79.99 for some new first-party games this holiday season. <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">The announcement</a> comes after "careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development," Microsoft said.</p>
<p>In the United States, this means Microsoft's premiere Xbox Series X will now cost $599.99 for a unit with a disc drive (up from $499.99), while the Digital version will cost $549.99 (up from $449.99). On the lower end, a 1 TB Xbox Series S will now cost $429.99 (up from $349.99), while a 512GB unit will cost $379.99 (up from $299.99).</p>
<p>The new prices are already reflected on Microsoft's official online store, and Microsoft says it will "provide updated recommended pricing to local retailers." That might leave a small window where you can get Xbox hardware and accessories from those retailers at the older, lower price while supplies remain available.</p>
<p>For headsets specifically, Microsoft said that pricing will change "in the US and Canada only," a potential recognition of the Trump administration tariffs on foreign goods imported into the United States. Microsoft also warned that "Xbox Series S and X availability may continue to change over time depending on the retailer and by country" as those tariffs threaten to upend international trade worldwide.</p>
<p>On the software side, Microsoft said the increase to $79.99 will apply to both digital and physical versions of "some" new games this holiday season. Existing Xbox games will not be seeing a price increase, and "different games and expansions will continue to be offered at a variety of price points."</p>

Players can pilot starfighters, train in Force abilities, and unlock plenty of new Star Wars-themed skins. Lego Fortnite is also going to a galaxy far, far away with Star Wars content of its own.</p><p dir="ltr">In Fortnite battle royale, players can pilot both the Imperial TIE fighters and Rebel Alliance X-Wings ships. Locating character holograms lets them train in the Force and earn a lightsaber, but there are also plenty of Star Wars blaster weapons to choose from. Several characters are announced to appear on the island, including Rey, Emperor Palpatine, Mace Windu, Darth Maul, Captain Phasma, and even a samurai variant of Darth Vader.</p>

		<p>Creepy Jar has released new footage of StarRupture with ten minutes that shows off the world as well as some gameplay from the latest build. The video acts as a tour of Arcadia-7 showing off the inviting looking environment that holds lots of perils and dangers to be aware of. Players will have to get familiar with those dangers pretty quickly while base building.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture: The World of Arcadia-7 Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/srtUwMGwCuE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. The game will be able feature co-op for up to four players, but if you want to explore this frontier alone you can. Weather cycles of the planet and regular attacks by Arcadia-7’s creatures will impede player progress, so learning the patterns and consequences of the dangers will be critical to making it through the days. If you are interested in StarRupture you will have to wait a little bit longer to get hands on with it. Creepy Jar has confirmed that StarRupture will be coming to Steam Early Access in the autumn.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/11/green-hell-review-spirits-of-amazonia/">Green Hell Review</a></h2>
<p>Creepy Jar previously released Green Hell, and in our review Steve said, <em>“Green Hell is a fantastic survival experience with an exemplary sense of place and peril. Creepy Jar have really nailed the feeling of loneliness and despair that true isolation would lead to and married this to some well balanced challenges and a refreshingly user friendly approach. The range of ways to play are really welcome and should ensure that even those players who may be turned off by the rigours of hunger and thirst mechanics can enjoy the immersive jungle experience. This may not be a welcoming jungle, but there’s plenty of fun and games to be had.”</em></p>

			<p>The exodus of PlatinumGames' hugely talented developers continues, with Astral Chain director and designer on Nier Automata, <strong>Takahisa Taura</strong>, confirming that he has also left the studio, though not to follow Hideki Kamiya to Clovers. Instead, Taura founded Eel Game Studio with a few other founding members.</p>
<p>In an interview with Famitsu (transcribed by <a href="https://x.com/genki_jpn/status/1917511865078538755?s=46">Genki</a>, spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/top-platinumgames-designer-quits-studio-starts-new-game-company/">VGC</a>), Taura confirmed his departure from Platinum and the founding of his new studio, but wouldn't say who the other founding members are. He also confirmed that despite beginning this new adventure, he'll still collaborate with Yoko Taro, Yosuke Saito, and Keiichi Okabe on an unannounced project.</p>
<p>All four were key members of Nier Automata, so this unannounced project could potentially be Nier-related, but it's still too early to tell.</p>
<p>Hideki Kamiya, former creative lead at PlatinumGames and one of the studio's founders, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-leaving/">left Platinum in 2023</a>, kicking up a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-leaving/">YouTube channel at first</a> while working to form another new studio, <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/">Clovers</a>. Which, as fans of Kamiya's work immediately recognized, was a callback to a studio Kamiya previously founded, Clover.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/hideki-kamiya-on-returning-to-his-roots-with-clovers-and-okami-2/">VGC</a> last year, Kamiya confirmed that the developers who started Clovers with him were mainly former PlatinumGames members, and that he left Platinum mostly because he was unsatisfied there.</p>
<p>"<em>If I was satisfied at Platinum, then I wouldn't have left. If there was one thing I am worried about, it's the fact I was VP and chief game designer of PlatinumGames. And so with me quitting, I worry about the people there, the staff there. Of course, if they're motivated and happy at Platinum, I believe that's the right path for them. But if there are others whose mindset aligns more with what we're building here at Clovers, we want to welcome and provide a path for them, too. I see that as a responsibility I have to those people after leaving Platinum.</em>"</p>
<p>Of course, Kamiya is speaking for himself, but his words raise questions about how things are internally at Platinum. Taura, like Kamiya, is another massive talent the studio is missing now.</p>
<p>This is not to say that PlatinumGames is without talented developers. It's just to point out that Platinum was a happy home for some of the best and most storied developers in the video game industry for years until it wasn't. It'll be interesting to see how the studio continues to evolve.</p>
<p>And regarding Taura and Eel Game Studio, hopefully it's not too long before we see what they're working on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/koei-tecmo-financials-profits<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>studio Koei Tecmo has released its financial results for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and the studio has reported rising profits, largely informed by new releases.</p>

<p>Per the latest Koei Tecmo financial <a href="https://www.koeitecmo.co.jp/e/ir/docs/ir3_20250501_e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the studio's operating profit has risen by around 12% over last year, and it's also about 7% higher than the studio's forecast for the twelve-month period.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo says the increase in its profit is largely down to "our new title release", although the studio does also say that "download sales of back catalog titles have grown". Cost reductions have also contributed to increased profits, according to the report.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo hasn't revealed any information about the sales performance of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2: Black</em>, but given that the game was released simultaneously on Game Pass, it's unlikely it's done quite as well as the two aforementioned titles. Still, if&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>can do it</a>, so can&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, I suppose.</p>

<p>In terms of future games, Koei Tecmo is currently gearing up to release a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian" rel="nofollow"><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian</em></a>, which is set to launch sometime this year, although we don't have a release date for it yet.</p>




<p>The studio is also looking ahead to the launch of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, which is a co-development project between Team Ninja and&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>studio PlatinumGames. That's due to arrive sometime this year as well, although again, we don't have a concrete release date.</p>

<p>You can read the highlights of Koei Tecmo's <a href="https://www.koeitecmo.co.jp/e/ir/docs/ir1_20250430_e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial report right here</a> if you want to get nerdy with the numbers. We'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>
