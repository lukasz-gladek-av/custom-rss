            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/riot-releases-new-details-on-riftbound-league-of-legends-trading-card-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has released new details on their officially licensed <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>League of Legends</em></a> card game. The officially titled <em>Riftbound: League of Legends Trading Card Game</em> has its first wave of products announced and an official distributor.</p>

<h2>The <em>Riftbound: League of Legends Trading Card Game</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Riftbound: League of Legends Trading Card Game</em> will launch with an inaugural set titled Origins. This set will contain 300 cards. These cards will feature several champions from League of Legends, including Annie, Garen, Jinx, Lee Sin, Lux, Master Yi, Viktor, Volbear, Yasuo, and more.</p>

These Champion decks will contain 56 cards, including various units, legends, champions, spells, gear, runes and battlegrounds.</p>

<p>As mentioned in its initial announcement, the game will support 1v1, 2v2, and free-for-all formats. Further gameplay details are scarce at this time since the game is still in development but it is confirmed the card game will not be a tabletop adaptation of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legends-of-runeterra" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Legends of Runeterra</em></a>. The press release also confirms that gameplay demos will be coming to both dedicated Riot and tabletop events.</p>

<p>Lastly, Riot confirms that have partnered with UVS Games to bring <em>Riftbound: League of Legends Trading Card Game</em> to local game stores in English-speaking countries around the world. Shining Soul will assist with production and distribution in China.</p>

<p><em>Riftbound: League of Legends Trading Card Game</em> is the latest expansion to Riot's multimillion-dollar franchise. It has expanded from its competitive PC game to well-received single-player spin-offs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ruined-king-league-of-legends-story" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Ruined King</em></a>, a critically acclaimed animated adaptation with <em>Arcane</em>, and even a fighting game spin-off with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/2xko" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>2XKO</em></a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Riftbound: League of Legends Trading Card Game</em> will be available in China in Summer 2025, in English-speaking countries October 2025, with additional regional rollouts following in 2026.</p>

Since then, Rockstar has shared no new official screenshots, videos, or trailers for the upcoming open-world sequel. And after 15 months of waiting, people are really curious about when to expect a second trailer, and more importantly when <em>GTA 6</em> will actually launch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-take-1851617299?_gl=1*cfc662*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQ0NzM3OS40Ni4wLjE3NDM0NDczODIuNTcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-take-1851617299?_gl=1*cfc662*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQ0NzM3OS40Ni4wLjE3NDM0NDczODIuNTcuMC4w">All we know right now is that the game is set to arrive in the fall of 2025</a></span>. Well, in a recent interview Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick implied that a new trailer might not arrive until closer to launch, and that’s to pump up excitement. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/0M53-LKlECk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/0M53-LKlECk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a new interview with <em>Bloomberg</em></a></span>, Zelnick was asked bluntly why <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>'s release date was such a big secret. The CEO laughed and gave a big grin before answering that the date is a secret because they want to keep fans excited. </p><p>“The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I’ve ever seen for an entertainment property,” said the former 20th Century FOX President. “And I’ve been around the block a few times and I’ve been in every entertainment business there is, and we want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement.”</p><p>Of course, he fails to mention that at this stage Rockstar Games likely hasn’t committed to a release date yet. And any internal dates or milestones are still very fluid. Game development is messy and trying to predict when things will be finished is hard, especially with a game the size of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/take-two-t2-ceo-zelnick-gta-6-rockstar-pc-port-xbox-ps5-1851512434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-t2-ceo-zelnick-gta-6-rockstar-pc-port-xbox-ps5-1851512434"><em>GTA 6</em></a></span><em>. </em></p><p>Zelnick also explained that they will provide “marketing” assets closer to the launch of <em>GTA 6. </em></p><p> “And we do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance. And we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation. I don’t always get it exactly right, but that’s what we’re trying to do.”</p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006">We at <em>Kotaku </em>predict, based on various factors</a></span>, that<em> GTA 6</em> will arrive in late October.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-mario-kart-9-1851772264?_gl=1*g6doqr*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQ0NzM3OS40Ni4wLjE3NDM0NDczODIuNTcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-mario-kart-9-1851772264?_gl=1*g6doqr*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQ0NzM3OS40Ni4wLjE3NDM0NDczODIuNTcuMC4w"> And with theSwitch 2 reportedly launching in June</a></span> and Take-Two’s <em>other</em> big game, <em>Borderlands 4</em>, arriving in late September, I’d hazard a guess that <em>GTA 6</em>'s second trailer might drop in early August or perhaps the last week of July.

            <p>IGN Entertainment (Eurogamer's parent company) has officially announced that IGN Live will run in LA from 7-8 June, 2025.</p>
<p>The fan-focused event, which takes place during summer's video game event season, is being held in downtown Los Angeles at Magic Box @ The Reef. Currently the confirmed list of studios, publishers, and brands includes Netflix, 2K Sports, Lenovo, and Arcade1Up, with more set to be announced soon. IGN Live will feature playable games on PCs, consoles, and handheld devices, plus gameplay and trailer reveals, celebrity panels, merch giveaways, a live DJ and more. It's not just video games, either, with the show aiming to be a celebration of games, movies, TV, comics, collectables and more.</p>
<p>Tickets can be bought now from <a href="http://ign.com/live">IGN</a> at a reduced price compared to buying at the door.</p>
<p>Ticket prices are detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early bird, single day tickets: $15 USD</li>
<li>Early bird weekend/VIP tickets: $30</li>
<li>Regular pricing, single day tickets: $25</li>
<li>Regular pricing, weekend/VIP tickets: $40</li>
<li>Single day tickets at the door: $30</li>
<li>Weekend/VIP tickets at the door: $45</li>
</ul>
<p>Act early if you want the cheapest prices, with early bird tickets only available until 30th April. A VIP pass also includes a goodie bag containing exclusive items valued at $40. You can still save money on the door price if you buy tickets online after 30th April.</p>
<p>If you can't make it to LA in June, IGN will be livestreaming the entire weekend event across IGN platforms, including IGN.com, YouTube, Twitch, social channels, and more.</p>
<p>IGN Live 2024 saw a number of big-name guests and reveals including <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-might-debut-an-unnamed-tolkien-character-ign-live-2024">The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power cast</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/phil-spencer-talks-xbox-showcase-studio-closures-xbox-handheld-and-more-ign-live-2024">Xbox’s Phil Spencer</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/assassins-creed-shadows-why-its-the-right-time-for-the-series-to-go-to-japan-ign-live-2024">Ubisoft discussing Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/johnny-rico-recruits-roughnecks-for-starship-troopers-extermination-ign-live-2024">Casper van Dien talking Starship Troopers: Extermination</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-don%E2%80%99t-offer-4k-output.1150251/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-dont-offer-4k-output/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In just two days, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be fully revealed in its very own Nintendo Direct. Fans have been eagerly anticipating any information about the upcoming console, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/">rumors</a> flying wildly. Some have been relatively tame and logical, while others have been completely outlandish.</p>
<p>One of the more recent rumors is that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support 4K resolution in one way or another. Previous rumors that were announced suggested that this resolution will be available when the console is docked, and that the resolution in handheld will be 1080p.</p>
<p>There have now been recent claims that there won't be 4K support, as the dev kits for the Nintendo Switch 2 don't contain any support for 4K resolution. This news comes from the Game Developers Conference (GDC) that took place in San Francisco earlier in March.</p>
<p>"I heard this from one developer at GDC and also heard it separately in an email, but the dev kits, or some of the dev kits, don't have a 4K output," says Tom Henderson during the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLUrxzSPZhU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">episode of Insider Gaming Weekly</a>. Whether this is true or not is yet to be confirmed by those who have access to the dev kits, but it's also likely that they are unable to confirm anything until Nintendo gives them permission to.</p>
<p>Although a dev kit may not have 4K output, it doesn't necessarily mean that the Nintendo Switch 2 won't support 4K output. Console development kits don't typically match the specifications of the final system, and there is a possibility that a newer dev kit will be released with this potential.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's hard to tell what is true and what isn't about the Nintendo Switch 2, based solely on the little information that is available across the internet. Luckily, the Direct is just around the corner, where we will hopefully find out the specifications, extra features, and price tag of the console. It's uncertain whether any games will be announced during this Direct or whether it will be focused solely on the console itself.</p>
<p>This console comes with new Joy-Cons, which look like they will be more stable overall compared to the first console. Hopefully, a lot of questions will be answered about what to expect from this console for both developers and consumers. Just three days ago, there was a leak of <a href="https://wccftech.com/us-retailer-documents-reveals-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/">US retailer documents</a> that showed the potential pre-order plans, with an expected date for pre-orders opening to be April 9.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Eidos Montréal Lays Off 75 Employees as Work on ‘Mandate’ (Fable?) Ends]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-mandate-fable-ends/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/eidos-montr%C3%A9al-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-%E2%80%98mandate%E2%80%99-fable-ends.1150230/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-mandate-fable-ends/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Canadian developer Eidos Montréal has laid off 75 employees. The studio <a href="https://x.com/EidosMontreal/status/1906728993061020142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the news with the following message shared on social media channels:</p>
<p><em>Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end. It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services. These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition. Eidos Montréal stays committed to deliver its other projects currently in development.</em></p>
<p>Besides the unfortunate (albeit sadly common in the industry lately) fact that people are losing their jobs, the message's wording is definitely interesting. Eidos Montréal singled out the end of a specific work commission as the cause of the layoffs, and the mind cannot but go to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-studio-eidos-montreal-is-helping-out-on-xboxs-fable-reboot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> that the developer had been helping out Playground Games with the Fable reboot. While the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to 2026 earlier this year, it was originally supposed to launch in 2025. It's possible and even likely that Fable is now content complete and Playground Games simply does not need any further help from the Canadian studio as it approaches the polishing phase.</p>
<p>Still, it's unfortunate that Eidos Montréal could not reassign those employees to its other projects. This is not the studio's only recent round of layoffs; it also had to cut 97 employees in January 2024 following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancellation of a new Deus Ex game</a>. It is unclear what else the studio might be working on right now; its latest game is still the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-what-kind-of-name-is-avengers-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underrated Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, sister studio Crystal Dynamics, which worked closely with Eidos Montréal on projects like Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Marvel's Avengers, also <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-team-members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the removal of 17 employees. Crystal Dynamics is also helping out with the reboot of a Microsoft-owned IP, <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-reboot-will-be-a-collaborative-effort-between-the-initiative-and-crystal-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect Dark</a>, in collaboration with The Initiative.</p>

<p>Ubisoft’s stock is falling again. Just days after the French-based publisher announced a deal for a new subsidiary in partnership with Tencent, the company’s stock fell by double digits on Monday.</p>



<p>Looking at the markets in the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), and France, the company’s stock fell by at least 11.80%. As of <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/market-stock/0NVL/ubisoft-entertainment-sa/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">closing in the UK</a>, Ubisoft was trading for €11.19 compared to the €12.15 it opened at. In France, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ubi?countrycode=fr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stock prices fell</a> 12.06% down to €11.16.</p>



<p>The fall fully erases the 11% gain the company saw in stock prices on Friday, less than a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">day after it was announced</a>.</p>

<p>Shortly after the deal was announced, multiple employees reached out to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-worried-about-layoffs-after-tencent-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">express worry over layoffs</a> at Ubisoft for those not working on the included franchises.</p>



<p>Ubisoft says that it expects the deal with Tencent for the new subsidiary to be completed before the end of 2025. When it closes, Ubisoft will maintain 75% control of the new company that includes Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry games.</p>

<p>ASUS is teasing something big for its Republic of Gamers (ROG) lineup on social media. In a short video teaser posted on Monday afternoon, ASUS teased what’s next for the ROG Ally. And what’s next is expected to be the rumored ASUS Xbox handheld currently known as Project Kennan.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-launching-partner-gaming-handheld-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rumors</a> and reports, this device isn’t going to be the standalone Xbox handheld that Microsoft is actively working on. Instead, it’s going to be a third-party device that will include Xbox branding.</p>







<p>Specifics on what the device will be remain scarce, including exact details on how it will fit as an Xbox device. A recent report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-is-partnering-with-asus-for-upcoming-gaming-handheld-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Central</a> seemed to make it clear that the system won’t play Xbox games as it will be a “tried-and-true Windows PC in essence”. Instead, it will be act like the current ROG Ally while featuring an Xbox Guide button and “more prominent grips”.</p>



<p>Lastly, it’s also unknown if it will feature any other spec updates over the original ROG Ally or will be similar to the anticipated ROG Ally 2.</p>



<p>What do you think the ASUS-Xbox Handheld known as Project Kennan will include? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows launched on March 20, and it got off to a hot start in the US.

This counts sales through March 22, so Shadows achieved this after only three days.</p><p>Piscatella added that, after three days of sales, Shadows is already one of the top five best-selling games of 2025 in the US based on dollars. In terms of a comparison, Piscatella pointed out that only Capcom's Monster Hunter: Wilds had a better first week in terms of dollar sales in 2025 so far.</p><p>Wilds is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6281">No. 1 best-selling game of 2025 so far in the US</a>. March's complete sales data for the US will be published by Circana on April 23, at which point we will have a better picture of how Shadows sold in March and how it compares to other titles in the

<p>Fighting mobs is fun, but we’re after The First Berserker Khazan’s bosses for the tense, multi-hour fights that leave you wanting to pummel your controller. We’ve rounded up every main boss fight in the game and can tell you how many there are.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-trophy-list-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is one of the hardest Soulslikes I’ve ever played. I’m not sure how Neople managed it, but they’ve put together a collection of unique, challenging, and rewarding boss fights. Very rarely are they unfair, either—a rarity, as when I die in a Souls game, I blame anyone but myself.</p>



<p>The boss fights in Khazan are fantastic. If you’re just starting or wondering how many are left, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-bosses-are-in-the-first-berserker-khazan">How Many Bosses Are in The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This guy… Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 16 main bosses and a further 10 optional side bosses in The First Berserker Khazan.</strong></p>



<p>If you want to beat <a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The First Berserker Khazan</a>, you need to overcome 16 boss fights. Encounters can have several phases, and enemies have a large moveset of attacks they inevitably cycle through.</p>



<p>I had the pain of fighting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-nerfs-hardest-bosses-in-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-patch Viper before it was nerfed</a>, and I can tell you I spent <em>over 2 hours</em> on this fight alone! Your mileage will vary depending on your ability, your patience, and how adept you are at studying and memorizing attacks.</p>



<p>Also, there are ways to make particular boss fights easier. <strong>The Aratra fight—for example—requires you to target the enemy’s weak points</strong> to inflict massive damage. If you coordinate your attack well enough, you can lop off its limbs simultaneously and bring yourself very close to the finishing line.</p>

<p>Eidos-Montreal, a development studio known for Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy and support on games like Marvel’s Avengers and Tomb Raider, has announced a wave of large-scale layoffs.</p>



<p>The Embracer-owned studio posted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eidosmontreal_nous-avons-inform%C3%A9-aujourdhui-les-membres-activity-7312494582850543616-TzUD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a> on Monday afternoon that it was letting go 75 employees.</p>



<p>“Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end,” the article reads. “It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.</p>



<p>“These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition.”</p>



<p>The studio closed its statement saying that it was “committed to deliver” the projects it has currently in development.</p>



<p>Currently, Eidos-Montreal is supporting Playground Games on the Fable reboot that is scheduled to launch in 2026. The game’s delay into 2026 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was recently announced</a> by Playground Games.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Embracer Group about the layoffs at Eidos-Montreal and whether the Fable delay had anything to do with the decision. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article.</p>



<p>What do you make of the layoffs at Eidos-Montreal? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1796/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <p>
Just weeks after a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>-themed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> mod was praised as "amazing" by Larian Studios co-founder Swen Vincke, it's been targeted by lawyers representing Dungeons &amp; Dragons company Wizards of the Coast, and hit with a DMCA takedown.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-baldurs-gate-3-mod-gives-you-another-way-to-romance-sultry-vampire-astarion">Baldur's Village mod released earlier this month</a> after more than a year in development, giving players the chance to explore a new village north of Stardew Valley's Pelican Town that's populated by some "rather unusual" residents. Its Baldur's Gate 3-inspired additions included a romanceable Astarion, alongside a new tavern and more.
</p>
<p>
At the time, its creator, Xun, said the release was just the start, with a storyline for Halsin also planned in addition to more "world-building, background stories, and gameplay". But even this initial version was enough to catch Larian boss Swen Vincke's eye, and he <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1898633725417504953">shared news of its launch on social media</a>, writing, "So much love went into this - amazing work!"

<p>
Unfortunately, it seems Dungeons &amp; Dragons license holder Wizards of the Coast was less impressed, and Baldur's Village has now vanished from modding website Nexus Mods after the company's lawyers hit it with a DMCA takedown over the weekend.
</p>
<p>
In a statement <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wizards-of-the-coast-scores-pr-masterstroke-bullies-bg3-stardew-mod-that-had-swen-vinckes-personal-approval-off-the-internet-with-a-dmca/">provided to PC Gamer</a>, Nexus Mods described Baldur's Village - which <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888">remains "under moderation review" on the site</a> at the time of writing - as an "an incredibly creative cross-over to Stardew Valley that the community loves". It optimistically added, "Hopefully, this is an oversight from WotC, who often use external agencies to hunt down violating content, and they will revert their decision. Fingers crossed for Baldur's Village."
</p>
<p>
Larian's Swen Vincke also chimed in to <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1906765058270540219">defend mods such as Baldur's Village on social media</a>. "Free quality fan mods highlighting your characters in other game genres are proof your work resonates and a unique form of word of mouth," he wrote. "IMHO they shouldn't be treated like commercial ventures that infringe on your property. Protecting your IP can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled. There are good ways of dealing with this."
</p>
<p>
Wizards of the Coast and parent company Hasbro have, of course, expressed considerable interest in continuing the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> franchise following the mega-success of Baldur's Gate 3 - despite the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">Larian won't be attached</a> after it instead opted to focus on its own IP.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Hasbro <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">claimed plenty of other developers are "very interested" in continuing the Baldur's Gate series</a>. "We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that," it explained. "And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that."

As a game about learning to see reality and Senua's visions as one and the same, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hellblade II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> delivers an experience that utilizes unique visual and, most especially, audio effects that emphasize the protagonist's state of mind throughout her journey.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During the 2025 Game Developers Conference, Ninja Theory principal sound designer Daniele Galante gave a detailed presentation on the sound design of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and how the original game's innovative use of binaural audio was expanded for the sequel. In addition to breaking down how actors performed their sessions with binaural audio setups, the sound designer explained the challenges and benefits of heightened sound design for games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Creating a hallucinatory soundscape">Creating a hallucinatory soundscape</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developer Ninja Theory has built quite a pedigree for crafting games with rich visual styles and impressive sound design. The original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hellblade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> received significant praise for not only being a game with a modest budget and scope but also for how the developers managed to push their resources to produce a visually stunning game with stellar audio design and clever use of binaural audio – audio design that re-creates sound within a 3D space.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/supergiant-denies-recasting-hades-ii-actor-over-interim-sag-aftra-contract-request" target="_self" data-discover="true">Supergiant denies recasting Hades II actor over interim SAG-AFTRA contract request</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Senua's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Saga: Hellblade II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Ninja Theory received more resources and a larger team to make a more high-end follow-up, and the sound design was one area that the developers wanted to improve upon. Throughout the game, Senua battles foes from rival clans and other unsettling foes—but her journey is fraught with visual and auditory hallucinations that turn her already dire circumstances into a harrowing ordeal. Ultimately, she uses her survival skills and perception to center herself, and by the game's end, she once again accepts herself and comes to terms with traumas.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Galante, continuing with the use of binaural audio was necessary as it allowed them to help players get a better understanding of how individuals hear auditory hallucinations and to immerse them within Senua's perspective.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Many people think that you hear [auditory hallucinations] inside your head, but that's not accurate." In most peoples' experiences, they hear voices around them, very much like how I'm speaking to you or when we talk to each other," said Galante. "Using binaural audio was an obvious choice because we want to reproduce these voices around the player to get them within this experience. On top of that, we can give our performers a very powerful tool, which is their body language movement. They usually cannot use it when they play video games. They have to stand in front of the mic, which is a powerful tool. They have to fill their performance with more emotion, and because of that, we found that actors with a theater background usually work very well with binaural audio."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/wizardry-proving-grounds-of-the-mad-overlord-composer-winifred-phillips-wins-grammy-award" target="_self" data-discover="true">Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord composer Winifred Phillips wins Grammy award</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Galante explained with several videos in his presentation, the actors playing the Furies (Abbi Greenland and Helen Goalen)—the voices that Senua hears throughout the game – performed their lines while also moving around a Neumann KU 100 Binaural Dummy Head mic during the capture sessions—treating the mic as if it were Senua and both the player. The special mic simulates the average-sized head and captures sound in a 3D space, but Galante made a point to mention that the effectiveness of binaural audio tends to vary for some people, and he stressed the best way to experience the game's sound design is with headphones.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sound drives story, but story is “king”">Sound drives story, but story is “king”</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One note that Galante stressed was that the game's audio design had to serve the storytelling. For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hellblade II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the principal sound designer treated the binaural audio recordings from the actors as if it were an acoustic instrument. The reverb created from the performers' voices and the sound designers adjusting it in post-production with Visual Studio Technology (VST) helped put players in the state of mind that Senua was in.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/deep-dive-sound-design-for-the-living-world-in-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora" target="_self" data-discover="true">Deep Dive: Sound design for the living world in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The use of non-verbal voice capture – to create eerie noises and other off-putting sounds—proved especially important in helping to create an unsettling mood, all in service of Senua's perspective. Actor Edward Spence provided voice lines and non-verbal audio for a sequence where Senua travels through a sunken cave filled with the voices of the dead reaching out to her.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our voice is an extremely powerful instrument, and we should use it more when we do sound design," he said. "We also record nondialect stuff, so any possible noise you can make with your mouth is there because we want to be experimental and take it to the player's brain and make them feel uncomfortable. Because when we hear a voice that is not supposed to be there, that can make you feel weirded out by it."</span></p><p>Image via Ninja Theory/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Ninja Theory/Microsoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the major sequences in Ninja Theory's sequel was Seuna's confrontation with the Tyrant—an emotionally challenging and brutal boss battle against the protagonist's father. To present this boss battle as a sequence where Senua confronts a major source of trauma and abuse in her life, the developers combined the voices of six different voice actors to make the voice of the Tyrant. They utilized the 3D audio effects to give the sequence an oppressive and all-consuming feel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Galante later stated that, despite the massive benefits of binaural audio for immersion, it also presents several challenges. In addition to being time-consuming to produce, extensive post-production work is required to ensure the binaural audio works in the game for general audiences. Most importantly, Galante stated you need to have a clear vision of what you want to do when recording, as 3D audio is set in stone.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One mistake the Ninja Theory sound designer made came early into the making of the audio design for the Tyrant battle, and it was because the rest of the team didn't have a specific vision for what the fight would be like. When he revisited the first actor's recording following the team having a clearer idea of how the encounter would play out he found it wasn't quite suitable for the new concept, and he had to do the painstaking process of readjusting the 3D audio, which meant duplicating the track and inverting and altering the sound to make it work for the concept of six different actors providing voices for the sequence.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, he remarked that binaural audio has tremendous advantages for immersing players in the game. Still, because there have not been many uses in the creative fields, it can be challenging to find a clear vision and roadmap for its uses, but he expressed that it was worth trying and that he hoped more developers would try to pursue it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For now, there's not much documentation regarding binaural audio on the creative side as it's mostly used for scientific purposes and not often in a creative field," said Galante. "So everything we did, we learned by making mistakes, and we did make mistakes along the way. Because of this, recording binaural audio can be quite an expensive part of our job. So what I'm sharing here is our experience, and what worked for us, and is not the rules set in stone, but hopefully, this can help some of you if you want to do some binaural recording [for your games]."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

This year, however, the main headlines coming out of the show were not exactly positive, though they were certainly telling: Variations on “No One Was Around To Collect <em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</em>'s Award For Social Impact Following Layoffs” circulated a couple days after the show, painting a grim picture of a night meant to be celebratory. But while the broad arc of those stories was correct, they didn’t quite nail the particulars.&nbsp;</p><p>Though articles on sites like <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/we-all-got-laid-off-says-former-deck-nine-narrative-designer-after-no-one-was-around-to-pick-up-life-is-strange-double-exposures-gdc-awards-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/life-strange-double-exposure-award-gdc-2025-layoffs-1851771282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku</a> clarified in their body text that some former Deck Nine employees were present at GDC, a narrative prevailed that nobody who worked on <em>Double Exposure</em> was in the room when the big moment happened – that nothing more could’ve been done. This is incorrect.</p><p>"On the night of the GDC Awards, I was in the audience, sitting in the section meant for the general public," narrative designer Giselle Francis told Aftermath. "I was unaware that anything I had worked on had been nominated and had kind of went on a whim. When we won the award for Social Impact, and [presenter] Jay [Justice] announced that ‘The team was unable to be here this evening,’ I felt like I was going insane because I was right there! I was stunned and confused and hurt and angry. No one had told me anything. No one had given me the choice. If they had, I would have gladly gone on stage to accept the award."&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I felt like I was going insane because I was right there!</p></blockquote></figure><p>Francis has publicly taken issue with the way publications and pundits framed the moment because, well, she’s not “no one.” "So often Black people are erased from our accomplishments and from the conversation,” she <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bewarethesiren.bsky.social/post/3ll5j35iwz22r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Bluesky</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On <a href="https://gdconf.com/gdca#:~:text=Social%20Impact%20Award,players%20in%20a%20meaningful%20way." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its official website</a>, GDC says the Social Impact award is meant to recognize “a game that advances equality, justice, intersectionality, and/or sustainability, and works to positively impact the lives of its players in a meaningful way.” Though Deck Nine is not the original creator of the<em> Life Is Strange</em> series, a previous entry developed by the studio, <em>Life Is Strange: True Colors</em>, won the Games For Impact award at the Game Awards in 2021, as well as a GLAAD Media Award in 2022. Despite this impressive track record, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-hidden-nazi-symbols-were-the-tip-of-a-toxic-iceberg-at-life-is-strange-developer-deck-nine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2024 report from IGN</a> suggested that management wasn’t so supportive behind the scenes and allowed a toxic work environment to fester at the studio. According to the report, Deck Nine’s C-suite “protected multiple abusive leaders, encouraged crunch, and allowed bullying of individuals advocating internally for more authentic representation in<em> Life Is Strange</em>."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the past couple years, Deck Nine has been hit hard by layoffs, cutting around 30 employees <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/life-is-strange-dev-deck-nine-games-hit-with-staff-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in May 2023</a>, letting go of around 20 percent of remaining staff <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-true-colors-studio-deck-nine-lays-off-20-of-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in early 2024</a>, and then parting ways with an unspecified number of additional employees <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-double-exposure-developer-deck-nine-announces-its-second-round-of-layoffs-in-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in December 2024</a>. "This was an extremely difficult decision and reflects the challenging times many companies in our industry are currently facing," CEO Mark Lyons <a href="https://x.com/DeckNineGames/status/1865138496601575468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a statement</a> at the time of the most recent round of layoffs.</p><p>Francis told Aftermath that upon realizing that Deck Nine had failed to coordinate with current or former employees to accept the award, she began messaging members of her old team, at least five of whom were in town for GDC. It was only after Francis and others sounded alarm bells <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bewarethesiren.bsky.social/post/3lkrtg24ugs2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Bluesky</a> that Justice, the writer, game dev, and accessibility-focused consultant who presented the award, realized what was going on.</p><p>"As the presenter for the Social Impact award at the GDCAs, I was not told who the winner would be in advance. I found out as I read the teleprompter, at the same time as everyone else,” Justice told Aftermath. “I had been told in rehearsals that the – at the time, unnamed – winner would not be there, but I know Giselle, I knew she had worked on [<em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</em>], and I knew she was attending GDC this year, though I did not know she was in the audience at this time. So after I read the name I realized there was at least one person who could have accepted it. Still, with seconds to keep the show running on time, I took the award backstage and handed it off to event staff. I then checked my phone, where on Bluesky I had been tagged in a thread where another developer who worked on [<em>Double Exposure</em>] commented about winning the award."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Imagine what it could have done for our careers if we had been allowed to go on stage and speak? To have our faces streamed out to the thousands of people who were watching?</p></blockquote></figure><p>Justice proceeded to invite Francis and other former Deck Nine employees backstage for a photoshoot. They were then allowed to collect the award, spend the final 30 minutes of the show in the VIP section, and attend the GDC Awards afterparty, same as other nominees.&nbsp;</p><p>But as far as Francis is concerned, the kerfuffle still proved consequential.</p><p>“I keep thinking about all of the opportunities that were denied to us because of our exclusion,” she said. “All of us have since [we worked on <em>Double Exposure</em>] been laid off from Deck Nine, and most of us are still looking for jobs. I have been out of work for a year. Imagine what it could have done for our careers if we had been allowed to go on stage and speak? To have our faces streamed out to the thousands of people who were watching? To get a seat in the VIP section and actual time to mingle with the executives who might have been looking to hire?”</p><p>Another ex-Deck Nine employee who attended GDC, former staff writer Alice Camp, backed up Francis’ account of events, noting that in her estimate, at least nine current and former Deck Nine devs were present at GDC – including COO Jeff Litchford, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7306008799817912320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on LinkedIn</a> about attending the conference. Further, she told Aftermath that awards show organizers let ex-employees know the next day that Deck Nine had been informed about the nomination, even as studio co-owner Lucie Lyons <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lucielyons.bsky.social/post/3lkvkjzd6f22g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Bluesky</a> that she and others “were not aware.” “So glad you were there to accept the award,” she said in response to a since-deleted post from an ex-employee.</p><p>Based on Deck Nine’s actions and Lyons’ supportive reply, ex-employees in attendance assumed that the studio was not interested in receiving the award and decided it should go to a former lead whom they felt contributed a notable amount to <em>Double Exposure</em>’s social impact, but who had not traveled to GDC. However, on GDC’s final day, they received word from organizers that Deck Nine wanted the award after all – and that former employees would have to return it.&nbsp;</p><p>"When we heard from GDC that we needed to return the award, we thought there might've been a misunderstanding, so we tried to get in contact with someone at [Deck Nine],” said Camp. “The person we got through to told us that Jeff Litchford had just gotten on the plane and wouldn't be reachable until after the deadline GDC gave us. Later, a GDC organizer clarified for us that [Deck Nine] had in fact contacted them to ask for it back, so we returned it."</p><p>“We were forced to give the award back, and… it was because [Deck Nine] demanded it,” said Francis.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>Personally, I've been out of a job for an entire year.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Aftermath reached out to Deck Nine and GDC for additional details, but the former did not reply as of this publishing, and the latter declined to comment on record.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bewarethesiren.bsky.social/post/3ll5j35wljs2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On Bluesky</a>, Francis published the speech she would have given had she been able to come up on stage and accept the award.</p><p>"I did not prepare a speech because I did not even know we were nominated. But I am truly honored to accept this award on behalf of my amazing team,” she wrote, also thanking her narrative team colleagues by name. “When I was first getting into this industry, I was a college student, unsure of whether or not to change my major. The original <em>Life Is Strange</em> was one of the games that made that decision for me, so it was a full circle moment and an honor for me to get to work on this game: bruises, bumps, and all. … And to all of you out there with narrative jobs: all of these amazing people were let go, including myself. Personally, I've been out of a job for an entire year. We are all talented, award-winning writers and you won't regret having us on your team. So please, hire us.

Her defensive Ultimate helps your team and hurts your enemies at the same time with only one real weakness, and her healing primary attack has limited aim assist. She’s a great healer to get started with. Cloak, on the other hand, is somewhat similar to Scarlet Witch, who is a Duelist. He has a mid-range attack that deals steady damage, but he can also debuff enemies, reducing their visibility, dealing damage, and causing them to take more damage for a time. He also has an ability that grants invincibility for a few seconds. </p><p>Since you can instantly switch between them, fans of both healing and damaging will find a lot to love about this pair.</p><h2 id="h179605"><a id="play"></a>How should you play Cloak &amp; Dagger?</h2><p>Dagger is a very approachable healer since you don’t need to have great aim to heal well with her Lightforce Daggers bounce and bend towards allies and enemies.</p><figure id="" data-id="d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-recommend-id="image://d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dagger attacks enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dagger attacks enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Brian Barnett / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-recommend-id="image://d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dagger attacks enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In spite of this, there is still skill required to play her and her comrade to their maximum potential—and much of that involves how much time you spend playing as Cloak.

Switching to Cloak and back again will reload Lightforce Dagger slightly faster than the standard reload animation.</li><li><strong>Light Explosion:</strong> Throw a large rectangle of light towards your target, healing them a slight amount and boosting subsequent healing they receive. Use this on enemies who are getting hurt a lot before using Lightforce Dagger or Dagger Storm on them.</li><li><strong>Dagger Storm:</strong> Throw a ball of light that expands into a dome, healing all allies within it over time. The primary way Dagger can heal herself, so throw it at your feet if you are getting hurt and the other Strategist is far away. You can also switch to Cloak after creating Dagger Storm to fight back against approaching Dualists like Spider-Man, and more.</li><li><strong>From Shadow To Light (Team-Up: Passive):</strong> Teaming up with Moon Knight will give him the ability to create a sphere of invisibility for himself.</li></ul><h2 id="h179607"><a id="cloak"></a>What are Cloak’s Abilities?</h2><figure id="" data-id="5ede5e33df925e5af7c102b42f6a2923" data-recommend-id="image://5ede5e33df925e5af7c102b42f6a2923" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Cloak's abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Cloak's abilities." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Brian Barnett / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ede5e33df925e5af7c102b42f6a2923" data-recommend-id="image://5ede5e33df925e5af7c102b42f6a2923" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Cloak's abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Darkforce Cloak: </strong>Your primary attack. Like Scarlet Witch, this ability deals constant damage to enemies who are in the close and mid-range. So long as you hold the button down, and aim near the enemy, they’ll keep taking damage. A great way to strike back at enemies trying to take Dagger out.</li><li><strong>Eternal Bond (Ultimate):</strong> Same as Dagger’s. Four dashes, each aimable, lay down a Light/Dark power on the ground, damaging all enemies and healing all allies standing on it. A very powerful Ultimate ability, and one which charges very quickly. Be aware that enemies like Magneto can kill you in-between dashes, so try to have a teammate like Punisher or Star Lord bait it out before you use this, or have a Loki on your team to have two Eternal Bonds.</li><li><strong>Light’s Embrace:</strong> Switches to Dagger.</li><li><strong>Terror Cape: </strong>Throws a rectangle of dark energy in the direction you are aiming, significantly reducing visibility for enemies struck with it. Also deals damage and makes them Vulnerable, making them take more damage from all sources for a time. Use this every 12 seconds, when it comes off cooldown, against the most vulnerable targets on the enemy team.</li><li><strong>Dark Teleportation: </strong>Causes yourself, and nearby allies, to become invisible, untargetable, and quicker movement speed. A well-timed Dark Teleportation can completely negate certain enemy Ultimate abilities. Iron Man shooting his ultimate at your team? Switch to Cloak and use this ability, and you’ll take no damage. It only lasts a moment, so your timing will need to be precise.</li><li><strong>From Shadow To Light (Team-Up: Passive): </strong>Teaming up with Moon Knight will give him the ability to create a sphere of invisibility for himself.</li></ul><hr><p>With all these tips in hand, you are prepared to become a true master of both light and dark. Good luck!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But it’s the Yankees, so they’ll let it slide.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/mlb-reactions-to-yankees-torpedo-bats-range-from-its-terrible-to-they-should-send-a-few-over-here-044054221.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/mlb-reactions-to-yankees-torpedo-bats-range-from-its-terrible-to-they-should-send-a-few-over-here-044054221.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Other players were more open to the new bat design</a></span> or suggested it might not work for everyone. </p><p>It should be noted that other teams besides the Yankees used the new bats over the weekend, and there’s some evidence that they’ve been around since last season. What makes things confusing is that the Torpedo bat isn’t a singular design, but more a new way to build bats where you place more mass in a specific spot. There’s also some debate as to how helpful they are and if they really provide a massive advantage. It still takes a lot of skill to swing a bat fast and accurately enough to hit a home run against MLB’s skilled pitchers.</p><p> Still, in a sport where even a slim advantage can be very important, that hasn’t stopped teams from taking notice. <em>Yahoo Sports</em> reports that after opening weekend, 29 other teams are now looking to optimize their own equipment to create their own Torpedo bats. </p><p> . </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
