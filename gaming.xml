            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>sales have already topped a major milestone, even though the game has only been available for a day.</p>

<p>The Czech developer's latest action RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward" rel="nofollow">launched yesterday</a> across PC and consoles, but it's already managed to hit a million sales, according to a <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1887155255130866099" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Warhorse X account.</p>

<p>In the post, Warhorse thanks&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>players for "stepp[ing] into our world" and says it's "beyond grateful" for the support it's received so far, calling its game a "triumph". With sales numbers like that, it's hard to disagree.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m-artwork.jpg?itok=rmcvlmQ3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m-artwork.jpg?itok=-nUN7D57 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has already sold a million copies.</figcaption></figure><p>The popularity of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>probably shouldn't come as much of a surprise; Warhorse has clearly put a lot of effort into the game, especially if the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">sheer size and density of its script</a> is anything to go by.</p>

<p>Despite its impressive sales figures, <i>Deliverance 2&nbsp;</i>hasn't been without its fair share of controversy. Prior to release, the game was subject to rumors that it would be banned in Saudi Arabia due to "unskippable" gay romance scenes, claims that game director&nbsp;Daniel Vávra <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-rumors-director" rel="nofollow">shot down in no uncertain terms</a>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has attracted a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Very Positive rating</a> on Steam so far across 5,660 reviews (at time of writing), with players praising the game's presentation, narrative, and improvements over its predecessor.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is, it's the sequel to 2018's medieval action RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>. Like its predecessor, the game is an open-ended RPG set in 15th-century Bohemia.</p>




<p>You'll once again play as blacksmith's son Henry of Skalitz, navigating a (relatively) historically accurate world of political intrigue. Since&nbsp;<em>Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>emphasizes realism and historical detail, don't expect to see any dragons or goblins around Bohemia.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9n4w31hsmvvd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

I’m praying it won’t be as terrible as some of the other live-action anime adaptations we’ve been cursed with.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>For anyone living under a White Base-sized rock, <em>Gundam</em> is a sprawling sci-fi military epic that originated in 1979, spanning multiple universes and timelines with one thing in common: soldiers piloting giant robots that fight with big guns and laser swords. The production agreement was signed last month and the movie is tentatively called simply <em>Gundam</em>. Bandai Namco and Legendary didn’t share any information beyond that. We have no idea when the movie will come out, what parts of the mech warfare anime it will adapt, or if there’s even a script yet. The only other detail the two companies confirmed is that it will release in theaters worldwide when it arrives. </p><p>This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about a live-action <em>Gundam</em> project. One <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2021/film/news/gundam-live-action-movie-netflix-jordan-vogt-roberts-1234949518/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/gundam-live-action-movie-netflix-jordan-vogt-roberts-1234949518/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was first reported back in 2021</a></span> as a Netflix release with <em>Y The Last Man</em> comic series creator Brian K. Vaughn set to to write and produce it. Late last year, however,<em> Deadline</em> reported that the project had moved to Legendary with a new creative at the helm, Mickle. He’s been in charge of the Netflix sci-fi fantasy series <em>Sweet Tooth</em> about a post-pandemic world full of whimsical human mutants. He’s also currently working on an adaptation of the Western fantasy comic series <em>God Country</em>. </p><p>The official confirmation that a big-budget Gundam project is in the works will have long-time fans’ heads swirling with questions and skepticism. We’ve seen how poorly this can go before, from 2009's <em>Dragonball Evolution</em> to 2017's <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>. Netflix’s live-action remake of <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> didn’t impress many fans either, though the recent<em> One Piece </em>series has found a warmer reception. The closest thing we’ve had to a <em>Gundam</em> movie with real people are Guillermo del Toro’s <em>Pacific Rim</em> movies, so there is at least an existing blueprint to make the formula not suck. </p><p>In the meantime, there’s been no shortage of ongoing Gundam anime series and movies. The newest, called <em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em> (that’s actually the name) released in Japan last month and has seemed unexpectedly decent so far. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> has announced Takeover, the 24th season of Respawn's battle royale, which introduces a new way to grab weapons called Arsenals. Additionally, Assault Class Legends take center stage with several perk changes, while Ash and Ballistic gain strong buffs. POIs will now be visible from the drop ship so you'll be able to see exactly where you're headed. Finally, there's new ranked challenges and the introduction of Mythic weapons - in short, there's a lot to sink your teeth into.</p>
<p>Arsenals will be available in all game modes across Apex Legends from the start of the season, as a new way of obtaining weapons once you land from the drop ship. They'll be across the map near POIs, be visible from the moment you exit the drop ship and they'll have map icons as well as HUD elements.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Arsenals are small weapon caches that you can visit to change the weapons in your inventory or those you pick up at the beginning of a match, somewhat reducing the chaotic scramble to grab anything before you get shot. Arsenal locations are fixed but the weapons stored in them will be randomised. In a recent press event attended by Eurogamer, we learned that this was designed in part to give players better chances for getting the weapons they want and are more comfortable with.</p>
<figure>

<p>Speaking of weapons, Mythic guns are being added that will serve as the best version of weapons already available in-game, with their own twists on the classics. These weapons will be inspired by individual Legends, and the Season 24 addition is the Mythic R-301 inspired by Wraith. Complete with a new void-inspired look, the Mythic version comes with new animations you can equip on other R-301 skins you own as well.</p>
<p>In addition, every weapon this season has been buffed and most of them have received a damage increase as well as an alteration on their headshot multiplier. The Havoc, for example, is staying in the care package for this season and, while the Kraber remains a one-shot headshot weapon for most armor pieces it will become more than one-shot when faced with the new red helmet armor piece.</p>
<p>White, blue and purple helmets will be fully removed for Takeover to make the headshow damage value consistent for each weapon; it will no longer be dictated by the helmet a target wears. However, the only way you can get one will be to grab the red mythic grade helmet that will only show in late game care packages and in mythic bins. Once equipped, this helmet will turn the rest of your armor red. This is the only way to get this level of armor in Season 24 and armor evolution for every player for white, blue and purple armor pieces will be capped at level three. To help you stay alive longer with these changes, Shield Cells, Med Kits and Syringes are now faster to use.</p>

<p>Assault Class Legends have been buffed with new perks for Takeover. In addition to being able to access red supply bins and carry one extra ammo per stack, the Combat Reserve perk means they'll also have two extra ordinance slots specifically for grenades. Battle Surge is gained after an Assault Legend cracks an enemy shield - once active, they'll get a temporary speed boost, faster reload speed, and highlight the cracked target for the rest of the team. The Stowed Reload perk will auto-reload any stowed weapon after two seconds.</p>
<p>Ash and Ballistic in particular have seen more buffs for this season. Ash's ultimate will further and you can move through it faster with better end point detection, the tether will snare from its own location rather than at the enemy target's location. Her passive has changed, and she now has an omni-directional dash ability, Predator's Pursuit. Both Ash's ultimate and passive can be upgraded through the upgrade tree to have two charges. She'll still be able to see Deathboxes on the mini-map too.</p>
<p>Ballistic's sling upgrade and dual tactical charge has now been integrated with his base kit, plus it can now carry crate weapons with unlimited ammunition when active. His upgrade that used to allow extra charges has been replaced with an upgrade that doubles his tactical charges, meaning at tier three Ballistic can carry four charges of his Whistler. His Tempest also now has a team movement speed bonus added to it too.</p>

</figure>
<p>However, Support Class Legends have had their heal expert perk removed for the upcoming season to focus them more on reviving.</p>
<p>Road to Ranked is a fresh way for new players to get into Apex Legends' ranked mode. The previous account requirements for joining ranked has been removed and replaced with a set of challenges designed for you to prove you can make it in ranked modes. Road to ranked challenges are for you to show you're a good enough teamplayer and have the skills, as well as experience, to succeed in ranked mode.  However, if you're already a ranked player from previous seasons then you won't need to participate in these challenges - these are just for new players trying to get into ranked.</p>
<p>Your starting skill value will be influenced by your performance in non-ranked modes across Apex and there will be more transparency in displays for the lobby as well as improvements made to the end of match summary screen, Respawn has said. Account progression has a dedicated home and access away from the main ranked lobby for Takeover. Finally, weapon mastery trials have changed, and the system itself has been simplified with some of the more intense and complicated challenges being removed.</p>
<p>Apex Legends Takeover will see different creators from the Apex community helping to create and curate their own challenge and rewards all season. As well as a collection of new takeovers and limited-time modes. Some to look forward to are a second change mechanic and an OG-inspired loot pool takeover.</p>
<p>Alongside the creator modes and challenges, starting at season launch Rampart Care Packages will appear in all PUBS modes for the first three weeks of the season. Within these care packages are Rampart-designed weapon variants and this time they'll be dropping with three mythic R-301 weapons. Each variant has its own unique perks, for example, the red vermillion has increased critical hit damage and triggers thermite on knocked enemies.</p>

Nintendo was asked about that last one in its latest earnings call, and while the company’s president remained cagey, he also said Nintendo will continue to take its reputation for affordability into account when determining the final price, which some experts predict will be $400. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,194141,193706" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The original Switch launched at $300 back in 2017. Since then, however, inflation has driven up the cost of various components, and console makers this generation have declined their usual hardware price cuts, even raising prices in some regions instead. And while it remains to be seen just how good the specs of the Switch 2 might be, this time around the device will also be partially competing with higher-end PC gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. </p><p> “We are aware that inflation is currently rising and that the exchange rate environment has changed significantly since the launch of the Nintendo Switch in 2017,” Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told investors</a></span> in the company’s third-quarter earnings call this week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-considering-various-factors-for-switch-2-price-switch-1-cost-staying-the-same/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-considering-various-factors-for-switch-2-price-switch-1-cost-staying-the-same/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a translation by <em>Nintendo Everything</em></a></span>. “We also need to consider the affordable prices that customers expect from Nintendo products. When considering the price of our products, we believe that it is necessary to consider these factors from multiple angles. At this time, we cannot announce the specific price of the Nintendo Switch 2, but we are considering it taking into account various points.”</p><p>There will certainly be pressure to price the Switch 2 higher than its predecessor, especially because Nintendo traditionally tries to make profit off of its hardware rather than selling it under market value as a loss-leader for selling software. At the same time, Furukawa’s remarks suggest that, despite the wild popularity of the original Switch, Nintendo knows it risks pricing itself into irrelevance if it aims too high.</p><h2 id="h359659"><a id=""></a>What might the Switch 2 cost?</h2><p>So what will the Switch 2 actually cost? Last month, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-cost-analysts-weigh-in&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-cost-analysts-weigh-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN </em>interviewed several industry analysts</a></span> for their expert opinions. While some think Nintendo could charge as much as $500 for the new device, many are banking on it costing $400. This was the “sweet spot” for Rhys Elliot of MIDiA, and Ampere Analysis’ Piers Harding-Rolls told <em>IGN</em> he was currently basing his sales projections on the same number. At the same time, diehard fans upgrading in the first year would probably be willing to pay more. “Early adopters won’t be price sensitive, and prices can always be lowered,” Circana’s Mat Piscatella said. “Of course, people will want it to be lower than whatever it is it will be announced at.”</p><p>And what does history tell us Nintendo will do?<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/509976/nintendo-switch-2-cost-how-much-price&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/509976/nintendo-switch-2-cost-how-much-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon</em> assembled a chart</a></span> of inflation-adjusted prices of all of the company’s consoles. Starting with the launch of the Nintendo 64, the price has mostly hung around $350 to $400. That seems like the minimum price this time around considering the Switch OLED itself is still $350, and while the Switch 2 is rumored to have a cheaper LCD screen, its other features, including the Joy-Con with mouse-like functionality, are a lot beefier this time around. </p><p>  <strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512">21 Games We’d Love To See On The Nintendo Switch 2</a></span></p><p>Polygon also notes that Nintendo has a history of trying to undercut its competition when it comes to price. This is the tradition of “affordability” Furukawa was referencing in this week’s call. But that will be harder to do late into a console generation where the disc-less PS5 is $450 (<em>up</em> from its 2020 launch price of $400). The current cheapest Steam Deck is also $400, though you can also get refurbished ones for under $300 when they’re available. </p><p>My own gut tells me that making the Switch 2 cost $400 is the logical play here, with $450 the absolute max the company can charge, unless it debuts something truly stunning during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848">its April Switch 2 Direct</a></span> that will get people excited to upgrade. I showed my kids the original Switch 2 reveal and they haven’t asked about it again at all, content to keep toiling away in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> and <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>. </p><p>Families without a parent that writes about video games for a living might feel similarly unmoved about upgrading early if the price is too high. But all of that will depend on everything Nintendo still hasn’t told us about it’s next console. We’ll have to wait a couple more months for that info too. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s been a great launch for Warhorse Studios’ Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 as the studio has announced that the game has sold one million copies in a little over a day on the market.</p>



<p>“Over a million of you have stepped into our world,” the studio <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1887155255130866099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on social media</a>. “We’re beyond grateful for your support – thank you for making [Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2] a triumph!</p>



<p>In Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, our Grant Taylor-Hill called the game a “masterpiece”. </p>



<p>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is beautiful in every aspect,” the review reads. “It’s deeply authentic and riddled with emotion and catharsis, and the way the story comes together is just perfection.”</p>

<p>He also said: “This monumental medieval adventure will have you living a double life – but in this one, you’re a brave adventurer exploring the most faithful recreation of a real place I’ve ever seen. From ethereal sequences packed with tearjerker scenes to a phenomenal weather engine, and from genuinely interesting side activities to a neat little photo mode, I cannot find one major fault with this game.”</p>

That's easier said than done, as with numerous hostile alien species wandering the solar system, you'll have your work cut out for you. You can choose to grab a three-item bundle for just $5, six items for $10, and the full bundle for $20.</p><p>The game is an MMO-style online firt-person-shooter that can be played solo or cooperatively, with optional PvP content as well, where the best elements take the form of complex co-op content that involves puzzle-laden dungeons and raids.</p><h3>Pay $5 or more</h3><ul><li>Destiny 2: Forsaken Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: Shadowkeep expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Beyond Light expansion</li></ul><h3>Pay $10 or more</h3><ul><li>Destiny 2: Forsaken Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: Shadowkeep expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Beyond Light expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: The Witch Queen expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Lightfall expansion</li></ul><h3>Pay $20 or more</h3><ul><li>Destiny 2: Forsaken Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: Shadowkeep expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Beyond Light expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: The Witch Queen expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Lightfall expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: The Final Shape and Annual Pass expansion</li></ul><p>There are some things to note with this collection. 2018's Forsaken campaign is no longer accessible in Destiny 2--although you can play a few highlight missions--and the pack for it gives you access to a selection of powerful Exotic weapons and armor that you can earn in the game. The campaign for every expansion since Shadowkeep is still accessible, and while these can be hit-or-miss in their design, they're generally fun to play in a binge gaming session.</p><p>You will need Destiny 2, but the good news is that the game is free to download.

                <p>Electronic Arts has said that it might move around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>'s release window depending on which other games get released around the same time, presumably referring to GTA 6.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent investors call</a>, CEO Andrew Wilson said, "I do believe that this year might be a nuance to year relative to competition. There may be some things happening in the year that may cause us to think differently about our launch timing." While he didn't explicitly name any games that could impact Battlefield 6's release date, it's obvious that GTA 6 is one of them. GTA 6 is currently set to release in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">Fall 2025</a>, but it's always possible that it could be delayed.</p>

      </div>
<p>Yesterday, EA revealed that Battlefield 6 is due out during its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-battlefield-game-releasing-by-march-2026/1100-6529243/" data-ref-id="1100-6529243">2026 fiscal year</a>, meaning that it'll release sometime between April 1, 2025 and March 31, 2026. Battlefield games traditionally launch during fall, with the current rumor being an October 2025 release. However, if GTA 6 launches close to that time, EA is certainly willing to pivot.</p><p>Wilson said, "But if we got close to that timeframe and believe that this wasn't going to be a great window for us, then we would take a look at what an alternate window might be that would give us the appropriate time, energy, and player-acquisition opportunity for this Battlefield to be all that it needed to be."</p><p>Players can get a chance to test out the new Battlefield early through EA's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">Battlefield Labs community program soon</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-max-gaming-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Samsung announced its highly anticipated Galaxy S25 lineup last month, which comes with more or less the same design, but the internals have been improved a lot. The raw computational and graphical performance is far superior to the company's Galaxy S24 lineup, and it will make a lot of difference if you are into mobile gaming. A new comparison test was conducted between the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and the gaming performance reflects which device is better at running Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves.</p>
<h2>iPhone 16 Pro Max roasts the Galaxy S25 Ultra in Genshin Impact with a solid 95 FPS average compared to the latter's 60 FPS</h2>
<p>The App Store and Play Store offer a wide range of high-end games that make the right use of the chips in the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Galaxy S25 Ultra. A new comparison test conducted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DameTech">Dame Tech on YouTube</a> highlights the performance of the Galaxy S25 Ultra against the iPhone 16 Pro Max in Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves. The test will detail the FPS of both games, along with performance throttling and power usage on the flagship smartphones and how they compare against each other.</p>
<p>One important aspect to note at this point is that the iPhone has been the top-performing gaming device. Dame Tech mentions that despite the Galaxy S25 Ultra's exclusive high-resolution settings for games, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a better in-game resolution. We also have to take note that the Snapdragon 8 Elite's <a href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-8-elite-chip-for-galaxy-s25-is-faster/">exclusive chip</a> has better performance on paper, and it is reflected in the overall performance of both Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the comparison video below, the game settings were set to maximum, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra maintains a solid 59.2 FPS across Wuthering Waves with minor ups and downs. Additionally, the game plays smoothly with no stutter whatsoever, which goes on to show that Snapdragon's exclusive chip for the Galaxy S25 Ultra is pushing performance on par with the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max, which scored 59 FPS.</p>
<p>However, we have to consider the higher power draw for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, taking in as much as 7.2 Watts against 5.4 Watts on the iPhone. Additionally, the iPhone 16 Pro Max was played at a higher 1705 x 786 resolution compared to the Galaxy. Moreover, the test also revealed that the iPhone 16 Pro Max maintained almost the same level of frame rates while running more than 10 degrees cooler than the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It clearly shows that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-8-elite-performance-cores-overclocked-can-beat-a18-pro-in-single-score-benchmark/">A18 Pro chip</a> is handling the high-end game quite easily compared to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the iPhone 16 Pro Max crushes the Galaxy S25 Ultra in Genshin Impact on the highest settings, maintaining 95.2 FPS on average and reaching as high as 120 FPS on several occasions at a higher resolution. The Galaxy S25 Ultra seems to be running at a steady 60 FPS, likely due to a frame rate cap implemented by the game developers. The iPhone 16 Pro Max also ran a few degrees cooler.</p>

<p>While the iPhone 16 Pro Max performed better, Samsung has finally introduced a device that can compete against the iPhone. In addition, it is possibly the best gaming smartphone when it comes to competition from Android. We will share more details on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and its performance, so do stay tuned.</p>

While we knew the company was planning to share more about the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">on April 2nd</a>, now we have a time: 9 AM ET / 6 AM PT / 10 PM JST. If you were taking bets on this time, you would have won handily as this is generally the usual time Nintendo holds its big events. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fsuccessor%2Fen-us%2Fnintendo-direct%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored">The announcement on Nintendo’s website</a> didn’t contain any extra detail about the duration of the event or the exact breakdown of topics that’ll be covered, other than to say it “will share a closer look” at the new device.</p><p>Last month, the company finally confirmed the existence of its new console dubbed, helpfully, the Switch 2. The reveal itself was sparse on detail, only confirming that the console would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">be larger than its predecessor</a> and that its Joy-Con controllers appear to attach <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">via some kind of magnetic action</a>. Because of the reveal’s relative lack of concrete information, we’re left with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24344718/nintendo-switch-2-specs-date-price-launch-games-mario-kart">so many questions about the new console</a>. Nevertheless, there was still lots of speculation about what the Switch 2 could possibly do. Theories were put forth that the new Joy-Cons contained some kind of mouse functionality and that the extra button on the right Joy-Con was related to some kind of party chat feature. Hopefully, Nintendo will let us know those if theories were correct during the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct on Wednesday, April 2nd bright and early at 9 AM.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo has added a small but important detail about the Switch 2 Direct on April 2: It will begin at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET. The streaming event will be focused on the recently revealed system and promises "a closer look at <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=switch+2+gamespot&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1887139391266558216" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, Nintendo revealed the specific starting time for the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/nintendo-direct/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct in April</a>. The event was previously unveiled when the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/">officially pulled back the curtain on Switch 2</a> last month with a reveal trailer. So far, Nintendo has confirmed the name for the system and what it looks like, but a lot of information is still missing. For instance, there is no release date, price, or launch lineup for Switch 2--particulars that should be addressed at the Direct in April.</p><p dir="ltr">What we do know is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/">Switch 2 will be backwards compatible with Switch games--with some caveats</a>. Super Mario Bros. Wonder was showcased as a game that will work on both consoles. We know that the Joy-Cons are bigger and attach via a magnetic system, instead of sliding onto the tablet with rails. We also know that Nintendo is strongly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-mario-kart-may-have-been-revealed-in-switch-2-trailer/1100-6528850/">teasing a new Mario Kart game for the system</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this week, EA CEO Andrew Wilson hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-may-return-to-nintendo-with-switch-2-ea-ceo-hints/1100-6529253/">the Madden NFL and EA Sports FC franchises could appear on Switch 2</a>. They join a long list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/">rumored games for Switch 2</a>, such as Assassin's Creed Shadows, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and Halo: The Master Chief Collection. It's also unclear if first-party games previously announced for the original Switch, such as Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, could make an appearance on the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with the Nintendo Direct, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-to-try-the-switch-2-before-its-released/1100-6528849/">Nintendo is also holding Switch 2 experience events</a> in cities across the world. They begin in early April in places like New York City and Paris, continuing into May in Amsterdam and Seoul.</p>

console and that Nintendo could always lower the price in the future.</p><p>MIDiA's Rhys Elliot did note that if the Switch 2 is in short supply at launch--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-making-preparations-to-discourage-potential-switch-2-scalpers/1100-6529220/">something Nintendo is aiming to avoid</a>--the price could start at $500. Manufacturing costs could also play a role in the Switch 2 having a high launch price, as Nintendo's business currently relies heavily on generating profit from Switch console sales. Overall, Elliot does expect $400 to be the sweet spot for the Switch 2 when it eventually arrives.</p><p>At $400, the Switch 2 launch price will be considerably higher than the current Switch console's $300 price tag, while the OLED model retails for $350. At the same time, this does make it more affordable than most handheld gaming PCs, as depending on the model and its configuration, they typically start from around $500 and can be as expensive as $800.</p><p>The Switch 2 could also be good value for money <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">thanks to backwards compatibility</a>, and with games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yes-metroid-prime-4-is-still-coming-out-in-2025/1100-6529216/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Pokemon Legends Z-A sharing the same 2025 launch window</a>, analysts are predicting that it'll be a big seller for Nintendo this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/605588/rift-of-the-necrodancer-review-music-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>, a new music game from the creators of the music roguelike <em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em>, solves the problem of exploring a big library of tracks with a simple idea: a story mode.</p><p>In <em>Rift</em>, you have to press buttons in time with notes that appear on lanes in front of you, similar to games like <em>Guitar Hero</em>. You only have three lanes to worry about, but the tracks get complex because the “notes” are actually enemies with different movement patterns. A green slime just takes one hit to defeat, for example, but a gold bat takes three beats to eliminate, and with each hit, it hops to another lane.</p><p>If you want, you can immediately jump into the game’s library, which features more than 30 tracks. (Though you’ll need to accrue “diamonds” to unlock some of them.) The songs are killer — I happily tapped my foot to just about every one I played. But because the songs are originals, there aren’t familiar licensed tunes to jump into like with <em>Guitar Hero,</em> so it can be daunting to know where to start.</p><p>That’s why I played <em>Rift</em>’s story mode. The plot doesn’t really matter — you play as Cadence, the main character from <em>Crypt</em>, as you try and solve the mystery of the rifts that spawn the monsters in the songs — but it provides a logical way to work through the music, especially as the songs ramp up in difficulty. It’s kind of like an album: <em>Rift</em>’s songs have clearly been put in a certain order with intention, and playing through that order through the story mode is a great way to experience them, at least at first. There are fun <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/3/11157462/rhythm-heaven-megamix-nintendo-3ds"><em>Rhythm Heaven</em>-like minigames</a>, epic boss battles, and charming cartoon art to accompany the story beats, too. (If you’ve played <em>Crypt</em>, you’ll recognize some familiar faces.)</p><p>Even on medium difficulty, <em>Rift</em> can get <em>tough</em>. In some of the later tracks, the tempo is fast, and the monsters fly down the lanes at a rapid rate and in tricky combinations. Fortunately, the game has a great practice mode that lets you repeat specific portions of songs at a significantly reduced speed so that you can get your timing down. You can also ease down to a lower difficulty whenever you want. And one time, I failed a song enough times that the game told me I could move on without finishing it. While I appreciated the gesture, it made me more determined to beat it. Which I did!</p><p>It took me about five hours to play through <em>Rift</em>’s story. When I was done, I was surprised to find myself immediately jumping into the game’s full tracklist to play some songs again. If I hadn’t played through the story mode, I might not have discovered some of the game’s best music.</p><p>Rift of the NecroDancer<em> launches today on PC.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We knew it was coming, but Nintendo has now confirmed an exact time for its dedicated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> Direct.</p>
<p>The company will host a Nintendo Direct focused on its upcoming Switch successor on 2nd April, at 2pm UK time.</p>
<p>For those of you sitting across the pond, that's 6am PST.</p>

</figure>
<p>But while Nintendo has now shared an actual time for its Direct with us all, it is still keeping further specifics under wraps for now. The upcoming showcase will simply offer "a closer look at Nintendo Switch 2", is all the company has said for the time being.</p>
<p>Even so, from the earlier Switch 2 reveal, we can presume we will hear more about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">Joy-Con's apparent mouse functionality</a>, and maybe even discover what exactly that mysterious button on the right-hand Joy-Con does.</p>
<p>We should also hear more about what games will be heading to Switch 2. Last month's announcement teaser did give us a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">glimpse of a new Mario Kart title</a>, complete with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kongs-new-look-in-switch-2-mario-kart-approved-by-former-rare-artist">fresh looking Donkey Kong</a>. Maybe we will find out if a theory currently making the rounds, which suggests the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-9-fan-speculation-points-to-fuel-tank-gameplay">addition of fuel tanks in Mario Kart may shake up gameplay</a>, will prove accurate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it has been a hot minute since we last heard anything on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">long-in-development Metroid Prime 4</a> or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, but perhaps this will change on 2nd April.</p>
<p>Nintendo will hopefully give us a release date too. For now, the console still just has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">vague 2025 window tied to it</a>. What do you think (or hope) we will see?</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo-related news, EA has become one of the first publishers to discuss - in broad terms - its plans for Switch 2. In fact, the company has implied it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-eyeing-nintendo-switch-2-for-several-key-franchises">has its eye on Nintendo's console for several of its key franchises</a>, including EA Sports FC and Madden.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Exclusives Are Essential to Its Success, Says CEO]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-exclusives-are-essential-to-its-success-says-ceo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be fully backward compatible with Switch titles. However, fans have been wondering for how long Nintendo would continue to release games for the original Switch.</p>
<p>Nintendo CEO Shuntaro Furukawa touched on the subject in the company's usual post-quarterly earnings <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q&amp;A with investors</a>. The executive said that more original Switch games will be made, but at the same time, he highlighted the importance of Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives.</p>
<p><em>We have already announced Pokémon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4 Beyond for Nintendo Switch in 2025. We will continue developing Nintendo Switch titles, but launching exclusive games for Nintendo Switch 2 is essential for its success. However, we aim to ensure a smooth transition between the two platforms.</em></p>
<p>This tells us that it may not be long before we get the first Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives, as Nintendo has a vested interest in getting users to transition from one generation to another. Besides, the original Switch is clearly on a downward trajectory for its sales, as evidenced even in the last quarter during which 'only' 4.82 million units were sold. Still, it was enough to allow the hybrid console to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-sales-surpass-150-million-units-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">break the big 150 million sales milestone</a>.</p>
<p>Third-party may leave behind the original Nintendo Switch even quicker. Since they already largely switched from PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X as the default targets for new games, it won't make much sense for them to spend time trying to make more complex titles fit the aging Switch hardware when there's a new platform with support for technologies like NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS).</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Nintendo Switch 2 is slated to launch later this year. Between April and June, hands-on events will take place worldwide; before that, on April 2, Nintendo will unveil many more details about the new console. So far, analysts have <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-hit-all-the-right-notes-according-to-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responded positively</a> to the brief teaser trailer shared in January.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-flopped-because-of-no-shared-world-elements-ea-says.1100790/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has released a new financial earnings call for the third quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and in the call, CEO Andrew Wilson expresses what appears to be a theory as to why&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>flopped.</p>

<p>Recently, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">admitted</a> that <i>Veilguard&nbsp;</i>and flagship sports game&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>had both "underperformed", and in the new <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">call</a>, Wilson seems to draw a link between&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s failure and its lack of "shared world elements".</p>

<p>He says EA's games need to "directly connect" to players, who he says "increasingly seek shared world features and deeper engagement". That's likely a reference to&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s nature as a single-player-only title, rather than a game with multiplayer elements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-flop-live-service-ea-archery.jpg?itok=2SNx5ha0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-flop-live-service-ea-archery.jpg?itok=Hahr8U2D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA seems to think&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>flopped because it had no "shared world elements".</figcaption></figure><p>At one stage, it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-past-and-present-of-dragon-age-4-1833913351" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;that a version of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>(which didn't have its name yet at this point) which would incorporate live service elements was in development.</p>

<p>However, this version was subsequently scrapped (assuming the reports of its existence are correct), leading to&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>'s single-player focus. It seems that EA's management now regrets getting rid of those live service elements.</p>

<p>There is, of course, no guarantee that&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>would have performed any better if it did have the "shared world" elements EA seems so wistful about. After all,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>is undeniably a live service title, and it, too, underperformed.</p>

<p>Wilson, however, puts this down to people sticking with previous&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC&nbsp;</em>titles and not buying the new one, as well as "lower-than-expected engagement" due to "specific issues with balance".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed-play.jpg?itok=aO4FZa9y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed-play.jpg?itok=T3jxwU9x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports FC 25</em>'s underperformance had nothing to do with live service, but&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s apparently did. Hmm.</figcaption></figure><p>I can't imagine that many of the people who felt dissatisfied with&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>would have been happier if the game had featured the "shared world elements" EA regrets not putting in, honestly.</p>

<p>It's hard to imagine that direction would have prevented the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">BioWare layoffs that followed</a>, nor the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow">departure</a> of <i>Veilguard&nbsp;</i>director Corinne Busche from the studio.</p>

<p>In any case, EA is probably looking very carefully at the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>game now. I'd be very surprised indeed if the publisher didn't try to ensure that some sort of "shared world elements" are present in that game, so we'll have to see how&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect 4&nbsp;</em>(name obviously not final) performs.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the call, EA confirms that the next&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game will be launching in 2026 and reaffirms that you can sign up to get a chance to test it right now via the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-labs-announced-ea" rel="nofollow">Battlefield Labs initiative</a>.</p>

<p>The company also commits to a new $1 billion share buyback scheme, which feels like exactly the kind of thing you'd expect from a studio that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">paid its CEO $25 million in 2023</a> despite hundreds of layoffs. Stay tuned for more.</p>

And...yeah! It’s looking good. It’s looking like if the director of <em>Monsters</em> made a <em>Jurassic World</em> movie. For good reason.</p><p>Set five years after 2022's abysmal&nbsp;<em>Jurassic World Dominion</em>, this seventh movie in the franchise appears to be a new attempt at a fresh start, with an entirely new cast and director Gareth Edwards helming the project. It stars Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali and Jonathan Bailey as a team of action-paleontologists, sent to what <em>might</em> be Isla Sorna (it’s referred to in the trailer as the research island for the original park) to recover DNA from the three largest dinos living on the island.

It’ll be interesting to see if his long absence from enormo-budget filmmaking will have allowed a better focus of his more personal, tell-don’t-show attitude toward threats, when applied to a crowd-pleaser like <em>Jurassic Park</em>/<em>World</em>. The trailer seems positive, to me. Sure, there are loads of dinosaurs, because of course there are, but it all feels more cramped, more claustrophobic, than the bland photography of the three previous films.</p><p>We’ll find out if it all comes together on July 2.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>OverActive Media, the parent company behind the Call of Duty League’s Toronto Ultra, has published a statement following the recent Major tournament held in Madrid, Spain. In a press release, it was confirmed that Major I, the first sizeable tournament of the CDL 2025 season, was ‘the most successful Major (they) have ever hosted’.</p>



<p>It was revealed that 80% of attendees at the venue in the Spanish city were from <strong>outside </strong>the country and that 12,000 people in total flocked to the Caja Mágica arena.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-defining-moment">‘A Defining Moment’</h2>



<p>OverActive Media’s CEO, Adam Adamou, explained in the press release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>By bringing together top-tier talent, innovative strategies, and fresh ideas, we are strengthening our connections with fans while unlocking new revenue streams and growth opportunities. </p>



<p>The energy in&nbsp;Madrid&nbsp;and the success of our acquisitions reaffirm our commitment to building a global esports company that entertains millions while creating sustainable growth.</p>



<p>Call of Duty League Major I was the most successful Major we have ever hosted. We sold more than 12,000 tickets, with more than 80% traveling from outside&nbsp;Spain, driving tourism and significant economic impact for the local community. </p>



<p>The energy in the arena, the intense competition, and the global engagement made this event a defining moment for the Call of Duty League and a clear statement on the sustainable growth of our esports presence in&nbsp;Europe.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I had the pleasure of attending the CDL Major in Madrid and caught up with many of the best Call of Duty players in the world. I was able to sit down with Atlanta FaZe, the team that won the tournament after a gruelling Grand Final against the LA Thieves.</p>



<p>The CDL Major I event was a boon to kickstart the latest competitive season. More than 233,000 consecutive viewers tuned in from around the world, and the showcase proved that Europe can be one of the most lucrative regions to host further Call of Duty events. This was the first CDL Major to take place in Europe in the history of the tournament.</p>



<p>Next, the Call of Duty League will head back to the United States, with Major II taking place in Texas in March 2025.</p>



<p>Later this year, in the summer, Toronto Ultra will host another CDL event – the Call of Duty League Championship tournament in Canada.</p>
