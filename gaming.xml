			<p>Herdling is as much of an experience as it is a game. There is gameplay as you gather and herd goat-like animals through the world, but it’s there to further your emotional travels with these creatures. It’s a game for dreamers, for the innocent, for those who delighted in floating around in Thatgamecompany’s Journey.</p>
<p><iframe title="Herdling - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ohjV5xwMuxU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game opens with the unnamed and silent protagonist waking up in an underpass and walking into a decaying urban sprawl. Here they meet their first Calicorn, shaggy horned creatures that come in different shapes and sizes, from stately elders who sit on their hindquarters and tower above our hero, to small bundles of fluff and feathers who gamble about like excited rabbits. A few button presses later, and you can start herding your tame Calicorn through the city and out to pastures new.</p>


<p>As you progress through the various biomes, you can pick up more Calicorns and soon have a fairly large herd to move around, an act that does become a little frustrating due to the control mechanism. You can direct the Calicorns only if you are behind one of them, and then use the joystick to move a flowery cursor to indicate where the Calicorns should move next. However, as you have to do this when the Calicorns are moving, sometimes at speed, and the cursor can dance across the world as the distance and angle between yourself and the Calicorns constantly changes. It feels like a control system designed for a mouse that had to be deployed into a console game, which uses less precise controllers.</p>


<p>The Calicorns can be powered up by flowers; Wade through a patch of blue blooms and you gain a speed boost to use when you wish, while red will extend the boost. These are used when you need to climb up slippery rock slopes or crash through tough bushes, but are also liberally spread throughout meadows. Here you can gallop across wide areas, the wind racing, the music soaring as you do, and it’s moment of pure delight.</p>
<p>There are some very simple puzzles, most of which involve finding a path to a stranded Calicorn or pushing a switch or lever, and you can lose a Calicron in a couple of sections. The first way for one to die is if it wanders off a crumbling cliff and plummets like a lemming, but the second comes from the skies. The chapters near the end of the game include monstrous bird creatures which sit on ledges and watch your fluffy friends as you wander through the land. The birds are activated by trampling into specific rock formations, and areas of the game are littered with these, meaning you have to carefully manage the herd and use precise instructions, something that becomes increasingly difficult as your herd grows.</p>

<p>Each chapter ends with a campfire where you can bond more with your horned friends. You can assign each one a name of your choice, pet them, groom them, and later play fetch. While these activities are pleasant, they are fairly limited, and once you have performed each action a couple of times, there appears to be no apparent incentive to do them again. You herd can also get injured, their coats becoming red with blood but this does not seem to affect them in any other way. Video game logic applies here and feeding the beasts fruit that can be harvested from convenient bushes quickly heals all injuries, your Calicorn will be happy bundle of fluff within seconds.&nbsp; You can also pick up additional adornments for the Calicorns and while it is a nice idea, they do end up looking like badly dressed Christmas trees.</p>
<p>Like Journey there is no dialogue and the story is told through imagery, starting with a billboard in the city that shows Calicorns in their native home. There are also murals to discover and images in dreams that hint at a larger story, but how you interpret these is up to you. Music &nbsp;from composer Joel Schoch plays a huge part, with calming flutes in the quieter moments and rambunctious trills&nbsp; when racing through fields, and when the music does quieten there are emotive sounds of winds and forests to immerse you, it is a great game to play using headphones.</p>

<p>Your enjoyment of Herdling will depend entirely if you can connect with the Calicorns, do you care about their future? For the first three of the roughly four hours of game time, I did. I rescued them from wrecked trains, fed them, named them after my pets and happily ran through forests watching the smaller Calicorn tails bobbing up and down like bunnies. However, as the herd grew and become more unwieldly I started to lose my patience with the control mechanic and started consciously sacrificing Calicorns just so I could plough through another Bird monster area, While it might not have been quite so much like real life herding, a simpler mechanic, such as direct line from the protagonist to the spot you want the herd to move to, without having to be behind the Calicorns, would have removed all my frustrations from the game and all the Calicrons would be alive. In other words I am blaming the developers for the casual murder of the fluffballs, shame on them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA Sports College Football 26 was the best-selling game in the United States (US) for July 2026. That marks the second-straight year that EA Sports College Football took the top spot the month it was released.</p>



<p>According to the latest data from Circana, College Football 26 takes the top spot over from Elden Ring: Nightreign, which led the way in May and June. For July, Nightreign finds itself at 16th.</p>



<p>Following College Football 26 comes, well, College Football 26 again. At least, in a way. The EA Sports MVP Bundle, which includes both College Football 26 and Madden 26, came in second in sales. That was followed up by Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive Donkey Kong Bananza, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>As far as new games finding themselves in the Top 20, there were 5 games joining the fray. Four of the new releases all were in the Top 5, while the other new release, Grounded 2, came in eighth.</p>



<p>With five new releases in the Top 20, as well as a return of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, that means six games fell out of the list. Leaving the Top 20 were Stellar Blade, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Star Wars: Battlefront 2, Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, Mario Kart World, and Elden Ring.</p>

Lucas takes a break from Hollywood stardom to lay the smack down on any baddies standing in his way, with grappling prowess and a fully-weaponized skateboard (meaning he hits people with it). Roxie meanwhile brings her signature sword-slicing and dicing into the fray as a quick-hitting, speedy half-ninja, with a kit complete with smoke bombs and moves that turn her into a blender on the battlefield.</p><p>In <em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em>, members of Toronto’s coolest band, Sex Bob-omb, are kidnapped and their instruments stolen as the city is terrorized by demons, vegans and robots. Scott Pilgrim, Ramona Flowers and other unlikely allies including Lucas and Roxie must bash their way across the city, from its streets to its beaches and maybe even back in time to save the band, the city and the world. A total of seven playable fighters will be featured, with Scott and Ramona set to gain more confirmed allies ahead of <em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em>‘s release.</p><p>Battle it out across a wild, video game warped Toronto with bursting colors and deep-cut Scott Pilgrim references, completing quests while defeating the gangs that rule over different parts of the city. Enemies can be dispatched with each character’s unique, upgradable toolkit, or with different items found in the game’s highly interactable environment, from baseball bats to demonic rods, turnips and more. Featuring a brand-new storyline co-written by Bryan Lee O’Malley and the team at Tribute Games, as well as all-new music from Scott Pilgrim alumni Anamanaguchi, <em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> delivers a bold new chapter in the franchise for longtime fans and newcomers alike.</p></blockquote><p><em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,254 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,808 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,585 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,296 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, Switch, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,100 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2640950/Scott_Pilgrim_EX/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in early 2026.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>When you think Ubisoft, you usually think about its tentpole franchises like Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six Siege, but the company has also released several great small-scale games across PC, console, and mobile. Some of these IP have been dormant for years, but Atari has inked a new deal to acquire five Ubisoft classics and bring them to modern platforms.</p><p>As part of the deal, Atari has purchased the IP for Cold Fear, I Am Alive, Grow Home, Grow Up, and Child of Eden. These were all one-off games (save for Grow Home and Grow Up) published by Ubisoft and developed by numerous teams, but in terms of console releases, most of them remained locked to Xbox 360 and PS3. Aside from their PC, Xbox 360, and PC releases.</p><p>"Millions of players have experienced these worlds over the years, and this will open the door for longtime players to revisit those memories while inviting new audiences to discover them for the first time," Ubisoft VP of New Business Deborah Papiernik said in a press statement (via <a href="https://businesswire.com/news/home/20250826081788/en/Atari-Announces-Strategic-IP-Agreement-With-Ubisoft-To-Revive-Five-Acclaimed-Titles" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BusinessWire</a>). "Atari has a rich gaming legacy and deep appreciation for these classic titles, and we're excited to see how they'll evolve and connect with players in fresh, meaningful ways."</p><p>Atari has picked a solid collection of games, as I Am Alive offered a tense survival experience in a post-apocalyptic world, Cold Fear played like The Thing meets Resident Evil, and the Grow games are delightful platformers. Child of Eden is the real draw here, as the 2011 game from Tetris Effect director Tetsuya Mizuguchi was a music-powered rail-shooter that appealed to fans of the developer's previous work on Rez and Lumines.</p><p>Meanwhile, Atari has been on a strategic tear lately with acquisitions. It recently became <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamworld-creator-acquired-by-atari-in-5-million-deal/1100-6533517/" data-ref-id="1100-6533517">the majority owner of Thunderful Group</a>--the company behind the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/steamworld-build/">SteamWorld games</a>--and the last couple of years saw it double down on its retro focus by acquiring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-buys-studio-that-makes-very-good-atari-games-and-remasters/1100-6518773/">Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse</a>, both of which specialize in remasters of classic games. Atari also purchased the rights to the Transport Tycoon IP <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-buys-ancient-rival-intellivision-insists-the-amico-is-still-coming/1100-6523679/">and its former rival, Intellivision</a>.</p><p>This isn't the only legacy gaming brand making a big comeback lately, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/acclaim-is-coming-back-as-game-publisher-focused-on-reviving-classic-franchises/1100-6529576/">as Acclaim was revived last year</a>. The company has pledged to support indie developers and "reignite" classic franchises, and on September 10, Acclaim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/play-acclaim-showcase-is-coming-in-september/1100-6534289/">will show what it's working on with a dedicated showcase event</a>.</p><p>As for Ubisoft, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-new-spun-off-division-is-being-led-by-yves-guillemots-son-and-he-loves-genai/1100-6533205/">it's refocusing some its efforts with a new subsidiary</a>--funded in part by Tencent--that will be led by Ubisoft Montreal veteran Christophe Derennes and Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's own son, Charlie Guillemot.</p>

In the US, for those in a PT timezone, it's running from August 28 to September 1, whereas in the ET timezone, the UK, and Japan, it's running from August 29 to September 1--it's all at the same time; the dates just differ because of timezone differences.</p><h4 dir="ltr">Start Date</h4><ul><li dir="ltr">August 28, 9 PM PT</li><li dir="ltr">August 29, 12 AM ET / 4 AM UTC / 1 PM JST</li></ul><h4 dir="ltr">End Date</h4><ul><li dir="ltr">September 1, 9 PM PT</li><li dir="ltr">September 2, 12 AM ET / 4 AM UTC / 1 PM JST</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">How can I sign up to the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test?</h3><p dir="ltr">All you need to do is head to your platform of choice, which includes <a href="https://store.playstation.com/product/JP0177-PPSA30664_00-SONICRACINGCWONT" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9PGDMMC6QGGP" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/sonic-racing-crossworlds-open-network-test-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2486820/Sonic_Racing_CrossWorlds/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, or <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/sonic-racing-crossworlds-sonic-racing-crossworlds-open-network-test-7aec63" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic</a>, and download the Open Network Test through their respective storefronts. After that, you'll be able to play! You can already preload the test ahead of its start time this week.</p><h3 dir="ltr">What's included in the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test?</h3><p dir="ltr">There's quite a lot available in the test, notably nine whole courses to choose from and zip through like Metal Harbour, Mystic Jungle, and Colorful Mall. Amongst all of those there are also seven CrossWorlds to get transported to while you're racing, such as Magma Planet and Holoska.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll have 12 characters to play as, obviously including Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Shadow, and on August 31 you'll also be able to play as Persona 5's Joker--more on that in a moment. The test will feature 21 vehicles across five different types, and you'll have 42 gadgets to modify your playstyle.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of modes, there's the standard Grand Prix, which typically contains four races in one cup, World Match--which sees you racing online against 11 other players and features a World Rank you can increase--and Time Trials, a mode that lets you race for the best time on various tracks.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also the Joker Festival, which starts August 31 and runs for 24 hours from 12:01 AM ET. The event sees players split into three different teams, where you can earn points and Persona-themed titles. Whichever team comes out on top at the end of the event will also win an exclusive title. It is probably worth noting that save data does not carry over to the full game, however.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of the technical details, you also don't need a PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass subscription to play online, though to play the World Match and Festival modes on Nintendo Switch you will need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Cross-play is also enabled for the network test.</p><p dir="ltr">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is out September 25, and will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

Plenty of games like Build A Rocket Boy's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Mindseye</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will land a sweet spot in a highly-watched showcase and still struggle to stick the landing. Succeeding in an event like Gamescom Opening Night Live, the Future Games Show or an Xbox Showcase takes strategy and a ton of forethought.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But what can a developer do besides "make a good trailer?" And how do they make their game appealing to showcase curators like Xbox, The Game Awards, or Future? According to Xbox head of premiere broadcasts Tina Amini, the answer to both question comes down to one word: "surprise."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In conversations after this year's Xbox Showcase, Amini and other developers from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/skybound-spins-up-new-fighting-game-studio-quarter-up">Quarter Up</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/dungeons-of-hinterberg-shows-how-all-games-can-feel-like-vacations-">Microbird Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pinecreekgames.com/">Pine Creek Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> explained how exploring that surprise factor helps developers succeed in broadcasts like this year's Xbox Showcase (this conversation took place before </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/zenimax-staff-lambast-inhumane-xbox-layoffs-it-s-difficult-to-work-when-you-re-looking-at-a-graveyard-">Microsoft laid off 9,000 employees</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, among them hundreds of game developers at companies like King, Zenimax, Activision Blizzard, and beyond).&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not just about sticking a "world reveal" tag in front of your trailer—it's using those critical moment in the months before launch to show curators and players why they can't look away from your game.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/steam-defaults-to-language-specific-review-scores-to-provide-a-better-indication-of-user-sentiment-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Steam defaults to language-specific review scores to provide 'a better indication of user sentiment'</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Creating contrast between your game and big first-party hits">Creating contrast between your game and big first-party hits</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While other organizations may only run one or two livestreaming broadcasts per year, Amini explained her job is to produce nine events across a 12-month cycle. These include high-profile streams like the SGF and Gamescom-aligned showcases, and more curated affairs like the January Developer Direct.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amini and her Xbox colleagues plan these events around major Xbox marketing beats like this year's reveal of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-first-xbox-handhelds-have-finally-arrived">ROG Xbox Ally,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or major game unveilings like Obsidian Entertainment's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/f_MpCHtM6U0?si=0jgYuo1vOTlB86T1">Grounded 2</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but then take a broad look at developers at third-party developers (often ones with some kind of relationship with Microsoft) to fill out the show.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For the June showcase in particular, we start talking internally by the end of the [prior] year, but it's not until January where conversations really start solidifying," Amini said in regards to picking games to show off. Developers can sometimes pitch as little as a slide deck or as much as a development build to get her team's attention.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want to get representation across the industry...because we know our audience is diverse too," she said, pointing to player reactions for the reveal of indie game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/u68h-Af1HiA">There Are No Ghosts At The Grand</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from developer Friday Sundae.

Pine Creek Games CEO Benjamin Salqvist explained that when his studio's game Winter Burrow debuted in the 2023 Xbox Showcase, the "hand-drawn comic book art style" proved to be a distinct differentiator</span></p><p>Image via Pine Creek Games/Noodlecake.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>There Are No Ghosts At The Grand</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was selected this year as part of what Amini described as a "business message" of promoting Xbox Play Anywhere, selling the different kinds of games that might be appropriate across the wide range of devices that can support Xbox Game Pass. But no matter what Xbox's business message is, Amini's old journalism instincts still guide her to look for the "news factor" of the games they select.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The news factor doesn't have to be a world premiere or a big launch date announcement (though those are both fine options if that's your pitch to Xbox). If you previously announced a game and players haven't heard from it in a while, it showing up with a fresh new trailer can be the news factor. Shadow dropping a game can be a news factor. Even a presentation of the development team can be the news factor.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/the-methodical-marketing-beats-behind-overnight-success-balatro" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Balatro publisher Playstack delivered a marketing masterclass</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here Amini referred to Sandfall Interactive's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/o9KQ4rlymEQ">which made its debut</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the 2024 Xbox Showcase (the game made its debut on Xbox Game Pass as well as PC and PlayStation 5).

"It's a multi-step process," he explained. "After getting invited to apply, you'll send a storyboard, then an animatic, and so on. At each of these stages there's a good chance your game will be eliminated because let's face it, there are so many great games out there competing for these spots."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amini said in this part of the process her "writers room" of producers and marketers uses the team's different tastes to pick games that represent different genres, eventually "putting a bet" down on games that they think will resonate with players because it resonates with them.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What follows isn't so much a process of "just send us your trailer," it's effectively a rapid marketing consultation project as developers prepare storyboards and animatics of what they'll display in the show. She said she regularly helps developers tweak their trailers at the earliest possibility for a maximum return, and she regularly sees players react to showcased games in a way that validates her feedback.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Great trailers show you something interesting every couple of seconds—a great vista, an unusual gameplay mechanic or some action that builds upon it, an intriguing piece of dialogue, or something mysterious, epic, or funny," observed Microbird's other cofounder Regina Reisinger.</span></p><p>Image via Quarter Up/Skybound.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amini also said her team sometimes selects games that can quickly drive "intrigue" among players. She pointed to 2025 Showcase participant </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/skybound-spins-up-new-fighting-game-studio-quarter-up">Quarter Up</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (which is owned by Skybound) as a case study of this strategy. "You'll see a name—it might be a studio name—and there might be intrigue from the audience," Amini said. "They'll go 'what is Skybound doing with this new studio?'" She described these players as the ones who will "investigate" what they see, and learn details like how Quarter Up was founded for the specific purpose of making the Invincible-themed fighting game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Invincible VS</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Quarter Up executive producer Chris Paulson explained that in its run-up appearance to the showcase, the team worked carefully to ensure preparing assets and a demo build for the Showcase didn't eat too much into the game's development.

"The Xbox showcase casts a very wide net," he said, while Wholesome Direct put the dungeon crawling vacation simulator in front of a "smaller audience" very focused on its niche.

<p>Part of the ship, part of the crew</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Hello Games is introducing the first major <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/no_mans_sky">No Man's Sky</a> update since the game launched on Switch 2, and it looks like a cool one.</p>
<p>The big new addition in the 'Voyagers' update is the chance to design and build your very own spaceship. These ships ('Corvettes') can be as big or as small as you'd like, with real interiors packing in med-bays, sleeping quarters, war rooms, radars, teleporters and more for you to waltz around even mid-flight.</p>
<p>To really hammer home the space captain vibes, you can bring aboard friends as your crew, letting them help with designs and travel across the universe with you. What's more, you can pop the hatch on your Corvette and head out for a space walk, gliding around your rig or hopping to another nearby ship.</p>
<p>For design inspiration purposes, here's a closer look at some of these Corvettes in action:</p>

<p>With so many additional moving parts (spaceships being redesigned while planets are rendered in the distance is no small task), we'll be interested to see how the little Switch version holds up. Fortunately, the beefier Switch 2 edition — which we described as "an almost-perfect match for other versions of the game" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> — should offer a smoother ride.</p>

			<p>When Xbox PR reached out about a digital preview for The Outer Worlds 2, I literally beamed at the opportunity. They had done exactly the same for Avowed a couple of months ahead of that Obsidian RPG's launch, and that demo <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did a lot to get me even more hyped for the final game</a>. It was an extensive demo that provided more or less free rein to roam Avowed's first region of Dawnshore, explore it, and get a proper taste of what the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full game would be all about</a>. It also included companions, who are always a big part of Obsidian's roleplaying games, as fans of the Irvine-based studio know all too well.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the demo that was shared for The Outer Worlds 2 is much more limited. It starts at what appears to be the very beginning of the game; in that regard, it's akin to Avowed. However, whereas the latter game's demo went much further than the tutorial mission, this one does not. I learned afterward that it was the same demo available at Gamescom 2025, and it would have made sense there given the one-hour slot limit, but for a digital preview, it is a thorough disappointment. </p>



<p>The demo doesn't even provide access to companions, so you're completely on your own for the mission. Moreover, it does not include any explorable zone like the aforementioned Dawnshore from Avowed. This <span>straightforward mission doesn't really showcase the '<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-has-way-more-expansive-worlds-filled-with-fun-stories-and-cool-stuff-to-find-says-obsidian/" target="_blank">much more expansive worlds</a>' touted by the developer in recent The Outer Worlds 2 media blasts, or the many new cool gadgets&nbsp;</span>showcased in previous videos.</p>



<p>Sure, there were a couple of different paths to take while going through the mission. You can, for example, use the Eloquence skill (provided that you've picked it up when creating your character) to convince an NPC to disable the automated security and get you into the facility without having to fight the robots. You can also use other skills like Hacking or Engineering or Lockpicking to unlock specific doors. But all those features were already in the first The Outer Worlds game. I hoped to get a peek at what's new and improved, but this build didn't have much of that.</p>



<p>It did have the option to play in third-person view, which was completely absent from the previous installment. You will have to select it from the game's options, and there are two choices: a close third-person camera and a far one. Honestly, though, just like with Avowed, I believe they are there more for accessibility reasons than a genuine alternative. It's fine if you just cannot stomach first-person due to health concerns like motion sickness, but otherwise, you're much better off with first-person; the animations do not look nearly as good in third-person.</p>



<p>Another thing that Obsidian said it improved in The Outer Worlds 2 is the shooting part, which was refined based on feedback from Halo Studios and the analysis of Bungie's Destiny. The improvements are definitely there; shooting feels more solid, but still not quite as good as a top-notch shooter. Melee combat, unfortunately, still doesn't appear to be as in-depth as Avowed, and the lack of a dodge button certainly does not help.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The combat gameplay relies heavily on the 'Tactical Time Dilation' device (which also returns from the original title). This device allows the player to slow down time, which is essential if you want to survive against multiple foes at higher difficulty levels. The sequel does add destructible cover, but again, this was not featured in the demo build.</p>



<p>Lastly, from a technical standpoint, The Outer Worlds 2 is powered by Unreal Engine 5 instead of Unreal Engine 4. The visual improvement compared to the original is noticeable but perhaps slightly less significant than I would have hoped, even with ray traced lighting, shadows, and reflections enabled. The game also already supports High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays, although the implementation might still need some tweaking. </p>



<p>On PC, the graphics settings already offer plenty of options for users to tinker with, including a built-in frame rate limiter, five upscaling options (TAA, TSR, AMD FSR 3, Intel XeSS, and NVIDIA DLSS, the only one to support Frame Generation), a slider for Field of View, and a toggle for Chromatic Aberration. On my RTX 5090 and Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the demo ran smoothly without any stuttering, but like I said, it was a small level. The real test will be on those larger open-ended areas. Given that the game will launch simultaneously on Sony's PlayStation 5 consoles, I hoped to see support for the DualSense controller's haptic feedback and/or adaptive triggers, but there seems to be only regular rumble.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>Despite the fairly disappointed tone of this preview, I am still confident that Obsidian will deliver a meaty, fun, and enjoyable roleplaying game with The Outer Worlds 2. It's just that the demo they provided did not give us much of an opportunity to discover its new features and improvements.</p>



<p>Still, the full game is just two months away from being released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Look forward to our review ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned October 29 launch</a>. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atari-to-revive-five-classic-ubisoft-games-after-acquiring-rights.1281705/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atari has announced that it has acquired the intellectual property rights to five classic Ubisoft games, and that it will revive all of them on newer platforms with "renewed publishing frameworks".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://businesswire.com/news/home/20250826081788/en/Atari-Announces-Strategic-IP-Agreement-With-Ubisoft-To-Revive-Five-Acclaimed-Titles" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Atari reveals that the five&nbsp;Ubisoft titles in question are as follows:&nbsp;<em>Cold Fear</em>,&nbsp;<em>Child of Eden</em>,&nbsp;<em>I Am Alive</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grow Home</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Grow Up</em>. All five will be re-released on "new platforms", according to Atari.</p>

<p>It's likely that the company is referring specifically to current-gen consoles, given that technically speaking, four of the five games in this list (with&nbsp;<em>Child of Eden&nbsp;</em>being the only exception)&nbsp;are still available on PC via Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/i-am-alive-ubisoft-atari-revival.jpg?itok=GxeB1ktm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/i-am-alive-ubisoft-atari-revival.jpg?itok=bZQURLhD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>2012's survival game&nbsp;<em>I Am Alive&nbsp;</em>is just one of five Ubisoft titles Atari plans to revive.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Atari, the plan is to re-release all five of these games under its own publishing label, as well as to "explore opportunities" to expand the reach of the games "through updated formats, new content, and extended distribution channels".</p>

<p>Hopefully, this means that the five games in the list will be getting remastered versions; they're all arguably in need of them to varying degrees, with 2005's&nbsp;<em>Cold Fear&nbsp;</em>being a particularly strong candidate for an updated re-release.</p>

<p>Still, being able to play <i>Cold Fear</i>,&nbsp;<em>I Am Alive</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Child of Eden&nbsp;</em>on modern consoles will be nice. Technically, both&nbsp;<em>Grow Home&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Grow Up&nbsp;</em>are already available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S through backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>This news comes after a particularly difficult year for Ubisoft. Not only did its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" rel="nofollow">first-quarter financials back in July</a> disappoint, but last fiscal year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible" rel="nofollow">was a grim one for sales</a>, with a strong performance from&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>failing to make up for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">shortfalls elsewhere</a>.</p>

            <p>Have you ever wanted to swim out of a spaceship's backside while it sits in orbit, the sound of two dear friends arguing over whether it really needs a fifth teleporter room not seeping with you into the inky blackness? You know, because space is a famously scream-free zone. Well, the latest in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>'s endless string of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-skys-latest-big-update-that-is-somehow-also-free-will-let-you-become-a-mayor-of-all-things">free</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-has-a-mass-effect-normandy-again-together-with-new-cross-save-functionality">updates</a> has you covered. It's called Voyagers, and adds in custom multi-person ships dubbed corvettes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These ships are yours to design and build to your liking, with the addition of some sleeping quarters and a mission radar all you need to get started and welcome a crew of friends aboard to accompany you on your adventures. "These ships have real interiors, med-bays, sleeping quarters, war rooms, radars, teleporters," said Hello Games boss Sean Murray. "It comes with you everywhere, which totally changes how you play. Decorating it with your friends gives you a space that you share together. Whether it's a brightly coloured tiny explorer, or a colossal dark metallic war ship, it allows you to show off your own personality.</p>
<p>Murray adds that corvettes, which you can naturally also tape the likes of extra guns and windows to, are "encountered a little way into the game" and can be unlocked "reasonably swiftly" by spacers who've already sunk plenty of hours into the quest for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">spacevival</a>. The Voyagers update relies on tech which Hello say has been developed with an eye to their next game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/light-no-fire">Light No Fire</a>, which as an open-world thing on an Earth-sized planet with Earth-sized oceans, will feature large boats and crews of its own.</p>

<p>Naturally, that's no easy feat, with Murray revealing: "Almost every part of the game has had to be reworked to accommodate these relative spaces. Having your multiplayer crew walking around, calmly editing your ship, as it travels at warp speeds towards a planet that is being generated as you approach. It's pretty insane what's going on behind the scenes to make that work."</p><p>Cool, but also, I'm looking at this very being-in-a-ship-centric update and can't help being drawn to an aspect of it that doesn't technically involve being in a ship. You see, if you park multiple corvettes in orbit around a planet, you can spacewalk or skydive between them. In practice, your space-suited little fella's gently spat out of the back entrance to your craft, like... Well, I'll refrain from describing it in the manner I'd typically employ, since the RPS treehouse has a bit more decorum than some of the other places I've hung out. Suffice it to say that mucking about pinging between ships and diving down towards the surface looks like great fun.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2 has received a fresh wave of reinforcements in the fight to spread democracy following the Xbox release, and there’s a host of Warbonds available to purchase.</p>



<p>Warbonds are regularly released in Helldivers 2, with the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dust Devils Premium Warbond</a> on the horizon, which can make it difficult to decide which to pick up. Fortunately for you, we’re here to help.</p>



<p>Whether you’re looking to spend your Premium Warbond Token or are mulling over splashing some extra cash on more unlocks, we’ve got a breakdown of the best Warbonds available in Helldivers 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-best-warbonds-listed">Helldivers 2 Best Warbonds, Listed</h2>



<h3 id="h-democratic-detonation">Democratic Detonation</h3>



<figure><figcaption>For democracy! Image via Arrowhead Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>For those just starting out in Helldivers 2 and looking to give their arsenal a boost, there isn’t much better than the Democratic Detonation. With three pages of rewards, you’ll receive useful weapons, armor, and an armor passive, along with the usual cosmetics.</p>



<p>The G-123 Thermite grenade is great for taking out Terminid enemies, while both the Grenade Pistol and Exploding Crossbow can also be used to take out swarms of enemies. Just beware you don’t also take out the rest of your squad.</p>



<p>Add in some nice cosmetics and a return of 100 Super Credits, and it’s the ideal starting point.</p>



<h3 id="h-cutting-edge">Cutting Edge</h3>



<p>Initially one of the weakest Warbonds in the game, the benefit of the Cutting Edge Warbond has increased significantly following the introduction of the Illuminate to the game.</p>



<p>The Arc Resistance Passive is the perfect counter to the Illuminate, offering a huge amount of damage reduction. If you’re struggling to overcome that specific enemy time, take a look at this option.</p>



<p>Also in the Warbond are Stun Grenades, the Sickle Assault Rifle, and the Blitzer Shotgun, with both weapons having infinite ammo.</p>







<p>The biggest addition from the Urban Legends Warbond is the Anti-Tank Emplacement, the perfect tool to take out Strider Convoys and large groups of enemies.</p>



<p>With the Siege-Ready passive, you will benefit from quicker reload speeds and the ability to carry 20% additional ammunition, which is a boost for any combat situation.</p>



<p>There’s also a Stun Lance, a Flame Sentry, and a Directional Shield which, although not as stong as other options, can still come in useful.</p>



<h3 id="h-halo-odst-legendary-warbond">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dropping in hot. Image via Arrowhead</figcaption></figure>



<p>Not only is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</a> stocked full of unlocks that will release a wave of nostalgia, it also marks the historic moment of Helldivers 2’s Xbox release—the first Sony title to make the jump to the rival platform.</p>



<p>With four new weapons, two armors, a new armor passive, and a bunch of other cosmetic items, the Halo ODST Legendary Warbond is a solid pick-up for those looking to expand their collection with exclusive items. </p>



<p>The downside, however, is that you can’t use a Premium Warbond Token to unlock this, so you will have to splash out some extra cash. </p>



<h3 id="h-servants-of-freedom">Servants of Freedom</h3>



<p>Those looking for the ultimate weapon should look no further than the Portable Hellbomb, the perfect tool to issue damage to a large area or to clear out an objective.</p>



<p>The Ultimatum sidearm can also clear out huge groups of enemies, with huge explosive damage that is on par with an Orbital Precision Strike.</p>



<p>If that’s not enough, the Double-Edged Sickler has a larger heat sink than the original and increased damage penetration the longer you fire, though the downside is you could catch alight too.</p>



<h3 id="h-truth-enforcers">Truth Enforcers</h3>



<p>Any players who prefer their combat to be up close and personal should head straight to the Truth Enforcers Warbond, which features some of the strongest close-range weapons in the game.</p>



<p>The SMG-32 Reprimand Heavy and the SG-20 Halt Shotgun are the two guns in question, the latter being able to switch between armor-piercing ammo and stun rounds, giving you more versatility in the field.</p>



<p>Capping things off is the PLAS-15 Loyalist Plasma Pistol, a decent sidearm option if you’re looking for something new, and it’s particularly useful against heavy enemies.</p>



<h3 id="h-steeled-veterans">Steeled Veterans</h3>



<p>Ask any Helldivers 2 player for their favorite weapons, and the SG-225IE Breaker Incendiary Shotgun will more than likely be mentioned.</p>



<p>Dishing out huge damage and setting enemies on fire, the Breaker Incendiary Shotgun is the perfect tool for dealing with large swarms of enemies, and there’s also the P-4 Senator Pistol to consider, too.  </p>



<p>Also included in the Warbond is the AR-23C Liberator Concussive that, although highly situational, can be a powerful asset to stun large enemies.</p>

<p><strong>NBA 2K26 gets your new basketball journey underway on September 5.</strong></p>



<p>2K is going all in on NBA 2K26. It’s the marquere basketball game every year, so why not? You can pick up a copy of 2K26 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and even the Nintendo Switch 1 and 2. It’s a worldwide, multi-platform launch, and outside of its editions, you should consider its release times to prepare.</p>



<h2 id="h-nba-2k26-start-times">NBA 2K26 Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>According to storefronts, NBA 2K26 launches at 9 PM on September 4, a bit earlier than the main September 5 date for everyone else.</strong></p>



<p>Launch time information can always be tricky. Thankfully, <a href="https://support.nba2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/43415899486483-NBA-2K26-Regional-Launch-Times" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2K</a> has provided full regional rollout information. It shows that it’s pretty much a midnight launch for everyone outside the PT time zone. </p>



<p>You can check out our key regions and time zones below to see when you can start playing NBA 2K26.</p>

Build a fully customizable and upgradeable skyship that serves as both your home base and your battleship against the colossal sky creatures known as the Seraph. Brave the dizzying heights with a physics-based grappling hook, wingsuits, and gliders, and enjoy the freedom to explore the endless possibilities that await.</p><p>In 2017, Bossa Games launched the ambitious sandbox MMO world of <em>Worlds Adrift</em> into Early Access. While the game ultimately did not reach a 1.0 release, the passion for the project and the world they created was never diminished or forgotten. When the time was right, Bossa decided to rebuild upon the strong groundwork left behind in <em>Worlds Adrift</em>‘s wake. <em>Lost Skies</em> is that spiritual successor in every way.</p><p>Lead Game Designer Luke Williams had this to say about the process of bringing <em>Lost Skies</em> to life: “<em>Lost Skies</em> was such a unique opportunity for a designer—if you could go back and revisit themes and experiences, what would you do? So we really wanted to elevate the elements players loved from <em>Worlds Adrift</em>, such as exploring hundreds of floating islands and building an entirely unique skyship from all the rare materials and parts you come across on your journey. Also some huge sky filling bosses thrown in for good measure. We’ve spent the last three years working with our community to make sure we’ve built an experience players can enjoy for years to come.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The small but mighty team at Bossa Games, creators of physics-fueled hits like <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> and <em>I Am Fish</em>, has worked tirelessly on making <em>Lost Skies</em> the best possible experience for past <em>Worlds Adrift</em> players and new players alike. Drawing on their past successes, they’ve built <em>Lost Skies</em> into a playground of fun and inventive mechanics, including the grapple hook which is so good that it’s been called the best grappling system by players and feels as smooth and rewarding as you’d expect from a AAA title.</p><p>Here are some of the team’s big updates and accomplishments for <em>Lost Skies</em> prior to the 1.0 release:</p><ul><li><strong>Get Creative</strong> – The introduction of the Island Creator prior to launch allowed players to craft their own islands, share them with the community, and get ready to fly when Early Access arrived. Dozens of these hand-crafted islands populate the world players explore on a daily basis. Players can also unleash their creativity by designing skyships however they choose, <a title="Genres > Crafting [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> the perfect home base among the clouds!</li><li><strong>Play Your Way</strong> – Full keybinding was added to allow players to customize their keys in order to climb, grapple, glide, and fight with whatever keys best suit them.</li><li><strong>Content, Content, Content</strong> – New weapons, ship assets, naval boss battles, regions, puzzles, a map table, storage naming, better inventory <a title="Genres > Management [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>, and so much more has been added during the Early Access period and is ready for all players to enjoy in the 1.0 launch.</li><li><strong>Improvements Galore</strong> – From day one, the team worked to remove bugs, deliver quality of life updates, and ensure the utmost stability for 1.0 while players journeyed through the clouds.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Version 1.0 Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Lost Skies | 1.0 Launch Trailer | Humble Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MCawAfVtLHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/lost-skies-launches-september-17]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>One of the more exciting reveals during Gamescom's Opening Night Live ceremony last week was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-announced-includes-content-from">Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>. Not only is TT Games returning to the Caped Crusader – its first time since 2014's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/lego_batman_3_beyond_gotham/b/xboxone/archive/2014/11/14/identity-crisis-game-informer-lego-batman-3-beyond-gotham-review.aspx">Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham</a> – but it's doing so with a brand-new take on the superhero... kinda. I say that because a lot of Legacy of the Dark Knight will feel familiar to those who watch and read about Bruce Wayne's bat-shaped half, and that's by design.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of continuing its original storytelling from the first three Lego Batman games, TT Games is fusing various Batman media, namely films like the Dark Knight trilogy and 2022's <em>The Batman</em>, to tell a definitive story. I played roughly 50 minutes of the game and caught references to <em>Batman </em>(1989), Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, and even the 2010 animated feature, <em>Batman: Under the Red Hood.</em> TT Games promises even more, including 1966's <em>Batman</em>, <em>Batman Returns</em>, and various comics and graphic novels.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5ha2VwHJCw?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5ha2VwHJCw?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Immediately after hearing and seeing all these references, I was curious how TT Games approached utilizing all these various (and unique) properties to tell a single, cohesive story. Assistant design director Jimmy Sedota tells me it's about mashing together the highlights.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's been a fun challenge," he says. "We're pulling from so much. There's so much inspiration and reference out there, so as we started developing the story, we looked at some of the most iconic moments that we know, that even casual fans would recognize [...] and so we started with that, the highlight moments, and we started to see how we could lay out a single story that's our retelling that also references that stuff.</p><p>"Then from there, we started pulling more and more of that deep lore in, so looking at comics, TV, and all that stuff, and really starting to find moments like, 'Oh, we can get this nice lore cut in here, and we can reference <em>this </em>thing here.' Even in the ACE Chemicals mission you played, there are definitely references to the 1989 film, but also <em>Under the Red Hood</em>, and some stuff from the comics. And we feel that we've married that all in a way that tells a unique story, but is something that players and fans will recognize as familiar at the same time, with, of course, our humor and Lego TT Games twist on it."</p>

<p>That ACE Chemicals mission Sedota mentions was the primary focus of my hands-on preview at this year's Gamescom in Cologne, Germany last week, and it was a blast. It also showed me that Legacy of the Dark Knight doesn't feature inspiration from <em>just</em> movies, TV, and comics – it takes massive inspiration from Rocksteady Studios' Batman Arkham series. And wow, am I so glad it does.&nbsp;</p><p>I've enjoyed previous TT Games Lego versions of beloved characters and stories, including Batman, but combat has always been the weakest point of the experiences for me. It felt too simple, with not enough challenge to keep me engaged. TT Games is tackling this in two ways: using Arkham-inspired combat and including, for the first time in its Lego games' history, difficulty options.&nbsp;</p><p>There are three combat difficulty options: Classic, which "offers a traditional Lego experience" with unlimited lives, fewer enemies, and less frequency of advanced enemy types; Caped Crusader, which "offers a balanced focus on combat and story" with unlimited lives, more enemies, and advanced enemy types that appear more frequently; and finally, Dark Knight, which "offers harder combat for heroes seeking a challenge" with limited lives, even more enemies/frequent appearances by advanced enemy types. Dark Knight also includes a level reset upon losing all your lives. While you can gain lives by collecting hearts in missions, if you lose all of them, you'll need to restart the entire level.&nbsp;</p><p>I chose Dark Knight for my ACE Chemicals mission, and I'm so glad I did. It's a perfect challenge for the game's Arkham-inspired combat, and I quickly fell back into my habits of sneaking around, taking enemies out, and grappling to high-up gargoyles and perches to plan my next attack. I performed stealth takedowns from the ground, even sneaking around in underground grates and through air ventilation shafts (where, like the Arkham games, your view transitions into first-person). Unfortunately, I was unable to perform stealth takedowns from gargoyles and perches, and I'm not sure if that will be an aspect of the game's combat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, stealth feels incredible, especially when coupled with distractions like throwing Batarangs or blowing up explosive barrels. Outside of stealth, my Arkham memories continued to push to the forefront of my brain as I pummeled enemies with the Square button, countering them with Triangle, and flipping over shielded enemies for attacks from behind with Circle. I even dodged bullets shot my way to glorious effect. It really feels like playing an Akrham game, but smartly, combat features the unique TT Games twist you expect. Sometimes takedowns were straightforward – other times, like while playing as Jim Gordon (who resembled the Gary Oldman version from Christopher Nolan's Batman films, though appearance varies based on costumes), I bashed an enemy over the head with a bug-catching net to comedic effect.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're huge fans of what Rocksteady was able to achieve [...] and this was built from the ground up at TT for what we think is the best Lego Batman combat system for our fans and for our games," Sedota says. "We have co-op, multiple playable characters over the course of the story campaign, gadgets, and more, and we feel we've created something uniquely our own." I do see how Legacy of the Dark Knight features unique flourishes in combat, courtesy of TT Games, but also... this combat is basically just Arkham combat, and that's great! That combat rule,s and it feels fantastic here!</p><p>I especially love all the humorous touches TT Games has added to its otherwise classic take on Gotham, complete with rainy nights, lots of neon signage, dangerous streets, and enemies galore. Similar to TT Games' more recent Lego games, not everything in this game is made of blocks. Instead, TT Games uses Lego as signposts to players.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's a really good mix of art direction, design direction, and usability and UX design," Sedota says when I ask how the team balances Lego vs real-world elements in-game. "When you see Lego, you expect to be able to smash it. [Legacy of the Dark Knight] still feels like a really beautiful modern game, but it still has plenty of Lego touches, and when you see those, you know most are interactable. That's for players to recognize, 'Oh, I can interact with that.' That's the marriage of our design and visuals."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the ACE Chemicals mission I complete, Batman and Gordon are tasked with infiltrating the compound, and I mostly stick to the shadows to do so, though I find myself in a couple of brawls, too. Switching back and forth between these two characters is good fun, as Batman plays, like, well, Batman, while Gordon uses a non-lethal gun to shoot giant sticky globs onto enemies, making them easy to beat up. Outside of combat, the mission requires these two characters to work together. As I'm playing solo, switching is as easy as tapping on the d-pad, but TT Games envisions me playing couch co-op with someone else taking control of the opposite character. There are light, easy puzzles to complete that require switching from Batman to Gordon, then back to Batman, and vice versa, every so often in this mission, and it feels reminiscent of TT Games' typical puzzle design.&nbsp;</p><p>This mission ends how you might expect, as a figure under a Red Hood falls into a vat of acid and may or may not become a certain villain in Batman's extensive rogue gallery: Joker.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of Joker, if you saw the reveal trailer, you likely recognized that Legacy of the Dark Knight features a Joker inspired by Heath Ledger's legendary performance, at least in appearance. I don't encounter the Joker in my preview, but Sedota tells me the characters in this game aren't based on a single iteration of the character. The team is drawing inspiration from various Batman media, and while costumes will allow different characters to resemble specific iterations, those costumes don't alter the character. Batman and other characters in Legacy of the Dark Knight will remain consistent in their personalities – you only choose to have your Batman look like Robert Pattinson's, Christian Bale's, or maybe even Adam West's iconic take.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're not just doing all the movies," Sedota tells me. "There's a single [English] voice actor [for Batman] that's constant throughout. Even as Batman progresses, the story features that single character, but we're bringing out some humor, keeping it light, and building this all through story and gameplay mechanics."&nbsp;</p><p>However, Sedota tells me the consistency is primarily for Batman and the extended Bat-family, teasing that we might see more character evolution in the game's villains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond the ACE Chemicals mission, I also got to play around and explore the open-world Gotham, and it's a visual treat. Immediately, I look for the nearest grapple point and am thrilled to learn that you can tap the jump button for a powerful boost mid-grapple when you reach the end point, similar to the Arkham games. This sends Batman flying high into the sky, and I glide down a bit before dive-bombing into a group of unsuspecting enemies below. After this, I solve a quick Riddler Puzzle Box and find a Wayne Tech Cache with a Lego piece inside. By clicking the right stick, Batman utilizes Detect, which shows you where to go and locates nearby things to interact with – it's basically detective vision.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I eventually make my way down to the streets below and call up the Batmobile via the d-pad. The one that appears is the muscle car variant seen in <em>The Batman</em>, complete with its roaring turbo. TT Games has already shown off the Tumbler from the Dark Knight trilogy and the 1966 Batmobile, and I look forward to other iterations that might appear. Driving around feels great, as rain pours from the moody sky, causing the neon signs above to glisten in reflections on the streets. I complete a quick time-trial race and can already tell I'm going to be spending a decent chunk of time behind the wheel in Legacy of the Dark Knight. As for which Gotham this is, it's an original version from TT Games, but, like the rest of the game, it draws from a wide range of Batman media.&nbsp;</p><p>"We looked at lots of maps, games, and comics, in particular, and looked at the basic structure of certain things you need to have in Gotham," Sedota says. "There are always multiple islands, and we found something for the right size of our game, and there are different islands that unlock as you go through the main story, and new content opens up." He adds that you'll have all four islands of Gotham unlocked about halfway through the main story, but lots of "new activities" will appear over the entire course of the campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This open-world Gotham, like the ACE Chemicals mission, is impressive. I'm more impressed with a TT Games Lego game than I've ever been with Legacy of the Dark Knight, and I've only played for 50 minutes. As a massive Batman fan desperate for another video game adventure with the Caped Crusader, TT Games seems set to deliver everything I want and more. Truly, I cannot wait, and I'm legitimately annoyed I have to until 2026 (but please take your time, TT Games, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/01/21/new-report-details-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-sagas-rocky-development-and-studio">don't crunch</a>).&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) sometime in 2026.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/27/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-is-the-next-arkham-game-youve-been]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Space can be a lonely place, what with it being - as a wise man once famously put it - so vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big and all. Which is where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> new Voyagers update comes in. Now, those long treks across the infinite expanse needn't be quite so lonely thanks to the introduction of multi-crew space ships you can build, pilot, and stroll around with friends.
</p>
<p>
Customisable ships - not to be confused with No Man's Sky's existing customisable freighters, which essentially serve as gargantuan deep space bases - have been at the top of many a fan's wishlist for quite some time. And today's Voyagers update look to deliver and then some. After progressing to a certain point in the story, players gain access to a hangar-like workshop where new Corvette spaceships can be engineered both outside and within. Customisable components include hulls, wings, landing gear, engine parts, thrusters, and weapons, and all can be arranged to suit players' whims.
</p>
<p>
And then there's the habitable interior. "Add sleeping quarters," developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hello-games">Hello Games</a> explains, "and you are ready to welcome a crew of friends on board. Add a mission radar and you are ready for adventure. A teleporter and you have an away team." There's also talk of med-bays and war rooms, or you can just add a window and watch the universe go by. And for thrillseekers, it's even possible to flip open the Corvette's airlock and go for a space walk together or, once within a planet's atmosphere, sky dive to the ground.

<p>
While newcomers to No Man's Sky won't have immediate access to Corvette construction given its unlock requirements, they'll still be able to experience the feature in a brand-new limited-time Expedition. Alongside the usual array of cosmetic rewards, this'll also unlock some ship parts players might find useful when trying to build their own vehicles in the core sim.
</p><p>
Hello Games says it's had to rework "almost every part" of No Man's Sky to accommodate Corvettes and their relative spaces, and to ensure crews can still roam their ship's corridors and continue editing during the likes of warp jumps and planetary approaches. Much of the tech, it says, is shared with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">upcoming Light No Fire</a>, which will feature vast oceans players can similarly explore together on a single boat. This isn't the first time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">No Man's Sky has adopted technology implemented for Hello Games' Earth-sized planet sim</a>.
</p>
<p>
And it sounds like Hello Games is still far from done. "The most exciting thing about Voyagers for me," writes Hello Games' boss Sean Murray, "is the possibilities it opens in the future for No Man's Sky, and I can't wait to see where the team takes it from here."

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> publisher Paradox appears to be rethinking its plan to charge for two of the six playable clans in the game.</p>
<p>Community developer DebbieElla told the Bloodlines 2 Discord community last night (spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-chinese-room-will-make-adjustments-after-feedback-about-locking-2-clans-behind-day-one-dlc-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2.1281309/">ResetEra</a>): "We are listening to your feedback about the Lasombra and Toreador clan access, and we're making adjustments ahead of launch to reflect this. We will share more information about what this means as soon as possible."</p>
<p>The comment comes a week after Paradox announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-all-these-years-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gets-an-actual-proper-release-date">the release date for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, which is 21st October, along with pricing details for the game. It was then we learned the company intended to charge £20 extra to access two clans in the game, via a Shadows and Silk content pack.</p>
<p>The Shadows and Silk pack can be bought alone for £18.69/€22/$22, or as part of a Premium Edition for £75/€90/$90, which also includes a cosmetic-focused Santa Monica Memories pack. For reference, the Standard Edition of the game costs £50/€60/$60.</p>

<p>At a glance, this might not seem untoward. Plenty of games sell additional content at launch and bundle it with premium editions of a game. The base price of Bloodlines 2 even appears to have been adjusted because of it, so it's cheaper than other full-priced games. But the problem comes from the content being charged for itself: the clans.</p><p>The clans in Bloodlines 2 are a core part of the game. Choosing one is equivalent to choosing your character class and therefore the playstyle you're opting for. Clans also determine the storied group you belong to in the world and give you access to different clothing options and clan-specific non-player characters. Clans are not superfluous, cosmetic content.</p>
<p>What's more, the locked Toreador and Lasombra clans are highly desirable. Toreador are a clan built around the iconic archetype of vampires as seductive, sexy beings, and come fitted with the power to enthrall their prey by, yes, kissing them. Lasombra, on the other hand, do their work in the shadows, and can manipulate shadows to tangle and hold enemies and teleport themselves. I tried both clans briefly in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-action-than-rpg-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-struggles-to-convince-after-a-few-hours-play">the Bloodlines 2 preview build I played</a> and enjoyed them, especially Lasombra.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Important caveat: you can access powers from another clan in Bloodlines 2, so you're not locked to only doing things your clan offers. Every time you gain a higher tier of power, you'll see other powers listed to the left and right of them that belong to other clans. You can unlock them but doing so is costly and complicated. You need to pay a higher skill-point cost for them as well as a price related to other 'currencies' in the game, which are usually earned by drinking special types of blood, and you need to find certain NPCs to teach these powers to you.</p>
<p>It's a faff, in other words, so it's more likely your experience of Bloodlines 2 will be unlocking your clan-specific powers first before branching into other clan's abilities. Your clan choice, therefore, is an important one, and so the decision to paywall access to a third of them is notable.</p><p>The justification for doing it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it">as relayed by developer The Chinese Room to Rock Paper Shotgun at Gamescom</a>, was these two clans represented content developed beyond what was originally planned for the game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">The Chinese Room inherited development of Bloodlines 2 </a>from Hardsuit Labs, remember - it didn't originate it. So The Chinese Room's reasoning was this was additional content developed for the game, so it would sell it as such at release. But if the content is developed during a game's main development period, is it really additional? And if it appears alongside other content in the game, only with a padlock over it, is it really additive or withheld?</p>
<p>Portioning off parts of a game to be sold around release is nothing new. Paradox itself has a track record of leveraging paid-for downloadable content as a significant source of income for games it makes. It was expected, to a degree, here. But Paradox has chosen the wrong approach. Carving off core gameplay will never be an acceptable proposition, and its decision has tainted the upcoming arrival of an excruciatingly long-awaited game. Here's hoping the "adjustments" being considered will turn this situation around.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced two brand new features for its SNES Classics catalog on the Nintendo Switch Online service, and if you're a connoisseur of strategy and puzzle games, this one's for you.</p>

<p>First up, select SNES games now support mouse controls on Switch Online. Naturally, this includes&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-paint-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">released on the service last month</a>; in fact, Nintendo says some games "can only be played using mouse controls", seemingly including&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint</em>.</p>

<p>Other games support mouse controls as well, though; the trailer demonstrating the new mouse control feature shows not only&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>being played, but also&nbsp;<em>Mario's Super Picross&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Nobunaga's Ambition</em>, both of which are probably a lot more satisfying with a mouse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-snes-classics-mouse-controls.jpg?itok=lH5X3M39 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-snes-classics-mouse-controls.jpg?itok=1FWa5CpH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can now play some SNES Classics on Nintendo Switch Online with mouse controls.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're playing on Switch 2, then the SNES games that support mouse controls will be playable with the Joy-Con 2's mouse mode, but if you're on the original Switch, you'll need to hook up a USB mouse to take advantage of this new feature.</p>

<p>As well as mouse controls, the new update also brings the ability to both view and change the controls for the SNES game you're playing. If there are button mappings that don't quite suit your play style, you can change them around to suit you.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll also be able to save different mappings and configurations for each game, so you won't have to stick with the mappings you set up for&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>in&nbsp;<em>Super Metroid</em>. Nintendo isn't that heartless.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer showing off the new features being added to Nintendo Switch Online right here.</p>




<p>Both mouse controls and the ability to remap your buttons are available right now if you're a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber. Of course, if you're not, you'll need to sign up to get access to the SNES catalog.</p>

I’m not surprised, really. With Games Workshop and publisher Focus Entertainment watching his every word like the Inquisition on the hunt for heresy, Willits must be careful to keep his cards close to his chest or else risk being declared a heretic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I was able to get <em>something</em> out of him on the hotly anticipated sequel, namely that Games Workshop is throwing all sorts of ideas at Saber right now, and some of them are apparently "amazing."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I began my foray into Space Marine 3 territory by asking Willits why <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive">the game was announced relatively soon after the release of Space Marine 2</a>. Willits dodged the question, saying: “It's just how we work with Focus… Again, it was massively successful for us, Space Marine 2, and Focus.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That it was indeed. Space Marine 2 may well be the most successful Warhammer 40,000 video game ever made. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-sells-7-million-in-less-than-a-year-and-you-can-see-why-space-marine-3-was-confirmed-so-soon">It sold over 7 million copies less than a year after going on sale</a>, and, by Willits’ own admission, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3">changed everything for Saber Interactive</a>. Even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-made-millions-for-games-workshop-now-its-on-the-hunt-for-the-next-big-warhammer-video-game">Games Workshop itself has talked about the money it’s made from the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 3 was inevitable, then, but questions remain. Where will Lieutenant Titus and co head next? Will we see new factions? Will Saber expand co-op beyond the three-player limit? Will there be actual meaningful PvP?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, Willits wasn’t ready to answer these types of questions, but did tease ideas are coming from Games Workshop itself — and Saber is excited by them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're working with Games Workshop, they’re the best ever,” he said. “And there’s such a rich universe that we’re pulling stuff [from]. And they've given us some ideas that are amazing. They have given us some really cool ideas. Their brains are just like… wow. So lots of super great ideas from Games Workshop.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without spoiling the Space Marine 2 campaign, it strongly suggests a continuation of the story, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-have-a-good-idea-which-enemy-faction-theyll-fight-in-space-marine-3"><u>IGN has reported on the enemy faction we’ll probably see in Space Marine 3</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Siege Mode Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some Space Marine 2 fans were concerned about the timing of Space Marine 3's announcement, but <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/glahjvsr/space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Games Workshop has said</u></a> Space Marine 3 "is likely years away from release,” and Saber has promised to continue to support Space Marine 2 for some time to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Willits pointed to the support Saber's World War Z has enjoyed as the model it’s following for Space Marine 2. A second year of Space Marine 2 content, which Focus has discussed, is already on the way. But will Space Marine 2 get story DLC?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have some plans,” Willits teased, “but we have to work with Focus to get the right announcement. But nothing is off the table.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Space Marine 2 is set for Patch 10 in September to celebrate the game’s first anniversary. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-just-confirmed-the-new-techmarine-class-the-power-axe-a-new-chaos-v-chaos-mode-and-much-more">Check out all the details here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

You may be outnumbered, but you are not outmatched.</p><p><em>Moros Protocol</em> is a relentless, fast-paced shooter where survival means adapting – or being consumed. To thrive against the monstrous hordes, players will need to dynamically adapt their loadout and strategy with each run.</p><p>Looking for a frantic, high-mobility approach to your enemies? Fill up your loadout with SMGs or pistols, augmented for speed and increased damage while moving—perfect for laying down a barrage of bullets on the go. Or for a slower, more methodical approach, put together a sniping build that focuses on powerful, precise shots that can take down enemies in a single hit.</p><p>Whichever you choose, your skills will grow during each run through thanks to <em>Moros Protocol</em>’s evolving combat system. Throughout your run you will find augments tailored to improve your skills in a specific playstyle. Find an augment that boosts your run and gun capabilities? Change up your loadout for a shotgun and let it rip!</p><p>Plot your own route through each run, with every branching path offering different risks. Do you want to play it safe, or face greater danger in pursuit of even greater rewards? Are you looking for a guaranteed new weapon, or a vendor to upgrade your skills? Choose wisely as you make your way towards your goal.</p><p>Beware, as death is around every corner in <em>Moros Protocol</em>—but death is not the end! Upgrade your abilities after each death before rejoining the battle as a better, more fearsome killing machine.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tactical <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,763 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">First-Person Shooter</a> Combat</strong> – Inspired by classic shooters, Moros Protocol combines fast-paced <a title="Genres > Action [2,987 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> with adaptability and customization.

Many big brands hopped on the train to try to drive engagement and awareness for their own franchises, and this included some video game companies.</p><p>The Halo account posted an image of Halo's Buck and Veronica Dare, with the same caption that Swift used in her announcement, "Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married."</p><p>The official Sonic the Hedgehog account, meanwhile, re-shared the engagement announcement to its story on Instagram with the caption, "I think I found the fourth Chaos Emerald..."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4557745-screenshot2025-08-27at8.08.57am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557745" data-ratio="1.7441441441441" data-width="555" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4557745-screenshot2025-08-27at8.08.57am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557745"></a><figcaption>Sonic reacts to the Swift/Kelce engagement</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4557745-screenshot2025-08-27at8.08.57am.png"></figure><p>Swift and Kelce got engaged some time ago but only just jointly shared the news with the world this week.
