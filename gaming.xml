            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/roblox-report-pedophile-hellscape-lying-investors<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A damning new report has emerged that accuses&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>and its creators Roblox Corporation of fostering an "X-rated pedophile hellscape" on the platform, as well as lying to investors about engagement and more.</p>
<p>The report comes courtesy of Hindenburg Research, and it's an incredibly comprehensive and lengthy document backed up by a huge amount of research, as well as conversations with former&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>data scientists and developers.</p>
<p>Some of its more shocking findings include discovering that&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>groups are "openly soliciting sexual favors and trading child pornography", and that users have "identified issues of simulated rape, naked users, and rampant in-game sexual harassment".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roblox-report-moderation-lying-racing.jpg?itok=XnKkf8gf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roblox-report-moderation-lying-racing.jpg?itok=6t9RZdQv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>games and experiences are innocuous, but Hindenburg Research's report shows that a huge number are not.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Hindenburg Research's report found that moderation was "largely outsourced to Asian call centers", and that moderators were "paid $12 a day to review countless instances of child grooming and bullying".</p>
<p>What's more, Hindenburg says moderators have a "limited ability to keep perpetrators off the platform permanently", suggesting perhaps that Roblox Corporation's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/roblox-financials-trust-safety-spending">decision to cut its trust and safety spending</a> earlier this year was not a particularly sound one.</p>
<p>As well as the horrifying details of what the company found during its time on&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>(of which there are many, many more in the full report), Hindenburg Research also says its data suggests Roblox Corporation could be lying to its investors and advertisers about its engagement and user numbers.</p>
<p>Roblox Corporation says its per-user-per-day engagement hour rate was around 2.4 hours in 2023, but Hindenburg's report says the studio "could be massively overstating" this number, and that its own research found users were spending just 22 minutes or so in&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>games per day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roblox-report-moderation-lying-monster.jpg?itok=HfeEmWwc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roblox-report-moderation-lying-monster.jpg?itok=iAc1SeB7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This monster may well be the least harrowing thing you'll see in&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>today.</figcaption></figure><p>One former&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>data scientist told Hindenburg Research that the platform's actual number of daily active users (DAUs) could be "like anywhere between 30 to 20 percent lower" than the number&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>itself states.</p>
<p>According to Hindenburg's research,&nbsp;Roblox Corporation effectively reports two different user numbers: one that includes users with multiple alternate accounts, which is for "internal business decisions", and one that discounts alts, which is for investors.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full report</a> is well worth a read; it's an exhaustively-researched look at just how much Roblox Corporation might be getting away with, and since safety concerns have been raised by other entities as well, including investigative YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">People Make Games</a>, much of it is likely to be accurate.</p>
<p>The report also appears to have caused&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>shares to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hindenburg-research-discloses-short-position-on-roblox-alleging-inflated-metrics/articleshow/114051997.cms?from=mdr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fall by almost 10%</a>, although stock prices tend to fluctuate so regularly that this might not be an indication of long-term damage. We'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>

<p>It looks like Saudi Arabia wasn’t looking to increase its stake in Nintendo. Instead, the country, through its Savvy Games Group, has reduced its stake in the company.</p>



<p>On Monday, a report from Kyodo News claimed that Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) was looking at increasing its shares in Nintendo. The outlet <a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2024/10/71fd22ea510c-saudi-wealth-fund-eyes-raising-stakes-in-nintendo-other-game-firms.html?phrase=Nintendo&amp;words=Nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ultimately updated their story</a> to say they were looking at all Japanese gaming companies as opposed to just Nintendo. Now, 24 hours later, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/08/saudi-arabias-pif-cuts-stake-in-nintendo-after-report-said-it-was-considering-increase.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNBC</a> has come out with a report stating the opposite.</p>

<p>According to CNBC, Saudi Arabia’s PIF has reduced its stake in Nintendo to 7.54% from 8.58%. The source is a Japanese regulatory filing from Tuesday.</p>



<p>At 7.54%, it remains one of the largest shareholders in Nintendo. It’s still higher than the original 5.01% it owned when it first bought in to the company in 2022.</p>



<p>What do you think of Saudi Arabia ultimately lowering their stake in Nintendo rather than increase it? Let us know in the comments, and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>. </p>

                <p dir="ltr">Epic Games, the company behind Fortnite and Unreal Engine, just won a significant antitrust case against Google, meaning the Android mobile store must open up alongside other requirements. However, Google announced it's already appealing the order.</p><p dir="ltr">Google vice president of regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland detailed why the company is fighting back against the ruling on <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Google blog</a>. For starters, Mulholland points out that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-declares-resounding-victory-over-epic-games-following-appeals-court-ruling/1100-6513515/" data-ref-id="1100-6513515">Epic already lost a similar case to Apple</a>, though <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/07/google-ordered-to-open-android-app-store-in-epic-games-case.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a> notes that was decided by a judge--Google's case was decided by a jury. As such, Mulholland writes: "In contrast, the Apple decision, upheld on appeal, rightly found that Android and iOS compete in the same market. This is obvious to anyone who has bought a smartphone."</p><p dir="ltr">On top of this, Mulholland argues Google and Apple fight for app developers. The ruling puts a three-year ban on Google paying developers for exclusive apps, for instance, per CNBC.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>'s expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4s-first-expansion-is-vessel-of-hatred-and-its-coming-late-2024">Vessel of Hatred</a> released earlier today, welcoming a record number of Steam players in the process.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are 45,231 Diablo 4 players on Steam, a record for Blizzard's hellish game on the platform. Earlier today, the all-time Steam player peak was sitting at 39,782, recorded four months ago.</p>
<p>Diablo 4 originally launched on consoles and for PC via Battle.net in June 2023, then popped up on Steam that October, by which point it had reached 12 million players total.</p>

<p>Despite these record-breaking numbers on Steam, Vessel of Hatred hasn't had the smoothest of debuts. Its launch had to be delayed by several hours due to "a small technical issue".</p>
<p>This has, unfortunately for Blizzard, seen a spate of negative reviews for the expansion. As I write, there are a total of 269 reviews for Vessel of Hatred on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3043530/Diablo_IV_Vessel_of_Hatred/#app_reviews_hash">Steam</a>. Of those, 69 are positive (nice), but the remaining 200 are negative.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there are still reports on social media of some lingering niggles, and Blizzard's Adam Fletcher recently acknowledged an issue in which players are randomly losing their access to Vessel of Hatred through their play sessions on consoles.</p>
<p>"We have identified the issue and have a fix in flight for testing. The plan is for this to be in our next hotfix," Fletcher wrotein a blog post titled <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/vessel-of-hatred-license-revokes/192700">Vessel of Hatred Licence Revokes</a>. "The workaround for now is to log out and back in or by swapping to a non Spiritborn character and then back again.</p>
<p>"Apologies for this but we are hoping to have a fix out for this soon!"</p>

<p>Hopefully, Blizzard will sort out those remaining kinks soon, and in time for our own Vessel of Hatred review. As a reminder, there was a setback with our code, so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Eurogamer's Vessel of Hatred review will be arriving on the site a little later than anticipated</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, Blizzard recently announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-first-microsoft-game-to-land-itself-a-ps5-pro-enhanced-label">Diablo 4 will be getting that shiny PS5 Pro Enhanced label</a> on the release of Sony's console. This all means Diablo 4 players with a PS5 Pro will be able to take full advantage of the console's improved features, such as advanced ray tracing and a GPU that enables up to 45 percent faster rendering, thanks to a free software update.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/littlebigplanet-3-and-all-littlebigplanet-dlc-being-delisted-on-halloween.1003761/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/littlebigplanet-3-plus-dlc-delisted-halloween<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Sumo Digital have announced that <i>LittleBigPlanet 3</i>, along with the entire currently-available range of&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>DLC, will no longer be available via the PlayStation Store starting later this month.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1843652568389480651" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>X (formerly Twitter) account,&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet 3&nbsp;</em>and the series DLC will be delisted from the store on October 31st. That's one way to scare&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>fans, I suppose.</p>
<p>Sony says that anyone who owns the game or its DLC will still be able to access those things after the delisting, so this isn't a complete removal. However, you won't be able to purchase the game or any of the DLC being delisted after that date.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/littlebigplanet-3-delisted-dlc.jpg?itok=apRFEsJ4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/littlebigplanet-3-delisted-dlc.jpg?itok=x0suQEyz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>LittleBigPlanet 3&nbsp;</em>will be delisted from the PlayStation Store soon.</figcaption></figure><p>As Sony points out, its message is a "friendly reminder" that anyone who has yet to purchase&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet 3&nbsp;</em>or "any&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>DLC currently available for purchase" should do so before October 31st.</p>
<p>Of course, if you own a physical copy of the game, it's not just suddenly going to stop working, so you'll always be able to play it from the disc. However, it won't be available to buy digitally anymore.</p>
<p>Sony doesn't give a reason for the game being delisted, but it's possible that since much of&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet</em>'s DLC revolves around licensed IP such as <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>, those licenses have run out and Sony either won't or can't renew them.</p>
<p>Games are delisted from digital storefronts for a variety of reasons, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting-player-surge">licensing</a> is just one of them; others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/postal-3-delisted-on-steam-due-to-drm-problems">DRM issues</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-rez-delists-paladins-switch-version-due-to-bad-performance">poor performance on certain platforms</a>, and a host of other potential causes.</p>

<p>The delisting of&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet 3&nbsp;</em>means that after October 31st, it will no longer be possible to buy and own a&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>game via a digital PlayStation storefront, which feels like a real blow for preservation.</p>
<p>Thankfully, as long as it's possible to track down pre-owned physical copies of the game, you'll still be able to pick it up from somewhere, and you can still buy&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/littlebigplanet-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via the PlayStation Store</a> for now, so if you have any inclination whatsoever to play it, I'd pick it up sooner rather than later.</p>

You’re probably already seeing all kinds of creepy creatures, from black cats to ghosts, in your everyday life, and why should video games be any different? Thank goodness they’re not, especially if you’re a <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>player. Square Enix’s MMO offers the Black Coeurl (a black cat) and Mama Automaton (basically a ghost) for players to acquire when joining in the scary festivities.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196452,195905" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h7555"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Obtain the Black Coeurl and Mama Automaton</strong></h2><p>The nice thing about these monstrous minions is that the method for obtaining both the Black Coeurl and Mama Automaton are the same.

That’s because ghosts are exactly 50 percent better than cats.</p><p>Once you have enough of the area’s currency, simply go to the main area of the park. At the front desk, there will be an attendant with the title “Gold Saucer Attendant ”. Speak to him and select the third option (“Prize Exchange III”), where you will see both of the critters available for purchase. Note that they will not show up in your Minion Guide automatically after you buy them—you will need to go into your inventory and “use” the newly acquired item before they are added to the list of available minions.</p><h2 id="h7556"><a id=""></a><strong>What is MGP and How Do I Get It?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="c0f9224f35688c0efd1523da7614d130" data-recommend-id="image://c0f9224f35688c0efd1523da7614d130" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cat menu and oh good grief this game looks a mess." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cat menu and oh good grief this game looks a mess." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0f9224f35688c0efd1523da7614d130" data-recommend-id="image://c0f9224f35688c0efd1523da7614d130" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cat menu and oh good grief this game looks a mess." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>MGP is obtained by participating in different activities around the Gold Saucer. The most lucrative method is to participate in GATEs which occur every 20 minutes at the 20, 40 and 60 minute marks. Depending on your performance, up to 4,000 MGP can be awarded during these events, so even if you do well, it will take completing a handful to get enough points to afford one of the minions, perhaps even both.</p><p>Another couple of easy options are buying Cactpot Tickets, of which there are two kinds. There is a small lottery—basically a scratcher—that can be purchased up to three times daily, and a jumbo lottery where you can purchase three tickets weekly with the winning numbers being drawn every Saturday. Since players can use MGP to purchase up to three tickets per drawing, this can be a simple and effective way to farm MGP with little effort on your part.</p><figure id="" data-id="330ea83db626fc42c994307243a7d0c9" data-recommend-id="image://330ea83db626fc42c994307243a7d0c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A visual migraine in gaming form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A visual migraine in gaming form." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="330ea83db626fc42c994307243a7d0c9" data-recommend-id="image://330ea83db626fc42c994307243a7d0c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A visual migraine in gaming form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It may seem counterintuitive to spend currency when you are trying to save up for a specific prize, but the great thing about the Cactpot lotteries is even if you don’t win the jackpot, you will receive a consolation prize, the amount received almost always being greater than what you spent on the actual ticket. Which is a terrible way to run a lottery. As an added bonus, the daily tickets are actually fairly easy to win, and if you are playing three times every day, you should have no problem getting a winning ticket several times a week—that’ll net you 10,000 MGP per win!</p><p>Decorating in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> is just as fun as in real life, so take advantage of this opportunity to get into the Halloween spirit. Or, if you are reading this too late, know that these prizes are available year round, so you can pick them up now, show your love of black cats and ghosts independently of the festivities, and be ready for when the ghoulies return next year.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Tequila Works, the developer behind acclaimed puzzle game Rime and publisher of The Sexy Brutale, has laid off a number of staff as part of a studio restructure.</p>
<p>In addition, it has cancelled an unannounced game.</p>
<p>The studio made the announcement earlier today on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tequilaworks_with-deep-regret-we-must-inform-activity-7249379290159452160-vRKo/">LinkedIn</a>. "With deep regret, we must inform of the decision to cancel an unannounced game," it wrote. "This tough decision means we will be restructuring the studio to concentrate on the development of only one game. These changes will have an impact to a small number of roles at the studio.</p>

<p>"This is an incredibly difficult time, and our focus is to provide the support and guidance to those affected."</p>
<p>It's unclear exactly how many staff members are affected, or in which roles.</p>
<p>Tequila Works, based in Madrid, is best known as the developer of 2017's Rime, a beautiful puzzle game about a young boy lost on an island. That same year it co-developed and published The Sexy Brutale.</p>
<p>Since then, it released Stadia-exclusive Gylt in 2019, which made its way to consoles and PC shortly after that platform's shutdown.</p>
<p>Its most recent game was Song of Nunu: A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> Story, released under the Riot Forge label that shut down earlier this year.</p>
<p>Still, as the studio wrote in its post, it's now working on just one game, which can hopefully avoid the bad luck of recent releases.</p>
<p>Layoffs across the games industry in 2024 are now <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">estimated</a> to be at over 13,000.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">Microsoft laid off 650 staff</a>, in addition to 1900 earlier in 2024. Sony laid off 900 staff back in February, followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">220 staff at Bungie</a> in July.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/08/enotria-the-last-song-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/enotria-the-last-song-review.1003710/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/08/enotria-the-last-song-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Confession time: I have never played Dark Souls. Nor have I played any of its immediate kin. So, no Elden Ring, no Bloodborne, not even Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. My excuse is that, upon Dark Souls release, I was taking an enforced leave of absence from video games, so I missed all that initial buzz. And then, when I came back to the warm loving embrace of video gamedom, the thought of spending hours trying to beat just one boss kept me far away from the Souls-like phenomenon. How then, I wondered as Enotria: The Last Song booted up, would I get on with the latest entry in the bloated Souls-like genre?</p>
<p><iframe title="Enotria: The Last Song - Gamescom 2024 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3IO29PB62fI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Enotria stands out from its many Souls-like siblings in two ways. The first is its colour pallet. The aesthetic of Enotria is resoundingly light and bright. The action takes place beneath glorious azure skies, amongst scores of golden, gleaming sunflowers, through white-washed villas, and across resplendent sandy beaches. It’s a far cry from the dark, dank, and gloomy look usually associated with the genre.</p>


<p>The second way Enotria emerges from the pack is with its setting of Italian mythology. Like all brilliant mythologies, Italian folklore is totally bonkers and completely inaccessible and incomprehensible to those not already immersed in it. I couldn’t make head nor tail of the story, nor did I understand what was occurring with the characters at any given point. But when the world you’ve created is this wonderfully over-the-top, you can’t help but be carried away by the wilful insanity of it all. What I can tell you is that it involved the stage, acting, singing, lots of masks, and very big hats.</p>


<p>In comparison to its look and world building, when it comes to gameplay, Enotria is more traditional. Your silent protagonist explores, fights bosses, gathers weapons and equipment, discovers save points, and dies. A lot. To a Souls-like newbie like me, it’s all a bit much. There are so many systems, so many intricacies, that developers Jyamma Games clearly didn’t know where to even begin with communicating it all to the player. The tutorial is a near-endless stream of pop-up text boxes explaining everything and anything. You can barely move for the first hour of the game without another very long lump of text telling you in excruciating detail about whatever it is you just tried to do. Clearly., it’s very much a case of tell, don’t show.</p>
<p>As such, it takes a long time for Enotria to get going and find its feet. But slowly – very very slowly – the systems start to reveal themselves. Rather than different player characters, you can equip and wear masks to power your avatar with new abilities and skills. You can generously switch between several of these masks on a whim, giving ample opportunity to change up your play and discover some impressively long attack combos in the process. It’s a revelation, providing the opportunity to wipe out even the most tenacious of bosses with a devastating and lengthy series of strikes. Elemental attacks are also unusually interesting. Rather than the usual fire or ice ho-hum, how about imbuing your foe with drunkenness? Now that’s much more fun.</p>

<p>Whilst you can equip hundreds of different weapons, the fact is that a handful will be your go-to choice; offering everything you need to progress. Dodging is the name of the game here, which works well enough, though the attacks themselves lack a sense of impact and contact to truly thrill a player. Combat feels exactly as you’d expect, which is, in this context, completely fine.</p>
<p>Enotria really lets itself down when it comes to the jank. Locking on to foes is fiddly and forced. While the game struggles with characters trying to fight each other on different height levels, it just doesn’t like it and refuses to play. It’s a real problem when your foes seem obsessed with finding themselves stranded on small boulders, totally confused. In fact, enemy AI is generally dumb, and that’s being generous. I encountered issues with controller inputs too, the game choosing to stack up moves and do them all in one go, rather than when I tapped the button. A good patch or seven will definitely be required to smooth out the overall experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/red-dead-redemption-pc-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar has finally announced the&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>PC release date, bringing one of the industry's worst-kept secrets into the light at last.</p>
<p>As revealed in <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/o3314a19koo147/red-dead-redemption-and-undead-nightmare-coming-to-pc-october-29" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a news post</a> on Rockstar's official website,&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>comes to PC on October 28th, and just like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/red-dead-redemption-ps4-switch-port">PS4 and Switch releases</a> that landed last year, the PC release will include the&nbsp;<em>Undead Nightmare&nbsp;</em>expansion as well.</p>
<p>Murmurs have been circulating about the PC release of&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>for some time now, but the strongest evidence yet for the port's existence came in August, when a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/red-dead-redemption-pc-port-seemingly-leaked">since-deleted PlayStation Store listing</a> all but confirmed the PC version.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/red-dead-redemption-pc-release-date-canyon.jpg?itok=RfA5Gn09 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/red-dead-redemption-pc-release-date-canyon.jpg?itok=AVO3BF_S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>2010's cowboy epic&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>is finally coming to PC later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>The PC version of&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>is being developed alongside Double Eleven, which, I suppose, explains what the studio has been up to since it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prison-architect-2-double-eleven-leaves">left the&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect&nbsp;</em>franchise earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>It'll include many of the usual PC enhancements you'd expect from a port like this, including native 4K, support for up to 144Hz refresh rates, and support for both ultrawide and super ultrawide monitors, as well as keyboard and mouse support.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to support for Nvidia DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.0, as well as a host of graphical settings that should make it possible to enjoy&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>no matter what kind of machine you have (assuming it isn't an actual potato, of course).</p>

<p><em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>originally launched all the way back in 2010 for PS3 and Xbox 360, followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/red-dead-redemption-2">a sequel</a>,&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, in 2018. Believe it or not, this will be the first time the original&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>has ever been available on PC.</p>

One of the games industry's worst-kept secrets, the PC version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a>, is a worst-kept secret no longer. After an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-leak-more-clues-of-a-red-dead-redemption-pc-remaster">unconscionable period of leakage</a>, Rockstar have at last confirmed the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> port, together with a PC version of its Undead Nightmare expansion - they're coming to Rockstar Store, Steam and the Epic Games Store on October 29th 2024. Picture craggy old John Marston riding into town at sunset, whooping and firing six-shooters at the clouds. Actually, don't picture anything - that's what videos are for!

<p>You'll be able to buy both Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare as one package, with a bunch of PC-specific features and tune-ups, including the below: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
    Native 4K resolution and beyond at up to 144hz on supported hardware
</p>
<p>
    Monitor support for both Ultrawide (21:9) and Super Ultrawide (32:9)
</p>
<p>
    Full keyboard and mouse support
</p>
<p>
    Upscaling technologies support for Nvidia DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.0
</p>
<p>
    Nvidia DLSS Frame Generation
</p>
<p>
    Adjustable draw distances, shadow quality settings, and more 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
One thing the press release doesn't mention is multiplayer. The console game allowed up to 16 barking buckeroos to roam a version of the single player world. I remember having great fun with a preview build on Xbox 360, engaging in Mexican stand-offs and getting knocked off my horse. But what I mostly recall, and cherish, about Red Dead Redemption is how wonderfully buggy it was at launch. Here's another, funnier video.

That's all there is to say, at this point. I'm not sure I'm desperate to play the original RDR again, with Red Dead Redemption 2 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-review">already available on PC</a>, but if you're an avid Rockstar-gazer, it's something to fill the void between now and the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>.

		<p>Rockstar Games has announced that the original Red Dead Redemption is finally coming to PC this month on 29th October. The game will be available via Steam, Epic and the Rockstar Store, bundling the main game together with the Undead Nightmare for some perfectly timed zombie-horror action on Halloween.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare Coming to PC October 29" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mnvc6uC6xZE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Red Dead Redemption’s port has been handled by Double Eleven – Rockstar themselves are <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">kind of busy</a> – with the studio working in some PC-specific enhancements to the game, including support for native 4K at up to 144Hz, Ultrawide (21:9) and Super Ultrawide (32:9) screen support, HDR10, and keyboard and mouse support.</p>
<p>Even though the game is 14 years old, you might like to have some graphics settings on PC, and so there’s things like adjustable draw distances, shadow quality settings and more. You’ve also got Nvidia DLSS 3.7 (with frame generation), and AMD FSR 3.0 for upscaling.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption’s PC port has been rumoured for as long as it’s been overdue, and even leaked on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/15/red-dead-redemption-pc-version-leaks-again/">a couple</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/13/red-dead-redemption-for-pc-leaked-by-the-playstation-store/">occasions</a>. Originally launching for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2010, it was a part of the last wave of Rockstar games that came out before GTA V saw all the global studios combine their efforts. Rockstar San Diego’s work was a big hit, though, and led to the 2018 prequel Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>

<p>Being stuck on Xbox 360 and PS3, the game remained playable on modern platforms for a good long while only thanks to the Xbox One backward compatibility program. However, it’s now enjoying a renaissance with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/07/red-dead-redemption-announced-for-switch-and-ps4/">a Nintendo Switch and PS4 port</a> coming along last year, the latter version <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/04/red-dead-redemption-patched-to-run-at-60fps-on-ps5/">eventually patched to enable 60FPS gameplay on PS5</a>.</p>
<p>In our original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/05/19/review-red-dead-redemption/">Red Dead Redemption review</a> we scored the game a masterful 10/10, saying:</p>
<p>“Rockstar San Diego’s latest title is an unmissable game for any fan of the genre or great action adventures in general. We don’t often get masterpieces around here, but this is certainly one of those moments in time when gamers will look back more fondly on a dusty old six shooter than anything that involves jacking cars. The Wild West, then, is the new New York, and Rockstar have got their work cut out for them if they want Grand Theft Auto V to come anywhere near close to the majesty of Red Dead Redemption. A job we don’t envy.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-reaches-20-million-pre-registrations/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A fully-fledged game is being made of the Nikki series, with this being the fifth installment in the franchise. Infinity Nikki is an upcoming RPG with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-announced-zelda-botw-designer-producing/">expansive open world</a> where players get to explore the platform and unlock new clothing to dress up Nikki and her cat, Momo. While the game doesn't have an official release yet, those excited about the dress-up game are able to pre-register for the game, which will give them access to pre-registration rewards and news once the game is officially released. Back in August 2024, Infinity Nikki had officially reached 12 million pre-registrations. Currently, <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game is sitting at 21,268,111 global pre-registrations</a> for the upcoming gacha game. Hitting 20 million pre-registrations globally is just a little way off of the next milestone for Infinity Nikki, with them aiming to get to 25 million pre-registrations at the least. By reaching this number, those who have pre-registered will get the fated rewards that are mentioned on the Infinity Nikki website.</p>
<p>The gacha game genre is already heavily saturated, with games like Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, and Zenless Zone Zero taking the top spots. Love Nikki-Dress UP Queen is one of the longest standing mobile gacha games in the Nikki series, and it's possible that Infinity Nikki will compete with games such as Genshin Impact when it comes out.</p>
<p>At the moment, Infinity Nikki doesn't have an official release date, but there are plenty of playtests taking place at the moment, with some of those who had pre-registered being able to participate. It has been confirmed by the developers that those who participate in the playtest will not be able to save their data, as it will be wiped after the playtest is concluded.</p>
<p>Infinity Nikki is set to release on iOS, Android, PlayStation 5 and PC via the Epic Games Store. It's unsaid at the moment whether this game will release on Xbox Series X|S in the future, or whether those who want to play it will have to resort to playing it on their phone instead.</p>
<p>Papergames is developing Infinity Nikki, which is the same company that is responsible for making all of the other Nikki games, such as Love Nikki and Shining Nikki. Players who join the 20 million pre-registrations globally will be able to get rewards such as Bling, Threads of Purity, Resonite Crystals and a 4-star outfit for when they sign up to the game, giving them some extra resources for when this Unreal Engine 5 game releases.</p>

			<p>It's finally happening after years of rumors and <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-announcement-leaks-on-psn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaks</a>: Rockstar has just announced that Red Dead Redemption will be officially released on PC on October 29. It will also include the critically acclaimed Undead Nightmare expansion.</p>
<p>The port was handled by Double Eleven, the British game studio that also worked on the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch ports that were released last year. The PC port will offer a few unique features:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is not the full-fledged remake powered by the Red Dead Redemption 2 engine that many fans had hoped for. While PC gamers have been waiting to play this installment for a very long time, there were ways to do that via emulators for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch, and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-red-dead-redemption-playable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 4</a>. Whether the unique PC features will be enough to entice many users remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Still, there's a chance modders may modernize the game's visuals in a number of ways, from texture packs to character model tweaks to the various ray traced ReShade mods. Rockstar Games has not shared pricing details yet for the PC version of Red Dead Redemption; as a reference point, the game is priced at $49.99 on consoles.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Until Dawn Remake Apparently Has a Lower PS5 Player Count Than Concord]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-concord</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-until-dawn-remake-apparently-has-a-lower-ps5-player-count-than-concord.1003668/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-concord<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, the live-service disaster that limped out of the gate to a tiny player count and then was shut down just two weeks later? Well, the new&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake apparently has a lower player count than Firewalk's game on PS5.</p>
<p>Said <i>Until Dawn&nbsp;</i>remake <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date">launched just a few days ago</a>, and per a report by <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/until-dawn-ps5-player-count" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation trophy site TrueTrophies</a> (which, in turn, cites data from GameInsights), its player count was 28.6% lower than that of&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>on Sony's console.</p>
<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>performed so badly at launch that it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">shut down in early September</a>, with all players who bought it being offered full refunds. This, incidentally, caused some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-trophy-hunters-rivalry">pretty amusing trophy-hunting behavior</a> in the game's dying days.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-characters.jpg?itok=bm0BD_G0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-characters.jpg?itok=xGAOx-j9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>has apparently underperformed on PS5.</figcaption></figure><p>A couple of things are worth noting here. First, we don't know exactly how Sony was hoping the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake would perform (although we can guess that the company probably had higher hopes for its game than this).</p>
<p>Secondly,&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>does have a much higher <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2172010/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all-time Steam player count</a> than&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>achieved, with a peak of 2,607 on launch day as compared to&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">measly 697</a>.</p>
<p><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>is also a single-player game as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>'s live-service slant, so its lower player count won't hurt it anywhere near as much as&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>'s did, and there's a chance that sales will slowly grow as well.</p>
<p>However, critical reception for the game has been <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17416/until-dawn-2024-" rel="noopener" target="_blank">decidedly mixed</a>, with many questioning the need for its existence at all given that the original is only nine years old, as well as criticizing performance and visual issues.</p>

<p>So, why haven't more people picked up&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>on PS5? TrueTrophies reckons it's because of a lack of marketing and promotion, as well as the chance that customers are baulking at the high asking price for what they may see as nothing more than a minor visual upgrade.</p>
<p>Frankly, the decision to remake&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>at all is a baffling one to me. The original is still widely available on PS4, after all (although that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb">isn't stopping</a> Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/last-of-us-part-2-remastered-leaked-and-releasing-for-ps5-in-january">elsewhere</a>), and it's not like the 2015 game looks ugly or plays horribly compared to the original.</p>
<p>In any case, you can check out the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/until-dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

However, after flooding led to the event being delayed by a year, Gutenberg found himself out of money, and instead turned to his other project, a press that would use movable type to mechanize the process of printing books.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197284" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Iconic Director And Proud Nerd Kevin Smith On Sneaking Into Movies, Mallrats, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="643" data-playlist="197284,197260,197209" data-current="197284"><div><p>Iconic Director And Proud Nerd Kevin Smith On Sneaking Into Movies, Mallrats, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197284/197284_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197284/197284_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197284/197284_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197284/197284_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22826.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>By 1450, in the German city of Mainz, his first printing press was built and working, and by 1455 he was printing the Gutenberg Bible.  Between the 1460s and 1480s, the printing press went from a local business to something found across Germany, eventually spreading Western Europe-wide come 1500. This coincided with burgeoning religious turmoil during the rise of proto-Protestantism, the prelude to the Reformation, creating a threat to the Catholic rule with the dissemination of anti-authority publications suddenly more viable.</p><figure id="" data-id="205906dfd4025c40276fc1dc61808685" data-recommend-id="image://205906dfd4025c40276fc1dc61808685" data-format="jpg" data-width="455" data-height="365" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Malleus Maleficarum's inside text, with notes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Malleus Maleficarum's inside text, with notes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Public Domain</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="205906dfd4025c40276fc1dc61808685" data-recommend-id="image://205906dfd4025c40276fc1dc61808685" data-format="jpg" data-width="455" data-height="365" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Malleus Maleficarum's inside text, with notes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In 1486, a German Catholic clergyman and sexual pervert called Heinrich Kramer wrote a book called <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em>. It was a deranged and conspiratorial collection of gibberish about demons and witches, a compendium of superstitions that had built up over the last century in Europe, and a book that suggested the only solution for all of these issues was torture and murder.<br></p><p>A few years earlier, <em>Malleus Maleficarum </em>might have been copied out a few times and shared among the local clergy, and—along with Kramer’s prolific preaching—presumably inflicted a lot of harm on those in Innsbruck and the surrounding areas. But instead the book appeared at the convergence of multiple factors, given the country in which it was written, and the religious unrest that was occurring all across Europe, and the contemporaneous establishment of a means of mass-producing books. <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em>, thanks to this serendipitous confluence, went on to become a phenomenon,  its renown spreading through the 16th century. And despite the initial cries of heresy from both within and without the Inquisition, the book ignited a widespread moral panic in both the church and the public, focusing broad fears about the dangers of witchcraft, and introducing the need to torture and kill all who were suspected.</p><div><h4>Buried Treasure</h4><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a></span><em> is a site that hunts for excellent unknown games that aren’t getting noticed elsewhere.

With 28 editions published over the next century, it became the accepted manual for dealing with this satanic plague amongst <em>both</em> Catholics and Protestants, riding this perfect storm of newfound accessibility, religious unrest, and the 15th century’s hurricane of superstitions.<br></p><p><em>Malleus Maleficarum</em> would go on to lead to the torture and brutal deaths of countless women over hundreds of years: Between 1400 and 1775 (the peak being the mid-to-late 16th century), some 60,000 people were executed for witchcraft, 80 percent of whom were women.</p><figure id="" data-id="7d2edca7c47f052b458af3f56d369ebc" data-recommend-id="image://7d2edca7c47f052b458af3f56d369ebc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A beaked figure with spikey teeth stands in the looming darkness." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A beaked figure with spikey teeth stands in the looming darkness." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Katanalevy / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7d2edca7c47f052b458af3f56d369ebc" data-recommend-id="image://7d2edca7c47f052b458af3f56d369ebc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A beaked figure with spikey teeth stands in the looming darkness." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the short indie horror <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3048140/Daemonologie/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3048140/Daemonologie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Daemonologie</em></a></span>,<em>&nbsp;</em>you play a witch finder of the 1600s, sent to a small Scottish village to discover the identity of an alleged local witch. Only six people remain in the village, and you must speak to them all to hear their accusations and defences, and after five days, identify who should be hanged for witchcraft.</p><p>This is an astonishing game, presented in a combination of scratchy, white-on-black drawings and hauntingly brilliant stop-motion animations, and written in old Scots English. There are four days of play, in which you speak to each of the locals to hear their beliefs and protestations and, should you want to hear more information, make use of the nonchalantly included option to crudely torture them. When you’ve unearthed four new pieces of information, night falls, and you have a prophetic stop-motion nightmare to guide you in your decisions. Normal stuff.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the game begins with a message explaining that it’s intended to be played in old Scots English, and while there’s an in-game glossary if needed, it also offers a version in modern English. If English is your first language, you don’t need the latter, believe me—it’s all easily understood, or inferred, and adds a great deal to the whole atmosphere of the game. </p><figure id="" data-id="e508f31c97508e2174a82cd7c9d1f704" data-recommend-id="image://e508f31c97508e2174a82cd7c9d1f704" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman sits at the center of a spiral of stones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman sits at the center of a spiral of stones." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Katanalevy / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e508f31c97508e2174a82cd7c9d1f704" data-recommend-id="image://e508f31c97508e2174a82cd7c9d1f704" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman sits at the center of a spiral of stones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Among the villagers, there’s Maiden Lilias, who spends her time in the Ring O Stanes, a stone circle that the local priest believes is the site at which she kills babies. She, however, maintains that she’s an herbalist, like her mother before her, at the stones to meet her lover who is missing. Then there’s Blacksmith Oswain, in the Smiths Abode, whose jaw is held on by a wire cage after what he claims was a curse by the Shepherd Violet. She instead accuses Oswain of releasing a wolf among her flock, killing her sheep and her livelihood. Accusations fly.<br></p><p>I wondered if it might be possible to finish the game without using the “torture” option, given that didn’t seem a comfortable pick when the other choice was “Talk.” I’m not one prone to choosing to torture, as it happens. However, it is not, and that’s rather brilliant it turns out, given the unconscionably matter-of-fact tone the witch hunter, and in turn the game, takes throughout. Tortures play out as grotesque minigames, where you pull at a person’s tongue until it tears, or time mouse clicks to squeeze a person’s fingers until they’re crushed. They’re disgusting little things, like twisted versions of a golf game’s timed swings, that may cause a character to reveal information they were holding back, or even to confess.</p><p>There’s no joy in this. But there’s no expressed revulsion, either. It’s coldly delivered by the witchfinder, albeit with accompanying screams from his victims. It matches the aesthetic decision to have the stop-motion characters all appear with blank space where their faces should be—this is a game that entirely trusts <em>you </em>to have appropriate reactions to unjust horror, rather than needing to demonstrate it to you.</p><figure id="" data-id="289447ff30d5b97963d53e813c7b7fc4" data-recommend-id="image://289447ff30d5b97963d53e813c7b7fc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The witchfinder talks to another resident, in front of his cart." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The witchfinder talks to another resident, in front of his cart." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Katanalevy / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="289447ff30d5b97963d53e813c7b7fc4" data-recommend-id="image://289447ff30d5b97963d53e813c7b7fc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The witchfinder talks to another resident, in front of his cart." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Then, come the fifth day, you make your accusation and that person—again in the incredible, black-and-white stop-motion film—is hanged. And you leave.<br></p><p>This coldness is what makes <em>Daemonologie </em>so brilliant. It’s what makes this a 30-minute game that led me to research (read: trawl Wikipedia) and write this piece’s introduction, primarily inspired by the first episode of the BBC’s fantastic <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001324q&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001324q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Coming Storm</em> podcast</a></span>, to understand how humanity reached such a nonchalance in the face of such deranged cruelty.</p><p>It certainly helps that it’s wonderfully drawn, with incredibly atmospheric sound and music, coupled with every line being so meticulously underwritten. And there’s the small matter of those unnerving, sometimes horrifying stop-motion nightmares. This is all the work of one guy, Chris Evry, a passion project made in his spare time, sold for only $3.</p><hr><p><em>Daemonologie </em>achieves so much more than it otherwise might thanks to its brevity and its lack of an attempt to preach or proselytise. The horror is the horror, and it’s not a scary witch. That you have to be a part of that horror to experience it only makes it far more powerful.<br></p><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3048140/Daemonologie/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3048140/Daemonologie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Daemonologie </em>is available on Steam for just three bucks</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
