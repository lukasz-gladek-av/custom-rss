            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-concept-art-apology<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has apologized for an element found in some of its&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>concept art that has been found to infringe a Japanese re-enactment group's flag.</p>
<p>The company's apology comes via its <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1810238727064854807" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Japanese branch</a> (with additional reporting by <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/ubisoft-apologies-for-assassins-creed-shadows-flag-art-infringement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Siliconera</a>). In the apology, for which we're using machine translation, Ubisoft says two pieces of&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>concept art use the flag design of the Sekigahara Rifle Corps, a war re-enactment group.</p>
<p>According to the studio, it contacted the Rifle Corps to apologize, and its apology was accepted. The flag in question will no longer appear in&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' concept art, although it will remain in art that has been printed as part of the physical book included with the game's collector's edition.</p>

<p>Still, if you're buying the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>collector's edition, you'll probably be able to spot the offending flag. After all, it's not really possible to remove art from a physical book without a full recall, which Ubisoft clearly isn't willing or able to do.</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series. Due to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date">launch in November</a>, it continues the RPG-heavy style of more recent entries like&nbsp;<em>Odyssey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valhalla</em>, eschewing the back-to-basics approach of&nbsp;<em>Mirage</em>.</p>
<p>The game will feature two playable protagonists: real-life historical figure Yasuke, the first real person to be playable in&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>, and fictional Japanese shinobi Naoe.</p>

Another unit may never be found, but a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomics.ha.com%2Fitm%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-playstation-snes-prototype-controller-sony-nintendo-1992-jpn%2Fp%2F7378-60001.s%23">second prototype controller</a> from the failed Nintendo and Sony collaboration is going up for auction in August.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/5/5/15562864/nintendo-playstation-prototype-finally-working-plays-cd-rom-games">Nintendo PlayStation</a> was Sony’s first attempt to break into the gaming market. It was more or less a Super Nintendo console upgraded with a CD-ROM drive, allowing games to incorporate more multimedia content from Sony’s proprietary Super Disc format.</p><p>The collaboration collapsed after Nintendo announced a partnership with Philips in 1991, and the 200 prototypes of the Nintendo PlayStation were thought to have all been destroyed — at least until one surfaced in 2015 and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomics.ha.com%2Fitm%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-play-station-super-nes-cd-rom-prototype-sony-and-nintendo-c-1992%2Fa%2F7224-93060.s">was eventually sold at auction</a> to the founder of Pets.com and Toys.com.</p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomics.ha.com%2Fitm%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-playstation-snes-prototype-controller-sony-nintendo-1992-jpn%2Fp%2F7378-60001.s%23">Heritage Auctions</a> hasn’t shared the provenance behind this second Nintendo PlayStation auction but describes the prototype controller as having “the familiar casing of a Super Nintendo controller but branded with ‘Sony PlayStation’ in dark gray on the front.” Despite a “few little dings on the back,” the prototype is in “very nice condition,” but Heritage Auctions can’t confirm if it’s functional given the extreme scarcity of the console it’s designed to work with. As a result, there will be no returns for the winning bidder.</p><p>An even bigger question than where this prototype was discovered is how much it will sell for. In 2020, a sealed copy of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320274/super-mario-bros-sealed-copy-auction-record-most-expensive-game-ever"><em>Super Mario Bros.</em> sold for $114,000</a>, and less than a year later, another copy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364245/super-mario-bros-most-expensive-game-ever-record-sealed-auction">sold for $660,000</a>. But spending that much money on a game you never intend to play seems like a bargain compared to the copy of <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. that sold in 2021 for a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/7/22614450/unopened-copy-super-mario-bros-sells-2-million-record">staggering $2 million</a>.</p><p>Demand for retro collectibles hasn’t cooled since then, and while this controller may not go for as much as the Nintendo PlayStation console did, it’s still incredibly rare hardware that may never turn up again. </p><p>According to Heritage Auctions, bidding on this prototype will start on August 2nd and will end on August 24th, when we’ll find out what a probably unusable controller is worth to one lucky bidder.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-to-present-neural-texture-block-compression-technique-reducing-game-sizes-with-easy-game-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in late June, AMD unveiled an AI-powered method to compress textures called NTBC (Neural Texture Block Compression). Following its presentation at last week's 35th Eurographics Symposium on Rendering, AMD has now <a href="https://x.com/GPUOpen/status/1810439717714034957" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the paper penned by researchers Shin Fujieda and Takahiro Harada on the GPU Open website, revealing details on this new technique.</p>
<p>The objective of NTBC is to reduce game file sizes, which have been on a constant increase over the past few years. It's not at all rare anymore for games to require <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-file-size-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 150GB</a> of free disk space to be installed. The main culprit for the increasingly large game file sizes are, of course, high-resolution textures for 4K displays and the like.</p>
<p>With the neural-based approach, NTBC learns how to map uncompressed textures to block-compressed textures (the paper focuses on the BC1 and BC4 formats), achieving up to 70% smaller storage footprint while maintaining reasonable texture quality and avoiding any change in the shaders. Here's an excerpt from the paper on how it all works:</p>
<p><em>NTBC employs multi-layer perceptions (MLPs) to simultaneously encode block-compressed data of all textures in one material, achieving lower bit rates than the standard BC while producing the same block-compressed data format.</em><br>
<em>NTBC is meant to reduce the texture footprint on the disk. Network weights are stored in the disk which are loaded into the memory. Then inference is executed to reconstruct block-compressed texture data which are copied to VRAM. Therefore, it does not require any change in the shaders, which makes our method easier to adopt in the existing graphics pipelines. We also utilize multi-resolution feature grids to encourage model optimization and compress them through quantization-aware training to reduce storage costs.</em></p>
<figure><figcaption>Credits to AMD's Shin Fujieda and Takahiro Harada</figcaption></figure>
<p>The AMD researchers note that NTBC predicts block-compressed data instead of loading block-compressed textures from the disk; then, texel values are decoded from the compressed data using the existing BC decompression method at runtime. As such, the technique only introduces a modest computational overhead at the texture loading phase in the graphics pipeline.</p>
<p>This was estimated to be between 27.31 ms and 49.84 ms, depending on the choice between conservative (which runs two distinct models for RGB and single-channel textures) and aggressive approaches. It would seem relatively high, but the researchers clarify it's not going to be a problem because the inference is only executed once per material instead of loading textures from the disk.</p>
<p>Of course, NTBC isn't perfect yet. Its creators recognize that it occasionally creates blurred details or block artifacts due to its usage of lower-resolution grids compared to the original texture. Possible solutions include different encoding methods, like texture-focusing encoding or local positional encoding. Regarding formats, the AMD researchers believe NTBC could be extended to BC6H and BC7, too.</p>
<p>Right now, it's anyone's guess when this might be implemented by games. The sooner, the better, though.</p>

A young woman at home alone answers a call, with a menacing voice on the other side of the line responding that they are someone who “wants to play Xbox.” The woman responds by saying that you need the console to play Xbox games. “You don’t need an Xbox to play Xbox,” the voice spookily asserts. Soon the menacing voice calls back and asks, “What’s your favorite video game?” Freaked out, the woman asks, “What kind of game is this?”</p><p>Ohoho, this is no game. It’s <em>hundreds</em> of games! The woman walks into the living room and sees that her TV, which boasts an Amazon Fire Stick, can now play Xbox games. Turns out she locked the doors to make sure no one interrupts her unprompted game night now that she has Game Pass, and most of its catalog, at her fingertips thanks to the cloud.</p><p>As of today, Xbox is taking the next step in its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-wants-to-let-you-play-games-without-a-console-1847071304&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-wants-to-let-you-play-games-without-a-console-1847071304">Play Anywhere initiative</a></span>, which has found Microsoft deemphasizing the need for a physical console in order to play its games. This began in earnest at the outset of the current console generation when Xbox Game Pass also debuted on PC, allowing folks with capable computers to access a sizable chunk of Xbox’s library. Soon enough, the term “Xbox exclusive” effectively implied PC as well, and Microsoft hasn’t stopped there.</p><p>Thanks to its efforts with the cloud and remote gaming, Xbox games have also been playable on mobile devices, as well as certain makes of Samsung smart TVs as of just last year. With this latest ad, the Xbox app is now making its way to Amazon Fire Sticks, further eliminating the need for a console.</p><p>However, this initiative isn’t without some drawbacks. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cloud-gaming-remote-play-impressions-xbox-ps5-1851571183&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cloud-gaming-remote-play-impressions-xbox-ps5-1851571183">As great as the cloud is these days</a></span>, it’s still hardly a proper substitute for a console with games installed on it, as cloud gaming remains susceptible to the ebb and flow of internet connectivity for stability. For folks expecting high quality graphics, cloud gaming (and especially Microsoft’s XCloud technology) isn’t ideal, as it compresses the image in order to run games better. Then there’s the matter of the catalog: Xbox’s app can only afford players <em>most </em>of the titles on offer via Game Pass, not the entirety of one’s catalog of owned games. That not only means the library is fairly limited, but also that you must be subbed to Xbox Game Pass in order to make use of the app.</p><p>Other than that, Xbox’s play to get its games on as many platforms as possible is clearly off to the races, and it’s a reasonable bet to assume it’ll keep expanding for the foreseeable future.

<p>After years of work, the third-party modders at Team Folon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout4london/comments/1dwntc1/release_progress_update/">announced over the weekend</a> that their long-awaited (and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-fallout-london-mod-has-been-delayed-by-fallout-4s-planned-next-gen-update/">recently delayed</a>) "DLC-sized" unofficial fan mod, <a href="https://fallout4london.com/?page_id=14"><em>Fallout: London</em></a>, is now in "QA testing" and awaiting the "final green light" from release partner GOG. But that release will apparently need to make use of a "downgrader" to work around a recent Bethesda "next-gen" update that upended all of the team's modding efforts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-london-mod-finally-gets-release-date-april/">Back in December</a>, Team Folon announced that its work on the <em>Fallout: London</em> mod would culminate in a planned April 23 release, lining up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George%27s_Day_in_England">England's widely celebrated St. George's Day</a>. Then, just weeks before the planned launch, Bethesda <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1778444117770444973">announced</a> that its own planned "next-gen" update for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/fallout-4-review-check-your-next-gen-expectations-at-the-vault-door/">the 2015 game</a> would be coming out on April 25, two days after <em>Fallout: London</em>'s launch target.
</p><p>"That has, for lack of a better term, screwed us over," Team Folon Project Manager Dean Carter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L71cZvASvAE">said in an interview with the BBC</a> shortly after Bethesda's upgrade announcement. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpqMftkTteo">a separate video</a>, Carter said that the next-gen update "requires many of our internal systems to be updated," since the content they created in the <a href="https://f4se.silverlock.org/"><em>Fallout 4</em> Script Extender</a> likely wouldn't work under the updated code. That turned out to be a valid concern, as the next-gen update <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-is-nearly-16-gigs-breaks-modded-saves-and-doesnt-seem-to-change-much-at-all/">did end up breaking many <em>Fallout 4</em> mods and saves</a> after its release.</p>
<p>"With the new update dropping just 48 hours later [than our planned launch], the last four years of our work stand to simply break," Carter said at the time. "We've had the release candidate ready to go, but we've had to put it down for the fixes we know it's going to need."</p>
<h2>Moving back to move forward</h2>
<p>To implement those needed fixes, Team Folon said in a <a href="https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1809555735681913115/photo/1">social media</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout4london/comments/1dwntc1/release_progress_update/">update</a> over the weekend that it will make use of a "downgrader" to undo Bethesda's mod-breaking updates. "At the 11th hour we've discovered that the next-gen, even after updates, isn't stable enough," Carter <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/1234891241184038973/1259924540088123393">wrote on the Team Folon Discord</a>. "Thus, we are now going out on the old version, thus the need for a downgrader."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LpqMftkTteo?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>Carter discusses the reason behind the initial <em>Fallout: London</em> delay.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Team Folon's release plans were further complicated when Bethesda <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1790052783183286435?lang=en">released another game update on May 13</a> that disrupted their work. "The most annoying thing for us is having something. Then delaying to wait for the next gen 3rd party fixes. Then having another update. Then having it still not working," Carter <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/1234891241184038973/1260033730765131916">wrote on Discord</a>. "It's been an utter frustration and every setback requires the testing process to restart. Which is why we've decided to go with the downgrader route and when the 'next-gen' is sorted, update it for that."</p>
<p>Team Folon initially planned to release <em>Fallout: London</em> on Nexus Mods, but the files ended up too large to host on the popular mod distribution site. Luckily, GOG provided a "light at the end of the tunnel" for the mod's release, Carter said, and the platform is currently helping provide the final quality assurance to make sure that "<em>Fallout: London</em> and its installer [and downgrader] work on all supported machines."</p>
<p>"I think for us, and what distinguishes GOG from Steam, is that we're just a bunch of very enthusiastic guys,” a GOG spokesperson <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-london-gog-release-delay-fallout-4-update-interview/">told TheGamer</a> in a recent interview about distributing <em>Fallout: London</em>. "There was just a project that we wanted to support, and we're like, ‘Hey, guys, this is great. Let's do it, it's gonna be fun,' Preparing for this, we're already having tons of fun.”</p>
<p>While Team Folon hasn't announced a new release date for <em>Fallout: London</em> just yet, it sounds like GOG's quality-assurance check is now the final thing preventing the long-awaited launch. When anyone asks about the release date on the Team Folon Discord, they're greeted with a stock message: "As soon as we fix what the update breaks, it'll be out."</p>

                <p>Some deals sound a little too good to be true, but this early <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a> special on Airpods Max are no joke! Apple's premium headset, this pricy tech of hardware traditionally retails for $549, but it's on sale for its lowest price ever, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Blue/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an astonishing $399</a>.

The sound quality from these, as you'd imagine, superb and can easily rival the biggest brands in this tech category. They are also extremely comfortable and offer stellar active noise-cancellation.</p><p>The AirPods Max are often compared to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony's WH-1000XM5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bose's QuietComfort (and Ultra)</a>. You can't go wrong with any of these if you want a high-end pair of headphones with noise-canceling tech, but Apple's AirPods have always been more expensive--that's what makes this deal so notable. In the three years since the AirPods Max released, Amazon has never charged less than $430.</p><p>With active noise-canceling on, you also get up to 20 hours of battery life from a full charge, and they can also share audio between other Apple AirPods or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Pro-Personalized-Compatibility/dp/B0C8PT7DF5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beats headphones</a> provided you're playing audio from an Apple device. If you have an Apple Music subscription, the spatial audio technology makes you feel like you're at a live concert.</p><p>You can of course use this Bluetooth headset with other sources, like an Android phone or your PC, as it is a versatile device.</p><p>If you're on the hunt for something more affordable,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Apple AirPods</a> are available for the very nice price of only $69 currently. These rest in your ear, and are a very good option if you're not a fan of jamming a piece of silicone directly into your ear canals. These are powered by Apple's H1 chip and provide surprisingly good sound alongside a battery life of around 24 hours total listening time with the included charging case.</p><h2>Apple AirPods Early Prime Day 2024 Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Blue/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods Max</a> -- $399 (<del>$549</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods (2nd gen)</a> -- $69 (<del>$129</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1WXVQTN?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods (3rd gen)</a> -- $129 ($<strike>169</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods with USB-C charging (2nd gen)</a> -- $169 ($<strike>249</strike>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dualsense-edge-ps5-controller-deal-walmart-prime-day-2024/1100-6524765/">PS5 DualSense Edge Controller Gets First Major Discount Ahead Of Prime Day</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-is-the-best-nintendo-switch-lite-deal-weve-ever-seen/1100-6522718/">This Is The Best Nintendo Switch Lite Deal We've Ever Seen</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/walmart-deals-prime-day-2024/2900-5577/">Huge Walmart Sale Features Incredible Gaming Deals Ahead Of Prime Day</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Early Prime Day Deals to Shop Now Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3-vr-headset-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet-at-walmart/1100-6524762/">Meta Quest 3 VR Headset Is On Sale For Its Best Price Yet At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-circle-week-nintendo-switch-game-deals/1100-6524715/">Grab Super Mario, Zelda, And More Nintendo Switch Exclusives For $35 While You Can</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-party-joy-con-bundle-is-cheaper-than-the-controllers-by-themselves/1100-6518931/">Super Mario Party Joy-Con Bundle Is Cheaper Than The Controllers By Themselves</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-a-pair-of-apple-airpods-for-only-69-at-amazon-before-this-very-nice-deal-sells-out/1100-6519008/">Grab A Pair Of Apple AirPods For Only $69 At Amazon Before This Very Nice Deal Sells Out</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/kagurabachi-shonen-jump-manga-memes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kagurabachi-is-better-than-memes-would-have-you-believe.922638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kagurabachi-shonen-jump-manga-memes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes a series so powerfully sucks you into a “I need to know what happens next” vortex that you sit transfixed for as many hours as it takes. The last time I ended up in that place with a manga was part one of <em>Chainsaw Man</em>. Well, until yesterday. On a friend’s recommendation, I started reading <a href="https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/kagurabachi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kagurabachi</em></a>, another Shonen Jump series, albeit one that only just kicked off in September 2023. It’s a fun time – much more enjoyable than a now-infamous meme riffing on its bland-sounding premise would suggest.</p><p><em>Kagurabachi </em>takes place in a version of Japan where ultra-powerful enchanted swords functioned as the great equalizer in a war that unfolded a couple decades prior. Chihiro, the main character, is the son of the man who forged those enchanted blades. So basically, the story is about Oppenheimer’s kid, except in a world where Japan created the atomic bomb instead of falling victim to it. Chihiro is raised in relative peace by his father, depicted as a principled but happy-go-lucky slacker type, until mysterious assassins show up and shatter that idyllic existence. Chihiro swears revenge and dedicates himself to studying the blade.</p><p>If that setup sounds generic, well, it kind of is! This <a href="https://gamerant.com/kagurabachi-manga-popularity-memes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turned <em>Kagurabachi </em>into a meme</a> before it even got up and running, with Shonen Jump readers conjuring up an irony-laced alternate reality in which it was a revered all-time great based on the premise alone. Committed non-fans charted out an imagined anime adaptation of the series, even getting a legit voice actor to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_8E6042TxE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record some lines</a>. Basically, <em>Kagurabachi </em>nearly ended up in the same hole as Jared Leto nonstarter <em>Morbius</em>: beloved as a series of building blocks for a gag rather than as an actual work.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, perhaps in part due to this meme, <em>Kagurabachi </em>achieved success, selling hundreds of thousands of copies and garnering a real fandom in addition to gawkers lured in by gags. This has allowed it to blossom into a series that gives me what I want out of a shonen battle manga these days: character-driven action that doesn’t sprawl needlessly in all directions. As somebody who grew up on bloated behemoths like <em>Naruto </em>and <em>Bleach </em>– and who cannot resist today’s variation on that theme, the entertaining mess that is <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> – I’m over series that refuse to get to the point.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Kagurabachi</em>’s tale of sorcery and sabotage in a modern-ish Japan demonstrates uncommon focus as far as these things go. Chihiro wants to collect the enchanted blades and learn why his father died. He has to go through the underworld to do so, putting him in the crosshairs of weapons dealers, the government, and a clan that basically organizes the black market, but the story doesn’t lose sight of its purpose.<em> Kagurabachi </em>reminds me of <em>Chainsaw Man</em> part one in that its pace is propulsive. It never lingers too long on a single villain or fight, nor does it suddenly introduce a bunch of secondary characters for the purpose of drawing out arcs or expanding the cast. This is Chihiro’s story – or rather, he tends to be the force that moves the story forward. New characters are introduced in service of that, rather than for their own sake.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike the Narutos and Gokus of the world, Chihiro (and his enemies) are unafraid to kill, which also keeps things moving forward. Put another way, an early villain who I thought for sure would stick around to become a sort of Vegeta- or Sasuke-like anti-hero… just died. And then it was time for the next arc. This is not to say Chihiro is cold-blooded: His father raised him to believe that the enchanted blades must be used to protect others, an idea <em>Kagurabachi</em>’s villains regularly challenge by pointing out that they’re effectively weapons of mass destruction. I’m not sure how the series plans to square these contradictory notions, but I’m at least interested enough to watch it try.</p><p><em>Kagurabachi</em>’s main issue is that the ideas and concepts surrounding Chihiro are more interesting than Chihiro himself. He tends to be calm, collected, and practical. At first, this serves as a refreshing contrast to shonen battle series’ long history of brash idealists who win on willpower alone. Chihiro is willing to scheme and sneak attack if it means overcoming insurmountable odds. The second arc, which involves a giant yakuza auction undergirded by some really creative magic, plays out almost like a heist movie in places. While <em>Kagurabachi </em>is clearly inspired by numerous shonen greats, there’s some <em>John Wick</em> in there, too.</p><p>But Chihiro’s dispassionate disposition sometimes makes it difficult to get emotionally invested in his struggles. He is perhaps too cool, demonstrating why this archetype tends to be a supporting character or anti-hero in these sorts of stories rather than the lead. Side characters pick up the emotional slack in places, but so far <em>Kagurabachi</em> has failed to tug at my heartstrings like <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, or even <em>Jujutusu Kaisen</em> in its more focused moments.</p><p>I’m enjoying <em>Kagurabachi </em>for what it is, though: A well-paced fight manga with cool powers, great art, and a world that’s a lot more interesting than it initially seems. Perhaps someday it will grow into an anime with too many arcs and a Library of Alexandria’s worth of lore, but for now it’s comfort food with a hint of spice – aka shonen at its best. If you’re hoping for more, well, you’re probably looking in the wrong genre.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The early images for Starry Studio’s Once Human, featuring weird fusions of everyday objects and pulsating alien flesh, were certainly striking and my interest was piqued without knowing anything about what kind of game it was set to be. I was a little disappointed to discover that it was to be an online rather than single-player affair, but when a demo became available during Steam’s NextFest I grabbed the opportunity to try it out – even roping in some friends to try out the multiplayer aspects. My overall impression is still one of intrigued confusion as the game emulates many other successful titles but still needs to find an identity of its own.</p>
<p><iframe title="Once Human | Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XTwOAAGhLCk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once Human throws you straight into a tutorial mission that plays out like a lost quest from Remedy’s Control. The uncanny surroundings and even the graphical style feel very familiar and this opening left me excited to play out a more narrative and single-player-focused version of the title. That being said, my co-op friends who switched servers to join me were less enamoured once they had to complete the tutorial each time they did so. This is hopefully a demo-only issue and you would hope will be skippable in the full release.</p>


<p>Once into the main game you’re required to find a patch of land to stake your claim and begin building a base. The shared nature of the space means that it can take an unfortunate amount of time to actually find somewhere, however, which doesn’t make for the most impactful early impression. There are multiple servers to play in but the aforementioned tutorial issues will put off players if not remedied. When choosing a server the game will warn you if it is busy so hopefully this is another aspect that will be smoother at release.</p>
<p>Building a base is simple and the construction mechanics are fairly intuitive. I initially went for a barebones approach and just built parts as and when the progress required it. It was clear that others had put a lot of time and thought into their homes though and it’s great that the potential for such different approaches appears to be present. One massive caveat for this whole preview, however, is that it is still unclear quite how the season progress of the game will work. At present, it appears that the game will work on a six-week rotation with different quests and challenges every week before progress is reset and the season repeats. This one decision will probably make or break it for many and it remains to be seen quite how Starry manage to retain players and what will be carried over in-game.</p>


<p>The main game plays out as a fusion of third-person looter shooter and survival mechanics. Hunger and thirst mechanics need to be managed and there is an additional sanity meter that diminishes based on how much exposure to the mysterious StarDust entities you have. The gunplay is solid if unspectacular and there appears to be a decent range of weapons to construct and enhance although the blueprints needed to unlock new ones are scattered in pieces so it may be a while between each new one.</p>
<p>At present, the 6-week season resets character and items but you retain global collectables and building (maybe but the language is unclear on this). This in theory prevents a huge onboarding ceiling for coming in later but also means there’s little reason to grind out other than just running through the core objectives each time. There seems to be an ‘Everdream’ mode unlocked after a decent amount of story progression that may be more permanent? Again, the wording is unclear and subject to change. In general, I think they’re currently juggling several different approaches and seeing what sticks.</p>

<p>Multiplayer is a key part of the game though the current implementation is functional but somewhat limited. You and your friends can occupy the same world and interact with one other to some extent but only the boss fight instances are true co-op. Entering into one of these teleports you to a separate boss arena and these play out pretty well. The one I tried with my friends wasn’t especially challenging, something that characterised most of my 8 hours with the game. That being said, this was all on the first area and I think things ramp up as you make further progress. After my friends decided to log off I carried on a bit and fought with a spectral treant doppelganger that was vaguely challenging on my own, not just because I was under-levelled but mainly due to my running out of bullets part way through. I beat it eventually as dying and respawning don’t renew the boss’s health, letting me whittle it down by burning it with molotovs and torch.</p>
<p>I’m still tempted by the full game for Once Human, especially if you can solo when others aren’t around to avoid missing out on the progress before season shifts, but much will depend on what is lost each time as I don’t relish starting from relative scratch. Once Human is also free-to-play so a lot will depend on how predatory the cash shop is, how many different currencies it tries to squeeze in, and to what degree it becomes pay to win. Hopefully, we’ll have answers to all these questions this week.</p>

			<p>A new version of the Need for Speed Underground RTX Remix mod has been made available, and here's what it does.</p>
<p>We reported on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-nfs-underground-mod-looks-stunning-in-new-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Remaster mod for Need for Speed Underground</a> some months ago, and the creator of the mod - ‘alessandro893’ - has now released a <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/need-for-speed-underground-rtx-remix/downloads/nfs-underground-rtx-v01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new version. </a>The latest version - version 0.1 - packs various bug fixes as well as performance improvements. In addition, this version aims to address issues with transparent materials and packs many new PBR textures. According to the official release notes for this version, all cars now also have both head and tail lights, and volumetric lights.</p>
<p>When using this mod, the game's resolution is set to 4K by default. Players can choose to change the resolution by editing the&nbsp;"scripts/NFSUnderground.WidescreenFix.ini" file. Also, mirror-like car reflections can be turned off by deleting the "rtx.conf" file, and renaming - "rtx(less-car-reflections).conf" to "rtx.conf".</p>
<p>As mentioned by the creator of the mod, car reflections still aren't perfect, and with the mod still being in active development, there are plenty of issues that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>The latest version of the Need for Speed Underground RTX Remix mod can be <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/need-for-speed-underground-rtx-remix/downloads/nfs-underground-rtx-v01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downloaded from here</a>. The mod offers path-traced global/direct illumination, upscaled textures, more than 2500 additional lights, and more. We've included a video of the latest version of the mod in action below:</p>

As seen in previous set photos, Ramsey has their hair pulled back in a similar fashion to Ellie’s in the sequel, but is notably longer. Here, they are wearing the gray-blue overshirt and jeans Ellie wears during the Seattle segments.</p><p>This is the first time we’ve seen Ramsey sporting Ellie’s tattoo. It depicts a moth landing on a fern and goes down the length of her right forearm. She uses this to cover up a chemical burn where her infected cordyceps bite once was, thus allowing her to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-show-hbo-why-is-ellie-immunity-mom-anna-1850219045&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-show-hbo-why-is-ellie-immunity-mom-anna-1850219045">hide her immunity</a></span>. However, as we see more of the show’s costuming, fans are starting to nitpick with the finer details, such as the hairstyles and tattoo size/placement not being quite one-to-one with Ellie’s in-game model.</p><p>While there was certainly some pushback about Ellie and Dina’s looks in the show, plenty of other fans argued that in the grand scheme of things, it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Colt_Cammie/status/1810496063490363717&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Colt_Cammie/status/1810496063490363717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doesn’t have a huge effect on the show’s story</a></span> and character arcs.

Also, if people want to watch something that is identical to the game, they could…play the game.</p><p>While Ellie and Dina have people in their feelings, folks seem pretty universally positive on what seems to be the first look at the Seraphites. These people are a cult in Seattle, and Ellie is mostly passing through their story during her time in the city, and some of the set photos show what appears to be a group of actors in costume between takes. Based on what we know about HBO’s plans for <em>The Last of Us</em>, it’s likely we’ll see more of the Seraphites in season three, if the show divides <em>Part II</em>’s story the same way as the game. But we’ll avoid diving too deep into that hypothetical for spoilers’ sake.</p><p><em>The Last of Us</em>’ second season will premiere in 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-degenerate-gamblers-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</em>, a deckbuilding roguelike with an eye on&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>'s crown, has an official release date, publisher Yogscast and developer Purple Moss Collectors have announced.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers&nbsp;</em>release date is officially August 8th, so if you've been waiting to add this one to your wishlist, now's the perfect time to do so.</p>
<p>Per a press release, the roguelike, which is themed around blackjack (as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>'s poker), was one of the most recent Steam Next Fest's top 25 most-played demos, and it's also amassed over 120,000 wishlists on Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-degenerate-gamblers-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=MiDQAcsS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-degenerate-gamblers-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=DsxfeDXX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</em>&nbsp;wears its influences on its sleeve (and presumably up it as well).</figcaption></figure><p><em>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers&nbsp;</em>takes place in a tavern that plays host to a "very unique, corrupted version of blackjack" with ever-changing rules.</p>
<p>You'll need to observe the rules carefully and adapt to them, changing your strategy to suit your opponents, who consist of a "colorful cast of blackjack-addicted townspeople". Yikes. Perhaps we should be helping these people, not feeding their habits.</p>
<p>Different suits grant different bonuses; hearts heal, spades provide protection, clubs add damage, and diamonds grant currency to help you make shop purchases.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, if you love&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, you're probably going to like this one as well, as it looks to be offering a similar zany twist on a classic and well-loved card game. You can check out the release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>

<p>Wanting to emulate&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>'s success makes a great deal of sense. After all, LocalThunk and Playstack's game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-half-million">crossed half a million sales</a>&nbsp;in less than two weeks, hitting a million <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-one-million">just a week and a half or so later</a>.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers&nbsp;</em>can find an audience for itself in the same way&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has, but if you're interested, it's launching on August 8th. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400510/Dungeons__Degenerate_Gamblers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">wishlist it on Steam right now</a>.</p>

<p>

Four iconic cultures from the Bronze Age will join battle - Babylon, Assyria, Mycenae and Troy - as well as 25 minor factions. The original campaign map has also been vastly expanded with 168 new settlements and new Sea Travel Lanes to speed up naval transportation.
</p>
<p>
The new titular Dynasty system, meanwhile, allows players to begin a family tree: "Reign over the tides of mortality and succession, navigating strategic marriages, heroic deaths on the battlefield, assassinations, and the looming mortality of old age to leave behind a legacy that will last the ages".
</p>
<p>
There are also over 150 new and reworked battle units as part of tweaked combat.
</p>
<p>
"From the outset of our design journey on Total War: Pharaoh, our vision has always been to deliver a grand-scale recreation of the turbulent Bronze Age Collapse; one brimming with historical intrigue, authentic representations of iconic civilisation, and a sandbox theatre that allows you to rewrite the course of human history," said Game Director, Todor Nikolov. 
</p>
<p>
"We're very proud of what we've achieved and whilst this will be our final content addition, we hope it serves as a love letter that encapsulates our continued passion for this wonderful age. Thanks for your support."
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-pharaoh-getting-four-new-factions-as-part-of-free-update">free update was announced by Creative Assembly and Sega back in May</a>, but now we have the release date.

</p>
<p>
The update will be the final addition to the game, capping off a turbulent time for the studio. Back in December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/creative-assembly-apologises-for-missteps-with-total-war-series-offers-pharaoh-refunds">Creative Assembly apologised for "missteps" with the series</a> and offered partial refunds of Total War: Pharaoh.

</p>
<p>
"We again apologise for the missteps we've made," read a blog post from Creative Assembly vice president Roger Collum. "The mistakes of Total War are a shared responsibility by all the leaders of the franchise, and while it may not seem like it at times, we are listening."
</p>
<p>
As for what's next, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-development-at-creative-assembly">rumours suggest the studio could be working on a Total War: Star Wars game</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-run-playstation-3-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-series-x-s-could-run-playstation-3-games-before-the-playstation-5-thanks-to-new-dev-mode-update.922560/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-run-playstation-3-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Thanks to a new important update to Developer Mode, the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles could run PlayStation 3 games before Sony implements proper PS3 backward compatibility on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>As reported in a new video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ModernVintageGamer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern Vintage Gamer</a> that highlights how the Xbox Series S, in particular, is still an emulation beast despite changes made in the past few months, Developer Mode was recently updated with Mesa (OpenGL/Vulkan) support, which, in theory, could make PlayStation 3 and even Nintendo Switch emulation possible. As of now, this new development has made it possible for the Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra to run on the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S relatively well for being in alpha stage, so anything could truly happen in the coming months.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Xbox Series S is STILL an Emulation Beast - New Updates!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9AUtERZ6tXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><iframe title="🕹️Vamos a jugar😎Retroarch emulador Citra 3DS - Xbox Series S" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r0_YAj1ByRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It would certainly be weird to see, for example, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots run on Xbox Series X and S, but unless Sony implements proper PS3 backward compatibility, this has now become a very real possibility. It is being <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-playstation-3-backwards-compatibility/">rumored</a> that it will be possible to play PlayStation 3 games on PlayStation 5 at some point in the future, but there are multiple indications that suggest how PS3 games support would be limited to a small selection of titles due to the<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-ps3-emulation-technical-limitations/"> technical challenges in emulating the console's complex Cell architecture.</a></p>
<p>The Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S Developer Mode is a special mode that can be used to develop and test software with a retail unit. More information on this mode and how to access it can be found on Microsoft's <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xbox-apps/devkit-activation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <p>That was…slightly cheeky of me. The Tomoe you play in parry-ful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodless">Bloodless</a> is not the same Tomoe that was conspicuously absent from undeniable influence <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice">Sekiro</a>. They <em>might</em> be based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoe_Gozen">same historical figure</a>, but that’s simply Sek-ulation. However! You can make your mind up yourself for zero money, since Bloodless has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592490/Bloodless/">free demo</a> on Steam. Trazzer below.</p>

<p>Bloodless is pleasingly simple. Space to parry-dash is your only move, omnidirectional. Parry an opponent to defeat them. Take three hits and you’re toast, but you get three gulps of tea to restore one hit each. There are Soulsy fire checkpoints, and you can brew a fresh flask at each. The complexity comes in enemy attack patterns. Nimble <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kama_(tool)#:~:text=The%20kama%20(%E9%8E%8C%20or%20%E3%81%8B%E3%81%BE,training%20segments%20of%20martial%20arts.">kama</a>-wielders throw a final, angled knife as they die, necessitating some funky timings just as you think you’re safe. Red attacks can’t be countered. I learned this when attacked by a clubman. If you see red, you should move - just like traffic lights idk I don’t drive - then follow-up when the club flashes white.</p>
<p>You also can slot in special items called crests. The first one I found was a sword hilt that made Tomoe drink her tea faster. Practical, if deeply troubling as a proponent of leisurely hot beverage breaks. After beating the clubmen, I also got a skill point. Now, a well-timed disarm gives me some stamina back, giving Tomoe more time to slurp tea. I’m a fan of these combat rhythms. It’s slower than both Sekiro and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-samurai">Disco Samurai</a>, but also decently tricky and intense.</p>
<p>Here’s a complaint. It’s the same complaint I make whenever I see this exact nonsense, so it’d be silly to pick favourites. Developers. I beg you from the bottom of my schedule. If there are no enemies around, then running should not cost me stamina. I will not be elaborating. Just imagine you’re showing me a design doc that says “you lose stamina whenever you run, whether or not you’re in a position where running is a risk/reward proposition”. Now imagine I’m staring at it and just making a really loud fart noise. You’re explaining your reasons calmly but I just keep making the fart noise. I don’t want it. Please stop.</p>
<p>However reader, you should not stop being interested in Bloodless, because its slightly particular rhythms are nonetheless satisfyingly stirring, and the presentation is lovely. It’s published by 3D Realms, and out this August.</p>

It turns out that saluting, offering to shake hands, or even proffering a hug causes characters to go rigid, and thus lose the ragdoll effect when hitting the ground.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/vrgamesshowcase/status/1810660176082739286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X, a VR Games Showcase was announced for August that will feature AAA Games and over eight VR studios and publishers. </p>

<li>Vertigo Games</li>



<li>Fast Travel Games</li>



<li>Schell Games</li>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/vrgamesshowcase/status/1810665036232417621" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">follow-up tweet</a>, the VR Games Showcase account also teased that fans should “stay tuned” to hear about more partners. </p>



<p>Batman: Arkham, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/batman-arkham-shadow-vr-game-revealed-coming-late-2024/">coming in late 2024</a>, could potentially get an update. Funcom might also show after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-hellsinger-vr-announced/">announcing Metal: Hellsinger VR</a> last March, but these titles are just speculation.</p>



<p>Today’s event trailer confirmed that IO Interactive and XR Games will offer an update on Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded.
