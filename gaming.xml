            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>In 2019, Nintendo <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/2019/5/16/18627669/nintendo-switch-online-game-vouchers-deal">announced</a> a new benefit for subscribers to its Switch Online service: <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers/">a pair of game vouchers</a>, available for $100, that could be redeemed for any two Switch games on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=pd&amp;p=0">Nintendo's eligibility list</a>. If you already knew you were going to be buying first-party games, the voucher could save you $20, or even $30, if you used it on the normally $70 <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>
<p>However, Nintendo announced today that it will soon end the program, rather than carrying it forward into the Switch 2 era. Switch Online subscribers can still buy a pair of vouchers until the end of January 2026, and those vouchers will be redeemable for up to a year after purchase, but you can't buy new vouchers after that.</p>
<p>The vouchers were already notably&nbsp;<em>not</em> usable to buy Switch 2-exclusive games like&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. However, for hybrid Switch games with a separate Switch 2 Edition, you could still use them to buy a game like <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> and then upgrade it to the Switch 2 edition separately.&nbsp;Nintendo also <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Nintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html">said on its FAQ page</a> that new titles would be added to the eligibility list between now and January 2026, raising the possibility that upcoming high-profile hybrid games like <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> or&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>could make the list.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> housing system will see players level-up their homes by completing neighborhood-wide events called Endeavors, ones that will visually change neighborhoods and offer special decorations for a limited-time.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard revealed those new details about the MMORPG's highly anticipated housing system and more in a recent <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24221516" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. While Blizzard already announced players would be buying homes as part of either public or private neighborhoods, now we know more about how exactly it will all work.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fQXHFrLX6A4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One key part of WoW's neighborhoods will be Endeavors. These neighborhood-wide events occur about once a month and visually transform the neighborhood to represent different cultures or factions found in Azeroth. Each Endeavor will introduce tasks that can be completed by those living in the neighborhood, ranging from competing quests to crafting certain items or finishing dungeons. Once enough tasks are completed collectively, the whole neighborhood is rewarded.</p><p dir="ltr">Completing an Endeavor's tasks come with two main rewards: a special currency used to purchase themed decorations from visiting Endeavor NPCs and Neighborhood Favor. It's the latter reward that looks to serve as housing XP of sorts, leveling up what looks to be a housing version of the game's Renown track system. Each new housing level grants new decoration items and sometimes will even increase housing limitations, like how many decorations a player can have in their house.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said the goal of Endeavors is to give neighborhoods common goals to strive for, add choices for how a neighborhood looks, and also introduce asymmetry between different neighborhoods, as not all neighborhoods will be working on the same Endeavor. While players in public neighborhoods will have their Endeavors essentially chosen for them, those in private neighborhoods will be able to choose from a selection of possible Endeavors. This allows for players to visit different neighborhoods and purchase Endeavor decoration rewards that might not be available in their own neighborhood.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4529708-wowhousinglevelupsystem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529708" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4529708-wowhousinglevelupsystem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529708"></a><figcaption>A look at WoW's housing level system.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4529708-wowhousinglevelupsystem.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Along with announcing Endeavors, Blizzard additionally answered some common questions it has heard from players, like how to move homes if a player doesn't like living in a place or next to a particular person, or how much control players will have over who can visit their home.</p><p dir="ltr">If a player doesn't like where they are living, they can just pick up their house and move. Blizzard said it's made changing home locations "frictionless and straightforward." Giving up a home will save its state, after which players can then "unpack" that home at a new location without having to redecorate or rebuild the home's interior. Homes in WoW are essentially magic boxes that can be as big or small as a player wants, so not having to redo previous work sounds like a smart move.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard emphasized that neighborhoods are quite large in size, with 50 housing plots spread across different biomes within the zone. Some homes will be more isolated for those who want to live the hermit lifestyle without neighbors, while others will be part of small or large cul-de-sacs that encourage more social interaction.</p><p dir="ltr">As for home permissions, Blizzard is giving players ultimate control over who can visit, with options for allowing (or denying) friends, guildmates, neighbors, or the general public. There will also be an option for allowing people to visit the outside plot of a home, but not come inside.</p><p dir="ltr">Details about Endeavors and neighborhoods are just the latest information Blizzard has shared about player housing, having previously shared its insights on how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/" data-ref-id="1100-6529278">WoW's houses will be available for everyone who wants one</a>, how the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-system-will-reward-decor-based-on-past-achievements/1100-6531163/" data-ref-id="1100-6531163">housing system will reward past achievements</a>, and all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/" data-ref-id="1100-6530083">nitty-gritty decoration options</a> players will have.</p><p dir="ltr">In May, GameSpot was among the first to go <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">hands-on with WoW's housing decoration tools</a>, and we came away impressed at the possibilities it offered, even in an early, unfinished state.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW's housing system was announced to be coming as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">MMO's next expansion, Midnight</a>, but is now expected to arrive ahead of it, perhaps as part of the expansion's pre-patch update.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-my-pants-are-from-outlier-because-they-appear-to-live-forever.1240782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a pair of pants that are almost 11 years old. They’re light olive, made from a very lightweight form of nylon and at this point acceptably shabby. I have kept them this long for two reasons: I spent a decent amount of money on them, and they’re so well made that I couldn’t kill them unless I actively tried. This is the reason why Outlier is the only company that I trust for men’s pants.</p><p>If you have never met me, you should know that I’m a large guy, hovering between 6’1” and 6’2” depending on how bad my posture is on any given day. Prior to getting into Outlier, my plan in my shithead 20s era was to buy whatever pair of Uniqlo jeans fit me, get them <a href="https://faq-us.uniqlo.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/Alterations-for-In-Store-Purchases/?l=en_US&amp;fs=RelatedArticle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hemmed for free at the store</a> and then drive them into the dirt until the crotch exploded from the force of my quadriceps.&nbsp;</p><p>A few things changed. The first is that I developed a fashion sense. It helped that there were a lot of very good sample sales in New York City, providing a steady drip of fashion pieces for my broke ass. The other was that I got tired of fast fashion failing me constantly. New York City is notoriously hard on clothes; it’s nasty here, and I wanted pants that would not get immediately ruined after a year of being subjected to the weather and grime.</p><figure><figcaption>I was able to track down the exact moment I started wearing these pants.</figcaption></figure><p>I cannot remember how Outlier came on my radar, but at the time they were a company with a goal of making clothes durable enough to withstand the abuse of a cycling commute, similar to Levi’s Commuter line, but that fashioned in a manner presentable enough for an office job. The cycling angle has faded over time (in part because it has become easier to cycle in the city), but the commitment to performance fabrics and construction has not. Outlier still prides themselves on using good materials to an obsessive degree, constantly trying to find some technical fabric from Japan or one that is borderline impossible to source on a consumer level. The majority of their clothing has traditionally lacked a logo, theirs being a simple silhouette of a black swan, although they’ve gotten slightly bolder on including (easy to remove) tags on newer items. Outlier’s basics are what William Gibson would describe as “CPUs” or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayce_Pollard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cayce Pollard Units</a> in the book <em>Pattern Recognition</em>: reliable standards that lack any external branding worn by the logo-allergic protagonist Cayce Pollard.</p><figure><figcaption>They only recently started adding logos to their stuff, and they are all fairly easy to remove.</figcaption></figure><p>Have you ever treated yourself to something nice and realized you’re never going to be able to buy the worse alternative ever again? That’s what happened when I bought my pair of lightweight <a href="https://archive-m2.outlier.nyc/shop/retail/futureworks.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Futureworks</a>. Not only were they comfortable, water resistant and well made, they also fit my body perfectly. But probably the most important part was how they were stitched together. Many mens pants are sewn in such a way as to tear directly down the middle, while the Futureworks had a gusseted crotch - a piece of fabric sewn to the natural stress point of the crotch that removes that tension from the equation. That, combined with the fact that they were made out of fairly strong, slightly stretchy nylon, has made them a durable staple.</p><figure><figcaption>Nice basics from left to right: SDs, New Way Seven Fives, Futuredarts. CreditOutlier</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually the Futureworks would be supplanted by the <a href="https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/futuredarts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Futuredarts</a>, which would further refine the pants by adding <a href="https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/futuredarts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">darting to them</a>. Outlier does a fairly good job at keeping a comprehensive archive of their old lines of clothing online, so you can easily track the evolution of the brand as it changes over time. Other reliable standards are the Slim Dungarees, a slightly more durable pair of pants than the Futuredarts. Outlier probably has some of the most reliable mens shorts in the game in various cuts, which include an internal drawstring. My favorite pants of all are the Injected Linen Pants, an extremely breathable pair perfect for summer, stitched from a <a href="https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/injected-linen-pants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polyester/linen</a> blend that is far more delicate than their standard fare but also leagues more practical than linen pants tend to be.</p><figure><figcaption>Injex is the Outlier's delicate fabric and my favorite, a slightly durable poly/linen blend that withstands more abuse than standard linen.</figcaption></figure><p>At the time of writing you’re looking at paying $125-$200 for a pair of shorts or pants, and be warned that if you decide to venture outside of the basics you will pay a hefty premium for it. That said, I have bought so many pairs of pants over the years, particularly from their seasonal grab bag sales dubbed “WTF” (you pay them 50 bucks, give them a waist size, and they send you something in that size), that I have a wardrobe in basically every waist size I have fit into.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Every time Outlier has roulette style sample sale I have bought a pair in basically every size I can fit in. </figcaption></figure><p>It is a strange thing to write about a company this way, but Outlier is, in a bit of nominative determinism, singular. They have held on to the 2010s direct to consumer model while many startups from that time have largely discarded this concept. Their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Outlier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subreddit</a> benefitted from an <a href="https://www.glossy.co/fashion/from-radical-quality-to-reddit-how-fashion-brand-outlier-is-charting-its-own-path/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influx of traffic</a> that helped them build a following there and gave them a step up. This community would in turn help shape their tastes and give them feedback, and the board felt truly conversational for many years. Outlier embodied the zeitgeist of the <a href="https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Techwear</a> community in its dedication to technical fabrics, although they have been generally much better at putting out pieces that don’t feel anchored to that movement and have in some ways outlived it. If you were to describe their current aesthetic, it would be a shockingly coherent venn diagram of rave wear, sensible office basics and LaKeith Stanfield’s wardrobe in the Netflix <em>Death Note </em>movie. That’s perfect because that’s how I dress most of the time anyway.</p><figure><figcaption>On top of basics, Outlier frequently has limited, experimental, and expensive drops. Guy Fieri shorts in space age linen? Fluorescent sun hoodies? It's always a joy to see. Credit: Outlier</figcaption></figure><p>The strangest part about following Outlier’s trajectory is how it has mirrored and informed my own obsessions with materials. Even outside of synthetics, they have a love of linen and merino from a purely technical perspective. Outlier is one of the only western companies I’ve seen that regularly makes clothes out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ramie</a>, a Chinese bast fiber that is better at cooling than linen but that I have heard is a pain in the ass to work with. Outlier, like everyone else including <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/our-dwr-problem/story-17791.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patagonia</a>, had to deal with the thorny issue of replacing PFAS for use in durable water repellents (also known as DWR), and following their trajectory as <a href="https://huntsman-pimcore.equisolve-dev.com/Documents/Zelan_R3_Brochure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they figured out how to solve that</a> has been interesting as an enthusiast. Additionally, Outlier has historically had a fondness for <a href="https://www.polartec.com/fabrics/insulation/alpha" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PolarTec Alpha</a>, an lightweight synthetic insulation that has the benefit of being highly breathable. PolarTec Alpha was used by Patagonia in its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822160605/https://www.patagonia.com/product/level-3a-jacket/19213.html?dwvar_19213_color=ALP&amp;cgid=web-specials-mens" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Level 3A PCU</a> (Protective Combat Unit) jacket back when the company had more extensive collaborations with the US military. I bought that Patagonia jacket on clearance in part because Outlier was <a href="https://outlier.nyc/search?q=alpha" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so obsessed with how well Alpha worked and has produced many garments with it</a>. The Level 3A has since become a mild collector’s item for guys who are obsessed with military gear, and I hate to say it is the closest thing I own to a perfect jacket.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Patagonia PCU Level 3A Light Loft Shell Wind Resistant Jacket" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqhiMhk8Bkw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>More than anything though, I am still shocked at how well their garments hold up. It’s not a flawless track record: I have a few garments with holes in some of the pockets, particularly from the time period when they moved to breathable mesh pockets which have some forgivable tradeoffs. The injected linen pants are as close as you can get to a perfect summer pant and have saved my ass in the 94 degree NYC heat, but they are slightly more frail than Outlier’s regular output by virtue of the material used. But those little exceptions to a rule exist side by side with a backlog of unkillable pants in my wardrobe, from the very baggy yet durable <a href="https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/bombdeux-standards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bombardeauxs</a> to the reliable <a href="https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/slim-dungarees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SDs (Slim Dungarees)</a>, the closest thing Outlier has to a standard.&nbsp;</p><p>The other day during one of Aftermath’s editorial meetings, I told the rest of the site what I had been working on: a blog about a pair of pants. Prior to the meeting I had been doing some ambient farming of Citibike points for a few hours, cycling in a path that took me from Penn Station, past the cursed NYT building, through Times Square, down past Japan Society, and eventually taking the meeting on a bench in front of Stuyvusent Town. The day had gone from a dreary light rain to the oppressive summer armpit of a July in New York City. I was dehydrated and exhausted. As I told the Aftermath crew about “The Pants Blog,” I looked down and I saw that by pure coincidence I had done the entire ride in the green pants; the ones I love, that I had bought when Barack Obama was the president, and I smiled in the knowledge that I am still many years away from killing them.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/plushie-lawsuit-emotional-support-chicken-nuggets-what-do-you-meme"><h3>Plushie Maker Suing Over ‘Emotional Support Chicken Nuggets’</h3></a><p>It’s a pretty standard copyright and trademark infringement case, despite being about stuffed chicken nuggets.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/outlier-best-mens-pants-indestructible-pants]]></content:encoded>

But a fresh delay of one of the most wish-listed games on Steam makes that almost impossible.

Additionally, the decision had already been under discussion prior to recent leadership changes at the studio.”</p><p>Unknown Worlds cofounders Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill were fired last week, despite Krafton promising the studio independence when it was purchased back in 2022. Cleveland later wrote on Reddit that the game was ready to release in Early Access later this year as originally planned, calling the move from Krafton to replace the studio’s leadership a “shock.”</p><p>The publisher now says that the decision to delay <em>Subnautica 2 </em>grew out of negative feedback from playtests. “We received valuable feedback from our community that reinforced our confidence in the game’s direction,” it wrote in its new statement. “At the same time, the feedback highlighted a few areas that could benefit from further refinement before release. As community voices play a central role in how we shape our games, we’ve made the decision to give the development team more time to implement that feedback and deliver a more complete experience.”</p><p>Krafton was less diplomatic in a new statement published on its website Thursday afternoon which accused Cleveland and McGuire of refusing to return to their leadership roles on <em>Subnautica 2 </em>after the studio’s fantasy skirmish PVP game <em>Moonbreaker </em>struggled to find an audience in 2024. The publisher blamed them for <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s failure to release in 2024 as originally planned:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Specifically, in addition to the initial $500 million purchase price, we allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives, with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2.</p><p>However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them.<em> Subnautica 2</em> was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of <em>Moonbreaker</em>, Krafton  asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of <em>Subnautica 2</em>. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.</p><p>Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule.<br>The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.<br></p><p>We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.﻿<br></p></blockquote><p>The statement also said Krafton was “committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s development,” though a spokesperson for the company didn’t immediately clarify what those bonuses would look like relative to the $250 million payout previously on the table. </p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oqrucfXQo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oqrucfXQo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A developer update posted on YouTube</a></span> confirmed<em> Subnautica 2 </em>would be coming to Early Access in 2025 back in April.

                <p>A new challenger is rising in the ranks. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/umamusume-pretty-derby/" data-ref-id="5000-524231">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a>, the free-to-play sports sim game about horse girls, is racing up the Steam charts. The gacha game has been garnering attention since its launch in North America in June, thanks in part to streams from mainstream creators like Northernlion and Vinesauce. It hit its all-time-peak of just over 50,000 simultaneous players yesterday, July 9, and has been boasting new personal bests day after day.</p><p>To put that number in perspective, that is just over double the number of concurrent players at launch. The game is now squarely in the top 50 most-played games on Steam, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3224770/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. That puts it in competition with games like Elden Ring Nightreign and Warframe.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCaWqXP54Mc" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uCaWqXP54Mc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Umamusume: Pretty Derby has been a phenomenon in Japan for a while, spawning tie-in anime, spin-off party games, and even a stage play. The titular Umamusume are women with a horse's speed and strength--they also sport pointy ears and tails. During the day, they race. At night, they perform in lavish pop concerts for their fans. The kicker is that each of the girl is based on an actual famous race horse. One of them, a lovable loser named Haru Urara, is still alive and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/verchan.bsky.social/post/3ltcv7zpzrk2o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fans have taking to visiting her at the farm</a> where she now lives. The developer even put out a statement about proper etiquette for <a href="https://umamusume.com/visitingstables-guidelines/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">visiting a stable</a>. It's bizarre things like this, the kind of fact that you couldn't say about any other game, that seem to be fueling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-train-and-race-anime-horse-girls-for-free/1100-6532908/" data-ref-id="1100-6532908">Umamusume's word-of-mouth momentum</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you are familiar with social simulation games like Princess Maker or Idol Manager, you'll understand the basics of how Umamusume: Pretty Derby plays. Each horse girl starts with a set of aptitudes and stats which you can enhance through training. At races, they can prove their mettle and, if they place high enough, progress to tougher challenges. But it's not all work. Training is frequently interrupted by visual-novel-esque segments and storylines. However, to unlock your horse girl of choice you will have to engage with the game's plentiful gambling mechanics. At its heart, Umamusume is a game about collecting jpegs. You might have to spend copious amounts of money to get the one you want.</p><p dir="ltr">You can play Umamusume for free on Steam or on your mobile device.</p>

<p>We miss you, Iwata-san</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Satoru Iwata" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/185f185d49ca8/satoru-iwata.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><blockquote>
<p><em>"On my business card, I am a corporate president. In my mind, I am a game developer. But in my heart, I am a gamer".</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>11th July 2025 marks the 10th anniversary of Satoru Iwata's passing; a man who cemented himself as not only an exceptional leader during times of both success and failure, but a figurehead that would steal the hearts of countless fans around the world.</p>
<p>It's difficult to really say anything that hasn't already been expressed at some point in the last decade, but we think it's clear that Iwata's presence continues to be felt in both Nintendo circles and the gaming industry at large. Indeed, with the recent news of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/xbox-layoffs-begin-as-phil-spencer-shares-internal-microsoft-gaming-update">extensive layoffs from Xbox and Microsoft</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/layoffs">turmoil at studios across the world</a> over the last couple of years, many have recounted the words spoken by Iwata during a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/stock/meeting/130627qa/03.html">shareholder Q&amp;A session</a> in 2013:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If we reduce the number of employees for better short-term financial results, however, employee morale will decrease, and I sincerely doubt employees who fear that they may be laid off will be able to develop software titles that could impress people around the world."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iwata also paved the way for the Switch — Nintendo's most successful home console of all time — having worked extensively on the system before his passing in 2015. The effects of this are still felt to this very day, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic2ez3ZoKAk">Nvidia paying tribute to Iwata in a recent video</a> on the Switch 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I still remember the day Iwata-san shared his dream with us. He wanted to create something no-one had seen before: a console powerful enough for big cinematic games, but small enough to take anywhere. It sounded impossible, but that vision became the original Nintendo Switch.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"We lost Iwata-san before the launch, but his clarity, his purpose, it still inspires our work everyday."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five years ago, former NL editor Tom Whitehead <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/07/feature_remembering_satoru_iwata_five_years_on">wrote about Iwata's career and his legacy</a>, and it's strange to think that a full decade has now passed - and to consider how the world has changed in that time. We wonder what Iwata would make of the state of the industry, of Switch's success, and of the brand new console we're enjoying.</p>
<p>All that's left to say is, well, thank you, Iwata-san. Nintendo would not be where it is today without your leadership, passion, and desire to deliver the very best experiences in gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-astro-bot-levels-and-limited-dualsense-controller-announced-coming-this-july/">last month</a>, the latest batch of DLC levels for Astro Bot have officially been added to the game today, and as an additional surprise, two iconic characters that are recognized by video game fans around the world have finally joined the roster of the cameo bots that players can collect in each level. </p>



<p>Today's update adds another five levels to Astro Bot, putting the total number of levels in Astro Bot over 90, but what's perhaps more significant to diehard PlayStation fans are two of the characters that have finally made their way into the game as cameo bots. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Final Fantasy's Cloud and Sephiroth are now part of the roster of cameo bots that players can collect in the five new levels available today. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other notable cameo bot inclusions are Atsu, the protagonist for Sucker Punch's upcoming follow-up to their 2019 samurai epic, Ghost of Yotei, which is also due to have its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-july-state-of-play-gameplay-deep-dive/">own State of Play presentation</a> later today at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for collectors, there's no update regarding the other announcement from last month's Astro Bot news, which was the reveal of a new limited-edition Astro Bot-themed DualSense controller. For now, it's still due out "<em>later this year</em>," with no official release date revealed. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-layoffs-has-microsofts-studio-buying-strategy-failed.1240698/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After spending a near-incomprehensible amount of money and resources on studio acquisitions, Microsoft is finally ready to make its mark on the gaming industry by...&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">firing another 9,000 workers, about 4% of its workforce</a>. While this latest wave of layoffs is not specific to the Xbox division, there were no shortage of victims in gaming-related products and services.</p>

<p>Notable casualties include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">an entire game studio, The Initiative</a>, as well as the cancellation of at least two publicly known projects, the <em>Perfect Dark</em> reboot and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow"><em>Everwild</em></a>. Other layoffs were reported at ZeniMax, King, and Turn 10, though the scale of these layoffs was not as fatal.</p>

<p>Some will undoubtedly be quick to point out that while the situation is unfortunate, <em>Perfect Dark</em> and <em>Everwild </em>have been in development for years with next to nothing to show for it. At the same time, it would be hard to imagine that anyone (especially Xbox fans) would feel particularly inspired by the layoffs--doubly so when an educated guess would suggest that Microsoft is doing these layoffs to chase the AI white whale.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-activision-blizzard-bethesda.png?itok=8RXSUe1W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-activision-blizzard-bethesda.png?itok=_fR_VTMY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>So...when can we expect new games?</figcaption></figure><h2>Xbox: Buy Him Out, Boys!</h2>

<p>One might go so far as to say that Xbox's recent decisions give the impression that they are aimless. Despite the vast fortune spent on acquisitions, the general public is simply not seeing the deluge of new games that they might have been anticipating.</p>

<p>After all, Xbox has been acquiring game studios since 2002 with Rare. Mojang was their next big purchase in 2014. The money really started flying in 2018 with the addition of seven smaller studios, including Obsidian and Double Fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-studios" rel="nofollow">Xbox's own count</a>, acquiring Bethesda put them at 23 studios. However, the eventual closure of The Initiative, Alpha Dog Games, Tango Gameworks, and Roundhouse Studios sets that number down to 19. The subsequent Activision Blizzard acquisition boosts them back up to 22 game studios, though it should be noted that Activision itself runs a number of studios, most notably Treyarch, Infinity Ward, and Sledgehammer Games.</p>

<p>Xbox once boasted that by purchasing Bethesda, they can "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/09/officially-welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/" rel="nofollow">begin working together to deliver more great games to everyone</a>." Since then,&nbsp;Activision Blizzard was also acquired to help "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/10/13/xbox-activision-blizzard/" rel="nofollow">create new worlds and stories</a>."</p>

<p>Bethesda has certainly been trying to deliver on that promise, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/starfield-review-interstellar-adventure" rel="nofollow">albeit to mixed results</a>. Quality aside, the studios under Bethesda Softworks have consistently been putting out a new game about once a year, regularly rotating between their associated studios.</p>

<p>Activision Blizzard on the other hand has not deviated much from its strategy of launching <em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;ad infinitum. Of course, given that Activision Blizzard is in charge of genre-defining live-service properties like <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>World of Warcraft</em>, and <em>Diablo</em>, there's not much of a rush to launch anything new. <em>Candy Crush's</em> popularity is not to be underestimated either seeing as how it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/candy-crush-saga-hits-20-billion-revenue-milestone-maker-king-says-2023-09-26/" rel="nofollow">made some $20 billion in revenue since 2012</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-infinite-flood-spartan.jpg?itok=lpf_uMDp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-infinite-flood-spartan.jpg?itok=otMxEN1S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Surely there's more than enough maps and modes now right?</figcaption></figure><p>The Coalition and Halo Studios are in somewhat unique positions, overseeing <em>Gears of War</em> and <em>Halo</em> respectively. These are supposed to be the traditional crown jewels of Xbox's first-party IPs, but it's been almost six years since a new game has been released under either banner.</p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/halo-infinite" rel="nofollow"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a> started out strong in 2021, only to fizzle out due to an underwhelming quantity of post-launch multiplayer content. Xbox seemed to be getting ready to go on a <em>Gears of War </em>blitz with back to back releases of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gears-5" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears 5</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gears-tactics" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears Tactics</em></a>, except that never materialized.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then there's Playground Games, the studio behind the upcoming <em>Fable</em>. The game probably isn't dead, although there hasn't been much gameplay footage since it was announced in 2020, so make of that what you will.</p>

<p>Mojang appears to be the only group that is showing signs of life. Between the recent release of a <em>Minecraft </em>movie and a couple of spin-off games, <em>Minecraft </em>is clearly the most active of the major Xbox properties.</p>

<h2>Xbox: Obsidian Entertainment's New Best Friend?</h2>

<p>Even so, the latest round of layoffs didn't leave Xbox's supposed big guns unscathed as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-unannounced-mmo-was-doing-well-and-even-scaling-up-as-xbox-cancelation-blindsided-staff-sources-say" rel="nofollow">ZeniMax was forced to shelve an original MMO that they were working on</a>. Rare is evidently not allowed to touch anything other than <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sea-of-thieves" rel="nofollow"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a> as they were working on <em>Everwild </em>before it was cancelled.&nbsp;Turn 10 lost half of its team despite the fact that they are partly in charge of the <em>Forza </em>franchise, though given <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2440510/Forza_Motorsport/" rel="nofollow"><em>Forza Motorsport's</em></a> lackluster user reviews, this might've happened eventually anyway.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Undead Labs has been radio silent as well. Under normal circumstances, this is hardly unusual, but one should no longer hold their breath when it comes to <em>State of Decay 3</em> given the recent layoffs.</p>

<p>That being said, the&nbsp;comparatively smaller companies have seemingly fared better under Xbox.&nbsp; World's Edge is doing a fairly good job at handling the <em>Age of Empires</em> franchise, having released both <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/age-of-empires-iv" rel="nofollow"><em>Age of Empires IV</em></a> and <em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em>.&nbsp;Compulsion Games just released <em>South of Midnight</em> to favorable user and critic reviews.</p>

<p>Ninja Theory's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review-binaural-bedlam" rel="nofollow"><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</em></a> won a couple of accolades at The Game Awards last year. Meanwhile, Double Fine is set to release <em>Keeper</em>&nbsp;in October, and inXile Entertainment's upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow"><em>Clockwork Revolution</em></a> looks promising as well.</p>

<p>Obsidian Entertainment is outright thriving. Since its acquisition in 2018, Obsidian launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds" rel="nofollow"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/grounded" rel="nofollow"><em>Grounded</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pentiment" rel="nofollow"><em>Pentiment</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/avowed" rel="nofollow"><em>Avowed</em></a>--four very different games of consistently high quality launched at reasonable intervals with room for sequels. In fact, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is set to release in October.</p>

<p>Alas, even with the success of these smaller studios, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">shutdown of Tango Gameworks</a> in spite of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hi-fi-rush-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Hi-Fi Rush's</em>&nbsp;overwhelmingly positive reception</a> is recent enough to be in the back of everyone's mind.</p>

<h2>Xbox: But What About the Hardware?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-7-remake-cloud.jpg?itok=sxuEnY5A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-7-remake-cloud.jpg?itok=jIrXUt9x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>On the bright side, <em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</em> and <em>Helldivers 2</em> is coming to Xbox!</figcaption></figure><p>While it would be unrealistic to expect every individual studio to follow in Obsidian's footsteps, it doesn't seem that unreasonable for Xbox fans to ask for a reason to remain Xbox fans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The annual <em>Call of Duty </em>and Bethesda game can be played on any platform. The next <em>Fallout </em>and <em>Elder Scrolls </em>are years away at best.&nbsp;<em>Halo </em>and <em>Gears of War</em> have been missing in action for almost six years. <em>Fable </em>was delayed until 2026. There are barely any new first-party IPs, much less anything that can move consoles.</p>

<p>Console sellers are a moot point anyways because Xbox is being hopelessly&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-microsoft-financials-q4-2024" rel="nofollow">outsold in hardware</a>. The only advantage that is left is Game Pass. The normalization of the $80 price tag plays directly into Xbox's hand by offering people an affordable alternative to buying games.</p>

<p>This holiday season is the perfect time to put this notion to the ultimate test with the releases of <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, and <em>Keeper</em>. One first-party game from a solid developer, one exclusive third-party game, and one relatively quirky game representing the vast majority of games that you could find in the Game Pass library. If those three games can convince people to sign up for Game Pass en masse, then a pivot to subscription services might not seem like a fool's errand after all.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this sole advantage might be ceded too if Microsoft decides to up the price of Game Pass any further. We are already at a stage where only the most expensive tier of subscribers can actually play new games on launch day. If affordable games aren't enough to move consoles, then raising the price is the only surefire way to lose the remaining players over time.</p>

<h2>Xbox: More Money Please</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elder-scrolls-online-molag-bal.jpg?itok=9hxtYRJC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elder-scrolls-online-molag-bal.jpg?itok=DmUzdZFB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If an MMO was so bad that it had to be scrapped before it even had a publicly known name, surely it's not too late to salvage parts of it for some other project</figcaption></figure><p>Keep in mind that none of this is happening in a vacuum. According to Microsoft's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q3/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow">fiscal year earnings press release from April 30</a>, their net income was $25.8 billion, with Xbox content and services seeing an increased revenue of 8%. By comparison,&nbsp;Sony claims that it had a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_sony.pdf" rel="nofollow">net income of 980 billion yen</a> (approximately US$6.7 billion) in 2024 and that its gaming and network services division <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/sony-earnings-q3-2025.html" rel="nofollow">enjoyed 16% year-over-year growth</a>. This suggests that PlayStation is continuing its dominance in spite of Xbox's acquisitions and apparent shifts to subscription services.</p>

<p>In any case, this would imply that Microsoft's recent cuts and layoffs weren't exactly life saving for the company, further lending credence to the idea that this is all to fuel Microsoft's AI push. If anything, it looks like Xbox's first-party developers and Game Pass are managing to keep the brand afloat, because it's definitely not because of console sales. Furthermore, if the layoffs and project cancellations were necessary from a financial standpoint, this brings up the question of why wasn't someone cancelling these projects earlier.</p>

<p><em>Everwild </em>was in development for a decade. Unless Rare was sitting on the next <em>Elder Scrolls</em> or <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> tier game, there's no excuse for any game to be in development for so long with nothing to show the public. Similarly, there's no reason for <em>Perfect Dark</em> to have been on life support for half a decade with barely any gameplay to show for it.&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/redfall" rel="nofollow">Redfall</a> </em>which should've never been released at all, or at least delayed and completely remade so that it matched the strengths of the studio.</p>

<p>Xbox then flipped to the other extreme by axing ZeniMax's new MMO while it was still in the crib. The game showed promise according to internal tests, and given ZeniMax's resume, there's no particular reason to doubt such claims.&nbsp;Nonetheless, it gives the impression that Xbox has no idea what it's doing when it comes to making games.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Xbox: Oh, I Didn't Get Rich By Writing a Lot of Checks</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outer-worlds-space-mansion.jpg?itok=1W96MJfb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outer-worlds-space-mansion.jpg?itok=tZ7FlzwO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Remember kids, if you work hard, one day you too will be able afford your own (picture of) a mansion in space!</figcaption></figure><p>If anything, this puts all the blame at the hands of Microsoft and Xbox's leadership. At the end of the day, even with whatever was going on with <em>Everwild </em>and&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark</em>&nbsp;and all the money Microsoft spent on Game Pass and studio acquisitions, Xbox still turned a profit by its own admission.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That last point cannot be repeated enough. As expensive as Activision Blizzard and Bethesda and all the other gaming studios and Game Pass partnerships were, Xbox still made money. Perhaps it wasn't as much money as its main competitor, but the game studios accomplished the only goal that matters in capitalism, and it still wasn't enough to save some of the workers from being laid off and their projects cancelled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Incidentally, this sandwiches&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Microsoft's CEO massive 63% raise</a>&nbsp;between two huge waves of layoffs, as if he was somehow outputting the value of almost 12,000 workers singlehandedly. Microsoft's wealth can't possibly have come from its workers, no, it must've fallen from the heavens as a gift for chasing "AI" projects.&nbsp;The workers merely sell their labor to produce everything, run everything, and maintain everything, then suffer the most regardless of how a business performs. What possible use can they have in making a company profitable?</p>

The first is that you will need to be using a pair of Joy-Cons or a Pro Controller. You’re limited to throwing items forward or backward when using a single Joy-Con.

Once those stakes are established, all bets are off. We see Sweet Tooth launching missiles, John (Anthony Mackie) dodging lightning bolts, and Quiet (Stephanie Beatriz) slicing a man open in a way that’s somehow seductive. But we’d already seen most of that in the Season 2 clip released last month. What did shock us was Axel steamrolling through the competition.</p><p>Back in April, Smith explained that Axel didn’t appear in the first season because they hadn’t yet solved one crucial challenge: “How do you do a character that is literally a giant muscular man stuck between two gigantic wheels?” Thankfully, they figured it out. Using a custom-built apparatus that, according to Smith, weighed a ton and required its own trailer, the bipedal beast finally joins the fray this season. While we don’t get a full close-up of Axel with his hands embedded in the massive wheels, we do see actor Michael James Shaw laughing sinisterly, with a clear shot of the mechanical rig strapping one of his arms to the wheel. By the looks of it, the <em>Twisted Metal</em> design team spared no expense in making him look real.</p><p>The War Wheel titan is seen racing alongside other vehicles—clearly aided by visual effects—but fans of the <em>Twisted Metal</em> games will appreciate the final result when the new season debuts on Peacock on July 31. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/twisted-metal-season-2-peacock-axel-anthony-mackie-1851786052]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Superman is one of the most iconic superheroes, if not one of the most iconic characters, of all time. The demigod from another world, raised by a kindly couple to embody the best qualities of humanity, has been inspiring audiences for nearly 90 years across several movies, thousands of comics, and unfortunately, a handful of mostly forgettable video games. For all of his status and prestige, video games have struggled to capture the unique appeal of the Man of Steel. As DC's film division gets a high-profile reboot with the release of James Gunn's Superman, it's time Superman got the game he deserves.</p><p dir="ltr">Superman's history in video games has been, to be generous, spotty. Early games for the Atari or Commodore 64 were simplistic affairs that captured his titanic feats of strength, at least as well as could be portrayed for the time. Their rudimentary nature meant that narrative was virtually nonexistent and they could only really capture one or two types of heroic actions and then loop them repeatedly. A 1992 Genesis game was a decent but unremarkable action-platformer. Superman was strong enough to punch down fearsome robots, and it made a token attempt at capturing his suite of powers, but it was barely distinguishable from any other action-platformer contemporary. The Death and Return of Superman game, a tie-in with the major comic book event of the same name, was a beat-'em-up featuring the four "Supermen" who appeared after the hero's untimely death at the hands of Doomsday: Cyborg, Steel, Eradicator, and Superboy. Many superheroes of the time were adapted into similar brawlers, including Batman, Spider-Man, Punisher, and others. Death and Return of Superman was a standout as one of the better ones, but it still didn't portray what makes Superman so remarkable.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529673-superman-atari.png" data-ref-id="1300-4529673" data-ratio="0.73059360730594" data-width="1095" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529673-superman-atari.png" data-ref-id="1300-4529673"></a><figcaption>Superman on Atari 2600, via vghchannel on YouTube</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529673-superman-atari.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">These early games largely failed to capture the essence of Superman. Some were better than others, but in broad terms they largely borrowed familiar genre templates. Superman often didn't feel powerful enough, as a limitation of game design; but more crucially, those early narrative structures couldn't properly support the fundamental goodness that is at the heart of the character. Sure, he could punch through solid steel--but why is he putting himself in harm's way for this planet of strangers at all? Why does he care so much about humanity? Superman's capacity to see the best in us--to <em>be</em> the best in us--is just as central to the character as his titanic strength and bulletproof skin.</p><p dir="ltr">As video games moved into the 3D era, the problem only worsened. Superman: The New Adventures, colloquially known as Superman 64, is widely regarded as one of the worst video games of all time, due to its general bugginess, pea-soup fog, and poor presentation. Superman Returns, a licensed game released alongside the Brandon Routh movie, was a middling open-world game without much to actually do. Its most notable feature, though, cleverly solved for a challenge that developers have struggled with: Superman is generally regarded as invincible, so how do you make it interesting to play as someone who can't lose? In Superman Returns, the son of Krypton himself was nigh-invulnerable, but instead, the city of Metropolis itself had a life bar. This shifted the player's focus from self-preservation to protection, which at least captures an important part of Superman's identity.</p><p dir="ltr">More recently, it seems game developers have mostly given up on making being the Man of Steel into a great video game experience. Instead, studios have increasingly turned to borrowing the character, with all his god-like abilities, to present the player with an insurmountable threat to overcome. Games like Injustice and Suicide Squad have embraced the "what if Superman were evil?" premise in different ways. It works well enough for that purpose. Superman is often criticized as overpowered, so why not turn that to your advantage by making him your game's big-bad? But sadly, that also means that Superman's best uses in video games have been the ones that act contrary to the character as he's been known for years, and to the qualities that make him an enduring hero.</p><p dir="ltr">Why is Superman so hard to get right?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529674-4228521-suicidesquad%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529674" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529674-4228521-suicidesquad%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529674"></a><figcaption>Superman in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529674-4228521-suicidesquad%285%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To start, the criticism that Superman is overpowered does carry some weight in terms of game design. He is one of the most powerful characters in DC's canon, the yardstick by which other powerful characters are measured, and has decades of history building up new levels of power and ways to use his abilities. Building game mechanics around that level of strength is, apparently, pretty difficult. Make Superman too powerful and a game in which you play as him will be dull. Make him too weak and the game feels untrue to the character and dispiriting. The Superman Returns approach of making Metropolis itself the vulnerable aspect is a smart solution, but as that game showed, it can be difficult to maintain interest in an open world that feels too sparse.</p><p dir="ltr">As an aside, it's worth noting here that Superman is very powerful, but he is not immortal. The comics have established that he's so strong that he seems invulnerable by any human standards, but sufficiently powerful technology, magic, or beings from alien planets can injure him. Kryptonite, the radioactive rock that serves as Superman's main weakness, can feel like a writerly cheat, but it's not even necessary to lay Superman low. A villain like Doomsday or Darkseid can draw blood all on their own.</p><p dir="ltr">So the solution, then, may be a compromise that marries the two approaches. A game that wants to capture the essence of Superman's powerful abilities could begin in Metropolis, giving you the freedom to fly around the city, rescuing people and averting crises, with a gamified element like Superman Returns' Metropolis health bar to show how well you're fulfilling your mission to act as Earth's protector. Elements like technology from perennial villain Lex Luthor or various invading aliens could slowly start to hurt Superman, ramping up the difficulty progressively until the player is faced with a threat that could actually kill him, and leave Metropolis defenseless in the process. Overcoming these threats could fulfill the power fantasy of being Superman and adapting to new challenges.</p><p dir="ltr">More importantly, this could be a narratively satisfying way to express the core of Superman: he is <em>fundamentally good</em>. The Elseworlds stories about an evil Superman ruling like a tyrant can work to give stakes to the stories of other heroes, but they are not really stories about Superman. The Man of Steel is earnest and gentle, a figure meant to be aspirational and inspirational. He has all the power you can imagine, but he would never use it to inflict pain or suffering. He is charitable with his time and his affection for Earth and its people. He gives of himself. <em>That</em> is Superman.</p><p dir="ltr">Any story that aims to be about Superman has to capture that element above all. The question, "What if the world's most powerful person were evil?" no longer resonates like it once did, perhaps because we have plenty of powerful, evil people right here in the real world. Much more revolutionary is the simple idea that Superman has represented for the last several decades. What if the world's most powerful person were also its kindest?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The maker of the party game <em>What Do You Meme?</em> is suing a toy maker for allegedly copying its popular line of plush emotional support chicken nuggets. The company, which is also called What Do You Meme is suing Liwei Song in a New York court for trademark and copyright infringement after he started selling his own emotional support chicken nuggets (pizza, too).</p><p>Why sue over stuffed chicken nuggets? It’s a huge business for What Do You Meme. The company’s line of emotional support products, which include dumplings, pickles, mushrooms, pizza, fries, strawberries, and more, has made “millions of dollars in sales,” according to the complaint, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/886715554/What-Do-You-Meme-LLC-v-Song-1-25-cv-05577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which was filed on Monday and reviewed by Aftermath</a>. The emotional support chicken nuggets are the second top-selling plush toy on Amazon right now, having sold more than 5,000 sets this month alone. (The top-selling toy on Amazon currently is a plush recreation of Anxiety from <em>Inside Out 2</em>, signaling to me that we are not okay.) It’s beating out Disney-branded plushies, Squishmallows, and Jellycats on Amazon.</p><p>Is What Do You Meme the originator of the emotional support stuffed animal? Maybe the label, but certainly not the concept — <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/06/us/jellycat-squishmallow-adult-stuffed-animals-cec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jellycats and Squishmallows have been increasingly popular</a>. Jellycats, which also make plushies of personified food,&nbsp; had a sales increase of 41% from 2023 to 2024, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-08/how-jellycat-stuffed-animals-became-a-gen-z-obsession" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Bloomberg</a>. The company made $252 million in revenue between 2022 and 2023, <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/16/jellycat-250-million-gen-z-consumers-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortune reported</a> in a story that tied its success to “Gen Z’s mental health crisis and need for comfort.” People clearly want cute things and comfort. What Do You Meme’s line of emotional support plushies draws the line straight between the two.</p><figure></figure><p>What Do You Meme has the <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/voyager_37203491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">copyright for the emotional support label</a>. On Etsy and Amazon, there are plenty of different makers with “emotional support” plushies; on Etsy, crocheted versions are especially popular, but What Do You Meme <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ausener-Emotional-Burritos-Birthday-Tortilla/dp/B0F82Q5L7G?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is concerned with one maker in particular</a>, seemingly due to how close they look visually.</p><p>What Do You Meme alleged in the complaint that Song intentionally copies its plushies and confuses potential buyers by using the emotional support label. What Do You Meme wrote that it submitted a Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notice in June, but that Song submitted a counter notice, which allows the products to go back up on Amazon. What Do You Meme is looking for $150,0000 per copyright infringement; it cites ”no less than four,” making that amount&nbsp; at least $600,000. It also wants the alleged copycats taken down.</p><p>It’s a pretty standard copyright and trademark infringement case, despite being about stuffed chicken nuggets. This isn’t the first stuffed trademark infringement case: Squishmallows owner Kelly Toys is suing Build-A-Bear over its Skoosherz line of products, which it says copies Squishmallows. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/toys/556065/squishmallows-build-a-bear-copyright-trademark-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The case is ongoing</a>, but the argument from Kelly Toys is that Skookerz look too much like Squishmallows, while Build-A-Bear argues that you can’t trademark cute, round stuffed animals — it’s a concept that’s been done time and time again, the company argued. What Do You Meme’s case against Song is seemingly a bit more straightforward. The likeness is unmistakable. What’d be more complicated, perhaps, is if the company went after the <a href="http://e/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pages and pages of crocheted emotional support foods, dumpsters, and animals on Etsy</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/plushie-lawsuit-emotional-support-chicken-nuggets-what-do-you-meme]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, White Owls announced the release window of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hotel-barcelona-suda-51-swery-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HOTEL BARCELONA</a>. The new game from revered creators Hidetaka 'Swery' Suehiro (Deadly Premonition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-good-life-team-dog-or-team-cat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Life</a>) and Goichi 'Suda51' Suda (Killer7, No More Heroes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-doomed-to-an-eternity-of-heavy-metal-jokes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadows of the Damned</a>, Lollipop Chainsaw, Let It Die) will be available in September for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2286600/HOTEL_BARCELONA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. </p>



<p> The game is a 2.5D sidescroller/slasher featuring roguelite and action game elements. It is set in a mysterious hotel, located in a remote location on the Pennsylvania-West Virginia border. Its luxurious appearance hides a terrifying truth—it’s a trap for America’s most dangerous serial killers. Players step into the role of Justine, a rookie federal marshal with a deadly secret—her mind is connected to Dr. Carnival, a deranged murderer with a violent past. Together, Justine and Dr. Carnival must eliminate the Seven Slash Killers and try to survive long enough to escape.</p>



<p>Hotel Barcelona has seven unique explorable areas, each inspired by a different subgenre of horror, such as haunted mansions or twisted laboratories. Each zone features an unforgettable boss battle.</p>

<iframe title="HOTEL BARCELONA - Dr Carnival Steam Next Fest Trailer 2025 | A new game from SWERY &amp; Suda51" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rfgsl6E0XsM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Each time Justine dies, a memory of her past self is born. These echoes, known as Slasher Phantoms, mimic the previous run's movements and can harm enemies. Clever players may use them as shields, allies, or distractions. Thus, with each failure, their strength increases.</p>



<p>The game even supports an online multiplayer mode that can be unlocked. Up to three players can team up in co-op mode to work together to complete missions and survive the hotel's murderous inhabitants. For those seeking a more competitive thrill, PvP mode allows a fourth player to invade your world, where you can hunt or be hunted in a brutal game of cat and mouse.</p>



<p>HOTEL BARCELONA is playable at BitSummit XIII: Summer of Yōkai, Japan's largest indie game festival. From July 18 to 20 at the Miyako Messe in Kyoto, attendees can experience the game's opening section, including its brutal first boss, Jacob, a baseball-obsessed serial killer rumored to strike every few years at the nearby baseball field of the hotel.</p>

Four of the levels are titled Twin-Frog Trouble, Suck It Up, Handhold Havoc, High Inflation, with Team Asobi keeping the name of the fifth as a surprise. The addition of the new levels brings Astro Bot's total level count to over 90.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer teased in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/astro-bot-five-new-vicious-void-galaxy-levels-special-bots-launch-this-july/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> that completing the new galaxy "might lead to something really cool," so players will have to dive in and see what surprises are in store.</p><p dir="ltr">It wouldn't be an Astro Bot update without new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/astro-bot-all-cameo-bots-and-secret-characters-list/2900-5754/" data-ref-id="2900-5754">Special Bot cameo appearances</a>, and now we know a few that players can discover.

Another fan-favorite character, 2B from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nier-automata/" data-ref-id="5000-438557">NieR: Automata</a>, can also be found. Players had long wondered why no Square-Enix, and more specifically why no Final Fantasy characters, were present in Astro Bot at launch, so it's nice to see some finally included.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to new levels, Sony as part of its June State of Play announced a new limited-edition Astro Bot DualSense controller, one with a slightly different expression from a previous Astro Bot controller. That controller is still not available for preorder, though Sony said it will launch later this year and that it would have more information to share soon.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-gets-ps5-pro-support-and-new-levels-starting-today/1100-6529484/" data-ref-id="1100-6529484">Astro Bot received PlayStation 5 Pro support</a> and new, more challenging levels back in February.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo has announced it will discontinue its Switch Game Vouchers service in January. The program launched in 2019 and allowed users to purchase a pair of digital tickets that could be redeemed on two select digital Switch games, usually at a cheaper overall price than if they were bought traditionally.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7piZNI98ODk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7piZNI98ODk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Nintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html">FAQ page</a> on the matter states that vouchers will remain available for purchase until January 30, 2026. Purchased vouchers are valid for one year (365 days) from the date of purchase. So even if you buy vouchers on the final day they're available, they will still be usable until January 30, 2027.</p><p>New Switch games will continue to be added to the list of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=df&amp;p=0">eligible Game Voucher titles</a>, even after January 30, Nintendo confirms. This means those who own vouchers past the cutoff date can still expect to have new games to redeem them for – and you probably should use them, as purchased vouchers cannot be refunded.</p><p>Game Vouchers cost $99.98, and since they can be redeemed for two full-priced games (usually at $59.99), customers could save a decent bit of money. They are only eligible for Switch 1 games, including The Legend of Zelda: <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/such-great-heights">Tears of the Kingdom</a>/<a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/the_legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild/b/switch/archive/2017/03/02/game-informer-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch-review.aspx">Breath of the Wild</a>/<a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/pulled-in-two-directions">Echoes of Wisdom</a>, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/pikmin-4/mans-best-friends">Pikmin 4</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/super-mario-bros-wonder/getting-its-flowers">Super Mario Bros.
