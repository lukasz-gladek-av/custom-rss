            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> is this year's current free-to-play PC game success story, attracting many millions of players over its opening weekend and making regular appearances in the Steam Most Played top 10 ever since. It garnered <a href="http://www.gamelook.com.cn/2025/01/562110">an estimated $136 million</a> in January. So naturally, it's time to start laying people off. 
</p>
<p>
Last night, one of the project's game directors, Thaddeus Sasser, revealed that an undisclosed number of US-based NetEase Games employees had been dismissed, including level designers Gary McGee and Jack Burrows. NetEase have now confirmed the news, calling it a move to "optimize development efficiency" and assuring players that they "are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game". Just not so much the people working on it.
</p><!--more-->
<p>

"This is such a weird industry..." Sasser wrote in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297672154060361729/">a LinkedIn post</a> last night. "My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games...and were just laid off! Oh well! Times are tough all over - Let's find these incredible people new jobs, because we all need to eat, right?"</p>
<p>In that post, Sasser named McGee as one of the departing team members. Burrows has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jack-burrows-b7896399_opentowork-yacantwinthemall-activity-7297445172118724608-mTi7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAANxzosB8Nu3u0E3e0D-T9TYAyXUCoJsByM">announced</a> the loss of his job separately. "Was an enormous pleasure to work my American coworkers who join me in this sad culling," he wrote. "Just couldn't dodge that big boot, I guess, no matter how big the success of the gig."
</p>
<p>The cutbacks appear to be part of worldwide cost-cutting at NetEase, who are headquartered in China. Last November, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">pulled funding for Worlds Untold</a>, the studio co-founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> developer Mac Walters. Last month, they also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jar-of-sparks-halts-production-on-debut-game-as-it-looks-for-new-publisher">broke up with Jar Of Sparks</a>, the studio co-founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook. And just this week, we learned of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">layoffs</a> at Liquid Swords, founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a> creative director Christofer Sundberg.
</p>
<p>

Some more context: the average cost of living and, by extension, the average salary in the USA and Sweden are dramatically higher than in China. I guess if I were a Chinese publisher looking to make a few spreadsheet cells turn green, I would start by making reductions overseas. Still, going after Marvel Rivals seems absolutely perverse.
</p>
<p>
The obvious difference between the previous NetEase-backed studio funding cuts and the Rivals situation is that the former had yet to release a game, while Rivals appears to be a colossal bread-winner. It's the only recent release in the Steam most played top 10 at the time of writing, sharing a screen with eternal fixtures such as DOTA 2 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>. If a live service project can do this well and still undergo pruning, we might ask, what hope is there for anybody else?
</p>
<p>
In their statement confirming the layoffs (<a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1892090498803696046?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">passed on by Stephen Totillo of Game File</a>), NetEase say they have "made the difficult decision to adjust Marvel Rivals' development team structure for organization reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game". Without sharing exact numbers, they comment that the 'adjustments' apply to "a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of Marvel Rivals". They will be treating those affected "confidentially and respectfully".
</p>
<p>
The statement then switches the focus to Marvel Rivals itself, while quietly reminding readers that Rivals development is based primarily in China - an interesting show of a publisher managing perceptions of a game that is based on comicbooks and movies from the States, and thus easily read as an American cultural project. 
</p>
<p>
"We want to reassure our fanbase that the core development team for Marvel Rivals, which continues to be led by Lead Producer Weicong Wu and Game Creative Director Guangyn Chen in Guangzhou, China, remains fully committed to delivering an exceptional experience," it continues. "We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game. We're excited to deliver new super hero characters, maps, features, and content to ensure an engaging live service experience for our worldwide player base."
</p>
<p>
The games industry continues to weather <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">a phase of mass reductions</a>, which have been variously attributed to rising interest rates, disappointing returns on new 'n' crappy technologies such as NFTs, and above all, a 'market reset' following over-ambitious expansion during the boom period created by Covid pandemic lockdowns. 
</p>
<p>
Just yesterday, Sony's out-going indie gaming boss Shuhei Yoshida summarised it all as an "overreaction" to Covid. "Companies invested too much, including ourselves," he told <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/shuhei-yoshida-looks-back-at-31-years-at-sony-playstation-exit-interview/">VentureBeat</a>. "Then we had to face reality and make adjustments." Ah, that word 'adjustment' again. It's possible NetEase's desire for efficiency also has something to do with newly precarious trade relations between the US Trump administration and China, which saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-us-just-added-worlds-biggest-games-publisher-tencent-to-their-list-of-chinese-military-companies">world's biggest publisher Tencent being added to a list of Chinese military companies</a>.</p>
<p>The Covid reset argument and other explanations risk being used as distractions from the banal reality that video game publishers are always going to want to cut costs and increase profits, even when times are good. Thankfully, Marvel Rivals is here to clear things up.

<p>According to an industry insider, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 Remaster will be released after the Xbox Summer Showcase in June 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, we learned through the pro skateboarder <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-remaster-is-coming-skater-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyshawn Jones</a> that a new remaster for Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater series is in the works and that he is in conversation with Activision again, which is “insanely exciting.” Industry insider eXtas1s has confirmed that the upcoming game is none other than Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 Remaster, and it might be released sooner than we think.&nbsp;</p>



<p>eXtas1s posted a new video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnCqKCNNJFs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> (via r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1iswtxn/extas1s_tony_hawk_34_will_be_shadow_dropped_at/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>) in which he confirmed that Jones’s information is accurate and that a THPS 3+4 remaster is in the works. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 Remaster is internally referred to as Project Chicago at Microsoft and will be ready to be released by June 2025. The insider has stated that the THPS 3+4 remaster will be shadow-dropped after the Xbox Summer Showcase presentation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, THPS 3+4 Remaster will seemingly arrive as a Day One title for Xbox Game Pass and will also be available separately on Steam and PlayStation 5. eXtas1s couldn’t confirm whether the THPS 3+4 remaster will be released for the Switch 2, but he is pretty confident about his claim on the game’s release window.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, February Xbox Game Pass Wave 2 titles include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-2-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed, Watch Dogs: Legion, F1 24</a>, and more games. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-titles-will-remove-9-games-this-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nine games will be removed</a> from the service this month.

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida played <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s ill-fated The Last of Us Online and said "it was great".</p>
<p>Factions, as the game became known as, was an online multiplayer spin-off from Naughty Dog's post-apocalyptic solo drama, but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">cancelled by Sony at the end of 2023</a> as the studio didn't want to become a "solely live service games studio".</p>
<p>Destiny developer Bungie was drafted in to assist during development, but raised concerns about the game's "ability to keep players engaged for a long period of time", according to a report at the time.</p>

<p>Yet Yoshida, who recently left PlayStation, was able to play the game before it was cancelled, which he discussed in an interview with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home">Sacred Symbols+</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/yoshida-i-played-the-last-of-us-online-and-it-was-great">Push Square</a>) saying he "played the game and it was great".</p>
<p>"The idea for The Last of Us Online came from Naughty Dog and they really wanted to make it," said Yoshida. "But Bungie explained [to them] what it takes to make live service games, and Naughty Dog realised, 'Oops, we can't do that! If we do it, we can't make Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.' So that was a lack of foresight."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is Naughty Dog's next game</a>, a single-player sci-fi hack 'n' slash revealed at last year's The Game Awards.</p>
<p>Yoshida spoke further on live service games at Sony, stating that no first-party studio had been forced into the genre.</p>
<p>"From my experience, when studios see the company has a big initiative, [they realise] riding on that gives them a better chance of getting a project approved and supported," he explained. "It's not like [current PS Studios boss Hermen Hulst] is telling teams they need to make live service games, it's likely mutual."</p>
<p>At one point, Sony had over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">10 live service games in development</a> it planned to launch before March 2026. "That phenomenon of the live service game... that has, in a very large part, fuelled the enormous growth in the gaming industry that we've seen over the last ten years," said (now former) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">Sony exec Jim Ryan back in 2022</a>. "I think that trend towards live services will continue, and if you look for a model in our category of entertainment, which supports sustained engagement over a long period of time, live services games arguably fit that bill better than a subscription service."</p>
<p>Gradually, though, the company has cancelled these live service projects and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-march">Ryan has since left the company</a>. Most notably, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">Sony shut down Concord</a> shortly after release. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">two games at Days Gone developer Bend and remake studio Bluepoint were cancelled</a> following a "recent review".</p>
<p>Yoshida did not comment on these projects beyond: "Yeah, it sucks".</p>
<p>Sony's recent PlayStation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced">State of Play</a> was light on first-party announcements, perhaps due to the large number of cancelled projects. The company's other live-service shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-shooter-fairgame-has-been-delayed-to-next-year-insider-suggests">Fairgame$ has reportedly been delayed to next year</a>.</p>
<p>In an interview earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-playstation-boss-shuhei-yoshida-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-take-a-job-overseeing-indie-games">Yoshida discussed his 2019 move from president of SIE Worldwide Studios to overseeing Sony's indie developer initiative</a>. "Well, I had no choice," he said. "When Jim [Ryan] asked me to do the indie job, the choice was to do that or leave the company."</p>
<p>He also addressed current issues in the games industry such as slowed development and layoffs. "I think it's an overreaction to the Covid situation," he said. "Companies invested too much, including ourselves. Then we had to face reality and make adjustments. If you take out the Covid years you'd have smoother growth over the years."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Gears of War E-Day may not be too far from release, judging by how long it has already been in development.</p>
<p>As reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/VGTGamingNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VGT Gaming News</a>, the game's Senior Level Designer revealed on LinkedIn that the new entry in the popular series has been in active development for five years and two months already. As such, its release may not be too far off in the future.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Gears of War E-Day was announced last year during Microsoft's usual summer showcase, but very little has been said about the game since its reveal. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-playstation-release/">job ad</a> discovered shortly after the game's announcement suggests that the game could be headed to PlayStation 5 at some point, which has become less surprising since the ad has been discovered, as it has been highlighted multiple times by Xbox execs, including Phil Spencer, that<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/"> there are no red lines</a> regarding bringing Xbox games to other consoles and any game could be considered for a console multiplatform release.</p>
<p>Gears of War E-Day is currently in development for PC and Xbox Series X|S. A final release date, or the launch on any other platform besides those that have been announced, has yet to be officially confirmed.</p>

<p>Co-op gaming brings us all closer together—for better or for worse. While single-player gaming and online multiplayer continue to thrive, so does co-op. Certain studios and game makers are ensuring the art doesn’t die, and we’re here to recognize this with the best co-op games you need to be playing in 2025—especially if you want something akin to It Takes Two and Split Fiction.</p>



<p>Hazelight Studios inspired this list, and I take great pleasure in declaring this. I grew up playing local co-op games with my friends whenever possible. A Crash Team Racing tournament, a backstage scrap in WWF Smackdown, or an intense 1v1 in Point Blank. Multiplayer gaming has veered off toward online for the most part. But you’ve got the likes of Hazelight Studios developing games intended as a co-op-only title.</p>



<p>The developer is responsible for the Game of the Year-winning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-hazelight-studios-next-game-it-takes-two-sequel-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>. If you need more local co-op fixes, here’s a list of contenders to consider in 2025.</p>

<p>Game director Josef Fares’ first project heading up the newly-formed <a href="https://www.hazelight.se/games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hazelight Studios</a> was A Way Out. Two human players have to choose their character—Vincent or Leo. The action plays out in split-screen fashion across a dramatic story with gameplay fueled by teamwork. It’s not as polished as It Takes Two, but it’s a breath of fresh air, and I’d recommend you try it out.</p>

<p>Yes, 2023’s outstanding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-devs-have-moved-their-full-attention-to-the-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> can be enjoyed locally with another player. There are no cutbacks or restrictions either as you can create your characters and unravel BG3’s world together like normal. <strong>The RPG is about as refined and revered as they come</strong>, and it has enough content to keep you going until a probable Baldur’s Gate 4.</p>



<h3 id="h-borderlands">Borderlands</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Take your pick. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve stood by Borderlands since its 2009 debut and will continue to do so. From its first iteration to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, I don’t think it matters much which title you opt to play in co-op. <strong>Borderlands 2 is my favorite</strong> as it captures the soul of Pandora perfectly with its story, characters, and quests. But a stroll through Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands or enjoying a blast from the past with the Pre-Sequel won’t do any harm either in the epic looter shooter saga.</p>



<h3 id="h-brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons">Brothers A Tale of Two Sons</h3>



<figure><figcaption>True kinship. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Brothers A Tale of Two Sons was Fares’ directorial debut in video games. He worked under the banner of Starbreeze Studios to bring the story of two brothers to life before he founded Hazelight Studios. The game didn’t have co-op at launch, but the remake addressed this overlooked issue. This narrative-heavy adventure is a must, and you can once again see the <strong>groundwork being laid down for It Takes Two and Split Fiction</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-chained-together">Chained Together</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The only way up is down. Credit to Steam</figcaption></figure>



<p>I watched internet darlings Kai Cenat and IShowSpeed almost destroy each other playing Chained Together. Its concept is simple: You and a partner are chained together, and you must work together to escape hell. Every step, jump, and action you take affects your cohort. One false move, and you’re sent spiraling back down to the bottom—potentially startling Satan in his slumber.</p>



<h3 id="h-cuphead">Cuphead</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Good day for a swell battle! Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Cuphead is one of my favorite games of the last 10 years. Its presentation is incredibly niche and nuanced and Cuphead is essentially a boss rush—with a handful of platforming levels for good measure. It’s more fun with a partner but also frustrating as the enemy’s health scales accordingly. You can spend a good hour or two beating a boss, but <strong>the feeling of satisfaction is unbridled and unbeatable</strong>. It has a delicious last course through its DLC if you’re not satiated—called The Delicious Last Course!</p>



<h3 id="h-diablo-4">Diablo 4</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Everyone’s heard of Diablo. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Blizzard’s multimedia empire includes the iconic Diablo franchise. 2023 saw the release of Diablo 4, and the ARPG title not only offers more looting, dungeon crawling, bosses, and run-ins with demons and angels but also local co-op. You can buddy up with someone next to you, pick a class, and explore the plagued grounds of Sanctuary as you try to carefully tip-toe around the ongoing conflict between the High Heavens and the Burning Hells.</p>



<h3 id="h-don-t-starve-together">Don’t Starve Together</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Friendly. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Whereas something like Cuphead is overtly difficult, Don’t Starve doesn’t give this impression. Don’t let it fool you though as Don’t Starve demands you survive at all costs. You need food, hydration, sleep, warm surroundings, and a means of defending yourself. You don’t need to channel your inner Bear Grylls on your own though as the free Don’t Starve Together update introduces local co-op.</p>



<h3 id="h-lara-croft-and-the-guardian-of-light">Lara Croft And The Guardian of Light</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Niche but needed. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light—and its Temple of Osiris follow-up—feels derided. I question how many people (and even Tomb Raider fans) remember this 2010 gem. Unlike other entries on our best co-op games you need to play in 2025 list, this benefits from an in-person friend helping you out. It has Lara, her trademark pistols, outfit, and classic Tomb Raider exploration—<strong>what more do you want?</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-moving-out">Moving Out</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Frustration aplenty. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Anyone who’s ever <em>literally </em>moved out in real life automatically understands this game. It’s a nuisance in so many ways. So what better way to exemplify the rigors of moving out than by taking this nightmare, cranking up the hyperbole, and inciting chaos in relationships and friendships? Moving Out is a wonderful display of co-op and calamity, and it has a sequel if you want more punishment.</p>



<h3 id="h-overcooked">Overcooked</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It doesn’t start like this, I promise. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Substitute “moving out” with “cooking” and I can be done with this entry. Alas, this wouldn’t be informative of me and lacks integrity. I will say that if I was ranking the games on this list, <strong>Overcooked 1 and 2 would be near the top</strong>. Ghost Town Games created something hilarious, hellacious, and heartwarming with this series. Your ability to coalesce with individuals into a unified force is tested with every meal. Unfortunately, I don’t think there will be any more Overcooked, but there’s a good reason why—more on this later.</p>



<h3 id="h-portal-2">Portal 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A classic. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Remember when Valve used to make award-winning single-player games? No? I wouldn’t blame you as it’s incredibly slim picking nowadays. <strong>2011’s Portal 2 is a compulsory play </strong>for anyone with a penchant for immaculate storytelling, puzzles, physics, and co-op capers. Separate from the main story is an independent and original adventure only intended for two players. The quality is just as good and requires you both to don thinking caps playing this one.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Eye sense danger here. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking of highly successful IPs being abandoned, Rayman Legends is an excellent 2D platformer bubbling with life and personality. It has the grace of a galloping gazelle and might be <strong>the best Rayman title ever</strong>. It has a ton of fun-to-find collectibles, one ingenious level design after another (don’t get me started on the music levels), and best of all? Local co-op.</p>



<h3 id="h-sackboy-a-big-adventure">Sackboy: A Big Adventure</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Slowly does it. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>PlayStation and PC owners can sample a piece of this succulent Sackboy snack. It doesn’t do anything revolutionary or push the boundaries of 3D platforming in a way contemporaries and historical releases have, but it’s fun! Youngsters will get a kick out of it, and it’s mindless fun for older folks. You can get stuck into the bubble bursting with local users in co-op.</p>



<h3 id="h-stage-fright">Stage Fright</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A lot of promise. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’re back with Overcooked’s Ghost Town Games and its newest IP Stage Fright. I’m jumping the gun on this one as it’s not out yet. But its hilarious debut trailer could already be a sign of things to come. It’s also co-op focused, looks outstandingly creative, and could be one of the most-talked-about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op games in 2025</a> after Split Fiction.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth">The Binding of Isaac Rebirth</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The tears crash around me. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Binding of Isaac Rebirth appeared as a PlayStation Plus Monthly game in November 2014. I barely batted an eyelid. However, one day, I needed something to play and decided to give it a crack. Even though I didn’t know what any items did, why my main weapon was a small child’s tears, or why I was trying to kill Isaac’s mother, I was engrossed forever. The Binding of Isaac kickstarted my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/10-best-roguelike-games-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roguelike/roguelite</a> journey, and if you haven’t, I implore you to do the same as it has added co-op since release.</p>



<h3 id="h-unravel-two">Unravel Two</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Threading the eye of a needle. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>The first Unravel was a blast, but the sequel supersedes it by allowing two players to intertwine. Your relationship with your co-op partner is unlikely to unravel as the title is straightforward and shouldn’t trouble you. But its tamer nature is a more welcome and pleasant one. Once you’re done, you’ll both yarn for more.</p>

            <p>Nike is stepping out with some 'low poly' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a>-inspired trainers.</p>
<p>The trainers are part of Nike's Air Max 1 collection of shoes, and are predominantly a Donkey Kong shade of brown, complete with a red and yellow Swoosh logo. There is also yellow detailing around the base of the shoe.</p>

<p>On the inside, meanwhile, owners will be able to enjoy looking at some DK-inspired coins when the trainers are not on their feet, except rather than having DK on their surface, these coins are embossed with DS, for Dot Swoosh.</p>
<p>Oh, and there is a low poly banana in there -  I mean, this is a Donkey Kong trainer, after all, and what is Donkey Kong without some bananas.</p>
<p>As for when you can get your hands (or, should that be feet?) on these trainers, that hasn't been announced yet, although <a href="https://sneakernews.com/2025/02/15/nike-air-max-1-low-poly-donkey-kong-hv5776-200/">SneakerNews</a> expects them to be released at some point during the spring/summer season. I wonder if they will also come in Diddy sizes...?</p>

            <p>
High-profile indie game publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> will lay out its forthcoming release slate during a new digital showcase event, to be broadcast next week.
</p>
<p>
The showcase will be the company's first since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">vast majority of Annapurna's staff quit last September in a mass exodus</a> - reportedly following internal squabbles over the leadership of the company.
</p>
<p>
In the past, Annapurna has been hailed as a beacon for the very best of indie game talent, and has helped publish hits such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/what-remains-of-edith-finch">What Remains of Edith Finch</a>, Outer Wilds, Cocoon and Stray.
</p>
<p>
This new show, to be held at 5pm UK time next Monday, 24th February is designed to offer a look at what's next.

<p>
Annapurna says the event will last 30 minutes, and include looks at Wanderstop, Skin Deep, Wheel World, Faraway, Lushfoil, To a T, Morsels, and "a few more surprises" - all set to launch in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Many of these titles are games Annapurna has been working to publish for some time, such as Wanderstop, the next project from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> creator Davey Wreden.
</p>
<p>
Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/developers-rush-to-reassure-players-of-forthcoming-releases-following-annapurna-interactive-mass-exodus">Wreden said that "nothing's gonna stop us from getting Wanderstop out the door very soon" despite the upheaval within Annapurna</a>, which he described as a "bump in the road".
</p>
<p>
At the time, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurnas-mass-exodus-of-staff-a-baffler-says-company-spokesperson">Annapurna spokesperson described the loss of its staff as "a baffler"</a>, and pledged it would plod on.
</p>
<p>
"We've had really great conversations with an overwhelming majority of our existing development teams and are grateful for their partnership," the company said. 
</p>
<p>
"If our inbox is any indication, a ton of developers continue to want to be a part of what we're building, and we look forward to seeing their pitches. We've also had an influx of quality job applicants and are excited to build a team passionate about our mission to tell original stories that aren't being told elsewhere. PS. We're hiring."
</p>
<p>
Staff members who previously worked at Annapurna have since reportedly reformed as a fresh team. Last month, Bloomberg stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-taking-over-private-division-portfolio-following-take-two-sale">this group had taken on the games and franchises of Private Division</a>, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-sells-private-division-label-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-world-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">sold off by Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two Interactive</a> in November last year. These include the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program">Kerbal Space Program</a> series, upcoming Lord of the Rings farming game Tales of the Shire, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-studio-game-freak-creating-new-action-adventure-ip-with-private-division">new action-adventure from Pokémon developer Game Freak</a>.

			<p>In June 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-was-planned-before-vicarious-visions-got-merged-into-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> from Tony Hawk himself that a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 remaster/remake had been in development before developer Vicarious Visions got merged into Activision Blizzard. Following that news, fans assumed they wouldn't get a new version of those games, but it seems like good news is coming relatively soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnCqKCNNJFs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to insider extas1s</a>, a remaster is not only in preparation but will also be shadow-dropped at the next Xbox Game Showcase in June.</p>
<p><em>A professional skater who is already featured in Tony Hawk 1 + 2—I'm talking about Tyshawn Jones, an Adidas athlete—has confirmed on the Breakfast Club podcast that a new remastered Tony Hawk game is coming soon. So far, so good, and everything's on point. This was mentioned by the guy on the podcast, and it leads us to something we've been waiting for. I’m talking about a codename at Microsoft, Project Chicago, which is none other than Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4. We already have the 1 + 2 remaster, and now the 3 + 4 remaster is on the way, as this guy said it’s going to drop soon.</em></p>
<p><em>What I can pretty much confirm for you right now from this video is that it's a video game set to be released in 2025. And I know you might be thinking, "Okay, Álvaro, everyone says things are coming out soon," but hear me out—this one is actually scheduled for June 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be available right after the Xbox summer showcase, which means on the Sunday showcase, they’re going to do a surprise drop. That surprise drop is Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remaster. Of course, it’ll be available on day one in Game Pass, and you can also buy it on Steam and PlayStation 5. As for Nintendo Switch 2, I can't make any promises because I don't know, but this Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 is dropping as a surprise at the showcase.</em></p>
<p><em>I was just waiting on some statements from people like Tyshawn Jones to back this up. For those of you who follow the channel, I had the name 'Project Chicago,' but I wasn’t exactly sure what it was. Now, I’ve been able to piece things together, and we’ll remember this soon—well, maybe not that soon, it depends on how you see it.</em></p>
<p>Microsoft is making it a habit of shadow-dropping stuff. They did it twice at the January Developer Direct with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hi-fi-rush-stealing-the-show-with-style-sss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>. It's a solid marketing tactic, although, of course, rumors such as this one kind of take away a bit of the fun of a surprise release. Still, I'm sure Tony Hawk fans wouldn't mind if it turned out to be true.</p>

		<p>Despite having a major hit on their hands with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, NetEase has decided to layoff a part of the team that made it happen as part of a shift away from having US-based workers – per <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zhugeex.com/post/3liid2tn3sk2g">industry analyst Daniel Ahmad</a>. The game’s continued support will revolve around the core development team in China going forward.</p>
<p><em>Updated: Added details on studio size.</em></p>


<p>Studio director Matthew Sassler broke the news on his LinkedIn (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-support-studio-director-shares-that-he-and-his-team-were-just-laid-off.1112481/">Resetera</a>), writing:</p>
<p>This is such a weird industry…</p>
<p>My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games…</p>

<p>…and were just laid off!</p>
<p>He went on to sing the praises of co-worker Garry McGee, who was working “as sort of an “R &amp; D” branch, coming up with new level design mechanics, gameplay mechanics, and so on.”</p>
<p>Level designer Jack Burrows also confirmed that they have been laid off, and it seems that this has affected exclusively a US-based design team, when the initial framing of the news suggested that NetEase was making a more dramatic cut.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how many developers were a part of NetEase’s Seattle team, though there’s some reporting that this was a micro-studio of just six employees – via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nickjcal.bsky.social">Second Wind Group’s Nick Calandra</a>. Still, if part of a wider shift, this could affect other NetEase teams in LA and Texas.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/">WCCFTech</a>, NetEase says:</p>
<p>We recently made the difficult decision to adjust Marvel Rivals’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game. This resulted in a reduction of a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of Marvel Rivals. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of those affected and will be treating them confidentially and respectfully with recognition for their individual contributions.</p>
<p>We want to reassure our fanbase that the core development team for Marvel Rivals, which continues to be led by Lead Producer Weicong Wu and Game Creative Director Guangyun Chen in Guangzhou, China, remains fully committed to delivering an exceptional experience. We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game. We’re excited to deliver new superhero characters, maps, features, and content to ensure an engaging live service experience for our worldwide player base.</p>
<p>A factor here will almost certainly have been the cost of labour in different parts of the world. Compared to the salaries that US-based developers hold (and particularly those in affluent tech hubs like Seattle), the “core” team in China will be much cheaper by comparison. Of course, this very much comes off as though the US devs have been quickly discarded once all their usefulness has been reached… which is pretty much par for the course in an industry where outsourced labour has become increasingly prevalent. It’s somewhat ironic that it’s the US developers feeling the effects of this, as opposed to those in Asia.</p>
<p>Hopefully all those affected will be able to find fresh work soon, and having a hit like Marvel Rivals on their resume certainly won’t hurt.</p>

            <p>The psychology of people who cheat in competitive games remains deeply mysterious to me, but I'll hazard a guess it stems from a love of ruining someone's day rather than any real sense of accomplishment. Something I am interested in, however, is the idea of play as transgression.</p>
<p>There is, for example, a subset of people who get very irritated at the concept of speedruns. I suspect this is because, even if we aren't consciously engaged with a game's story, there's an underlying sense of what I'm going to very clumsily call 'narrative correctness' that's absolutely shattered when, say, Leon Kennedy starts shuffling up stairs at superhuman speeds. Glitches, warps, and other exploits expose the shroud of storytelling conjured by every little piece of a game's design, pulling off the mask so the underlying grey box is painfully visible. They call art a liar.</p>
<p>Competitive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cheaters-cheetah">Cheaters Cheetah</a> initially seems like pure transgression against any sense of fair play or even level design, but the key here is that <em>everyone</em> gets cheats like aimbots, wallhacks, and spinbots. "This creates a unique dynamic," reads the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3438990/Cheaters_Cheetah/">Steam page</a>, "where everyone knows everyone else's position, leading to intense mind games and thrilling battles". It sounds like it's either going to be a complete disaster or incredibly interesting, probably both.</p>

<p>It's from Acmore Games, with help from a reformed miscreant cheat developer. Before matches, you'll choose a mode. "Legit cheat" just lets everyone see through walls with wallhacks, and "rage cheat" unlocks the whole kit. Alongside classic deathmatch, there's also a "Raid boss" mode - "where multiple legit cheaters team up against 1 rage cheater". You can also play single player against bots. From Steam:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The game is set in a prison for former cheaters, who were caught using cheats in a popular online FPS. Transformed into cheetahs, they are forced to participate in a game show "Cheaters Cheetah" as a punishment. Winners will be granted with the "BAN Hammer", allowing them to BAN all of the losers from the game. Show no mercy to those scumbags!"</p></blockquote>
<p>It's not entirely clear exactly how this BAN Hammer works, but if it literally stops you from ever playing the game again, I can't help but respect the performance art quality to it all - although my aesthetic tastes are obviously very malleable depending on pricing. No release date on this one just yet. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kids">Kids</a> these days, eh?

            <p>NetEase has released a statement following the shock Marvel Rivals layoffs last night.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals - the free-to-play shooter based on characters from within the Marvel universe - has been a huge success since its release in December. On its opening weekend just two months ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-opening-weekend-sees-10m-players-join-in">the game welcomed an astonishing 10 million players to the fray</a>. Meanwhile, at this very moment in time there are still <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/">121,646 heroes making their way in the game via Steam</a>. And Marvel Rivals hasn't just boasted high player numbers. A report in January estimated that <a href="https://80.lv/articles/first-month-revenue-of-marvel-rivals-is-estimated-at-over-usd130-million/">Marvel Rivals had made over $130m in revenue during its first month</a>.</p>
<p>However, despite this success, which is even more impressive when you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">consider how other online shooter games have struggled to get off the mark recently</a>, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">laid off an unspecified number of the Marvel Rivals development team last night</a>, including game director Thaddeus Sasser. The news was broken by Sasser himself, before other members of the development team went on to share word of their situation.</p>

<p>The Marvel Rivals publisher has now broken its silence on the layoffs, calling them a "difficult decision" made to "optimise development efficiency" for the game.</p>
<p>"This resulted in a reduction of a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of Marvel Rivals," a NetEase spokesperson said in a statement shared with Eurogamer. "We appreciate the hard work and dedication of those affected and will be treating them confidentially and respectfully with recognition for their individual contributions."</p>
<p>It added that the "core" development team in China "remains fully committed to delivering an exceptional experience" for Marvel Rivals players.</p>
<p>"We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game," NetEase continued. "We're excited to deliver new super hero characters, maps, features, and content to ensure an engaging live service experience for our worldwide player base."</p>

<p>As reported last night, the job cuts within Marvel Rivals' western-based development team follow a recent pattern by NetEase, which has made broader reconsiderations to its overseas investments and studios.</p>
<p>In November of last year, Mac Walters - the veteran writer and producer who worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> for almost two decades - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">announced a "pause" in operations at his NetEase-backed AAA game studio</a>, Worlds Untold. Then, last month, Jar of Sparks - the Seattle-based "AAA" studio established by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook back in 2022 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">halted work its currently-unannounced first title as it searched for a new publishing partner</a>, stating it's looking to "find all of our team new homes" as a result.</p>
<p>More recently, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">NetEase-backed and Sweden-based developer Liquid Swords announced an unspecified number of layoffs</a>, before it had even released its first game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Limited Run Games has responded to a report that accused it of selling NES game cartridges that damaged consoles. In a statement, the company confirmed the reports of damage were accurate, and blamed the issue on a change in supplier. It's now offering refunds and re-manufactured games.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/02/this-cartridge-is-a-tiny-time-bomb-limited-run-accused-of-selling-carts-which-can-damage-your-nes">Time Extension</a> reported copies of Rugrats Adventures in Gameland and PioPow could damage players' consoles due to a mismatch in voltage between the cartridges and the original hardware. One user, speaking to Time Extension, described the cartridges as "a tiny time bomb for my electronics".</p>
<p>"Upon learning about this issue from our community, we immediately began investigating and can confirm that due to an issue with voltage regulation, there is a small chance that prolonged use of these titles could result in damage to either the cartridge or the console hardware," a Limited Run Games spokesperson said in a statement shared with Eurogamer reads.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/war-rats-the-rat-em-up">War Rats</a> is sort of trash, but I love it all the same. Oh, you're giving me a 'ratvolver' and letting me build 'turrats' and there's a dramatic close-up of swinging rat balls in the intro montage for each stage? Yeah, go on then. It's got the vibes of something made by the guy you knew in secondary school who exclusively drew pictures of cartoon dicks but, like, they were<em> </em>undeniably really<em> good</em> dicks. Absolute cock prodigy, that guy. Pablo Dickasso.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm probably making it sound like there's a serious dick to rat ratio here but it's really just those balls. There are some great rat animations though. It's a 2D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> tug-of-war where you push through stages summoning troops and building structures, and when you do, you're treated to a bunch of rats with hammers piling up construction barriers. When enemy rats fall, either to your own guns or your army of Ratineeers, gangs of regular-sized rats come to nibble on their corpses. They also say things like "Tell my wife…squeak".</p>
<p>Also I am 95% sure your Ratvolver fires legally distinct warpstone. They saw me coming, I tell you.</p>

<li><strong>Recruit Troops:</strong> Going in alone is sure to lead to failure. Make sure you utilize your troops effectively or it's GG. Call in reinforcements at key times to turn the tide of battle in your favour</li>
<li><strong>Buy New Weapons and Gear:</strong> Earn credits (CHz) and upgrade at the shop (rat dealer) to give yourself an edge over the endless hordes that are only going to get stronger and stranger as you get closer to TechnoRat HQ.</li>
<li><strong>Base Building:</strong> Build turrets, shrines, walls, resource generators and missile launchers to counter and overwhelm the armies of TechnoRat.</li>
<li><strong>Roguelike Progression:</strong> You have one life to fight through each district and try to reach the TechnoRat HQ and shut them down permanently. On death, spend your hard earned CHz to upgrade your attributes to do better!</li>
<li><strong>Iron Rat Mode:</strong> If you like a challenge, enable this toggle to turn your run even more hardcore! Start over at level 1 again if you die, but keep the core gameplay loop of upgrading with whatever you earned during that run.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Art Style:</strong> Experience the world of Ratopia with graphics all hand-drawn by rat artist wootusart (Me!). (Meaning I am an artist who draws rats, not that I am a rat that is an artist. That would be crazy.)</li>
<li><strong>Skirmish Mode:</strong> Select any map and just go at it, for practice or for fun. Or both!</li>
<li><strong>Multiplayer (Coming Soon):</strong> Grab a friend and go rat-toe to rat-toe on any of the maps featured in the game.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>You get killed unbelievably quickly in War Rats, and I think that will to survive was where most of my compulsion to carry on playing came from, but I reckon there's something here still. The demo is very short, giving you a taste of the many available upgrades without fully revealing its hand, so I'm mainly curious to see how that evolves. Still: free rats, free rat puns, and its out "Q2 2025" if you fancy the full thing. I would have used the subtitle 'Rat Time Rategy' but that's just me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Niantic, the developer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, is in talks to sell off its games for $3.5bn to the Saudi Arabia-owned Monopoly Go! publisher Scopely, a new report has stated.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-19/-pokemon-go-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit">Bloomberg</a> revealed the potential deal today, though stated the agreement was still yet to be finalised. Niantic and Scopely both declined to comment on the report.
</p>
<p>
If the deal went through, ownership of Niantic's smash hit Pokémon Go would transfer to Scopely, alongside the rest of the company's gaming portfolio.
</p>
<p>
Currently, Niantic also runs <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-now">Monster Hunter Now</a> in collaboration with Capcom, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a> in collaboration with Nintendo. Niantic's first game, Ingress, is also still operational. All are believed profitable - Pokémon Go still in particular - but Niantic has faced repeated layoffs in recent years as it has struggled to replicate Pokémon Go's lightning-in-a-bottle success, and the company has always been, at its heart, a technology firm fascinated by AR and mixed reality technology.
</p>
<p>
Scopely is best known as the company behind Monopoly Go!, the biggest mobile hit of 2023 that continues to dominate app store spending. Savvy Games Group, an arm of Saudi Arabia's controversial Public Investment Fund (PIF), snapped up Scopely for $4.9bn in July 2023.
</p>
<p>
Savvy Games Group has notable stakes in a raft of other companies, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-increases-stake-in-ea-by-55">EA</a>, Take-Two, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-acquires-stake-in-embracer-group">Embracer</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabia-reportedly-increases-nintendo-stake-for-second-time-in-a-month">Nintendo</a> - of which it currently owns 7.5 percent. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-claiming-its-signed-a-saudi-deal-for-fresh-assassins-creed-mirage-content">Ubisoft declined to comment that it was also working on a deal with the PIF</a>.
</p>
<p>The PIF is an initiative designed as a way to diversify the country's revenues via investment in foreign companies. It's chaired by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the controversial ruler <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>, and who has upheld the country's notoriously poor human rights record.</p>
<p>
In April last year, Savvy's boss Brian Ward told <a href="https://archive.is/o/ymwfH/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-19/saudi-arabia-s-savvy-to-put-more-into-mobile-after-monopoly-go">Bloomberg</a> that the company wanted to buy an unnamed "genre-leading" mobile game via Scopely as "the "tip of the spear" for its mobile investment. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/savvy-games-group-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-niantic-for-mena-expansion/">Niantic and Savvy then publicly cosied up in August last year</a>, when the companies signed a memorandum of understanding designed to expand Pokémon Go within the Middle East.
</p>
<p>
Niantic declined to comment to Eurogamer this morning.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/pokemon-go-creator-niantic-rumored-to-sell-video-games-unit-for-3-5-billion/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Pokémon Go creator Niantic is reportedly in talks to sell its video games division to Scopely for $3.5 billion. The rumor comes <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloomberg-%E2%80%98pok%C3%A9mon-go%E2%80%99-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit.1112859/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Bloomberg</a>, which cites 'several people familiar with the discussions'. According to the report, a deal could be announced in the coming weeks, but there's still no guarantee it will be finalized.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based developer started in 2010 as Niantic Labs, an internal startup within Google. However, it went independent in 2015 following Google's restructuring into Alphabet, Inc.</p>
<p>Niantic made its business in the augmented reality game segment for mobile devices. After their debut title, Ingress, they adapted the location-based technology to create <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-go-review-the-new-king-of-mobile-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon Go</a>, arguably one of the biggest financial successes of the last decade. By the end of 2016, the year that saw the game's original launch, Pokémon Go had already been downloaded over 500 million times. By 2020, the game had grossed over $6 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>However, following Pokémon Go, Niantic was unable to replicate that success, even when using other big intellectual properties. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/harry-potter-wizards-unite-pokemon-go-without-cute-creatures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</a> launched in 2019 but never really took off and went offline less than three years later. NBA All-World was even more short-lived, lasting only a few months (between January and June 2023). Some hyped games, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-world-of-heroes-is-niantics-next-ar-mobile-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MARVEL World of Heroes</a>, were never even released. Others, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/niantics-monster-hunter-now-brings-the-hunt-to-the-real-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter NOW</a> and Pikmin Bloom, were released but never really became successful. The latter game, for example, only made $44 million in revenue in the first two and a half years of its live service.</p>
<p>That's probably why Niantic is interested in selling off its video games unit to Scopely, which operates big mobile games like Monopoly Go!, Marvel Strike Force, Star Trek Fleet Command, and WWE Champions, among others. Scopely was acquired in 2023 by the Savvy Games Group, which is wholly owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), for $4.9 billion.</p>

<p>NetEase has just released a statement regarding the recent layoffs of the Marvel Rivals team in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals game director Thaddeus Sasser revealed yesterday that his entire team in the United States was<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-laid-off-as-netease-guts-entire-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> suddenly gutted</a>. Sasser added that the layoffs took place even after their team was able to “deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games”. It was unclear why the layoffs occurred, but NetEase’s latest statement clarifies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NetEase’s statement on Marvel Rivals layoffs was first spotted on an <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1892090498803696046/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post by Stephen Totilo. It revealed that the layoffs were part of a “difficult decision” required for “organisational reasons and to optimise development efficiency”. The decision led to cutting down their Seattle design team, which comprised six people. The developers stated that the affected will receive confidential and respectful treatment “with recognition for their individual contributions”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, they assure players that the core development team for Marvel Rivals, which resides in Guangzhou, China, and is led by Weicong Wu, is “fully committed” to providing the best experience for the players. The developers are investing more in the game’s growth and are looking forward to delivering new characters, maps, features, and engaging live-service content for their community.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Here’s NetEase’s statement on the Marvel Rivals layoffs in Seattle:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We recently made the difficult decision to adjust Marvel Rivals’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game. This resulted in a reduction of a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of Marvel Rivals. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of those affected and will be treating them confidentially and respectfully with recognition for their individual contributions.</p>



<p>We want to reassure our fanbase that the core development team for Marvel Rivals, which continues to be led by Lead Producer Weicong Wu and Game Creative Director Guangyun Chen in Guangzhou, China, remains fully committed to delivering an exceptional experience. We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game. We’re excited to deliver new super hero characters, maps, features, and content to ensure an engaging live service experience for our worldwide player base.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Counter-Strike Major is returning to North America for the first time since the start of 2018. But while an NA team managed to lift the trophy then, it doesn’t feel like any team from the region is in the realm of contending for the BLAST.tv Austin 2025 trophy.</p>



<p>In the past couple of years, Counter-Strike fans have seen young phenoms like Danil “donk” Kryshkovet and Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov emerge. Why isn’t it happening in North America? CS2 caster, analyst, and former coach Jason “moses” O’Toole spoke to Gaming World Media about the state of NA CS, and what is needed for the region to properly compete with Europe.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-was-the-last-time-we-had-a-phenom">‘When Was The Last Time We Had a Phenom?’</h2>



<p>It’s been a long time since a North American player truly broke into the upper echelon of professional Counter-Strike play. When Moses spoke to GWM at the media event for the BLAST.tv Austin Major, he laid out his hopes that the event could reignite NA CS with new talent and new events.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When was the last time we had a phenom? When was the last time we had a new player burst onto the scene? If you look at the players at the top of the list [of NA players] you’ve got Twistzz and EliGE and they’ve been playing since 2015. I always wonder: all the talent in the country, but where’s it going?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Moses pointed out a country like Mongolia, which has managed to produce tier-one-ready teenagers like Azbayar “Senzu” Munkhbold and Ayush “mzinho” Batbold, saying “if they can do it in Mongolia, we can do it in North America.” The former coach of Team Liquid says the NA scene isn’t structured right to produce that kind of talent, and that the biggest issue if discovering that talent.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We exist in that weird space where we expect North American players to go to tier one events in Europe, but we have no ability to find out who they are because we have no events here. And that’s what I hope, in one sense, the Austin Major solves. A shot in the arm of North American Counter-Strike that brings some events back, bring some energy back, so we can develop those circuits and figure out who the players are that we should promote to a top team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Moses isn’t the only person who cares about developing talent in NA. Complexity owner Jason Lake told Gaming World Media about the importance of “staying loyal” to NA, saying the region won’t grow if organizations keep “recycling the same big names from Europe and other regions.” Acquiring new player talent isn’t solely an issue with NA or Counter-Strike. François-Xavier Deniele, the VP of Global Esports at Ubisoft, told GWM at the Six Invitational that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-vp-of-esports-no-new-talent-games-die/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games die without new talent coming in</a>.</p>



<p>Is the Austin Major going to reignite the North American Counter-Strike scene? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-support-studio-director-shares-that-he-and-his-team-were-just-laid-off.1112481/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news</a> that one of the teams working on Marvel Rivals for NetEase suffered major layoffs struck the industry like thunder. After all, this is arguably the biggest success of the last few months, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earning an estimated $135 million in the first month alone</a> with a user base of more than 20 million players across all platforms.</p>
<p>Needless to say, fans of Marvel Rivals and just regular gamers in general did not understand what was happening. We immediately reached out to NetEase to get their statement on the matter, which just arrived. Here it is in full:</p>
<p><em>We recently made the difficult decision to adjust Marvel Rivals’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game. This resulted in a reduction of a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of Marvel Rivals. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of those affected and will be treating them confidentially and respectfully with recognition for their individual contributions.</em></p>
<p><em>We want to reassure our fanbase that the core development team for Marvel Rivals, which continues to be led by Lead Producer Weicong Wu and Game Creative Director Guangyun Chen in Guangzhou, China, remains fully committed to delivering an exceptional experience. We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game. We’re excited to deliver new superhero characters, maps, features, and content to ensure an engaging live service experience for our worldwide player base.</em></p>
<p>Somewhat ironically, earlier in the day, NetEase had sent out a press release and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPCzylKgc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video update</a> with new details on the next Marvel Rivals patch, launching with Season 1.5: Eternal Night Falls. This will kick off on February 21, introducing The Thing and Human Torch from the Fantastic Four as playable heroes. Additionally, a new redemption system will be implemented, allowing players to convert excess Chrono Tokens into Units. The second part of Season 1 will also include a new map, 'Empire of Eternal Night: Central Park,' along with updates to competitive mode, tournament plans, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Human Torch: Hottest Hero In Town | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ORBFXYlQ3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Human Torch will be a Duelist type of character in the game, adding an intense flare to every battle with scorching flames. When he's not busy burning Dracula's legions with flames brighter than the sun itself, he's soaring across the city to gather Chronovium and scavenge for parts of the Timestream Reintegration Device.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Thing: You Know What Time It Is | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l44udAAD3Yc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Thing, on the other hand, will predictably be a Vanguard character. His story is well known: Ben Grimm originally signed up to be a pilot for his friend Reed, but he returned from the mission as a monster called The Thing. However, while beaming cosmic rays transformed his flesh, Ben's heart of gold still beats in his rocky body. As New York City plunged into eternal night, the Thing made it his mission to selflessly protect his home and lead missions to collect Chronovium by putting his piloting skills to the test.</p>
<p>NetEase also announced today that the recent in-client tournament, the Marvel Rivals Championship (MRC), maxed out its Faction registrations in North America. After the upcoming update in the second half of Season 1, this limit will be increased. There will be a series of Marvel Rivals Invitationals (MRI) set to kick off at the end of February and continue into March, paving the way for the upcoming championship.</p>

<p>Niantic Inc. is closing in on a deal to sell its games division, which includes Pokemon Go, to Saudia Arabia-backed Scopely Inc. for $3.5 billion. This, according to a new report from Bloomberg.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-19/-pokemon-go-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg says</a> a deal on the sale could be announced “in coming weeks”, and would include Niantic’s video game business and gaming properties. In addition to Pokemon Go, Niantic games also include Ingress, Pikmin Bloom, and Monster Hunter Now, among others.</p>



<p>Despite talks being close, the report states that there’s “no assurance an agreement will be reached.”</p>

<p>Founded in 2011, Scopely was acquired by Savvy Games Group in 2023 for $4.9 billion. Savvy Games Group is a gaming subsidiary funded by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.</p>



<p>In August 2024, Niantic and Savvy Games Group <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/savvy-games-group-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-niantic-for-mena-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">signed a deal</a> for Niantic to help with planned expansion into Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and United Arab Emirates. </p>



<p>“Our collaboration with Niantic marks a significant milestone in our efforts to bring cutting-edge games and esports experiences to the MENA-3 region,” Savvy Games Group CEO Brian Ward said, at the time, via PocketGamer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Scopely nor Niantic would comment on the potential sale when contacted by Bloomberg.</p>

But the stuff I want to talk about in more detail today is the game's conversation system, and how it has been built to support both the weight of the universe's lore as well as the needs of a large and varied playerbase.</p><p>Up top is a screenshot of the conversation screen in action. Looks normal, right? A character talks, you select some responses, a conversation happens. But look at the two buttons down the bottom. The one of the left toggles subtitles on and off. Normally this is a main menu kind of thing, something you're supposed to toggle once based on preference then never touch again. Here, though, you can do it on the fly, which is amazing! I'm normally a subs off guy, but this game has some wild accents and creatures, so the button lets me turn them on for some (when I need to understand them) and off for others (so I can enjoy the game's gorgeous characters and environments unobscured).</p><figure><figcaption>Sometimes it's nicer to just appreciate this beautiful video game, without half the screen being obscured by text</figcaption></figure><p>I'm even more impressed with the button on the right. <em>Avowed</em> basically shipped with a wiki attached to its conversation system, so whenever a character or location or even concept from the <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> universe is mentioned, you can stop, check the conversation's logs and get a great little explainer on just who or what was mentioned. This has been life-changing to me, a guy who wanted to play this game in particular but isn't really a <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> guy, because now I'm fully up to speed about this universe's lore in ways I wasn't with, say, <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> even after 60-70 hours.</p><figure><figcaption>Other times, you need to LEARN<span></span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Favowed-i-hope-you-guys-are-into-your-lore-dumps-and-enjoy-a-v0-ecelbta3q3je1.png%3Fwidth%3D1080%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Da6ea29331194b9c25a85b9620c5bc235eb0e2cb4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a></figcaption></figure><p>Accessibility is an important word in video games, and it's one that we usually--and rightfully--associate with making games more accessible to those who would otherwise be unable to play them. Here, though, it also means making a game more accessible generally, right down to people's tastes for subtitles and lore. I think it's been a huge success here, and I will really feel its absence next time I try and play you, <em>Yakuza</em>, yes you, I'm looking at you.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gamestop-stonks-shares-closures-store"><h3>GameStop Is A Very 21st Century Company</h3></a><p>And also has the most predictable trajectory</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nvidia's PhysX offerings to developers didn't always generate warm feelings. As part of its broader GamesWorks package, PhysX was cited as one of the reasons <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/05/amd-says-nvidias-gameworks-completely-sabotaged-witcher-3-performance/"><em>The Witcher 3</em> ran at notably sub-optimal levels</a> at launch. Protagonist Geralt's hair, rendered in PhysX-powered HairWorks, was a burden on some chipsets.</p>
<p>PhysX started appearing in general game engines, like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/03/unity-5-game-engine-brings-enhanced-graphic-tools-new-cloud-services/">Unity 5</a>, and was eventually open-sourced, first in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181205103131/https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk">limited computer and mobile form</a>, then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230528035837/https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/open-source-simulation-expands-with-nvidia-physx-5-release/">more broadly</a>. As an application wrapped up in Nvidia's 32-bit CUDA API and platform, the PhysX engine had a built-in shelf life. Now the expiration date is known, and it is conditional on buying into Nvidia's 50-series video cards—whenever they approach reasonable human prices.</p>

<h2>The real dynamic particles were the friends we made…</h2>
<p><a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5615">Nvidia noted in mid-January</a> that 32-bit applications cannot be developed or debugged on the latest versions of its CUDA toolkit. They will still run on cards before the 50 series. Technically, you could also keep an older card installed on your system for compatibility, which is real dedication to early-2010's-era particle physics.</p>
<p>Technically, a 64-bit game could still support PhysX on Nvidia's newest GPUs, but the heyday of PhysX, as a stand-alone technology switched on in game settings, tended to coincide with the 32-bit computing era.</p>
<p>If you load up a 32-bit game now with PhysX enabled (or <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/557125/rtx-5090-missing-physx-support/">forced in a config file</a>) and a 50-series Nvidia GPU installed, there's a good chance the physics work will be passed to the CPU instead of the GPU, likely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJGf0-tGaf4">bottlenecking the game and steeply lowering frame rates</a>. Of course, turning off PhysX entirely raised frame rates above even native GPU support levels.</p>
<p>Demanding <em>Borderlands 2</em> keep using PhysX made it so it "runs terrible," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1irs8xk/comment/mdauwh3/?utm_name=web3xcss">noted one Redditor</a>, even if the dust clouds and flapping cloth strips looked interesting. Other games with PhysX baked in, as listed by ResetEra completists, include <em>Metro 2033,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/assassins-creed-iv-review-enormous-but-ultimately-empty/"><em>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</em></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(2013_video_game)">the 2013&nbsp;<em>Star Trek&nbsp;</em>game</a>.</p>
<p>Commenters on Reddit and ResetEra note that many of the games listed had performance issues with PhysX long before Nvidia forced them to either turn off or be loaded onto a CPU. For some games, however, PhysX enabled destructible environments, "dynamic bank notes" and "posters" (in the&nbsp;<em>Arkham</em> games), fluid simulations, and base gameplay physics.</p>
<p>Anyone who works in, or cares about, game preservation has always had their work cut out for them. But it's a particularly tough challenge to see certain aspects of a game's operation lost to the forward march of the CUDA platform, something that's harder to explain than a scratched CD or Windows compatibility.</p>

That’s fun enough, but if you move too fast you also add noise cubes to a bag, making it more and more likely that it’ll be you who wakes a sleeping dragon and suffers its wrath, adding a great element of tension to ever step. And that’s fun enough, but Catacombs ups the ante by having a modular map for maximum variety and a real feeling of exploration. All of them work well with three: two players feels like too much of a head to head, and four takes a little too long. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like the style of this game, we also recommend you check out our guide to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">best dungeon-crawler board games</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215446"><div id="215446" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">An odd but brilliant civilization game without a map, this sees you shepherding your nascent culture from its roots in the Bronze Age all the way up the technology tree to the present day. All the resource management and population pleasing you’ve come to expect from the genre is there, enlivened by a tense conveyor belt of upcoming upgrade cards that you’re always tempted to overpay for in order to snaffle them before your opponents. There are also plenty of military engagements that face off one player’s forces directly against another, and the lack of a map not only makes these fast and easy to resolve but prevents dogpiling, ensuring that it’s a great game for three, staying a well-balanced test of tactical and strategic decision making.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Star Wars: Outer Rim</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215447"><div id="215447" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars: Outer Rim</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From its weird crescent-shaped board to its striking art, you know that this is going to be a great re-creation of the Star Wars universe. Each player steps into the shoes of a galactic ne’er-do-well trying to make a name for themselves by trading, hunting and smuggling through the systems of the rim. You’ll gain skills, upgrade your ship and, likely as not, run into some famous faces from the franchise during your epic escapade to become (in)famous across the wider galaxy. It plays perfectly with three, giving you enough interaction to enrich your shared adventure, but not dragging this admittedly random and narrative-rich game past its welcome point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are interested in more from the franchise, there are actually quite a few <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games">great Star Wars board games we recommend</a> outside of this one.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="gloomhaven">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215448"><div id="215448" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Gloomhaven has really created a stir the last several years.

This fantasy adventure game has players cooperating to work through dungeons and defeat an array of enemies. Each character possesses a unique deck with a distinct playstyle.

We are fortunate that one of the most beloved board games of the past few years is set in this universe. This game has players balancing military strength with political power by building a personal deck of cards from a public market. You must also acquire resources and build alliances by placing your workers on a myriad of spaces on the board. Both of these systems combine to create a powerful game loop of improving your engine to yield greater rewards. The payout is tremendous in this nuanced game that rewards strategic play and deeper exploration. Three players works wonderfully as it creates just the right amount of competition over spaces on the board and forces you to adapt to an ever-changing landscape.

The birds come to life with over 170 beautiful illustrations alongside delightful components such as small eggs and attractive resource tokens. Each bird offers a unique ability which interfaces with the rest of your sanctuary to create an emerging combination of effects. This is a very inviting and warm game visually, but it also has some heft to it as a game, offering a satisfying strategic foundation for players to repeatedly return to. Three players is the ideal count, as it creates some healthy competition by pushing each other to thoughtfully expand your group of birds without hurting the tempo of play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information about this board game, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-review">my hands-on review of Wingspan</a> as well as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wyrmspan-board-game-review">dragon-themed Wyrmspan spin-off</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="anachrony">Anachrony</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215451"><div id="215451" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anachrony: Essential Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">An asteroid is going to hit the Earth and you have a limited amount of time to prepare to save humanity – but you want to be the one who’s in charge when the dust settles.

You can also speed up your progress by using Time Rifts to grab resources from the future so long as you pay them back before time anomalies form.

Each player is working to form the most beautiful mosaic by drafting tiles from the central market to place on their board, scoring points based on how many you can connect. Full rows, columns and sets of the same type of tile earn big bonus rewards. The beautifully detailed pieces are satisfying to play with as you slide them into place, carefully considering the best move of the moment but also what other players are likely to pick so you don’t lose points from getting stuck with tiles you can’t use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information about the game, check out my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/azul-board-game-review">hands-on review of Azul</a>.

Each session is different thanks to the variety of scoring goals, which reward points based on the relative placement of animal tokens. In one game you may try to ensure red tailed hawks are flying solo and in another that they have an unobstructed view to their potential mate. The tiles you draft not only represent where each type of animal can live but different terrain types, and building unbroken expanses of mountains, wetlands and forests can be worth just as much points at the end of the game as having the right animal patterns. Add in pinecones that can be used to mix up the token and tile pairs during drafting and you’ll have plenty to think about each turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information about this game, make sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cascadia-board-game-review">my Cascadia board game review</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="cthulhu">Cthulhu: Death May Die</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215454"><div id="215454" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cthulhu: Death May Die</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most games based on Lovecraftian horror are about preventing Elder Gods from setting foot on Earth, but it’s already too late for that in Cthulhu: Death May Die. Instead your goal is to arm yourself well enough to be able to shoot the monster in the face. There’s a high level of replayability to the cooperative game thanks to the variety of investigators players can control and the threats of the different Elder Gods and their minions, who are represented through impressively detailed miniatures. Three players gives you a nice variety of character archetypes without making the game take too long, which can happen when there are five people choosing the best way to take their actions. You still need to be careful though, since the game ends if a single investigator is eliminated before the Elder is summoned.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="waterdeep">Lords of Waterdeep</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215455"><div id="215455" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lords of Waterdeep</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Lords of Waterdeep provides an excellent introduction to the worker placement genre and is especially fun for D&amp;D players who will recognize the references to the Forgotten Realms. Players take on the roles of secret Lords of Waterdeep, each with their own strengths, and will try to establish influence over the City of Splendors by recruiting various types of adventurers to send on quests. Some quests provide powerful boosts that will make it easier for you to gain more resources throughout the game while others are worth a huge amount of points, so you’ll have to think carefully about your priorities as the rounds progress. Players can also build new locations on the map that they can use themselves and they’ll rake in rewards when a rival takes advantage of them.

There are so many ways to earn points that it’s a real challenge to figure out which is best to pursue, especially since you’re directly competing with your opponents to be the first to nab bigger rewards. You can focus on exploring new areas and fighting fearsome guardians, conduct research, try to improve your deck, or recruit assistants that will make your work easier. The game board is tailored based on the number of players so it’s as well balanced for three as it is for two or four. There’s a solo variant if you want to play alone or are looking for a good way to practice strategies.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="raiders">Raiders of the North Sea</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215457"><div id="215457" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Raiders of the North Sea</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Be a Viking with this worker placement game, where you’ll need to put together a crew and gather enough resources to successfully raid increasingly well-protected settlements. You’ll collect silver to hire crew members, who will help determine your strategy since they can give you bonuses when attacking specific targets. They can also die and become Valkyrie that will earn points you need to win. You also have to take the time to convert your plunder into offerings for the chieftain, though the amount of favor you’ve earned is kept a secret until the end of the game. Choose your actions wisely as the game can end quickly as players rush to make offerings and launch their boats deeper into the territories at the bottom of the board.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="splendor">Splendor</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215458"><div id="215458" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Splendor</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This fast game is easy enough for kids to learn but satisfying for players of all ages, making it a good <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">board game for families</a>. Compete to build a thriving jewelry business by gathering gem tokens which can be used to purchase developments and win the favor of nobles. You’ll want to try to take actions as efficiently as possible, keeping track of what resources your opponents are gathering and when they are likely to purchase a development so you don’t miss the opportunity or get stuck waiting for them to stop hoarding a key resource. You also should plan long term, looking at the bonus gems needed to attract each noble since you can only pick up one per turn and their high point values can be the difference between winning or losing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="viticulture">Viticulture</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215459"><div id="215459" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Viticulture</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve inherited an unimpressive Tuscan vineyard and you have to build it up into something to be proud of in this charming strategic game that takes place over a series of seasons. In summer you’ll deploy workers to plant vines, build structures and sell grapes, while in winter you’ll harvest crops and start aging your wines. You can develop more complex and valuable varieties based on the types of grapes you grow and how much work you’ve done in your cellar, which you can then use to fulfill orders and earn more money to make additional improvements to the vineyard. Pop open a bottle of wine and settle in to learn a bit about how it’s produced as you play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Chapter 6 Season 2, aka <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">Lawless season</a>, starts on Friday, and it's bringing us an early dose of something we thought we'd have to wait until at least the fall for: a new Grand Theft Auto. Not literally, of course. Epic is not collaborating with Rockstar Games here--they're just adding a new urban location on the map called Crime City, and we'll be spending much of our time this season stealing stuff from vaults, armored cars, and the train, and each other. Yep, sounds like GTA to me.</p><p>It's amusing timing, given that the very long awaited Grand Theft Auto 6 looks like it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">might actually come out this year</a>, a decade and two console generations since GTA 5 launched back in 2013. But even with a proper new GTA title finally peeking its head above the horizon, Epic beat them to the punch with Lawless season.</p><p>Not convinced by the comparison? Let's take a look at the season trailer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66eAN56g7D8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/66eAN56g7D8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The cinematic part at the beginning puts a heavy emphasis on breaking into vaults and stealing stuff, but it's a little different than it was in past heist seasons--in addition to the vaults that are in buildings, we've got armored security vans, and even the train will now be a moving vault you have to blow open and which is defended by turrets. In other words: we'll have some GTA Online-style missions to do in the middle of our battle royale matches.</p><p>But the big tell, for the purposes of the GTA comparison here, is the tone. While Fortnite loves its heist seasons, they've usually been a bit classier about it with more of an Ocean's 11 feel--whereas Lawless season is more grungy and down in the dirt the way GTA has always been. And because it's Fortnite, it doesn't have any problem matching GTA's irreverence--these two brands have a similar lack of respect for everything.</p><p>After last summer's controversial Wrecked season, the thought of another vehicle-focused season might be a little scary for some. But this appears to be a middle ground, meaning there appears to be a more measured increase in emphasis on vehicles this time--there's no sign of upgrades or mounted weapons for the vehicles, for one thing, so you'll have to stick your head out the window and shoot your guns as usual. That said, I actually thought Wrecked season was delightful, so you wouldn't hear me complain about a potential new focus on cars anyway.</p><p>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 kicks off on Friday, February 21, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">we've got a rundown of everything we know so far about the new season right here.</a></p>
