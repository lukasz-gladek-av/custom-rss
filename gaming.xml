		<p>Nintendo has finally confirmed the release day for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, the musou spin-off set to launch on 6th November 2025 for Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JL3PnM_s-Vk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will follow the narrative of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which saw Zelda transported back in time to the distant past and the formation of Hyrule and the Imprisoning War.</p>
<p>The new trailer showcases how you can use the Zonai contraptions in combat, as well as combo team-ups with other characters. </p>
<p>The last game in this spin-off series, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, told a prequel story to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, depicting the grand battle to try (and fail) to save Hyrule from the rising evil forces. When the main Zelda series has always been about delving into dungeons and defeating bosses one-by-one, it’s a great change of pace to see the huge wars between the massed forces of good and evil.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/18/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review/">our review of that last game</a>, we said, “Age of Calamity is, for all intents and purposes, a prequel to Breath of the Wild. It might be a spin-off in a separate genre, but it’s clearly a labour of love, and the result is a thoroughly enjoyable romp through one of the most interesting periods of Hyrule. If the first game was a love letter to the Zelda series, this not only improves on this concept in every way, but stands as one of the best Zelda games, period.”</p>

		<p>Nintendo have announced a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/yoshi/">Yoshi</a> game aimed at the younger market, Yoshi and the Mysterious Book. The plot finds Yoshi jumping inside the pages of a book that has fallen from the sky, and he investigates the creatures he finds within.</p>
<p>The creatures interact with the landscapes, such as helping flowers to bloom, and you can also find other things to do, for example, Dandelions can absorb nutrients and used to break rocks. Anything you discover will be written back into the pages of the book.</p>

		<p>Nintendo shared a new trailer for Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, digging into the relaxed, seaside town gameplay for the esoteric life sim. In its own inimitable way, the launch window was confirmed for Spring 2026, and is coming to Switch 2. </p>
<p><iframe title="Tomodachi Life Living the Dream Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6uYvj3xvFB0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer showed how you can create and customise the Mii characters that will populate your island, who will then simply go and chill out in this idyllic seaside town. You’ll then have to cater to their needs, such as sating their hunger pangs by handing them a lettuce or something. If characters are bored, you can pick them up and introduce them to other inhabitants of the island, making them into acquaintances and eventually, you’d hope, friends.</p>
<p>After the original game on DS, Tomodachi Life was an off-beat hit for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013. There were other Mii-based spin-offs like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/miitomo">Miitomo</a> on mobile and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/miitopia">Miitopia</a>, but the main Tomodachi Life experience is now being revived after well over a decade.<sup id="cite_ref-65"></sup></p>

		<p>The next Mario Tennis game has been revealed with Mario Tennis Fever arriving on 12th Febrary 2026 exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Tennis Fever Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_KqyXamkgI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game brings some new tweaks to the Mario Tennis formula with enhanced movement coming from the ability to slide to reach trickier incoming balls. </p>
<p>Much more impactful, though, will be the special Power Rackets and the Fever Shots that they enable –&nbsp;things like the mini mushroom racket spawning miniaturising mushrooms for your opponents, and the shadow racket creating a ghostly duplicate of your character.</p>
<p>There will be 30 power rackets that can be combined with the 38 playable characters in the game’s roster. </p>

<p>You can take all of these to a whole host of gameplay modes, including the Trial Towers and the Mix It Up mode, the latter of which will add some unexpected rules and modifiers including some Wonder effects inspired by Super Mario Wonder.</p>
<p>Turning to the online, there will be both casual online rooms and ranked matches, while the more casual amongst you might like the motion controlled Swing Mode. </p>
<p>And then there’s the Adventure mode, which sees Mario, Luigi and chums all turned into babies. Now running around without your previous tennis abiliites, you’ll have to learn and train them all up again through the journey.</p>

<p>Fair dinkum</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/watch-nintendo-direct-september-2025-live">today's Nintendo Direct</a>, publisher Krafton is bringing developer James Bendon's <strong>Dinkum</strong> to Switch on <strong>9th November</strong>. There's a demo coming on the Switch eShop later today.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of it (or if the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-life-sims-and-farming-games">enormous crop of cosy farm-sim-style games</a> has you confused - which would be understandable!), Dinkum is set on an Australian outback-style island and sees you farming, building, foraging, hunting sharks — you know, all the usual cosy life-sim shenanigans — as you fight to thrive in cute, slightly polygonal environments filled with plant and animal life.</p>
<p>It opened in Early Access back in 2022 on Steam, getting its full release in April this year and garnering over 14,000 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062520/Dinkum/">"Very Positive" reviews</a>. Solo dev Bendon says the game — which is being ported to Switch by 5minlab — has "been the most requested console from players who have been waiting a long time to play Dinkum."</p>
<p>Beyond an "exclusive in-game Battlegrounds costume," content will be available across both PC and Switch, although the update timings may vary per platform.</p>

<p>The game's already sold more than 1.4 million PC copies, apparently, so its Aussie-flavoured offering of 25-minute days, island customisation, and cosy-sim online multiplayer must be doing something right.</p>
<p>The bar is high on Switch when it comes to island customisation and cosy-sim online multiplayer, though, with the spectre of the massively popular <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> lingering on years after its pandemic-fuelled world takeover. Whether Dinkum can compete is a question for which we'll have to wait until November for an answer.</p>
<p>In the meantime, check out the trailer at the top of the page if any of this sounds up your street.</p></section></article><div><p>Gavin first wrote for Nintendo Life in 2018 before joining the site full-time the following year, rising through the ranks to become Editor.

<p>Nintendo has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> will launch for Nintendo Switch 2 on 12th February 2026.</p>
<p>The game, which you can check out in the trailer above, looks like it's taking Mario Tennis back to its glory days, packed full of features, modes, and even an adventure for the cute characters involved to work through!</p>
<p>We'll have more info on this one as it comes in, but a new tennis game from the Mushroom kingdom is always a good time, and with brand new Fever Racket mechanics, a roster of 38 (!) characters, tournament and trial modes, motion controls and online play...we're fairly excited already!</p>

<p>Available for Switch 1 &amp; Switch 2!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Square Enix has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> digital pre-orders are now live on the Nintendo eShop for both Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Octopath Traveler 0, as you'll doubtless be aware, takes the series back in time for a new story that features a fully-customisable protagonist, larger party sizes, town-building and, of course, the good old turned-based scraps and high drama we all show up for in the first place.</p>
<p>The game is available in both standard and deluxe editions on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/OCTOPATH-TRAVELER-0-2914713.html#Overview">eShop</a>, with the standard coming in at £49.99/$49.99 whilst that fancier version will set you back £54.99/$59.99 (or whatever that equates to where you are). The digital deluxe version nets you the game and the following extras for your coin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>■ Contents of the Digital Deluxe Version</p>
<p>1. OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 Base Game<br>
2. Deluxe Travel Provisions</p>
<p>▼ Action Skills<br>
- Triple Strike Mastery<br>
- SP Saver Mastery<br>
- Extra JP Mastery</p>
<p>▼ Consumable Items: 8 Types of Nuts (M)<br>
- Fortifying Nut (M)<br>
- Magic Nut (M)<br>
- Tough Nut (M)<br>
- Resistant Nut (M)<br>
- Light Nut (M)<br>
- Critical Nut (M)<br>
- Sharp Nut (M)<br>
- Slippery Nut (M)</p>
<p>▼ Town Decorations: Festive Decoration Designs<br>
- Table with Roasted Chicken<br>
- Festive Arch<br>
- Large Festive Arch<br>
- Festive Flag<br>
- Grand Vase</p>
<p>3. Digital Art Book</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/OCTOPATH-TRAVELER-0-2914713.html#Overview">game's eShop page</a>, there's also confirmation that Switch 1 and Switch 2 save info is transferable, so that's great news! However, it also confirms that there's no upgrade path available between both versions.</p>
<p>On Switch, Octopath Traveler 0, as noted over on the <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/octopathtraveler0/">game's official website</a>, will run at 720p and up to 30fps, whilst Switch 2 players get 1080p/60fps. So, make sure you get the version you know you're gonna stick with.</p>
<p>Here's a selection of images from the eShop page to compare and contrast Switch 1 and 2. It's not too hard to see the drop in resolution, but otherwise both versions are looking tasty!</p>

			<p>After some time in Early Access on Steam, Hades II launches later this month on PC and Nintendo Switch systems.</p>



<p>As confirmed during today's Nintendo Direct, the highly anticipated second entry in the series will launch on September 25 on PC, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2. Going by how the first entry in the series eventually made its way to PlayStation and Xbox systems, it's unlikely Hades II will remain <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/">a Switch console exclusive </a>for long.</p>



<p>Besides announcing the game's release, today's Nintendo Direct also provided a new trailer that provides a solid overview of what Supergiant Games' roguelike offers. The trailer also provides some details on the Nintendo Switch 2 version, which will support 120 FPS gameplay at 1080p resolution in docked mode. You can check out this new trailer below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><em>The first-ever sequel from Supergiant Games builds on the best aspects of the original&nbsp;god-like&nbsp;rogue-like dungeon crawler in an all-new, action-packed, endlessly replayable experience rooted in the Underworld of Greek myth and its deep connections to the dawn of witchcraft.</em></p>



<p>Hades II launches on PC, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on September 25 worldwide. You can learn more about the excellent first entry in the series in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-damned-great/">review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-could-be-super-mario-galaxy-nintendo-universal/">predicted yesterday</a>, Nintendo has indeed debuted the first teaser for the sequel to the Super Mario Bros. Movie at today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">Nintendo Direct</a>, by announcing The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, set to premiere in April 2026.</p>



<p>The news was one of the opening announcements for the Direct, with Shigeru Miyamoto kicking things off with the 40th anniversary of the original Super Mario Bros launching in Japan. A short teaser took players through the Mushroom Kingdom, up to Peach's Castle, and then into the sky to reveal the title.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Super Mario Galaxy Movie | Official Title Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c1mTbYB6EOM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Following the title's debut, Miyamoto passed the buck to Illumination chief executive officer and founder Chris Meledandri, who confirmed that the cast from the first Super Mario Bros. movie is returning, including Chris Pratt as Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Kevin Michael Richardson as Kamek. </p>



<p>There were no other casting reveals or character reveals, so we'll just have to wait until closer to the film's premiere to see what's new in the film. What Meledandri did reveal is that the Super Mario Galaxy games are the movie's main inspiration for its story.</p>



<p>The film is still due to arrive in April 2026 as was previously announced, though, curiously, Nintendo did not list the previously confirmed April 2, 2026 date, which could mean that the film's premiere date has been slightly altered.</p>

            <p>"What does flirting actually look like?" is one of several, quintessentially Friday-afternoon questions raised by the latest development footage for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paralives">Paralives</a>, the upcoming life sim with its heart set on stealing yours away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>. 
</p>
<p>We last covered Paralives in October last year, when the devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paralives-heats-up-the-race-to-be-the-next-sims-with-early-access-release-in-2025-confirms-no-paid-dlc">confirmed an early access release in 2025</a>. That early access launch, 8th December, is fast approaching, so it's high time we treated this would-be Maxis-feller to some fresh scrutiny. If only to stop ourselves thinking about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-4-adventure-awaits-first-gameplay-trailer-presents-an-ethically-concerning-look-at-imaginary-friends">The Sims 4's harrowing suite of imaginary friends</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>So: what does flirting actually look like? Paralives thinks it looks like smiling and making eye contact and maybe leaning in a bit closer than you otherwise would. Maybe fluttering your hands around in a delicately come-hither way. Witness the simmering emotions in the below development video, just published on the developer's site. All the animations are created with reference to the moderately context-sensitive <a href="https://www.paralives.com/news/together-card-variants">Together Cards</a> you'll play to direct conversations.

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBfTLcFC1No" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>As in most other departments, The Sims prefers to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfI9GrYJEQc">play things slapstick</a>. I myself adhere to the Mr Darcy/Kaguya-sama approach to flirting, which consists of looking steadily at a ceiling corner while making no sudden movements. You know, kind of like how you'd defuse an argument with a bear. If it's really going well, I'll storm out of the room and stop speaking to that person for months. Believe it or not, this method has worked at least once.
</p><p>The video also includes some animations for how Parafolks, as they're called, talk to children. The devs are currently working on bespoke animations for kids, looking at what they can carry over from the adults, and what needs to be "made from scratch". This aside makes me wonder after the possibility of a life sim in which kids pick up body language from parental figures. Similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg6uPROvkH4">this scene in The Invincibles</a>.
</p>
<p>Alice Bee (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-5-reveal-has-only-made-me-more-excited-for-paralives">compared Paralives favourably to what we then knew of The Sims 5</a> in 2022. I like the looks of it rather more than I do this year's other big Sims competitor - burbanite frightfest InZOI, which Jay Castello <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inzoi-early-access-review">summarised in our early access review</a> as "an endless series of vapid, corporate-feeling interactions that never lend themselves to interesting storytelling". Paralives is a smalltown affair, and much less glossy - check out <a href="https://www.paralives.com/news/check-out-the-town-plazas-newest-building-market-antiques-">this antique shop</a>, for example.
</p>
<p>I do worry it might be wholesome to a fault, though. The game's Steam page blurb is bracingly unromantic: "You live and then you die. But at least do it in a nice house!" The action in-game, however, feels very feelgoody-two-shoes, notwithstanding the obligatory option to shut your characters in doorless rooms.</p>
<p>The Sims has been a success partly because it has quite a pronounced nasty streak born of understanding the sociopathic tendencies of certain players - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> has whole expansion packs <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/life-and-death-expansion-pack">dedicated to death</a>. I'd like to see some of that energy in Paralives, and a little less parafolksiness. At the very least, they could let me romance people by giving no outward impression that I am conscious they exist.</p><p>This being an article about life sims, I will spare a thought for the cancelled Life By You and its shuttered creators, Paradox Tectonic. The game's former publishers Paradox Interactive are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-still-want-to-make-a-sims-competitor-after-life-by-you-but-we-need-to-start-smaller">still interested in making a Sims competitor</a>, but have said they need to "start smaller" next time.</p>

              <p>During today’s Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book.&nbsp;</em>The cute-looking adventure is set to arrive on Switch exclusively next year.</p> <p>On September 12, during an extra-long Nintendo Direct, there was a whole section dedicated to the 40th anniversary of Mario. (Well, <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, at least.) And for some reason, the big new game announced during this part of the show was a new Yoshi game. Seems rude.</p> <p><em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book </em>is set to hop over to Switch 2 in Spring 2026. Here’s the trailer.</p>  <p><em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book </em>is an adorable-looking 2D platformer that features Yoshi trying to help a magical book. That book, named Mr. E, is filled with all sorts of secrets and knowledge, but he can’t see it himself, as his eyes are on his cover. Sounds like a nightmare existence to me.</p> <p>Anyway, Yoshi has to hop into the different stories and pages to help. This apparently involves fishing and looking super duper cute in stop-motion-like gameplay. Yoshi also has to help a flower-like creature that rides on the green hero’s back and helps him solve puzzles and interact with the worlds he hops into. For example, Yoshi can touch flowers and make them bloom while the odd creature is on his back. Not quite as cool as “<em>touch fuzzy get dizzy</em>,” but I’ll take it, I guess.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-tennis-fever/" data-ref-id="5000-694771">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, a new installment in the sports series coming exclusively to Switch 2. Announced at today's Nintendo Direct, the game is set to launch February 12, 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">The big new feature for Mario Tennis Fever is found in the name--Fever rackets. These special rackets have a Fever gauge that can be built up to "unleash a Fever shot," like blasting the court with fire or ice. Another example is the Mini Mushroom racket, which will litter your opponent's side of the court with the item that can shrink them down. Nintendo noted that there are 30 Fever rackets in all, each with a special ability.</p><p dir="ltr">Mario Tennis Fever will also offer 38 playable characters--the most ever for the franchise, according to Nintendo. Most of the familiar faces are here, such as Yoshi and Donkey Kong, and Nintendo didn't seem to showcase any new characters in the game's first trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">There will be an Adventure mode for Mario Tennis Fever, as Mario and company are turned into babies. That means they will need to relearn how to play tennis through an overworld, minigames, and boss battles. Other modes detailed by Nintendo include Tournament, Trial Towers, Mix It Up, Online Room, and Online Ranked.</p><p dir="ltr">The last game in the sports series was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-tennis-aces/" data-ref-id="5000-477088">Mario Tennis Aces</a>, which was released on Switch in 2018. The franchise began in 2000 with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-tennis/" data-ref-id="5000-2715">Mario Tennis</a> on Nintendo 64.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> now has a release date, following its previously stated "winter" launch window.
</p>
<p>
As revealed at today's Nintendo Direct, the game will release on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> on November 6.
</p>
<p>
This latest in the Warriors spin-off series acts as a prequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, focusing on Zelda's story. Check out some fresh gameplay in the video below. The trailer goes into detail about Sync strikes (special moves used with two allies) and how Zonai devices can be used to modify the flow of battle. You will also be able to play with two players across two devices, even if only one person owns the game. Thanks Nintendo!

<p>
Age of Imprisonment follows Age of Calamity, which similarly acted as a prequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>.
</p>
<p>
Both games were preceded by Hyrule Warriors on Wii U (later ported to Switch), developed as a collaboration between Koei Tecmo and Nintendo.
</p>
<p>
Gameplay follows that of Koei's Dynasty Warriors games, known for their large-scale battles and hordes of enemies to defeat.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-is-getting-a-hyrule-warriors-sequel">Age of Imprisonment was first revealed</a> at the Switch 2 Direct in April.
