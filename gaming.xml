            <p>The <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home/disabled">Stop Destroying Videogames citizens' initiative</a>, the petition asking EU lawmakers to look into the issue of publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when official support runs its course</a>, hit its deadline at the end of last month looking like it'd amassed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake">more than enough signatures</a>. With that phase over, the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign that's vocally supported efforts like this is left to await the outcomes, whatever they might be.</p>
<p>That's given YouTuber Ross Scott, who's become the loudest voice publicising this worldwide push for action on consumer rights when it comes to these sorts of server shutdowns, a chance to take stock of how things have gone to this point. He's keen to take a break, but will first have to see how things pan out with the multiple irons Stop Killing Games and their adjacent groups have in the fire.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Since the signing period is over, we're entering a phase where things like counter lobbying and political connections are most important," Scott said in a 'wrap up' video posted to his channel Accursed Farms. "Frankly, that is not my department. I know nothing about that, though some political insiders do, and they're advising the official organizers [of the EU petition]. I'm not even aware of all their plans."</p>
<p>So, that means "a whole lot of the campaign now involves waiting", though Scott did still encourage those who're keen to support it to carry on doing things like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/european-parliament-vice-president-throws-his-support-behind-stop-killing-games-campaign">contacting MEPs about the issue</a>, or helping the initiative's organisers get in contact with EU admin staff if they can.</p>
<p>Looking back on the campaign's efforts and general strategy to this point, Scott reckons those behind it have done well in terms of having "maximized our chances to push back against the issue of games being destroyed on almost every front". While he acknowledged that the group's efforts in a number of countries, such as the USA and Brazil, having hit brick walls in some form or another, Scott said he believes the campaign's "done about as well as is humanly possible given the landscape."</p>

<p>"I think France, Germany, Australia, and the EU as a whole are the heavyweights in this," the YouTuber reasoned, with measures in these places all currently waiting action or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/campaign-asking-eu-to-stop-publishers-destroying-online-games-hit-by-anonymous-transparency-complaint">responses from the bodies</a> they're directed at. "As long as we get a major market prohibiting game destruction, I think we'll largely win this globally...I don't see lots of new stuff on the horizon later. I think we either win on at least one of these or if they all fail, then it's over."</p>
<p>With things now at that stage, Scott's aiming to soon take a "standby break" from his volunteering to help promote this cause, only popping up if something happens with the campaign that he thinks would benefit from his intervention.</p>
<p>"I know a lot of people found out about Stop Killing Games just recently, but I've been going at it hard for over a year and a half now, and I wasn't exactly well rested prior to that," the YouTuber said, adding that he ironically hasn't "had time to play a game for close to a couple months now". Here's hoping he is able to take that proper break, while we all wait to see what the outcomes of these bits of action are.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-stop-killing-games-supported-eu-petition-now-closed-the-campaigns-loudest-voice-reckons-its-done-about-as-well-as-is-humanly-possible]]></content:encoded>

              <p>It‚Äôs a rule of the universe that if you release a successful indie game, there will almost immediately be crappy mobile knock-offs and a version built in&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>. That‚Äôs as true as ever for&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>, the adorable co-op climbing game about scaling a mountain with your friends (<a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-cannibalism-patch-notes-bug-fixes-steam-1851787299">and sometimes eating them</a>), with a <em>Roblox</em> rip-off called&nbsp;<em>Cliff</em>. And&nbsp;<em>Peak</em> developers Aggro Crab are clearly not impressed.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-steam-reviews-lethal-company-aggro-crab-1851786254"><em>Peak</em></a> came out on June 16, and has quickly gone on to be a summer smash. From the developers of 2024‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/another-crabs-treasure-review-1851435745"><em>Another Crab‚Äôs Treasure</em></a>, the indie co-op climbing sim has become massive, peaking at almost 115,000 simultaneous players, and still has 20,000 people playing right now. It‚Äôs been a splendid and well-deserved success. So of course, there are knock-offs. But my goodness,&nbsp;<em>Cliff</em>‚Äòs is beyond blatant. And Aggro Crab aren‚Äôt delighted about the situation.</p> <p>‚Äútbh would rather you pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled @Roblox slop ripoff,‚Äù says a post from Aggro Crab‚Äôs official X account, spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/peak/roblox-ripoff"><em>PCGN</em></a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">tbh would rather you pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled <a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Roblox</a> slop ripoff <a href="https://t.co/ulRShLLGz2">pic.twitter.com/ulRShLLGz2</a></p> <p>‚Äî AGGRO CRAB üí• (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1952475157433549083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Cliff</em>, by a developer called PewStudio, is the most obvious copy of <em>Peak</em>. Except of course it instead looks really crap because it‚Äôs made in <em>Roblox</em>. To demonstrate this isn‚Äôt hyperbole, here are a couple of comparisons. This is <em>Cliff</em> in <em>Roblox</em>:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614672" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614672"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614672">¬©Roblox</figcaption></figure> <p>And this is <em>Peak</em>:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614673" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614673"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614673">¬©Aggro Crab</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Cliff</em>:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614674" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614674"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614674">¬©Roblox</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Peak</em>:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614675" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614675"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614675">¬©Aggrocrab</figcaption></figure> <p>It‚Äôs not exactly subtle. The same goes for how the games play, the floating hands for climbing, the plane crash start with the suitcases on the beach, pretty much everything. Except that in&nbsp;<em>Cliff</em>, everything costs money. From the airport at the start to the suitcases on the beach, the&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> rip-off wants you spending your Robux as often as possible, because of course it does.</p> <p>Of course, Aggro Crab would prefer you just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">paid for your copy of&nbsp;<em>Peak</em></a>, not least since it‚Äôs only $8 in the first place. But seeing their creativity reduced to a cash-in knock-off must be incredibly galling, not least when people could be playing the far superior game for a low up-front fee, and never have to spend another cent.</p> <p>Oh, and really, <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">no one should be going anywhere near&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> in the first place.</a></p>

                <p>Since its debut near the end of March, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grow-a-garden/" data-ref-id="5000-681260">Grow a Garden</a> has been a breakout hit on the Roblox platform. Now, players will be able to cook the vegetables they grow and earn rewards in the game's latest update.    </p><p>The new update revolves around Chris P, a literal pig who has his own kitchen. Chris P's thought balloon reveals what he's craving at any particular moment, from candy to pizza. And if players are able to satisfy Chris P's cravings, then they'll be able to get an assortment of new seeds, new gear, and new in-game pets.</p><p>Some of the new seeds added to the game include onions, jalapenos, crown melon, and tacofern. Grow a Garden has also revamped its trading capabilities. Previously, some players were allowed to essentially rob their trading partners by disconnecting before coming through with their end of the bargain. Now, players need to get a trade ticket from the gear shop in order to complete a transaction.</p><p>Earlier this summer, Grow a Garden reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-roblox-game-is-blowing-up-in-popularity/1100-6531728/" data-ref-id="1100-6531728">5 million concurrent players</a>, before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-single-roblox-game-has-toppled-pubgs-all-time-concurrent-player-record/1100-6532006/" data-ref-id="1100-6532006">hitting nearly 12 million concurrent players</a> in July. The game was created by a teenage Roblox user who has yet to come forward publicly. However, production of the game and its updates is currently being handled by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a studio called Splitting Point</a>.</p><p>Grow a Garden's success is the best example yet of The Roblox Corporation's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-lays-out-grand-plans-to-transform-the-platform/1100-6526340/" data-ref-id="1100-6526340">grand plans for the platform</a>. As laid out at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/" data-ref-id="5005-152">Roblox</a> Developers Conference in 2024, the company unveiled a new revenue-sharing plan for developers who create premium experiences using Roblox's game creation tools. So far, Grow a Garden is easily the most popular fan-made experience on Roblox. </p>

Lots of players are getting ahead of the game and setting their options, taking 30 minutes or so to edit user interface colors and weapon Field of View, for example.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are just using it to share their excitement with friends. ‚ÄúI have 6.4 hours in the beta total so far,‚Äù <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mhx7pe/a_lot_of_people_just_sitting_in_the_preload_menu/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor gruggers1</a>. ‚ÄúI literally just sat in the lobby and chatted with friends in the in game voice chat.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are reporting having to spend time getting around EA‚Äôs frustrating restrictions on PC launch.

From EA‚Äôs perspective, it suggests there‚Äôs significant interest in the game. EA has said it‚Äôs all-in on Battlefield 6, so there‚Äôs significant pressure on it to perform.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>When you get down to it, a lot of people would probably quite like to be a racoon that can ride a BMX bike, but what about being a BMX-riding racoon that‚Äôs also in consistent employment? That‚Äôs the dream Tanuki Pon‚Äôs Summer sells you, giving you control of a furry little chap and his bicycle as he attempts to deliver everyone‚Äôs mail, while pulling off a sick trick or two. It‚Äôs cute, cuddly and quite silly, and it‚Äôs undoubtedly utterly charming too.</p>
<p><iframe title="TANUKI: Pon's Summer ‚Äî New Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTBIgHgJpHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pon, your tanuki hero, is lazing about on a bench at the start of the game, and it‚Äôs only the voice of the narrator ‚Äì or is it his conscience? ‚Äì that gets him moving, nabbing his BMX and setting off down the road. You find a bunch of the different elements that you‚Äôre going to experience down this country path, from Torii Gates that act as waypoints or finishing lines, obstacles to bunny hop over, and, most excitingly, different places to pull off tricks.</p>


<p>There is, in fact, a handy skate park thrown into your journey back to civilisation, and here you find that your raccoon is a furry little Dave Mirra, chucking out a tail flip or Superman with ease. Just like your favourite gaming extreme sports heroes, you can chain these moves together for higher scores, though you do, of course, have to nail the landing. It‚Äôs possible to chuck yourself off your bike, and you‚Äôll have to run over and grab it if that happens. Which it undoubtedly will.</p>


<p>Pon has to spend the summer earning money in order to decorate and repair the local Tanuki Shrine, which sits at the centre of the island, all leading up to the Matsuri Festival which happens every 50 years. Pon doesn‚Äôt necessarily seem like the ideal candidate ‚Äì he‚Äôd much rather spend his time sleeping or grinding rails ‚Äì but he sets to work, nonetheless, becoming the island‚Äôs delivery boy, working for the Post Office to raise the cash.</p>
<p>Our hands-on covered Pon‚Äôs first week on the job, working his way through the first town, which presumably means that there‚Äôs multiple towns that will need your delivery services.</p>
<p>The first step is to pick up the packages. This is a game in itself, as the packages arrive in all sorts of different shapes, and you have to fit them neatly into your bag, packing the Tetris-like shapes together in the most sensible way.</p>
<p>Once you‚Äôve stacked the packages into the basket on your bike, it‚Äôs off to work, but this isn‚Äôt really the kind of behaviour you‚Äôd expect from a FedEx employee. While you have to ride around finding the recipients, there‚Äôs a stack of Letter Quests to work your way through, from collecting all the TANUKI letters, to backflipping over the statue in the centre of town. I‚Äôd quite like to see our local Amazon delivery guys spicing things up by pulling off BMX tricks, but they‚Äôd probably break all the air fryers in the process, so best to leave it to the raccoons.</p>

<p>Tanuki Pon‚Äôs Summer is cute. It has an adorable aesthetic, with a colourful Japanese countryside setting, and chunky architecture that really brings the island to life. I love the characters here though, from the podgy Pon, with his cute walk and oversized Post Office hat, to the exceedingly loud Bunta and kind Fumi, the workers at the Post Office, and Tetsuo, the former sumo wrestler who longs for the old days.</p>
<p>Tetsuo convinces you to train in sumo, and that opens up another diversion, becoming the first tanuki to fight in sumo. Here, you stomp to charge up your stamina for the fight, use hand slaps to push the opponent back quickly, dodging at the right time to keep up your momentum, and big belly smashes to force them out of the ring. It‚Äôs another great little aside, that keeps you guessing as to where Tanuki Pon‚Äôs Summer might take you.</p>
<p>You get an insight into the recipient‚Äôs interests and mindset, chatting with them while dropping off their package, or being drawn into an unexpected activity, and it gives Pon‚Äôs world a grounding and reality that you probably shouldn‚Äôt get from one with a tanuki on a bicycle. It‚Äôs all thoroughly charming, and I can see why Microsoft chose to highlight it in their upcoming indie schedule. Breezing about the town, performing tricks while racing between different deliveries just feels like a lot of fun.</p>

<p>At the moment, the only downside is your compass becoming immediately filled with package notifications, and there‚Äôs currently no way to pop down a pin or marker on the map to help you stay focused on that particular one.</p>
<p>Tanuki Pon‚Äôs Summer is a cute and charming indie adventure, where deliveries, diversions and BMX tricks lie around every corner. We can‚Äôt wait to see more when it reaches final release for PC, Switch, and the Xbox family of consoles later this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-vi-may-launch-at-100-but-it-will-still-be-massively-profitable-analyst-predicts.1262184/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI may break records in the gaming industry not only in terms of profits, but also in terms of price tags, as a known analyst believes the game will cost more than any other title on the market.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/03/grand-theft-auto-online-safety-laws/">The Telegraph</a>, Wedbush Securities' Michael Patcher, known for making some bold predictions in the past, said that he expects a high price, $100, for the new entry in the series by Rockstar Games at launch, which would make it the first video game to be sold at such a high price, not counting special or limited editions. Still, no matter the price point, Patcher expects the game to be immensely profitable, likely generating $10 billion in lifetime and $500 million annually from <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-age-verification/">GTA Online</a>. Commenting on the game's budget, Patcher's estimates are more in line with what we have heard from other analysts, placing them in the $1.5 billion range, also including marketing costs.</p>



<p>Although predictions may vary, the consensus among analysts is that Grand Theft Auto VI is going to be one of the biggest video game releases of all time, if not the biggest.<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-7-billion-revenue-60-days/"> Last month</a>, Konvoy's Managing Partner Josh Chapman confirmed the firm's prediction that the game will generate $7.6 billion in revenue in the first two months of availability, with Take-Two recouping a potential $2 billion investment within a month from release. Even by other metrics, such as number of copies sold, player count, and viewership, the new entry in the series is expected to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">record-shattering release. </a></p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26, 2026,</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. A PC version has yet to be confirmed, but going from past Rockstar Games titles' launches, we should expect the game to make its debut on the platform sometime in 2027.</p>

<figure><a title="Sonic Timberlands" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4a1224762b865/sonic-timberlands.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/these-sonic-the-hedgehog-crocs-are-kinda-horrific-and-theyre-out-now">collaborating on a pair of Crocs</a> back in 2023, SEGA is continuing its streak of 'Footwear That Would Be Inappropriate For Sonic The Hedgehog' with a new pair of Sonic-inspired Timberland kicks.</p>
<p>Let's manage those expectations right from the jump. It's unlikely that most of us will ever get our hands on a pair of these bad boys. The collab is in celebration of the upcoming grand opening of SEGA's flagship store in Japan, and will <em>only</em> be available at the nearby Shibuya PARCO Timberland store from 9th August.</p>
<p>Now that we know we're never going to see the range in the flesh, let's collectively cry over how cool it all looks. The highlight item is, of course, a pair of Timbs, which takes the classic "yellow" boot design and throws in some sneaky Sonic nods for good measure. There's a small picture of the blue blur himself etched onto the outer material, the Sonic the Hedgehog icon adorns the inner side, and get a look at those laces!</p>

<p>According to the collaboration announcement on the <a href="https://www.timberland.co.jp/news-250805_sega.html">Japanese Timberland website</a>, the boots will set you back ¬•38,500 (roughly ¬£196 / $261) and there are <em>apparently</em> only 30 pairs available. Yep, we're sure people will behave totally normally in the queues for these...</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are some other items in the range besides the boots. The collaboration also introduces two long- and short-sleeve t-shirts, available in black or white. Both tops sport the rather snazzy collab icon of Sonic in his Timbs, with the brand logos on the sleeve/chest.</p>

<p>And just to rub it in even more, anyone lucky enough to pick up an item in the range will <em>also</em> land an exclusive postcard and sticker of the boot-wearing hedgehog. Damn, we're suckers for a good sticker...</p>
<p>As we say, it's unlikely that we'll ever see much of the range in person thanks to the ol' Japanese exclusivity, but who knows, perhaps it'll be so popular that it gets a bigger release in the future. We doubt it, but let us dream!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s open beta kicks off later this week, and EA have now painted a picture of what you can expect maps/modes-wise, as well as in terms of the changes the devs have made based on Battlefield Labs playtest feedback.</p>
<p>Plus, there's a new trailer that features yet more folks in camo running about amid booms. I'm glad to report that no helicopters, at least at a glance, look to have been harmed in the run up to this one.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As detailed in Battlefield 6's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">multiplayer reveal last week</a>, the open beta will mainly run across two weekend-ish windows, August 9th-10th and August 14th -17th. Because big video game in 2025, there'll also be open beta early access running from August 7th into the first weekend, limited to folks who've subscribed to EA Play Pro or registered for Battlefield Labs before July 31st.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/everything-you-need-to-know-for-the-open-beta">the first weekend</a>, you'll be able to jump into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">three different maps and three different game modes</a>. Siege of Cairo will offer urban battles likely involving much crouch-walking, Liberation Peak takes you to the countryside of Tajikistan's mountains for what sounds like more open action with jet and chopper dogfight potential, and Iberian Offensive takes you back to tight streets, but this time in Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The three modes for that opening weekend are conquest, breakthrough, and closed weapons breakthrough. For weekend two, the Empire State map will be wheeled out so infantryfolks can thoroughly wreck Brooklyn, with rush and squad deathmatch also arriving to make it five modes in total.</p>
<p>Lest you think EA haven't taken anything on board from those who've already dived into the game's Battlefield Labs testing, the publishers have put out a full Tweeter essay outlining how that feedback's shaped changes for the beta and beyond. For this open play specifically, they want you to give a closed weapon conquest playlist a go as part of plans to let folks "choose between closed and open weapon modes", while maps like Siege of Cairo have had several aspects revamped with an eye to ensuring the flow of murder-deathing and balance of battles is closer to the ideal.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>The sorts of Time-to-Kill and Time-to-Death debates that'll still be going on around multiplayer shooters in the year 5025 have led EA to balance damage "across the weapon pool". The weapon customisation menus have also been made more clear, and signature weapons have been introduced. The latter means, for example, recon classers will get extra advantages with the sniper rifles that I assume they'll be using to 360 no-scope fools from across the map.</p>
<p>More in-depth changes for all four of the game's main classes - assault, engineer, support, and recon - are already planned and detailed in the essay, but won't be coming in until after this open beta's concluded. That means you'll have to hop into more Labs testing if you want to try something closer to the "final adaptation" of the class system <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-pc-specs-dont-look-too-lofty-despite-all-the-booms-and-steam-players-wont-need-the-pesky-ea-app">ahead of release</a>.</p>
<p>Once the open beta's done, EA'll be putting out "an overview of further changes we‚Äôre making on the road towards launch", because the tweakage can never stop.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-maps-and-modes-shared-as-ea-write-an-essay-about-tweaks-based-on-labs-feedback]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Are you the sort of player that would rather drop a game altogether than simply bump the difficulty down (if such an option exists?) If so, then you might be in better company than you think - at least that's what the developer of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-first-berserker-khazan">The First Berserker: Khazan</a> has deduced from poring over its player data, anyway.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2680010/view/543360749096928012?l=english">In an update on Steam</a>, Neople revealed some interesting information about the behaviour of players that picked up its hardcore action role-playing game since its release in March 2025.</p>

<p>As part of the game's big June update, Junho Lee (Khazan's creative director) posted a big rundown of the thinking behind the game's difficulty rework that explained the reasons for adding a 'Beginner' mode to the game. Whilst the update is a couple of weeks old now, I've seen the statement doing the rounds in dev Discords and message boards this morning, and thought it was worth bringing to attention more broadly.</p>
<p>"At launch, we set our intended standard experience as 'Normal' and added a more accessible option labeled 'Easy'," wrote Lee. "We figured that if players found the game too difficult, they'd simply switch to Easy. But when we looked at the data, we saw that many players just quit the game without ever changing the difficulty."</p>
<p>Per Lee and the team's research, there was a simple reason for this: he believes players feel like "[they'd] rather quit with dignity than drop it down to Easy."</p>
<p>It's a fascinating study of player psychology. Just look towards something like Bloodborne or Sekiro - games that launched without a second difficulty mode - and the fervent conversation that kicks up every single time someone suggests slapping an 'Easy' mode in those games. People get very defensive about their ability to master difficult games like these, and see it as a mark of pride that they can take on the (in some cases) extreme challenge that comes with the action-RPG genre. Just think back to the discourse around <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fromsoftware/comments/1fep4zc/radahn_is_actually_a_great_boss_after_this_patch/">beating 'pre-patch Radahn'</a> in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, for example.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Did the game's difficulty drive you Berserk? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Neople / Nexon</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Lee continues: "Some also said that if the default had been called 'Hard' instead, they would've felt okay about switching down to 'Normal'." Again, this demonstrates player ego more than anything else - did Neople's decision to call its difficulty modes 'Normal' and 'Easy' affect player retention? It would seem so.</p>
<p>"Difficulty is subjective, and each player experiences Khazan's challenges differently," muses Lee. "That's why we offered multiple difficulty options from the start. We wanted more people to enjoy Khazan, and we thought it would be better to let players freely adjust the challenge. We thought it was up to the player to lower it if it's too hard or raise it if it's too easy.</p>
<p>"That's one of the biggest lessons I've learned from all of you."</p>
<p>The result? In the June update, Neople added in both 'Beginner' and 'Hardcore' difficulty modes. 'Beginner' was a result of people claiming "Sure, there's an 'Easy' mode... but it's the hardest Easy mode I've ever played," per Lee, that doesn't just make enemies easier to kill and make your character more hardy,  also adds accessibility elements (allowing you to engage at your own discretion better). 'Hardcore', meanwhile, rolls out the bosses in the game in their "purest form": bastard-hard versions of the encounters that are more true to the prototyped versions from earlier on in the dev cycle.</p>
<p>This is the polar opposite approach compared to a creator like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a>, creator of Dark Souls. He has gone on the record as saying turning down <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s difficulty would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/turning-down-elden-rings-difficulty-would-break-the-game-itself-says-miyazaki">"break the game itself"</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is actually enduring complaints about the opposite end of the spectrum at the moment, with veteran players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-revised-roadmap">clamouring for harder fights</a> in the post-game. Newly-released Wuchang: Fallen Feathers devs are using post-launch patches<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuchang-fallen-feathers-studio-to-continue-optimising-performance-and-rebalance-cheap-difficulty"> to address 'cheap difficulty' in its fights</a>. It's somewhat impossible to get the balance right the first time, clearly.</p>
<p>I appreciate the transparency of the developers, here. I think Neople's assessment and reaction to player behaviour is a fascinating look behind the curtain of game development, and something more developers should endeavour to communicate. Regarding game development, I'd rather this than something a little more underhanded, like you see in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-res4-ps2">Resident Evil 4</a> - which will quietly bump the difficulty down without telling you if you're struggling with a certain section (see the video below for more information on that little nugget).</p>

<p>Difficulty in hard games is not a new conversation. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-video-game-difficulty-became-a-cultural-battleground">it's something of a cultural battleground</a>. Only recently, our own Ed mused on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-difficulty-options">the positive impact difficulty options had on his experience with Lies of P Overture</a>. We've spoken about how achingly fine-tuned balance in video games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-massively-imbalanced-but-balance-is-overrated-anwyay">can often be a bore, if we're honest</a>.</p>
<p>What's your opinion? Are you more likely to pick up The First Berserker: Khazan knowing that there are more difficulty options now available? Or do you like your games as masochistic as they come (roll on, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-announced-and-theres-a-demo-out-now">Nioh 3</a>)?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/would-you-rather-stop-playing-a-game-than-lower-the-difficulty-the-first-berserker-khazan-devs-reckon-you-would]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The preload for the first Battlefield 6 Open Beta weekend is available now on all platforms via the respective store pages ahead of the beginning of the test, which is set for Saturday, August 9 (although there is an Early Access beta that begins on Thursday, August 7). On Steam, the download size is 39.24 GB. In case you're wondering about the PC system requirements, they can be found <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-pc-requirements-relatively-mild/">here</a>, and they're not that scary if you have built a PC in the last four or five years or so. </p>



<p>The official Battlefield account on X also <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1952412102871994565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> an overview of how the Open Beta test will differ from the Battlefield Labs testing and the final game. The Assault class has had some of its abilities reworked to be team-oriented; for example, Commanding Presence has replaced Enhanced Mobility as the new Signature Trait, speeding up capturing objectives for nearby squad members and taking the team out of combat status faster. Moreover, the Spawn Beacon has been transferred from the Recon class to the Assault class. Although the Deploy Beacon has traditionally been a Recon class staple, it has had its challenges there. By moving it to the Assault class for Battlefield 6, the developers hope to make it a teamplay tool for frontline flanking and coordinated squad movement. The Deploy Beacon can now only be used a finite number of times per squad, and it will self-destruct if the Assault player spawns on it. Finally, the Assault Ladder is a new gadget that provides squads access to previously unreachable areas. Depending on the deployment angle, it can function as a ladder or a ramp. As a powerful teamplay gadget, it allows Assault players to help their entire team overcome obstacles, gain height advantages, and surprise the enemy.</p>



<p>According to feedback, the Engineer works well right now and will not be receiving changes at this time. The Support, however, may get some minor tweaks to the refresh rate of supply crates and how well its signature weapon buffs contribute to the game's flow. The Recon has had one of its training options, Pathfinder, replaced by Spec Ops:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Spec Ops 0</strong>:<strong> </strong>Your base class training, available from the start and allows quieter takedowns, crouch and prone movement.</li>



<li><strong>Spec Ops 1</strong>: Spots nearby enemy gadgets (except when sprinting).</li>



<li><strong>Spec Ops 2</strong>:<strong> </strong>Going prone takes you out of combat much faster and removes the spot on self.</li>
</ul>



<p>Moreover, the Recon class now features an Active Ability at Level 3 that lets players call in a UAV to a marked position for passive spotting.</p>



<p>Lastly, as mentioned in the headline, the developers confirmed in a press briefing (as <a href="https://twitter.com/undefined/status/1952011658143924686?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1952011658143924686%7Ctwgr%5E668771305845d75d42a62ab4f1f2512df684bf6c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fbattlefield%2Fbattlefield-6-confirmed-to-have-skill-based-matchmaking-no-server-browser-3233524%2F">reported by CharlieIntel</a>) that matchmaking in Battlefield 6 will be based on a series of factors, including ping, player location, server availability, and some skill checks. It is unclear on which criteria this will be based, but the goal is clearly to deliver a more evenly balanced experience between players with relatively similar skills.</p>



<p>On PC, Intel <a href="https://wccftech.com/intel-ea-partners-battlefield-6-pc-xess-2-launch-optimizations-for-intel-core-ultra-cpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is the official partner for the game</a>, although Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-feature-nvidia-dlss-amd-fsr-intel-xess-support-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will support all upscalers</a>.

<p>Out this December</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Last week, during Nintendo's partner showcase, Square Enix lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> - a new entry in the HD-2D series where you'll customise and play as your own character.</p>
<p>Square Enix has already shared quite a bit about this upcoming release, and now it seems it's been rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board ahead of its arrival this December. It's 'T' for "Teen" and contains blood, fantasy violence, language and suggestive themes.</p>
<p>Here's the official ESRB description, which goes into detail about all of the themes mentioned in the classification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is rated T for Teen by the ESRB with Blood, Fantasy Violence, Language, and Suggestive Themes. This is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of a traveler searching for sacred rings. As players explore a fantastical world, they assemble companions to engage in turn-based battles against human, animal, and monster enemies. Graphics are highly pixelated, with gameplay and cutscenes taking place from a distant perspective. Players use bladed weapons and elemental attacks to deplete opponents' health/hit points; combat is highlighted by impact sounds and light effects. Cutscenes depict additional violence involving small, pixelated characters: characters holding knives to their throats; cultists repeatedly stabbing a character; a man strangling a woman; a villain killing an unarmed civilian. Some characters are depicted with bloodstained clothing; a handful of scenes depict rooms with bloodstained corpses. The game contains some suggestive/sexual material: text describing a prostitute character (e.g., ‚Äúsold their little sister to a brothel in a far-off land...In a distant land, their sister sold her body for coin.‚Äù); other dialogue (e.g., ‚ÄúDid you pleasure my old man last night you dirty wh*re‚Äù); stylized female monsters wearing revealing outfits (e.g., large amounts of cleavage/breasts). The word ‚Äúsh*t‚Äù appears in the game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As previously mentioned, the Switch 2 release is a Game-Key Card, and Square Enix says there are no plans to allow the Switch version to be upgraded in the future.</p>
<p>Octopath Traveler 0 will release on the Switch, Switch 2 and multiple other platforms on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the many announcements during last week's Nintendo's Partner showcase was the Switch 2 upgrade for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>With the game now available for the Switch 2 this week, Respawn Entertainment has outlined the game's performance details on this new platform. Here's the full rundown along with some information about the download process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Enjoy up to <strong>60 FPS</strong>, depending on monitor/hardware capability and compatibility (<strong>1920x1080 docked</strong>, <strong>1792x1008 undocked</strong>)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>- When you login, you‚Äôll be redirected to the eShop to download Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch 2. You‚Äôll be able to delete ‚ÄúApex Legends for Nintendo Switch‚Äù after you login to the updated version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you log into your Apex Legends account on the Switch or Switch 2 before <strong>16th September 2025</strong>, you'll also receive the "P.A.T.H." Pathfinder Skin!.</p>
<p>You can see the full patch notes for this latest update on EA's website. Once again, this game is a free download on the Switch 2. In terms of the estimated file size, according to the eShop it's a <strong>31.7 GB</strong> download.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/715220/ziff-davis-creators-guild-cnet-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> layoffs at parent company Ziff Davis</a> last week, the IGN Creators Guild has announced eight layoffs at IGN today, comprising 12% of the site‚Äôs bargaining unit. Today‚Äôs cuts are the latest in what‚Äôs becoming a regular occurrence at the company, and come despite what the union <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ignunion.bsky.social/post/3lvm4rhup5k2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calls</a> ‚Äúseveral quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue increases.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>Several affected IGN staffers have announced their layoffs on social media, including senior features editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lawoftd.bsky.social/post/3lvm53wqnck27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt Kim</a>, video editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oswinstark.bsky.social/post/3lvm4tif6ms2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chelsea Reed Miller</a>, entertainment reviews editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erikadams.bsky.social/post/3lvm7esktjs2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Erik Adams</a>, and gaming editorial events manager <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/robmanuel.bsky.social/post/3lvm6nbmhys2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Manuel</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In a statement, the IGN Creators Guild noted that the move comes not just after recent layoffs that affected sites like CNET, Mashable, and Lifehacker, but ‚Äújust months after our multibillion-dollar parent company, Ziff Davis, instituted a company-wide <a href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-gamesindustrybiz-humble-buyouts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buyout</a> that shrunk our unit numbers, with the express intent of avoiding future layoffs. And it comes just a little over one year after three of our members were laid off almost immediately after our union <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-creators-guild-union-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went public</a>.‚Äù&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The union cited a ‚Äúa Ziff Davis-mandate to cut costs‚Äù as the reasoning behind the layoffs, despite the fact that ‚ÄúIGN Entertainment has had a tremendously successful year thus far‚Äù with events like San Diego ComicCon and Summer Game Fest-related coverage. ‚ÄúEvery single person impacted today was involved in and critical to the success of those events,‚Äù the union wrote. On social media, Adams <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erikadams.bsky.social/post/3lvm7pvitlk2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> that ‚Äúthe cuts span desks and verticals and departments and areas of expertise, and I say without reservation that they're each A Huge Bummer.‚Äù</p><p>The union also highlighted IGN‚Äôs acquisition of Gamer Network sites including Eurogamer, RockPaperShotgun, and GamesIndustry.biz last year, which saw prompt <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a> and then further departures in the time since. ‚ÄúThe company has not responded to the union's questions about whether its budget for future acquisitions is being reconsidered as a cost-saving measure alongside these other apparently necessary personnel cuts,‚Äù the union wrote.</p><p>In April, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/656044/ziff-davis-sues-openai-ign-cnet-pcmag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ziff Davis sued OpenAI</a> for copyright infringement, and the union noted that ‚ÄúIGN Entertainment is choosing to eliminate the individuals who ensure IGN remains competitive as generative AI threatens our reach. We have been told that‚Ä¶ work that leverages our staff's deep knowledge of gaming, tech, and entertainment are all essential to combating AI summarization and regurgitation of our work. Management has responded by cutting several individuals who do that exact work.‚Äù</p><p>Senior reporter and co-chair of the IGN Creators Guild Rebekah Valentine told Aftermath:</p><blockquote><p>Thanks to an interim agreement our bargaining team negotiated earlier this year, we were able to get our members significantly better severance than was offered by the company in the past, including an extra 30 days on top of their owed amount due to the company failing to notify them of the layoffs in advance. They also received at least two months of company-paid COBRA, and will be placed on a recall list for six months in case their job title comes open again during that time. Unions work.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>‚ÄúWhile IGN Entertainment management may not value us, we value one another and the incredible work we can do together,‚Äù the union wrote. ‚ÄúBehind the articles, videos, social posts, playlists, and maps of IGN are human beings, not just numbers on a spreadsheet to be pushed around when some number at the top isn't big enough. Without us, there is no IGN.‚Äù</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve"><h3>Gabe Newell Bought A Yacht Company</h3></a><p>Valve's head honcho is now in the big boat business</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-chris-plante-sandwich-post-games"><h3>You Have To Hear Chris Plante‚Äôs Sandwich Story</h3></a><p>"It‚Äôs somehow getting on us, but we‚Äôre so happy that we‚Äôre not gonna die"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-covid-lockdown-hideo-kojima"><h3>Death Stranding 2 Is A Joyful, Absurd Response To COVID</h3></a><p>Goofy, lighthearted, constantly mugging: Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an exercise in spectacle, a rumination on lockdown, and one of the most human games Kojima has made in years</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/harry-potter-jk-rowling-cge-codenames-board-game"><h3>Board Game Company Fucks Around (Announcing A New Harry Potter Game), Finds Out (When Fans Revolt And Media Announce Boycotts)</h3></a><p>'It‚Äôs a product to sell to people who prioritise their nostalgia for children‚Äôs fantasy over the culture their trans friends and family live in'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-ziff-davis]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Imagine Tetris but played in a bottomless ocean shaft, with linked tetronimoes serving to continue your journey down that shaft, providing you keep earning enough points to play them. This is <a href="https://fourquarters.itch.io/podvodsk">Podvodsk</a>, a free game jam experiment from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/loop-hero">Loop Hero</a> developers Four Quarters. </p>
<p>Not played Tetris? 1) you bloody liar, and 2) let me frame this differently, then. The idea here is that you're trying to construct a tapering underwater city out of random clumps of building blocks, dangled from the bottom of a miraculously unsinkable surface platform. Each building both costs points and also, earns points based on different scoring criteria, and every time you play a piece, the screen scrolls irreversibly downward.</p><!--more-->
<p>Residential blocks score points based on whether they're close to other types of building. Factory blocks like to be positioned up against the walls of the chasm, so they can mine for ore. Business centres prefer to be a few squares away from other building types - financial analysts do enjoy a bit of elbow room, especially when they're 300 fathoms under. Seaweed farms want to be close to seaweed, obviously, while scaffolding earns you nothing, but is cheap.</p>
<p>My favourite tiles are bunkers, which can be drilled into the rock, and score points based on the number of other, on-screen bunkers they're linked to. Getting a vertical streak of bunkers feels like the key to transforming a mere Aquarius Reef Base into a credible Rapture. Science centres, meanwhile, earn points every time the screen scrolls for as long as they're visible, so you'll want to park them as far down as possible. And city centres, finally, give you the next three buildings for free.</p>
<p>It might feel like there aren't enough building types, but the game squeezes some decent intricacy out of these variations, and the pixelart is quite tasty. The real limitation, perhaps, is that too much depends on luck of the draw. As such, Podvodsk is best played in Tactical Mode, which stores any building piece you don't play for one turn, and thus allows you to strategise a little - placing scaffolding at first to move your seaweed farm closer to a bountiful kelp forest.</p>
<p>The relationships between scoring criteria remind me of wooden token game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/406660/seaside">Seaside</a>, except that Seaside sticks to the shore. If you're concerned about playing anything from a Russian developer, given the on-going invasion of Ukraine, it's worth noting that Four Quarters <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/russian-loop-hero-devs-tell-players-to-pirate-their-game-because-of-sanctions/">have publicly opposed the war</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/build-underwater-cities-out-of-tetris-pieces-in-podvodsk-a-game-jam-freebie-from-the-loop-hero-developers]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ziff Davis-owned IGN Entertainment has laid off staff, including eight members of the IGN Creators Guild. Those cuts represent 12 percent of the bargaining unit. The layoffs are the latest shift in the turbulent gaming media landscape. Earlier this year, <em>Verge</em> parent company Vox Media <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659575/polygon-vox-media-sold-valnet-gamerant">sold <em>Polygon</em></a> to <em>GameRant</em> owner Valnet, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664747/giant-bomb-independent-gaming-site-employee-owned"><em>Giant Bomb</em> went independent</a>, and <em>Game Informer</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/635915/game-informer-return-gunzilla-games">returned</a> after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24212016/game-informer-shutting-down-layoffs-gamestop">being shut down by GameStop</a>. Last week, Ziff Davis also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/715220/ziff-davis-creators-guild-cnet-layoffs">laid off staff at CNET</a>.</p><p>Laid off IGN staffers include <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lawoftd.bsky.social/post/3lvm53wqnck27">former senior features editor Matt Kim</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oswinstark.bsky.social/post/3lvm4tif6ms2f">video editor Chelsea Miller</a>, but no single department was primarily targeted by the cuts, Rebekah Valentine, IGN senior reporter and co-chair of the guild, tells <em>The Verge</em>. ‚ÄúIt was largely single individuals from different departments.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúThe company has told us that the reason for this layoff stems from a Ziff Davis-mandate to cut costs despite several quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue increases, to which IGN Entertainment responded by coming for our members‚Äô jobs,‚Äù <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ignunion.bsky.social/post/3lvm4rhup5k2a">the guild says</a>. ‚ÄúThis is perplexing to us, as we are told again and again that IGN Entertainment has had a tremendously successful year thus far thanks to their hard work.‚Äù</p><p>An employee in the engineering department was also laid off, Hunter Paniagua, a representative of the Pacific Media Workers Guild, which represents the IGN Creators Guild, tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Ziff Davis didn‚Äôt immediately reply to a request for comment. Last year, across all of Ziff Davis, the company employed approximately 3,800 people, <a href="https://s205.q4cdn.com/689425761/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/5ea843d6-d06a-41b1-bac0-4bb45df94888.pdf">according to an SEC filing</a>.</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161718/ign-gamer-network-acquisition">IGN acquired</a> the website portfolio of Gamer Network, which includes publications like <em>Eurogamer,</em> <em>Gamesindustry.biz</em>, and <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em>. Terms of that deal weren‚Äôt disclosed at the time.</p><p>‚ÄúThe company has not responded to the union‚Äôs questions about whether its budget for future acquisitions is being reconsidered as a cost-saving measure alongside these other apparently necessary personnel cuts,‚Äù the IGN Creators Guild says.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/718692/ign-entertainment-layoffs-creators-guild-ziff-davis]]></content:encoded>

These new Switch and Switch 2 versions will play just like the PS5, Xbox, and PC versions that launched last year, but will add support for motion controls for certain moves, such as Goku's Spirit Bomb ultimate attack. Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero will be available on Switch 2 and Switch in multiple versions, including a $60 physical standard edition and multiple digital editions that include tons of extra content, all of which are available to preorder now ahead of Sparking Zero's November 14 release date. Preordering any edition of the game on either of Nintendo's hybrid handhelds also unlocks several of the game's characters early.</p><h2>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Preorder Bonus</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542785-dbsparkingswitchpreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542785" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542785-dbsparkingswitchpreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542785"></a><figcaption>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Preorder Bonus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542785-dbsparkingswitchpreorders.jpg"></figure><p>If you preorder Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero on either Switch 2 or Switch, you'll get Goku's child form from the most recent Dragon Ball anime, Dragon Ball Daima, as a bonus playable character. You'll also get early unlocks for six variations of Gogeta (the fused form of Goku and Vegeta) and Broly--but that's still a nice head start on unlocking the game's full 182-character roster.

Physical preorders are available for $60 at multiple online retailers. Digital preorders are also available on the Switch eShop.</p><p>It's worth noting that the Switch 2 edition is a Game-Key Card release, meaning the cartridge does not include any of the game data, and instead works as physical DRM that allows you to download and play the digital version on your console. The original Switch version includes the full game data on the cart. It does not look like Bandai Namco is offering the option to upgrade from the Switch to Switch 2 edition. It's also uncertain how the game will perform on the original Switch, but Bandai Namco confirms that the more-powerful hardware of the Switch 2 will naturally offer better graphical power. </p></div>                      </div><h2>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Digital Deluxe Edition (Switch 2 and Switch)</h2><h4>$90 | Releases November 14</h4><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542903-deluxedbzero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542903" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542903-deluxedbzero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542903"></a><figcaption>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Digital Deluxe Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542903-deluxedbzero.jpg"></figure><p>Along with the physical standard edition, Sparking Zero will also get two digital-only Switch 2 and Switch versions that include additional content.

The game is a celebration of the entire Dragon Ball franchise, featuring a roster of 182 characters from various Dragon Ball anime series and movies. In addition to the single-player campaign that spans multiple Dragon Ball sagas, there's also a mode that lets you change the outcome of notable moments from the series. The game also includes online and local multiplayer for up to six players.</p><p>There are several other great Dragon Ball games available for Switch, all of which are also backwards compatible with the Switch 2. If you're looking for another fighting game, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Fighterz-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B07F2ZX3DN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Dragon Ball FighterZ is a superb entry in the genre</a>. Developed by Arc System Works, the studio behind Guilty Gear, Dragon Ball FighterZ is a 2.5D tag-team fighting game with a roster of characters pulled from Dragon Ball Z, GT, and Super. However, it offers a more traditional fighting game compared to the three-dimensional action of Sparking Zero. You can pick it up for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Fighterz-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B07F2ZX3DN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$25 at Amazon</a>.</p><p>For a story-focused single-player Dragon Ball experience, there's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Kakarot-Awakes-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B097FQM3QN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Kakarot</a>. The game retells the entire Dragon Ball Z story of Goku, but it adds an action-RPG flair with an enjoyable grind and skill customization as you explore the anime's iconic world. The game has also received several post-launch expansions that adapt other Dragon Ball storylines, including Dragon Ball Super and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Kakarot-Daima-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DZQMPT6P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Daima</a>.

While it is an older game in the series, Xenoverse 2 has been supported constantly with new DLC over the years, and its roster is up to date with modern Dragon Ball media.</p><h2>More Dragon Ball Games on Switch</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Fighterz-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B07F2ZX3DN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> -- $25</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Kakarot-Awakes-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B097FQM3QN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Kakarot</a> -- $32.45</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Kakarot-Daima-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DZQMPT6P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Kakarot: Daima Edition</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Xenoverse-2-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01N1034HX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a> -- $25 (<strike>$30</strike>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rebuild-of-evangelion-blu-ray-editions-neon-genesis-evangelion-complete-series/1100-6533665/">Two Rebuild Of Evangelion Movies Are Finally Returning To Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-star-wars-3-in-1-clone-wars-mandalorian-adventure-gift-set-walmart-2025/1100-6533571/">New Lego Star Wars Gift Bundle In Stock At Walmart - 3 Sets For $45</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-minecraft-5-in-1-world-explorer-walmart-gift-set-2025/1100-6533572/">Lego Minecraft 5-In-1 Gift Set Up For Grabs For $45 Exclusively At Walmart</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-deals-limited-edition-restock-guide/1100-6526172/">Rune Factory: Guardians Of Azuma For Switch 2 Gets First Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chonicles-preorder-amazon-exclusive-edition-switch-2-playstation/1100-6532119/">Final Fantasy Tactics Remake Has Free Nintendo Switch 2 Upgrade</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-one-piece-netflix-anime-all-building-sets-available-now/1100-6532155/">Lego One Piece - Going Merry Ship &amp; Six Other Sets Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-lorcana-tcg-reign-of-jafar-palace-heist-cooperative-game-is-steeply-discounted/1100-6531334/">Disney Lorcana TCG Palace Heist Solo And Co-Op Game Is Steeply Discounted</a></li>   </ul> </div>

</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>WWE has never felt more out of touch. In its Netflix documentary <em>WWE Unreal</em>, which was intended to give a hammed-up look inside the company, WWE‚Äôs head honcho Paul ‚ÄúTriple H‚Äù Levesque, talked about meeting and subverting fans‚Äô expectations like he was a modern-day Machiavelli. The toothless series only really succeeded in demonstrating how disconnected the company is from reality, especially coming after the John Cena heel-turn disaster.</p><p>A heel turn in wrestling is when a good guy wrestler becomes a bad guy wrestler. Wrestlers do it all the time, signaling a paradigm shift in their gimmicks and their relationship with the audience. In all of Cena‚Äôs two decades with WWE he has never turned heel. WWE never turned Cena heel when his ‚ÄúSuper Cena‚Äù persona, which had squash match victories against younger talent, turned him into a pseudo-bad-guy for fans who wanted to see another wrestler get a shot at the top of the mountain. Sure, he‚Äôs broken the fourth wall joking about turning heel, but for decades, wrestling‚Äôs Superman never wavered.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bray Wyatt tells the story of how John Cena helped create The Fiend | WWE ON FOX" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ljMgmMvkKZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The closest thing the WWE universe got to seeing a Cena heel turn was when the <a href="https://kotaku.com/wwe-bray-wyatt-died-the-fiend-wyatt-family-cause-death-1850774254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">late-Bray Wyatt</a> had a cinematic match with him, where he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFnX1xj-sss&amp;pp=ygUUY2VuYSBicmF5IHd5YXR0IHd3ZSA%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">psychologically broke down Cena‚Äôs facade in a nightmare sequence</a>, jabbing at his insecurities as the company‚Äôs main guy. With Cena announcing his <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/john-cena-announces-wwe-retirement-in-2025-wrestlemania-41-will-be-his-last-wrestlemania" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retirement tour from wrestling last year</a>, fans were resigned to the fact that the unwritten rule of wrestling‚ÄîJohn Cena will never turn heel‚Äîwould remain.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="John Cena Details Plans For His Heel Turn In 2012" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yabyTd2cTgQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Until, at the close of Elimination Chamber back in March, it finally happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FULL SEGMENT: John Cena SELLS OUT and ruthlessly assaults Cody Rhodes: Elimination Chamber 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mS8W6NY6QjQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Cena‚Äôs heel turn was a shocking moment in wrestling, and rife with diminishing returns. Despite big marquee matches against new company man Cody Rhodes, Cena running it back with longtime rivals Randy Orton and CM Punk, and an awkward little one-off with Cena super-fan R-Truth, heel Cena was abysmal. His matches, save for his match against CM Punk, ended in uninspired, cheating finishes without much wrestling work to compensate for their deflating endings. Adding to the stench of failure: <a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2025/6/27/24457179/cm-punk-saudi-arabia-apology-miz-tweet-blood-money-wwe-night-of-champions-cena" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cena vs CM Punk happened in Saudi Arabia</a>.</p><p>Cena‚Äôs gift of gab couldn‚Äôt save him from turning the ship around. Rather than give an inspired reason for turning evil, Cena did the thing most ‚Äújust put the fries in the bag, bro‚Äù heels do: blame the fans.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FULL SEGMENT: John Cena TRASHES the WWE Universe until Cody Rhodes fires back: Raw, March 17, 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExQYm6gintE?start=1004&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>His promos became repetitive, vapid, and whiny. They lacked the heat, positive or negative, to make him feel like a big deal. They ended up more like an awkward segment that fans were forced to watch out of nostalgia, or on the off-chance he‚Äôd somehow manage to surprise them. Like rubbernecking at a 21-car pile-up, a happy ending never came.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a stunt with added pressure because it was marketed alongside Cena‚Äôs retirement from wrestling. This farewell tour was further soured by appearances by Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson, known for vanity projects and <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/dwayne-johnson-dc-exit-black-adam-superman-failed-plan-1235478867/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meddling in all things involving a creative, collaborative process</a>, and rapper <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25165999-rock-talks-travis-scotts-involvement-john-cenas-heel-turn-possible-wwe-match" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis Scott‚Äôs pivotal involvement in Cena‚Äôs monumental heel turn</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FULL SEGMENT: The real John Cena returned in face-off with Cody Rhodes: SmackDown, Aug. 1, 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1r2r37vaA0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>WWE wound up reversing course for SummerSlam. Suddenly Cena turned face two days before his SummerSlam rematch with the new-blood face of the company, Cody Rhodes. In an impassioned dual promo-off, Cena turned off his dour, milquetoast, ‚Äúthe fans are fickle and no one cared about me succeeding‚Äù charisma vacuum shtick he‚Äôd been perpetuating throughout his disastrous heel run and returned to his high-energy, crowd-gesticulating self, saying he‚Äôd give Cody ‚Äúthe real John Cena‚Äù in his rematch. And that he did. They had arguably Cena‚Äôs best modern-day bout since his face-off against AJ Styles, with all the pageantry and physically impressive and emotionally resonant ring work in a long while.&nbsp;</p><p>But of course, as extra baggage to WWE‚Äôs shitty booking with Cena‚Äôs farewell tour, SummerSlam couldn‚Äôt just end with Cena waving goodbye to fans after. Following Cena‚Äôs loss and the torch passing to Rhodes, WWE fans were greeted with a bizarre shock return by Brock Lesnar, a wrestler rumored to have been on <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/wrestling/wwe/daniel-cormier-claims-brock-lesnar-on-wwe-tko-banned-list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company‚Äôs banned list</a> after being listed in active litigation in disgraced former CEO <a href="https://kotaku.com/wwe-vince-mcmahon-stephanie-mcmahon-nick-khan-john-laur-1849079202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vince McMahon</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6105612/2025/02/01/brock-lesnar-wwe-lawsuit-vince-mcmahon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sex trafficking lawsuit</a> by former employee Janel Grant.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wwe-appoints-vince-mcmahons-daughter-as-interim-ceo-amid-probe-11655467082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a>, the lawsuit accused McMahon of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/vince-mcmahon-accused-of-sex-trafficking-by-wwe-staffer-he-paid-to-keep-quiet-0b19b21c?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhFLTjUtLvg_2Y0CuoIDeTcx701_qzkT_b92lYWtJ1Bv9KAhn5vAArDkAghb0Q%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68901ff3&amp;gaa_sig=w_Wg8RAUGXE0P_TGdbpJ5ke6NgtfxaKU4XWctlfDlAQtEyOeY5Pa7cHwfwIRpU_ulsvZh4cELFi--c9KdXz76w%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sex trafficking and pressuring Grant to have sex with other men at WWE</a>. During this media shitstorm, McMahon bowed out of the company in 2022 after an investigation of an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wwe-appoints-vince-mcmahons-daughter-as-interim-ceo-amid-probe-11655467082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged affair and hush money payout with numerous WWE employees</a>, totalling at <a href="https://kotaku.com/vince-mcmahon-wwe-investigation-sex-affair-hush-money-1849157420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$12 million</a>. Bizarrely, he returned to the company to oversee WWE‚Äôs transition into a Saudi Arabia-owned sports entertainment company, <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/wwe-ufc-deal-closes-tko-group-1235719908/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TKO</a>, alongside UFC, and subsequently <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/vince-mcmahon-wwe-board-members-return-1235480703/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired some WWE board members</a>. Vince was then ousted (kind of) from the company once more, selling some of his shares in TKO.&nbsp;</p><p>All this added a special stink to the entire affair: Cena‚Äôs farewell tour, his heel turn, his sudden face turn all paled in comparison to bringing a man implicated in an active sex trafficking trial back into the fold of the company.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="'Thank You For This Honor': Wrestler Triple H Praises Trump After Being Named To Council On Sports" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D75Mftn9izQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In a SummerSlam post-show segment, Levesque praised himself and the impressive work he and his writers do. He described how they juggle the ongoing WWE storylines and explained how their latest twist in the never-ending wrestling saga, and Cena's final act, came about. He characterized the decision as something Cena wanted to do before retiring. Instead of taking all the credit, Levesque said Lesnar‚Äôs return was fulfilling Cena‚Äôs wishlist of opponents to face before leaving, stating, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs him writing the last chapter in his book.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúMy reaction was exactly what I thought it was going to be; if there had been a roof on this place, it wouldn‚Äôt be there anymore. The dynamic in the room changes when The Beast is here. Seeing Brock Lesnar come back‚Ä¶anything you thought was happening sort of all goes out the window because the factor of Brock now just changes that dynamic so incredibly,‚Äù Levesque said while interrupted by fans chanting ‚ÄúWe want Brock.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúIncredible to have him back,‚Äù Levesque said.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="SummerSlam Sunday Post-Show: August 3, 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NlSGvD1h_CM?start=3571&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That Levesque and Cena had such a tone-deaf attitude isn‚Äôt surprising, given how willfully ignorant they‚Äôve been about the elephant in the room‚ÄîMcMahon‚Äôs fall from grace and WWE‚Äôs cozying up to the president (and <a href="https://www.wwe.com/superstars/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE Hall of Famer</a>) Trump. Recently, <a href="https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/john-cena-i-love-vince-i-m-not-downplaying-allegations-any-kind-when-i-love-somebody-i-love-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cena reiterated his unwavering love for McMahon</a> despite his alleged crimes. Similarly, <a href="https://wrestletalk.com/news/triple-h-wwe-vince-mcmahon-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Levesque has dodged questions about McMahon</a>‚Äîleaving <a href="https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/cody-rhodes-comments-vince-mcmahon-netflix-documentary-and-janel-grant-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rhodes to vaguely fill in</a>. What Levesque (and WWE by extension) hasn‚Äôt been shy about is their support for Trump, calling him ‚Äú<a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2025/8/2/24479499/triple-h-says-vince-mcmahon-sex-abuse-allegations-separate-wwe-creative-calls-donald-trump-genius" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most intuitive people</a>‚Äù he‚Äôs ever met. Additionally, in a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/roman-reignss-quest-to-be-wwes-next-great-crossover-star" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a> interview, Roman Reigns, cousin of The Rock and another key wrestler in the company, expressed his support for Trump despite being a registered Democrat.</p><p>‚ÄúI support our president. Trump is one of those guys where he‚Äôs got a vast history and a huge background,‚Äù Reigns told Vanity Fair (whatever that means). ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been in entertainment. He‚Äôs been in big business, politics. At this point, I‚Äôm supporting a bright future for our country. Positive and competent leadership. For us to be what we‚Äôre supposed to be‚Äîto be a world leader and carry that respect and do what a world power like us should be doing."</p><p>WWE has also noticeably stopped celebrating holidays like <a href="https://whatculture.com/wwe/wwe-just-ignored-black-history-month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black History Month</a> and Pride Month, <a href="https://www.f4wonline.com/profiles/wwe-releases-2025-superstars-fired/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">while</a> laying off many wrestlers, including <a href="https://www.pride.com/wwe-sonya-devilles-contract-not-renewed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many of its openly queer talent.</a> Meanwhile, their programming has increasingly aligned with UFC and resembles a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/gallery/president-trump-attends-ufc-316/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glorified Republican National Convention</a> by adopting MAGA themes. For example, a white wrestler named Chad Gable adopts a luchador gimmick called ‚Äú<a href="https://www.wwe.com/superstars/el-grande-americano" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grande Americano</a>‚Äù‚Äîa nod to <a href="https://www.bodyslam.net/2022/12/11/hulk-hogan-discusses-his-mr-america-gimmick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogan‚Äôs disguised ‚ÄúMr. America‚Äù gimmick</a>. One of the most baffling aspects of this gimmick is the use of <a href="https://cultaholic.com/posts/wwe-criticised-for-allegedly-using-ai-to-create-el-grande-americano-raw-video-package" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI in his entrance video</a> ($8 billion company, by the way) and his claim to hail from ‚Äú<a href="https://wrestletalk.com/news/wwe-el-grande-americano-character-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Gulf of America</a>.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, things are worse than they‚Äôve ever been on the WWE side of the squared circle. And the latest development in Cena‚Äôs retirement tour booking is, unfortunately, yet another poor mark on an already tumultuous journey of trying to send off the company‚Äôs it-guy.</p><p>Although heel Cena vowed that he‚Äôd ‚Äú<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOeOYrhZkDU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruin professional wrestling</a>,‚Äù it never actually happened in a conscious, kayfabe way. Regardless, WWE has undoubtedly tarnished this man‚Äôs legacy by making his farewell tour one of the worst series of booking spectacles in wrestling, and he deserves better.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-ziff-davis"><h3>IGN Lays Off 8 Staff, 12% Of Union</h3></a><p>The layoffs follow wider cuts at Ziff Davis, buyouts, and layoffs and departures at acquired sites</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve"><h3>Gabe Newell Bought A Yacht Company</h3></a><p>Valve's head honcho is now in the big boat business</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-chris-plante-sandwich-post-games"><h3>You Have To Hear Chris Plante‚Äôs Sandwich Story</h3></a><p>"It‚Äôs somehow getting on us, but we‚Äôre so happy that we‚Äôre not gonna die"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-covid-lockdown-hideo-kojima"><h3>Death Stranding 2 Is A Joyful, Absurd Response To COVID</h3></a><p>Goofy, lighthearted, constantly mugging: Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an exercise in spectacle, a rumination on lockdown, and one of the most human games Kojima has made in years</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/harry-potter-jk-rowling-cge-codenames-board-game"><h3>Board Game Company Fucks Around (Announcing A New Harry Potter Game), Finds Out (When Fans Revolt And Media Announce Boycotts)</h3></a><p>'It‚Äôs a product to sell to people who prioritise their nostalgia for children‚Äôs fantasy over the culture their trans friends and family live in'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/john-cena-heel-turn-summerslam-wwe-wrestling]]></content:encoded>

Instead, Newell is acquiring Oceanco, the yacht-building company that‚Äôs creating his <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-upcoming-superyacht-09012025.php">$400 million super ship</a>, as reported <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/boat-pro/news/oceanco-yacht-builder-sold-to-gabe-newell">earlier by <em>Boat International</em></a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/new-chapter-gabe-newell/">a post about the change</a>, Oceanco says Newell‚Äôs interest in the brand comes from a ‚Äúlifelong fascination with the sea‚Äù and ‚Äúa deep respect for the people who live and work on it.‚Äù Oceanco is based in the Netherlands, and it has changed leadership a few times since its founding in 1987, with private investor Mohammed Al Barwani <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yacht-market-intelligence/brokerage-sales-news/superyacht-builder-oceanco-under-new-ownership--4673">helming the company</a> for the past 15 years before Newell came along.</p><p>Along with Newell‚Äôs 364-foot-long superyacht, Oceanco developed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos‚Äô <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/news/jeff-bezos-koru-yacht-best-pics">$500 million sailing yacht, Koru</a>, which stretches 417 feet long.
