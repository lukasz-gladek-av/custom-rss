Players will still be able to access all earned and purchased content while offline via the local gameplay mode and training mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While real-money transactions for MultiVersus are no longer available, fans can still use Gleamium and character tokens to access in-game content until support ends on May 30. MultiVersus will also be delisted from the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, Steam, and Epic Games Store at this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the announcement, and without word of a refund policy, MultiVersus players who bought the $100 premium Founder's Pack hit out at Warner Bros. and Player First Games, with some saying they felt “scammed.” Based on online reports, there are a number of disgruntled customers who have character tokens that are now rendered useless, given they had already unlocked all playable characters in the game. Predictably, MultiVersus is also getting review-bombed on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tony Huynh, co-founder of Player First Games and game director of MultiVersus, <a href="https://x.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1886119648480915954" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to address player concerns and call out threats of violence directed at the team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Huynh’s statement in full:</p><blockquote>Hey all, I wanted to say a few words as I reflect on the recently announced news about MultiVersus. While I'm sad about the outcome, I will forever be grateful for the opportunity given to us by Warner  Bros. Games and to each and every developer on the Player First Games and WB Games teams. Also to every IP holder thank you for entrusting us with your babies, we hope we made the characters true to themselves and felt authentic to your fans. I couldn’t be prouder of the work the PFG team did. Their endless creativity and passion never ceased to inspire and amaze me. And of course I wanted to thank every player who has ever played or supported MultiVersus. Delighting and serving players is Player First Games objective.</blockquote><blockquote>I apologize for not addressing things sooner, there’s been a lot going on and I’ve been focused on the game and the team, but now more-so the team.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you for sending us all the great fan art, character ideas, and personal stories. They were the highlight of every day and always excited the team.</blockquote><blockquote>I’m sorry if we couldn’t get to your favorite character. I do think Aquaman and Lola are really cool and I hope you all check them out. Character selection comes down to bunch of things including development time, listening to what the community wants, working with IP holders and approvals, if there is a cross-marketing opportunity available to support, and of course if the team is inspired to make the character. So a lot goes into to it.</blockquote><blockquote>For instance BananaGuard came about because the team was enthusiastic about making it and on their own produced it over the weekend as a fun, quick-to-make character. When inspiration and enthusiasm spark we want to reward that and we got BananaGuard because of that. It wasn’t at the expense of another character. It was because the team was excited about making the character.</blockquote><blockquote>I don’t have the power some you think I do. PFG is a highly collaborative team and ideas are encouraged and can come from anyone and we promote delivering value to players</blockquote><blockquote>I also hope that the community notices that we try to listen and act. Like any developer we’re limited by time and resources.</blockquote><blockquote>I know that this is painful for everyone, and I know every member of PFG feels it too, but I have to call this out, you’re entitled to what you say and think, but when there are threats to harm it’s crossing the line. I hope that you can take a step back and realize that this is an extremely sad time for the team. I am in deep mourning for the game. Nobody wanted this outcome and it wasn’t from lack of caring or effort.</blockquote><blockquote>I sincerely hope that Season 5 is enjoyed with the time we have left and that you will all continue supporting other platform fighter and fighting games as these games have impacted me in many positive ways. I’ve made so many friends and created so many great memories because of these games, and a big reason why we worked so hard at PFG was to share that with you. I hope that we played a small part and that you can look back on MVS and find some joy in the friends you made and the memories you shared.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you for allowing this dream to become a reality even if for a briefer time than we would have wanted. I don’t know what the future holds for any of all of us, but I just wanted to say thank you. It has been an honor to work alongside the team at PFG to serve our community and players.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Player First Games community manager and game developer Angelo Rodriguez Jr. took to <a href="https://x.com/AJAX_HQ/status/1886134953546838238" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> to defend Huynh, stressing: “Receiving threats of physical harm against him is not and will never be the way.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I've legitimately been losing sleep over the past few days watching as all of these has been happening to Tony,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The man who would stay up past midnight with us watching streams and listened for fun ideas from the players. The man who took the time to read so many messages and respond to so many people when he didn't have to. The man who spent countless hours working with every department to try and improve things we could in the weeks we had to do it. The man who went out of his way to hire so many of us from the community and gave us a shot at being involved in something so special. Tony is not who he is being painted out to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know things aren't the best right now and everyone is looking for answers. Receiving threats of physical harm against him is not and will never be the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“PFG poured their heart into this game and we still hope everyone enjoys season 5. We never stopped pushing for improvements and again you will see 50 pages worth of them this season. I hope everyone can take the time to read through what Tony has to say, and I hope you will all think things through.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MultiVersus’ demise is the latest high-profile failure for Warner Bros. Games, following Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s disastrous launch last year. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-is-leaving-the-company-a-year-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disastrous-launch">the departure of Warner Bros. Games boss David Haddad was revealed</a> after what had been a troubling 12 months for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s failure contributed to a $200 million hit to its business</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business"><u>MultiVersus added another $100 million on top</u></a>. Warner Bros. Games' only new game release during the third quarter of 2024 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions"><u>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</u></a>, which failed to make an impression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav said: "We recognise [the games business] is substantially underperforming its potential right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League post-launch content has come to an end with the delivery of its year one roadmap. Warner Bros. has yet to announce Rocksteady’s next game, but it is reportedly helping out on a director’s cut of Hogwarts Legacy. The legendary British studio has suffered a number of layoffs in recent months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also question marks over Mortal Kombat 1’s financial performance, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-chief-ed-boon-teases-t-1000-fatality-and-future-dlc"><u>NetherRealm chief Ed Boon recently announced over five million sales and teased future DLC following the release of the T-1000 Terminator guest character</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Zaslav said Warner Bros. was doubling down on four games: Hogwarts Legacy (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-coordinating-big-picture-storytelling-with-harry-potter-tv-show-storylines"><u>a sequel is already in the works</u></a>), Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC, "in particular Batman." Warner Bros. recently published the VR game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/batman-arkham-shadow"><u>Batman: Arkham Shadow</u></a> exclusively on the Meta Quest 3, and has a Wonder Woman game in the works at Monolith Productions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio," Zaslav added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
Sony is set to hold its next PlayStation State of Play broadcast next week, according to a new report.
</p>
<p>
The tip comes from NateTheHate, a leaker with a long track record who accurately reported last month's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2 reveal date</a> ahead of time. 
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, the leaker <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1885748440132456877">teased</a> Sony's upcoming broadcast is currently expected to arrive around Valentine's Day - which is the end of next week.

<p>
Sony has streamed a State of Play broadcast each year in February since 2021, and typically uses the show to lay out its list of big first-party and third-party exclusives for the year.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-sonys-playstation-state-of-play-2">Last year's big show</a> (held on 31st January, before a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>-specific State of Play aired in early February) highlighted <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>, Foamstars, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-the-short-message">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a>, Judas, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-guides-tips-tricks-9422">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, Rise of the Ronin, Until Dawn and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, among others. The biggest surprise of the show was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-fans-after-sickness-made-him-reconsider-his-priorities">Hideo Kojima popping in to announce Physint</a>, a fresh game that's set to hark back to the creator's Metal Gear Solid action-espionage roots.
</p><p>
So, what do we expect from State of Play this year? Well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reveals-ghost-of-yotei-the-follow-up-to-ghost-of-tsushima">PlayStation is set to launch its samurai sequel Ghost of Yotei this year</a> - and could do well to announce some kind of launch window to space it out from Assassin's Creed Shadows. 
</p>
<p>
We're also expecting to hear more about Bungie's shooter reboot Marathon, and potentially Haven's live-service Fairgame$. Kojima may pop in to chat more about Death Stranding 2, which is out this year. And then there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-wont-say-if-wolverine-launches-in-2025-but-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement-for-release-date">Marvel's Wolverine - will it make 2025?</a>
</p>
<p>PlayStation's livestream will follow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-during-the-xbox-developer-direct-2025">last month's Xbox Developer Direct</a>, which gave us a look at South of Midnight, Doom: The Dark Ages, Ninja Gaiden 4, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - the last four of which will all arrive on PS5.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-4k-texture-packs-tifa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">character improvement texture mod</a>, here's another Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod that improves the game's visuals. This time, the so-called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/198?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natural Fantasy mod</a> is focused on improving the environmental textures via 2x upscaling, specifically these textures (around 1300 of them):</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Trees<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Cliffs<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Rocks<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Stones<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Ground<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Grass<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Flowers<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Puddles<br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The improvements are rather noticeable in the provided comparison pictures.</p>

<p>The author reported between 5% and 20% performance hit, depending on the graphics card. However, they recommend the mod only to players with 8GB+ VRAM graphics cards and NVME SSDs. Moreover, they warn that sometimes the game's texture streaming issues may well prevent the sharper textures from correctly appearing. The following tweaks to the Engine.ini file were provided to mitigate the issue:</p>
<p>r.Streaming.PoolSize=20000 (Adjust to 80% Your VRAM)<br>
r.Streaming.LimitPoolSizeToVRAM=0<br>
r.Streaming.UseFixedPoolSize=0<br>
r.Streaming.PrioritizeMeshLODRetention=1<br>
r.Streaming.SkeletalMeshResidentLODBias=-1<br>
r.Streaming.StaticMeshResidentLODBias=-1<br>
r.Streaming.TextureResidentLODBias=-1<br>
r.Streaming.UseAllMips=1<br>
r.Streaming.UseMaterialData=1<br>
r.Streaming.MaxTempMemoryAllowed=10000<br>
r.Streaming.PoolSizeForMeshes=5000</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launched a few days ago on PC. So far, Steam user reviews are 'Mostly Positive' at 75% on average. The game has improved graphics features (better character models and lighting) over the PlayStation 5 version, though it lacks some common PC-specific features. For example, while it does support NVIDIA DLSS and DLAA, there's no native support for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution or Intel XeSS.</p>
<p>Moreover, there's no frame generation, and the maximum frame rate is capped at 120 by default.&nbsp; However, there are workarounds for that, too. You can either use <a href="https://github.com/Lyall/FF7RebirthFix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Fix</a>, which also lets you tweak the field of view (FoV), disable vignette, and adjust the size of subtitles, or FFVIIHook, which is an INI and dev console unlocked that lets the game read variables as with a regular Unreal Engine 4 title, allowing for greater tweaking.</p>
<p>If you're still on the fence about Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, make sure to read our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perfect score review of the PlayStation 5 version</a>.</p>

<p>An insider has said that PlayStation next State of Play is on its way in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>According to Nate, the next PlayStation State of Play is in February, with the insider teasing that it could be on Valentine’s Day.

<p>PlayStation’s last State of Play took place in September 2024, featuring games like Astro Bot, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-revealed-at-state-of-play-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>.</p>



<p>As of the time of writing, it’s currently unclear on what the next PlayStation State of Play could feature, but it’s likely to include Kojima Productions Death Stranding 2: On The Beach and Ghost of Yōtei, both of which are scheduled to release later this year.</p>



<p>Other announcements could include the Horizon multiplayer game, Fairplay$, or Bungie’s Marathon, which was rumored to release later this year.</p>

<p>Atlanta FaZe just pulled off a remarkable reverse sweep at the Call of Duty League Major in Madrid. After a fairly dominant opener that saw LAT blitz FaZe, Atlanta switched things up during the mid-series Control and never slowed down. It boiled down to a round eleven showdown during map five that was quickly mopped up by FaZe.</p>



<p>The LA Thieves will now fall into the final fixture of the elimination bracket, going head-to-head (again) with the Miami Heretics. Earlier in the tournament, the LA Thieves booted Miami into the lower bracket after a 3-0 sweep.</p>



<p>Talking on stage after the match, Drazah had some choice words for the LA Thieves.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rivalry-renewed">Rivalry Renewed</h2>



<p>The LA Thieves and Atlanta FaZe represent two of the biggest dogs in the CDL fight. They’re fronted by some of the sharpest talent in the Call of Duty League, and they have the most valuable rosters to boot.</p>



<p>This face-off series was never going to go any other way than to the wire – which is exactly what happened. With it coming down to single-digit kill counts, Atlanta FaZe prevailed, earning the first ticket to the grand final series of the Madrid Major.</p>



<p>On stage in the post-match interview, Drazah fired shots at LA Thieves:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m feeling great – those guys are <strong>frauds</strong>. It’s Sunday, we’re on LAN, reverse-sweep, this shit is easy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the last few weeks, the LA Thieves roster has been wrestling with the title of ‘Super Team’, which was branded upon the squad when it was assembled last year. For many, LAT hasn’t yet lived up to those lofty expectations, which is a sticking point for sure.</p>



<p>LA Thieves will now contend with the Miami Heretics for the sole remaining spot in the grand final. There’s a $150,000 prize awaiting the winner of Major I – who will secure it? Find out in just a couple of hours.</p>

Whilst they still list Private Division as the publisher on those pages, the defunct Steam pages - which were quietly amended last week - have been <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1294420/history/">updated</a> to replace the publisher Private Division with 2K.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it's unclear if this is just an oversight, a licensing issue, or a signal that Roll7's portfolio did not transfer to the anonymous buyer and remains with 2K.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands publisher Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-sells-private-division-label-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-world-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">announced the sale of its indie-focused publishing label Private Division in November 2024</a>. Additionally, the company also confirmed the closure of OlliOlli World developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2's Intercept Games, six months after CEO Strauss Zelnick insisted, "We didn't shutter those studios".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>DICE and EA have announced that the first details on the next Battlefield’s community test program will be revealed tomorrow.</p>



<p>The announcement was posted on the official X (formerly Twitter) account, where it was said, “Tune in tomorrow at 5PM CET / 8AM PDT for more on the upcoming <a href="https://x.com/hashtag/Battlefield?src=hashtag_click">#Battlefield</a> community testing program.”</p>



<p>Last week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-playtests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming exclusively reported that Battlefield playtests</a> were once again ramping up to test the multiplayer and Battle Royale experiences of the game. </p>



<p>While details on what will be announced tomorrow are incredibly slim, several sources have suggested that we’ll get our first look at pre-alpha gameplay of the game (abliet, only a few seconds).</p>



<p>Insider Gaming also understands that playtests for the next Battlefield title have been a weekly occurrence for months, with DICE and the other Battlefield studios relentlessly gaining player feedback; something they didn’t do for Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>From small feedback sessions to large-scale player tests, Battlefield is now taking the much-needed “player first” approach to ensure that the next Battlefield game is a success, with the teams leaning from its mistakes of the series’ past couple of installments. </p>



<p>Are you looking forward to hearing more about the Battlefield Community Test Program? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-brand-trading-system-a-joke-and-downright-greedy">Within days of launching a controversial new update that added the ability to trade cards</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has acknowledged the community's backlash, saying it was "actively investigating" ways to improve.</p>
<p>A statement posted to social media stopped short of apologising to unhappy players, but admitted some of the new feature's restrictions were actively "preventing players from being able to casually enjoy" the card game.</p>

<p>"Since releasing the first iteration of the trading feature a few days ago, we have received a large number of comments. Thank you all for sharing your feedback," the statement from Creatures Inc began.</p>
<p>"The item requirements and restrictions implemented for the trading feature were designed to prevent abuse from bots and other prohibited actions using multiple accounts."</p> <div>

<p>As trading requires players use up valuable resources and adhere to a lengthy list of restrictions in order to acquire cards they don't already have, some players felt as though trading was actively discouraged, especially as its limited to players on your friends list, and only one trade can be conducted at a time. Currently, only cards of One, Two, Three or Four Diamond rarity can be offered for trade, alongside One Star rarity.</p>
<p>Now, however, the team says that the goal had only been to "balance" the game whilst "maintaining a fair environment for all players", adding "preserving the fun of collecting cards[...] is core to the Pokémon TCG Pocket experience".</p>
<p>"However, thanks to your feedback, we understand that some of the restrictions put in place are preventing players from being able to casually enjoy the feature as intended," the team concluded.</p>
<p>"We are actively investigating ways to improve the feature to address these concerns. Going forward, we also plan to offer multiple ways to obtain trade tokens including through event distributions.</p>
<p>"As always, thank you for being part of the Pokémon TCG Pocket community."</p>

It’s a great addition if you and up to three buddies want to relive the halcyon days of ‘07 on a single TV, particularly if you’re using a nostalgia-inducing peripheral like the <strong>PDP Riffmaster</strong> — which is now available from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RIFFMASTER-Controller-PlayStation-Rechargeable-Officially-5/dp/B0CWN15TRF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmAMlEcH9iA" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.turtlebeach.com%2Fproducts%2Friffmaster-wireless-guitar-controller" rel="sponsored">PDP</a> for an all-time low of $109.99 ($20 off).</p><p>Much like the old guitars developed for <em>Rock Band</em>, PDP’s wireless gamepad allows you to strum along with real songs in both <em>Rock Band 4</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24041933/rock-band-4-dlc-songs-ending-fortnite-festival-harmonix">RIP</a>) and the free-to-play <em>Fortnite Festival</em>. It offers a lot of the same functionality as previous controllers, though, seeing as it’s been nearly a decade since Mad Catz’s last Stratocaster-style gamepad, the Riffmaster introduces a few modern tricks. That includes USB-C charging and a 3.5mm audio jack, along with a dedicated analog stick on the back of the neck for more straightforward navigation.</p><p>In true <em>RB4</em> fashion, the Riffmaster is also outfitted with five color-coded buttons higher up the neck and a second set lower down, each of which you can use to hammer out the various notes as they appear in their respective lanes. A strummer and a whammy bar make good on the classic <em>Rock Band</em> experience, letting you unleash vibrato on the Xbox, PlayStation, or PC with the included USB dongle.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->130</span></p><div><p>The wireless PDP Riffmaster is an alternative to Harmonix’s official <em>Rock Band 4</em> guitar.

<p>Recently, Simu Liu took to social media to suggest he was working on a live-action representation of Sleeping Dogs, the 2012 open-world game. When Sleeping Dogs was released over a decade ago, it was to critical acclaim, boasting an intense story, masterful combat mechanics, and a star-studded cast. For the longest time, fans of the one-and-done game have been holding out hope for a sequel, but it has never surfaced.</p>



<p>Now, we have confirmation that the Sleeping Dogs movie <strong>is in production</strong>. It’s being pieced together by Story Kitchen, in collaboration with Square Enix, and Simu Liu, of MCU fame, is poised to star as the game’s protagonist, Wei Shen.</p>

<h2 id="h-it-took-you-long-enough">It Took You Long Enough</h2>



<p>Sleeping Dogs was one heck of a game when it was released in 2012. This gritty, crime-fuelled title put players in control of Wei Shen, an undercover police officer infiltrating the seedy, gang-driven underbelly of Hong Kong. It was seen as a solid GTA competitor, even if it was ultimately overshadowed by the release of Grand Theft Auto 5 just a year later.</p>



<p>Following a string of successful expansions, Sleeping Dogs was effectively laid to rest, and any hope of a sequel was extinguished as the years wore on. For almost a decade, fans have been toying with rumours and suggestions of a Sleeping Dogs movie surfacing, and <strong>now</strong>, we can say for certain that it is happening.</p>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sleeping-dogs-movie-is-in-development-and-were-hearing-shang-chi-star-simu-liu-is-set-to-play-wei-shen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by IGN</a>, it was revealed that Story Kitchen (Sonic the Hedgehog, Tomb Raider, Streets of Rage) is collaborating with Square Enix to produce a Sleeping Dogs movie. The production is set to star Simu Liu as the lead character, Wei Shen. That revelation hasn’t been met with much jubilation from fans worldwide, though.</p>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-adaptation-and-sequel-mentioned-by-simu-liu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Simu Liu mentioned</a> a ‘sequel game’ for Sleeping Dogs. In 2013, a proposed follow-up game was cancelled, with the original title’s developer going bust a couple of years later.</p>



<p>Do you plan on checking out the Sleeping Dogs movie when it’s released, or is Simu Liu’s involvement presenting an issue for you? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
