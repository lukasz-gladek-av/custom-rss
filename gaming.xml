			<p>Sonic Rumble is a new party game from Sega inspired by the highly popular party game Fall Guys. The title was originally meant to launch at the end of 2024, but unfortunately, that didn't happen. This news was announced in a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000111/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> by Sega, where they went on to tease some of the features that people can expect to see in the game. Sega also went on to say:</p>
<p><em>We would like to extend a huge thank you to our players and Sonic fans for their patience in waiting for the global launch of Sonic Rumble. The team is committed to delivering a memorable experience for Sonic fans with even more new game mechanics, new features, and more exciting content to look forward</em> to.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Rumble - Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Em6-SjjaYQE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the game doesn't have a set release date yet, Sega has confirmed that the game will be coming in Spring, and even included a roadmap for the game within the blog post.</p>
<p>Sonic Rumble was already available to some degree in a pre-launch early-access period, where players would get to experiment with a limited amount of features. With the game's full global launch coming in Spring 2025, this will take the game to 1.2.0, where a competitive game mode will be added, as well as a feature called "Crew," which will allow players to team up together and play Sonic rumble.</p>
<p>For those who don't want to dedicate a significant amount of time to the game, a game mode named Quick Rumble will also be available for players at launch. Instead of a full-scale match, this instead provides matches that last one round and is perfect for those players out there who may not like long play sessions or those who don't have much time to spare.</p>
<p>In addition to the three features, Sega also spoke about how it is making Sonic Rumble "truly unique."</p>
<p><em>We're making Sonic Rumble truly unique by embracing the abilities of your favorite characters from across Sonic's universe. Ever wanted to stun rivals with Amy's Piko Piko Hammer? Now you can!</em></p>
<p>Selected characters will have a certain set of unique abilities that will give those who play them the potential to get an advantage by utilizing the abilities and help keep the gameplay fresh.</p>
<p>When Sonic Rumble does release, it will be available on iOS and Android, as well as on PC via Steam. It's not certain yet whether there are plans to bring this game to console or whether the next big release on console will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/">Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</a> first, which is set to release later this year on console and PC.</p>

<p>Sony has announced the three new games available for free for all PlayStation Plus subscribers for March 2025 will be Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Sonic Colors: Ultimate and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</p>



<p>All <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/26/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-march-dragon-age-the-veilguard-sonic-colors-ultimate-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection/?sf276488366=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">three of the games</a> will be available for PlayStation Plus members starting March 4. As with past monthly games, once you add them to your library, they will be available to download at any time as long as you have an active subscription.</p>



<p>The games will be available until March 31.</p>



<h2 id="h-march-2025-s-free-playstation-plus-games">March 2025’s Free PlayStation Plus Games</h2>



<p>Of the games coming to the service in March, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is the most notable. Released in October 2024, Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s response was mixed from both critics and consumers. The game failed to meet EA expectations, with the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-didnt-meet-revenue-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying it missed targets</a> by nearly 50%. Developer BioWare has also since made changes, including layoffs at the studio.</p>



<p>Sonic Colors: Ultimate was released in September 2021 and sees you play as Sonic on a journey to free Wisps that were captured by Dr.  Eggman. Lastly, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection was release in  August 2022 and includes a collection of 13 games released between 1989 and 1994.</p>



<p>For those who haven’t picked up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-2025-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February’s free games</a>—Payday 3, High on Life, and Pac-Man World Re-Pac—you have until March 3 to do so.</p>



<p>In addition to the new games for PlayStation Plus subscribers, those who are on Extra and Premium memberships <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-game-catalog-gets-9-games-in-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received nine new games</a> to the PlayStation Game Catalog this month.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A couple of months after the unveiling, CD Projekt Red has decided to pull the curtains back to showcase how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/">The Witcher 4's</a> debut trailer came together in partnership with <a href="https://platige.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Platige Image</a>. The developer discusses that a major theme was showcasing how Ciri is somewhat of a mirror to a Stromford girl named Mioni.</p><p dir="ltr">The behind-the-scenes video for The Witcher 4 (seen below and posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJ-B7v5tYI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on YouTube</a>) begins with director Sebastian Kalemba stating "that this is the moment to tell the story with Ciri." From there, the RPG's narrative director Philipp Weber opens up about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-first-trailer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528436/">The Witcher 4's first trailer</a>--which debuted at The Game Awards in December--follows how two women approach destiny differently.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJ-B7v5tYI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pGJ-B7v5tYI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We were thinking in the story that Mioni and Ciri are a little bit mirrors of each other," Weber said. "The traditions of Stromford essentially mean that Mioni has to be sacrificed. That's her destiny, and she accepted that destiny. Ciri is known as someone who does not accept destiny, she fights back at it."</p><p dir="ltr">CD Projekt Red notes that the reveal trailer highlights this mirroring from the get-go, as Mioni gets dressed in a village tradition and Ciri prepares in a Witcher style. Additionally, the developer points out that Ciri does things differently than Geralt would do. Last month, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-voice-actor-is-excited-to-see-the-witcher-4-focus-on-ciri/1100-6528960/">expressed his excitement about The Witcher 4 focusing on Ciri</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of the mirroring theme, the behind-the-scenes video gives insight into the production of the RPG's debut trailer. For example, Platige Image says the motion-capture session lasted around 14 days, with another three days spent for on-site shooting and testing. There's discussion about the Slavic style being used artistically as well as the animation behind the Bauk monster.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time CD Projekt Red has elaborated on the trailer, either. After the unveiling in December, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-breaks-down-new-trailer-scene-by-scene/1100-6528474/">Kalemba broke down The Witcher 4 trailer</a> and confirmed the story within the video will be seen in-game. GameSpot also got a chance to chat with Kalemba <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-on-ciri-gwent-and-in-game-romance/1100-6528580/">about Ciri, Gwent, and in-game romance</a>. There is no release date yet for the game.</p>

Well, here's a surprise. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> will be part of Sony's PlayStation Plus Essential Games for March.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's big role-playing game only launched four months ago, so it's a surprise to see it included within the subscription service so soon.
</p>
<p>
Reception to the game has been mixed, with a solid launch and a decent critical response not translating into sales. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">publisher EA said the EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard had "underperformed"</a>. This month, its boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-suggests-dragon-age-the-veilguard-might-have-sold-better-if-it-was-live-service-so-what-does-this-mean-for-mass-effect-5">Andrew Wilson suggested the game might have performed better if it was live-service</a>.
</p>
<p>
PlayStation Plus Essential games for March 2025 include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dragon Age: The Veilguard (PS5)</li>
<li>Sonic Colors: Ultimate (PS4)</li>
<li>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection (PS4/PS5)</li>
</ul>

<p>All the above join the PlayStation Plus game catalogue next Tuesday, 4th March, and you'll find more details on what else is on offer in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">full PlayStation Plus guide</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-dock-pictures-leak/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new look at the Nintendo Switch 2 dock has arrived today, thanks to some new pictures shared by a known leaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/2dH7Za0#n35dYx2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new pictures</a>, which have been shared online by the Xiahongshu forums user who obtained a CAD model of the console last year as reported on the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4119">Famiiboards forums</a>, provide a new look at the console's dock, highlighting some of the changes over the current dock, including what looks like a grid on the base of the dock, which suggests a change in the cooling and air intake over the current model.</p>
<p>Following the console's long-awaited reveal last month, Nintendo has kept pretty silent about its new system and will likely continue to do so until the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd Nintendo Direct</a>. According to a former Nintendo employee, the event won't only go over the Nintendo Switch 2 features that were briefly teased in the reveal trailer, but will also likely confirm the console's release date, which is speculated to be sometime in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">June</a> for a few reasons, so there's the chance that we won't have to wait much longer to learn when it will finally launch worldwide.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches this year. We will keep you updated on it as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fear-gog-preservation-program-monolith</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/f-e-a-r-added-to-gog-preservation-program-to-recognize-shuttered-dev.1119537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fear-gog-preservation-program-monolith<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced that it's adding 2005 horror shooter&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>to its Preservation Program ahead of schedule in order to "recognize" the contributions of shuttered developer Monolith.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1894753901540196781" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, GOG says that while&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R. Platinum&nbsp;</em>- which collects the base game and its expansions - was due to be added at "a later timeframe", the release has been accelerated to honor Monolith Productions.</p>

<p>For context, it was revealed yesterday that Monolith was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">closed down by parent company Warner Bros</a>, and that the studio's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Wonder Woman&nbsp;</em>game has been canceled.&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>developer Player First was also shut down following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">failure of the crossover fighter</a>, as was mobile studio Warner Bros San Diego.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/f.e.a.r.-gog-preservation-program-shooting.jpg?itok=NhAk4SMW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/f.e.a.r.-gog-preservation-program-shooting.jpg?itok=p7q3MxAQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>F.E.A.R. Platinum&nbsp;</em>is now a part of the GOG Preservation Program.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.</em>, GOG says that "other Monolith icons" will join the Preservation Program, and that "even more news" will be shared regarding the Program tomorrow as well. These are exciting times for game preservation.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what the GOG Preservation Program is, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">an initiative</a> started by the GOG folks to ensure that certain PC games will always be supported, regardless of whether they're receiving official support from their publishers or not.</p>

<p>Many games have already been added to the program, including titles that have been delisted by their publishers, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting" rel="nofollow">the first two&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>games</a>. Other games that are already part of the project include classics like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dino-crisis-1-2-gog-rerelease" rel="nofollow"><em>Dino Crisis</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, plus many more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gog-preservation-program-dino-crisis.jpg?itok=4wiGnRzs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gog-preservation-program-dino-crisis.jpg?itok=gSSQcij3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>is just one of many games already bearing the GOG Preservation Program stamp.</figcaption></figure><p>Other Monolith games that might make it to the Preservation Program include the likes of classic FPS&nbsp;<em>Blood</em>, cult shooter <i>The Operative: No One Lives Forever</i>, and, of course, the two&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>sequels.&nbsp;<em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&nbsp;</em>is already part of the program, but&nbsp;<em>Shadow of War&nbsp;</em>has yet to be added.</p>

<p>Sadly, Monolith and Player First are just two of the latest casualties in what is somehow becoming an increasingly tumultuous time for the industry. Other studios to close in recent months include NetEase's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">Seattle&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>studio</a>, Dr. Disrespect's ex-studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-shutdown-dr-disrespect" rel="nofollow">Midnight Society</a>, and some of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft's studios</a> as well.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Splitgate 2 Multi-Team Domination Mode And Glacier Map Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In total, there will be three new locations available in the open alpha:</p><ul><li><strong>Glacier (8v8v8)</strong> - This location is 20 times the size of any map from Splitgate and is full of icy slopes that allow players to chain speed from sliding with portal momentum</li><li><strong>Bypass (4v4)</strong> - A vertical map designed for high-flying plays, so you'll want to keep an eye on the sky</li><li><strong>Eden (4v4)</strong> - This map has plenty of portal-walls, as well as a launch-portal that can be used for daring aerial attacks</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">Cross-play</a> will also be supported, and some of the modes that'll be available to try out include Multi-Team Domination--where teams will battle to take control of four zones--and Multi-Team Hotzone, where players will battle it out to take control of a central zone.</p><p>For the new modes, 1047 Games will introduce Splitball and Firecracker to the game. Splitball is a two-team arena mode that combines classic Capture the Flag gameplay with the fast-paced strategy of Halo's Oddball, so teams will need to focus on offense and defense simultaneously. Search-and-Destroy game modes inspire Firecracker, and it involves an attacking team working to deploy the titular firecracker while the defending team attempts to stop them from setting off their fireworks.</p><p>1047 Games added that the open alpha will represent less than half of the content that will be present in Splitgate 2 when it launches later this year on PC and consoles. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-excels-at-feeling-like-its-own-thing/1100-6525852/">Splitgate 2 preview</a>, we said, "New additions like character classes and abilities help further distinguish Splitgate 2 from a field of extremely familiar shooters."</p>

                <p>GOG has announced that it is adding FEAR to its preservation program next month after the game's developer, Monolith Productions, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">shut down yesterday</a>. The version being added is the Platinum one, which includes the base game and both expansions. It's on sale right now on GOG for $1.</p><p>While FEAR was already planned to be added to the preservation program, GOG decided to accelerate the process. "Monolith Productions has given players some of the most unforgettable experiences, blending groundbreaking gameplay with rich storytelling," GOG said in a statement on <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1894753901540196781" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>. "To honor their legacy, we’re proud to announce that F.E.A.R. Platinum will be joining the GOG Preservation Program."</p><p>There are two other games in the FEAR series, including FEAR 2 and FEAR 3.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> players are reporting that some in-game children now have pregnant bellies, following the game's latest patch.
</p>
<p>
Several <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iyd8rp/umm_guys_my_kid_is_pregnant/">posts on The Sims' reddit</a> from over the past 24 hours report the issue and provide visual evidence, showing young Sims strutting about with a baby on board.
</p>
<p>
"Umm guys..." one player wrote. "My kid is pregnant..." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iy87lc/since_todays_patch_all_the_male_children_in_my/">Wrote another</a>: "Since today's patch all the male children in my game have pregnant bellies." 
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iyd8rp/umm_guys_my_kid_is_pregnant/">Umm guys… My kid is pregnant…</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FutureApricot8074/">u/FutureApricot8074</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/">thesims</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
It's unclear what new bug has caused the issue, or how widespread the appearance of pregnancy has spread.
</p>
<p>
The bright side here is that these young Sims are only appearing pregnant, rather than actually having their in-game status set to give birth. As far as players can work out, the issue is simply a visual one - though still, bizarre.
</p>
<p>
"I think the overall bug is that they're mixing up adult and child body presets somehow," one player suggested. "One in my save is very muscular suddenly and I saw another one with the classic beer belly and narrow shoulder combo. Really hope they fix it soon."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted The Sims publisher EA for more detail on what's gone wrong.
</p>
<p>This week's patch for The Sims 4 - the one that seems to have caused this issue - was meant to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-finally-adds-the-series-iconic-burglar-and-it-only-took-11-years">finally add the series' iconic burglar, after 11 years</a>. </p>
<p>Amidst some uncertainty surrounding The Sims' future, the franchise is currently celebrating its 25th anniversary with a range of events, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-and-2-patch-fixes-numerous-issues-following-farcical-re-release">somewhat wobbly remasters of The Sims and The Sims 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SEGA has provided a new release window of Spring 2025 for Sonic Rumble, along with details about new game modes and other features.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sonic Rumble’s new release window was announced in a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000111/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on its website. Along with the Spring 2025 window, the developers have provided details about new game modes and features such as Quick Rumble, Rival Rank, and the “Crews” feature. The developers have also provided a road map for the game that gives players details about what to expect until release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In update 1.1.1, the developers added 12 new stages, new co-op battles, a Special Rumble, friend invitations, and 12 new languages. The game then received the new Quick Play mode with update 1.1.2. Now, update 1.2.0 will introduce a competitive game mode, new ‘Crews’ feature, and skills for each game character.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-new-sonic-rumble-game-modes-and-features">New Sonic Rumble Game Modes and Features</h2>



<p>Sonic Rumble’s Quick Rumble is a quick-play mode that allows players to hop in and play a bite-sized one-round challenge. Rival Rank is a fresh competitive mode enabling players to showcase their skills and earn extra rewards at a new stage. The ‘Crews’ feature, on the other hand, allows players to take on the competition as a group and earn even more rewards.</p>



<p>The developers have stated they will pack Sonic Rumble with new content features before it arrives this Spring. They will also add specific abilities for each character from the Sonic Universe to make them feel truly unique, such as Amy’s Piko Piko Hammer.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Sonic Rumble, the Fall Guys-inspired party game from Sega, was supposed to launch at the end of 2024. That didn't happen, of course, and the free-to-play game is now set for launch this spring.</p><p>In a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000111/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Sega thanked fans for their patience, saying the studio is "committed to delivering a memorable experience for Sonic fans." </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em6-SjjaYQE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Em6-SjjaYQE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Sonic Rumble was already available in a pre-launch early-access period with a limited set of features. For the global launch in Spring 2025, Sega will bring the game up to 1.2.0, and this will include a new competitive game mode and the "Crew" feature that allows players to get in on the action together.</p><p>A mode called Quick Rumble will also be there at launch. This offers "bite-sized" matches that only last one round. Sega said this is aimed at people who are short on time.</p><p>Whenever it's ready, Sonic Rumble will release on iOS and Android, as well as for PC via Steam. As for the console series, the latest release was 2024's Sonic X Shadows Generations. The next big release is Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, which launches later this year for console and PC.</p><p>Outside of games, the movie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-gets-march-2027-release-date/1100-6528922/" data-ref-id="1100-6528922">Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is set for releases in theaters in March 2027</a>.

			<p>A new Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition trailer was shared online today, providing a new look at the game's mechanics and features.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioWlTKzw2VM">The new overview trailer</a>, which can be watched below, is an excellent introduction to the game, as it goes over its most important features, like exploration and traversal, the combat system, the armored vehicles Skells, online features, and more. The trailer also has something for those who played the game on Wii U, as it provides a new look at the additional story content of the Definitive Edition, which includes a new location to explore, new characters, and more.</p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition is setting out to be the best way to enjoy the game developed by Monolith Soft, thanks to its visual improvements and updated interface that make it easier to get into what can be a very overwhelming game, even for veterans of the series. You can learn more about what the game offers in its first ten or so hours by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-hands-on-impressions/">preview</a>.</p>
<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition doesn’t feel like a particularly radical upgrade through its first 10-or-so hours, but some UI updates and a limited visual makeover ought to make the game more approachable for the large majority of Switch owners who missed out on it the first time around. I still have a lot more to try out, including the game’s teased new content, but so far, it feels like X still marks the spot.</em></p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition launches on Nintendo Switch on March 20th worldwide.</p>

After passing trials at an early age, I was then molded into the tool that now serves the Imperium at Inquisitor Halikarn's request. The others may have misgivings, but I never do. The Inquisitor points, and I obey. But this hive city? This miracle? Even I have my doubts. But if there's corruption, either way, I will find it and snuff it out.</i></p>

<p>We've been fans of Cubicle 7's <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying games for a while, and you can read our review of the <em>Age of Sigmar&nbsp;Soulbound</em>&nbsp;starter set&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying Game</em> starter set&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the starter set for the other <em>Warhammer 40K</em> roleplaying system that they produce, <em>Wrath and Glory</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-roleplay-wrath-and-glory-stater-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=-2lkQ2H0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=T8cp7KQO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Imperium Maledictum</em> Starter Set includes 2 books for the GM and a load of great reference sheets for the players, with background as well as rules.</figcaption></figure><h2>Corruption and Miracles</h2>

<p>Similar to Cubicle 7's <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy roleplaying systems, their sci-fi <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> (or <em>40K </em>for short) roleplaying systems also have 2 options, with different mechanics and styles. The <em>Wrath and Glory</em> system that we've looked at <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-roleplay-wrath-and-glory-stater-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;uses 6-sided dice, similar to the tabletop wargaming system, and is much more combat-focused.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Imperium Maledictum</em> (which we are looking at here) uses a D100 system similar to that of the <em>WFRP </em>system that Cubicle 7 also produces and is much more focused on investigation and social encounters. Think of the split of systems between heroic systems using D6s (<em>Wrath and Glory</em> / <em>Soulbound</em>) and street-level using the D100 system (<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> and&nbsp;<em>Imperium Maledictum).</em></p>

<p>All of the previous starter sets we've covered recently have been out for a year or two, but the <em>Imperium Maledictum&nbsp;</em>starter set is brand new, released this month.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-5.jpg?itok=6sSfJeeg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-5.jpg?itok=OPryp0cl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As well as thematic Inquisitorial seal for Inquisitor Halikarn, you get 2 awesome custom D10.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Tools Of The Ordo Hereticus</h2>

<p>Following the pattern of the other Cubicle 7 <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying starter sets we've covered, <em>Imperium Maledictum</em> contains all the components for 6 players plus a Games Master to play through their first adventure and beyond. Each player gets a pre-generated character sheet, which we'll go into more detail about below, along with some quick reference sheets for all the rules they need to play.</p>

<p>The Games Master, who runs the adventure, gets 2 books, the&nbsp;Blazing Seraph, the core adventure and rules tutorial for <em>Imperium Maledictum,</em> and Rokarth: A Guide to the Hive, a sourcebook full of details background details for the hive, a giant city structure, and its inhabitants, from the ruling noble houses, merchant guilds ad the gangs that run the underhive.</p>

<p>It also contains some random encounter tables for the different levels of the hive that can be used to flesh out the introductory adventure or expand into a full campaign in Rokarth before picking up more&nbsp;<em>Imperium Maledictum </em>books.</p>

<p>The set also includes a custom set of dice, 2 10-sided dice, one with the 10s (10, 20, etc) and the other with 0 to 9 to show a number between 1 and 100 when rolled together. The dice have custom markings, and any 1s are represented by the InquisitoriaI I symbol. Out of all the custom dice in the 4 <em>Warhammer</em> starter sets, these are my favourite.</p>

<p>I say the same things in all my reviews of the Cubicle 7 <em>Warhammer</em>&nbsp;starter sets, that the Games Master needs to do some prep (which is standard for all GMs), but here if you're not a <em>Warhammer 40K</em> fan already it would be very helpful to read a little beyond the starter set books.</p>

<p>They do a great job of introducing the system and the hive, but a wider understanding of the setting would be beneficial, especially as this is aimed at the lower levels of society and is a lot more intrigue and investigation-based. Having a great understanding of that will make your games much more fun and vivid for your players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=wU0Nfb1Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=PRcbJE3w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The box the&nbsp;<em>Imperium Maledictum</em> Starter Set comes in turns into a GM screen with a map of the sector. Some helpful charts for the GM would have really added to the set though.</figcaption></figure><h2>Those Who Serve The Imperium</h2>

<p>The<em>&nbsp;Imperium</em><em>&nbsp;Maledictum</em> starter set includes 6 pre-generated characters, and similarly to the other starter&nbsp;sets, each character comes with a fold-out sheet full of background details to flesh out the character beyond the stats. Also, similarly, it includes a great spread of characters to introduce players to the setting.</p>

<p>Players can choose from a zealot of the Imperial creed, armed with their faith and a chainsword, a covert infiltrator, an Imperial scribe, who's knowledge and data access usually proves more useful than any of the combat effectiveness of the other characters, a sanctioned psyker, a powerful magic user allowed by the Imperium, a mechanically augmented member of the cult of the machine god, who amusingly is the best healer for the fleshier members of the team, and an Imperial soldier.</p>

<p>Unlike in the <em>Wrath and Glory</em> starter set, where some characters can be at odds with the others, here, they are all entirely dedicated to Inquisitor&nbsp;Halikarn and share the same passion for the Imperium. They're all unique characters, so they don't always get along, but they're entirely joined up about their mission and reasons for working together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=ySApL6FP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=sLrfbnXe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Imperium Maledictum</em> Starter Set incudes a great spread of characters from the setting, that all have their own character folio with some great depth.</figcaption></figure><h2>Not Only War In Warhammer 40K</h2>

<p>The <em>Imperium</em><em>&nbsp;Maledictum</em> system requires players to roll 2D10 to get a number between 1 and 100, needing to score under their skill to succeed. The GM can add or subtract to the character's skill, depending on how hard the test is. Success levels (SL) can then be used to work out how well you succeed (or fail), and the 10s number rolled is subtracted from the difficulty of the test. The number left is compared to a table to show how successful you have been.</p>

<p>There is also the opportunity to gain superiority during the adventure, which can be used to further boost your SL. This is gained by learning about the enemy, the battlefield, and each other, and the mechanic plays extremely well into the investigatory nature of the system and rewards players for doing social and research encounters rather than just blasting their way into and through situations.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Imperium Maledictum Starter Set Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The <em>Imperium</em><em>&nbsp;Maledictum</em> starter set is a great introduction to the style and mechanics of the system, but not the setting as a whole, so if everyone is completely new to <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, some background reading is advised first. The focus on the other aspects, over bringing war to your enemies (which it still does well), is really brought out with the pre-generated characters, and the adventure takes players through that.</p>

<p>The components and design are of the quality standard I've come to expect from Cubicles 7's starter sets, and the range of characters and detail in the sheets is fantastic. I think that the only thing missing from the set is a small <em>Warhammer 40K</em> primer document for those new to the setting, but that detail can be found easily enough online. Otherwise, it's a fantastic product, with a great adventure and an awesome custom dice set.</p>

            <p>
One of the internet's primordial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media_art">New Media</a> experiences is the Wiki Game - an asymmetrical "racing sim" in which you hurry from one Wikipedia page to another by clicking on the fewest number of links. Try doing that in the Museum of All Things, "a nearly-infinite virtual museum generated from Wikipedia", which you can <a href="https://mayeclair.itch.io/museum-of-all-things">download for free from Itch</a>. Devised by <a href="https://may.as/">Maya Claire</a> using the Godot Engine with audio from Neomoon's Willow Wolf, it's either a charmingly unusual way to browse a wonderful public resource or a free-associative liminal death-spiral, depending on your mood going in.
</p>
<p>
The Museum pulls down and generates new exhibition spaces from individual Wikipedia pages as you explore. Its scale is limited only by the quantity of cache memory you assign it in the settings. Needless to say, you'll need to be online for it to work. There's no attempt to disguise the procgen: instead, the simulation makes an insidiously graceful spectacle of its own self-assembly. Marble displays, neatly captioned imagery and overhead light fittings slide and rattle into view as you enter rooms (again, you can decide the proximity at which they appear in the settings). Instead of hyperlinks, there are little signs with arrows pointing you down a tunnel to a relevant exhibit.
</p>
<p>
If the Museum Of All Things is a celebration of Wikipedia, with the option of jumping out from the pause menu to visit the relevant page in a browser, the glamour of its generation quickly takes priority over the act of retrieving information. The air-con serenades you steadily as you venture down one staircase after another, pursuing a layout that is unapologetically non-Euclidean, with entire schools of thought and the wisdom of bygone ages tucked Tardis-like inside blocks a few metres wide. 
</p>
<p>
This space is vast beyond comprehension, and yet, terribly small, for each room's architecture is the same collection of assets, elegantly rearranged. The polished wooden floors reflect the exhibits but you can't see yourself in them. A distorted background tone intrudes upon the hum of the air-con - is that a tannoy announcement? Somebody singing? Oh hell, I have to get out. I tumble down the corridor to "Butter Tea", hurry on through into "List of Butter Dishes", then "Dish (food)", then "Eat", then "Chewing", then "Teeth". I pause before a diagram of a rat's incisor and I know that the rat is me. The Museum has me now. Please, come find me.

<p>Delta Force is laying down the law as an FPS not to be messed with, and its controller support keeps cropping up in combat. Mouse and keyboard players need not worry, but let’s see if Delta Force has a controller as a trusted ally.</p>



<p>The gaming market is never short of shooters—third-person, first-person, or otherwise. Black Ops 6 and Warzone remain popular despite dwindling numbers, Marvel Rivals is dominating the hero shooter genre, and Fortnite has infinite lives. Gray Zone Warfare was an example of an indie shooter trying to break out and match the extraction success of Escape From Tarkov—but Delta Force is a force in its own right.</p>



<p>The first-person shooter title has received new fans courtesy of its free <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Hawk Down Campaign DLC</a>. We’ll clear up any confusion about controller support for Team Jade’s shooter.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-delta-force-have-controller-support">Does Delta Force Have Controller Support?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Trickier than it needs to be. Credit to Team Jade</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Delta Force officially doesn’t have controller support on PC yet, meaning you either have to use keyboard and mouse or unsupported controller support.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, Delta Force doesn’t let you use a controller right now. If you want to use a controller with Delta Force, you need to enable <strong>Steam Input</strong>. This allows you to connect a controller, but the controls might be a bit funky and unstable. You might experience input issues you wouldn’t have with proper native support.</p>



<p>For now, you’re better off using a keyboard and mouse. This might not be forever though as updates have been provided concerning controller support.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-controller-support-coming-to-delta-force">When is Controller Support Coming to Delta Force?</h2>



<p><strong>The developer has confirmed controller support is coming to Delta Force in Q1 2025.</strong></p>



<p>On Dec. 5, 2024, a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2507950/discussions/0/4638240954399129918/?ctp=2#c4638240954399140782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam General Discussion thread for Delta Force</a> discussed the topic of “No controller support?” User Philx.v posed this question about Delta Force. The question wasn’t left for the community to discuss amongst itself though.</p>



<p>A Team Jade dev commented on the query: “Thank you for playing Delta Force! We’re working on adding controller support and are aiming to introduce this feature to the game by Q1 2025.” It’s looking likely that <strong>March 2025</strong> will see the addition of controller support, but this is subject to change.</p>



<p>It was rumored the support would coincide with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-console-release-window-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console launch of Delta Force</a>. However, the Delta Force console release date—as of writing—has been postponed. But it is coming, so keep those dual analog sticks warm while you wait.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nacon-connect-2025-announced-for-next-week.1119423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nacon has revealed the air date for its latest Nacon Connect presentation, which will feature information on some of the studio's previously-announced games as well as a few surprises.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out Nacon Connect 2025 next week; it's airing on March 6th at 10am Pacific (that's around 1pm Eastern and about 6pm GMT, in case you're wondering). Nacon is remaining cagey about exactly what's going to be announced during the showcase.</p>

<p>Back <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2023" rel="nofollow">in 2023</a>, Nacon gave us a look at games like&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em>,&nbsp;<em>Clash: Artifacts of Chaos</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum&nbsp;</em>(the latter of which was not yet wreathed in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lord-of-rings-gollum-studio-reportedly-abandons-game-development" rel="nofollow">tragedy that would subsume its developer</a> after its release).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robocop-rogue-city-nacon-connect.jpg?itok=G_ihziSU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robocop-rogue-city-nacon-connect.jpg?itok=k5X4lYoi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In 2023, Nacon showed off&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City&nbsp;</em>as part of its Nacon Connect presentation.</figcaption></figure><p>The festivities <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-and-more-unveiled-at-nacon-connect" rel="nofollow">returned last year</a>, when Nacon revealed survival game&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors</em>&nbsp;during Nacon Connect 2024, as well as showing off the likes of action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dragonkin: The Banished</em>,&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World</em>, and racer&nbsp;<em>Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown</em>.</p>

<p>As for what could be coming in this year's showcase, the studio's upcoming slate still contains all four of the aforementioned games, all of which are yet to receive definitive release dates (although&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>is admittedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-early-access-roadmap" rel="nofollow">out now in Early Access</a>).</p>

<p>In fact,&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-early-access-release" rel="nofollow">delayed back in August last year</a>; it was originally slated for a 2024 release, but it was subsequently pushed back to 2025.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I'd say we'll probably get a release date or a release window for&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors</em>, and I'd be surprised if we didn't hear more about Rogue Factor's&nbsp;<em>Hell Is Us&nbsp;</em>and Midgar Studio's&nbsp;<em>Edge of Memories&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>




<p>Whatever's on the way - and whatever surprises Nacon has planned - will be revealed in full during the Nacon Connect 2025 presentation, which is set to air on March 6th. You'll be able to check it out via Nacon's YouTube channel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/619605/framework-desktop-preview-hands-on<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Framework’s mission is to “fix consumer electronics, one category at a time” by making them modular, repairable, and upgradable. It’s the only laptop maker to ever <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23125965/framework-laptop-upgrade-intel-12th-gen">truly succeed</a> at that “upgradable” part. But <em>desktop</em> PCs are already modular, so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618785/framework-desktop-annoucement-price-release-date">why is Framework making one</a>?</p><p>At first, I thought it saw a unique opportunity to make <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618785/framework-desktop-annoucement-price-release-date">a cute yet badass tiny gaming PC</a> with AMD’s unusual Strix Halo processor and decided to shoot its shot. As you’ll read below, I’m excited by the result. But I also have another idea I’ll share with you afterward.</p><p>Let’s start with the gadget part: yes, the tiny 4.5-liter gaming desktop that Framework announced yesterday is just as cool in person as it was in Framework’s photos, and yes, it can game.</p><p>At first, I wasn’t sure we’d be able to meaningfully try that last part. Almost all the Framework Desktops at the company’s live event in San Francisco yesterday were either running games that don’t offer a great sense of performance (<em>Counter-Strike</em> and <em>Street Fighter</em>) or were unplugged so we could take photos from every angle. But partway through the event, someone had fired up <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and I saw my chance.</p><p>The first benchmark was promising but not exactly running smoothly, averaging just under 30fps at 4K with ray tracing, FSR upscaling, and Frame Generation turned on. But when we swapped to a native 1440p at Ultra settings, no ray tracing, and none of AMD’s fancy tricks, I saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-cyberpunk-2077-internal-pc-benchmarks-tested-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-consoles">a PS5-beating</a> 73fps average — with lows of 60fps! — from a box that’s actually smaller than a PS5 (or an Xbox Series X) in volume.</p><p>That’s because the Framework Desktop contains a new and rather unusual <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337025/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-fire-range-9955hx3d">AMD Ryzen AI Max processor</a> whose integrated Radeon 8060S graphics are as powerful as a discrete mobile graphics chip — namely, the laptop version of the Nvidia RTX 4060 — and can apparently trade blows with the mobile RTX 4070 when it gets enough sustained power like the 120 watts it can tap into here. It also shares a massive amount of unified LPDDR5x memory across the entire system, including graphics — up to 96GB of VRAM for its GPU.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335012/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-amd-ryzen-max-plus-price-specs">an Asus tablet</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339771/i-lifted-128gb-of-memory-and-the-most-powerful-integrated-graphics-with-one-hand">an HP laptop</a> also contain the same chip, the Strix Halo’s power may be constrained by its cooling and battery, and yet, unconstrained, the chip still doesn’t have enough power to supplant today’s big gaming laptops or desktops. But here, Framework has built an attractive miniature desktop that’s not quite like anything that currently exists.</p><p>It lets you pick your own front I/O ports thanks to the same expansion cards on Framework’s laptops. It has magnetic front and side panels that easily pop into place, then slide down to secure. There’s an optional carry handle that I already love — when you spin each of its halves into place, they act as the thumbscrews to keep your case fully closed, then you screw the two halves of the handle together <em>using the handle itself</em>, and it feels incredibly secure once you’re done. (See my embedded video if that sounds confusing.)</p><p>It also seems easy to personalize this case: there are 21 slots for colored plastic squares on the front panel, you can 3D print your own (I saw some Lego bits attached to 3D-printed studs on one and fake grass attached to another), and it’s incredibly easy to pop the squares out to make room for new ones if you remove the front panel first.</p><p>I’m not yet sold on this computer being easy to upgrade like Framework’s other products, though. Even forgetting the soldered memory, there’s not necessarily enough space in here to maneuver its parts like a larger desktop; I had to reach inside pretty delicately to unplug the ATX motherboard power cable and USB headers. While removing the fan, storage, and Wi-Fi modules is quite easy, I was told I’d have to disassemble the top rails of the case itself to remove the motherboard, which doesn’t have enough room to escape through the large side panel hole.</p><p>But it’s possible some of that will change before its Q3 launch; Framework stopped me before I could fully extract the board or remove the cooler to expose the Strix Halo chip, telling me that what I’d see underneath is not quite final.</p><p>Since yesterday morning’s announcement, I’ve already seen a bunch of reasonable people questioning whether this desktop makes sense — is it truly a modular desktop with no upgradable socketed CPUs, GPUs, or memory? — and noting how unusual it is for Framework to dive into a category it can’t necessarily improve.</p><p>But the more I think about it, the more I wonder if single-board computing might genuinely be a new direction for mini desktops. They’ve largely been at the mercy of the vestigial ATX motherboard spec for a long time, a spec that’s long assumed you’ll plug your memory modules and graphics cards at a 90-degree angle to your motherboard, sticking out perpendicularly, which limits the sizes and shapes of upgradable mini PC designs.</p><p>With Framework’s laptops, the reason they’re so <em>easily</em> upgradable is that Framework builds an entire computer on a swappable board, right down to the USB-C ports, save for the <em>other</em> components you might like to easily upgrade (storage, memory, and Wi-Fi / Bluetooth radios). This is only one component (memory) different from that, and maybe <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173813/this-is-what-a-desktop-motherboard-with-camm2-memory-modules-looks-like">flat-mount CAMM memory</a> can change that in future designs. (Framework’s CEO <a href="https://youtu.be/-lErGZZgUbY?si=x0208DpFBZPUPCad">told Linus</a> that CAMM wasn’t going to work for Strix Halo, though.)</p><p>Maybe Framework can help unlock more new sizes and shapes of mini PCs, especially if others follow its lead, which feels more likely now that it’s iterating on an existing standard desktop motherboard spacing pattern, rather than boards designed to fit specific Framework laptops. Maybe Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm might like to get in on single-board mini PCs that’d fit such computers, too.</p><p>Even if not, AMD seems potentially interested in doing more. At CES, I asked AMD chief gaming solutions architect Frank Azor if Strix Halo was a one-off, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/14/17346234/intel-nuc-8-pc-gaming-amd-vega-review">like the unusual Intel chip with AMD graphics that also once powered a tiny gaming PC</a>, or if it’s a new category that’ll stick around. He said he couldn’t announce any new products but noted that it was extremely expensive to build this new “Halo” tier. The hope is that it’ll create a new category by enabling laptops and ultra small form factor PCs to do things they couldn’t do before.</p><p>I also asked Azor if Strix Halo was cost-effective; specifically, if manufacturers can build systems with a single Strix Halo instead of a similarly performing discrete CPU and discrete GPU without paying more. He said yes, they could, and get the benefits of AMD’s fast unified memory as well.</p><p>I will note, though, that Framework did not promise that the Framework Desktop would have future revisions or boards available. And there’s no mention of upgradability on its product page. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24138475/framework-laptop-product-categories-new">While Framework CEO Nirav Patel told me last April</a> that every new product is the “first stake in the ground” for a new category, and that they won’t be one-offs, it’s a bit murkier whether we’ll see future Framework Desktop boards than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619586/framework-laptop-16-update-one-key-but-not-done">whether the Framework Laptop 16 will get future GPU upgrades</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
