<p>Now then, what's everyone up to this weekend?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:183377 @ 1751108433 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>With my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> P Switch journey complete, I'm excited to actually spend some time with the damn machine this weekend. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> is still tickling me in a "I can't believe I'm actually playing this" kinda way, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> is... well, it's Wind Waker! <em>On the go</em>!</p>
<p>My big plan is to play some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> over the next couple of days, though. That DK Direct has left me with Power Moons on the mind, and crossing a few more off the seemingly never-ending list is my only course of action. What a game, eh?</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m still playing quite a bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> at the moment, though I must say I’m quite tempted to dive back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/worms_armageddon_anniversary_edition">Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</a> and check out the new additions to the game line-up.</p>
<p>I’ve been a bit manic with my Switch 2 games recently; jumping between a handful of them at frequent intervals out of an abundance of excitement. I’m conscious to just slow down for a little bit and focus on one thing at a time. Probably won’t happen, though.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>. That's it. When I start it up, I'm physically unable to pull myself away for about two hours. It's a real problem, but the whole darn thing is just excellent all around. I'm going to hit the 100 hour mark on this loooong before the year is out...</p>
<p>Amazingly, I haven't actually tried out the GameCube NSO app yet, so I think a few rounds of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a> are on the docket for the weekend. But I can't leave my island alone for too long. I've got too many lives to level up.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>Still making my way around TRON: Catalyst after some unexpected plot twists. But this week’s champion on the Switch eShop is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a>. Questionable choices of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/front-mission-3-remake-appears-to-replace-2d-art-assets-with-generative-ai">generative AI usage</a> on the game’s fictional internet aside, this is one of the strongest entries in the whole franchise and while being a very “safe” remake, I quite welcome the upgraded PS1 visuals in glorious 16:9 screen ratio.</p><p>

On the Switch 2 front I got a few new bangers but am still too hooked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> and its latest free DLC update while carving my way into chapter 7 of Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut. There was also a very nice update on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/warhammer_40000_space_marine_2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II</a> that brings the new siege PVE game mode that will surely take a chunk of my weekend. Assuming I can safely ignore STEAM summer sales, that’s my weekend sorted.</p></div>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Well, I'm off for holiday the next two weeks, so I'm planning on doing some serious damage to a few things, including my game collection. I'll be playing a whole lot of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2</a> on PS5, and the amazing <strong>Dune: The Awakening</strong> on PC, those are my main priorities, and if I don't do serious hours in them on my week off it's never happening. However, my beautiful Switch 2 is also gonna be getting plenty of action, fret not</p>
<p>My sons and I will be continuing to hoover up everything in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, but I'm also making my way very steadily through the new and improved <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, which I rushed through first time out. It's got me wanting to 100% this time, though. Otherwise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Civ 7</a>, Cyberpunk 2077 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shin_megami_tensei_v">Shin Megami Tensei V</a> are all on my holiday hit-list.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend, and catch you all after a quick two-week power nap. Take care, pals!</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend... I'm on a plane! Again! But that means that perhaps it's time to catch up on my backlog. Or... time to do research for my own project! Which means that my options are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, which I'm using as inspiration for a game I'm making to learn programming</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a>, which I know I'm going to love (as I've mentioned in at least one other WAYP)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>, which I bought full price and then only played a couple of hours of</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a>, which I hear great things about</p>
<p>So many games! So little time. I haven't decided yet, which means I'll probably default to Fantasy Life... again...</p>

<h2>Fraser Gilbert, Pure Xbox Editor</h2>
<p>Hello from the world of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/">Pure Xbox</a>! I haven't delved into the world of Switch 2 yet, but I'm excited about my latest purchase for the Switch 1 - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>! I managed to pick it up at a great price on Vinted, and as someone who tends to stay away from 2D Mario (but loves <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>), I'm curious to see how I get on it.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm also still playing a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> (kinda addicted to the Koopathlon, not gonna lie), and I'm meaning to get back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ring_fit_adventure">Ring Fit Adventure</a>. I had a great streak going on Ring Fit for weeks, but things got busy around the Xbox Showcase, and I ended up neglecting it. It's time to right that wrong!</p>

			<p>With Battlefield Labs continuing its testing phase with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-will-add-more-players-to-battlefield-labs-playtesting-this-month-across-europe-north-america-and-asia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more players</a> from various regions, new leaked videos of Battlefield 6 regularly appear on the Web. The latest one<span>, featuring a full match of Rush Mode from the Alpha, was posted yesterday on the Battlefield subreddit</span>.</p>
<p>So far, feedback from the test phase (and from these leaks) appears positive. Destruction is set to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come back in a big way</a>, with the developers seeking to make it once again an integral part of the core Battlefield experience. Interestingly, destruction also causes rubble that remains on the map, creating new cover opportunities as the match goes on.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1llyrat/battlefield_6_alpha_leak_rush_game_mode_27_06_2025/">Battlefield 6 Alpha leak - Rush Game Mode ( 27_06_2025 )</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Brilliant-Sky2969/">u/Brilliant-Sky2969</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/">Battlefield</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Battlefield 6 would be revealed this Summer with a launch planned by April 2026. However, the new game was nowhere to be seen at Summer Game Fest 2025. There are two options left: either it's going to be featured during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 (airing on August 19, 2025, 8:00 PM local time) or Electronic Arts is preparing a dedicated event specifically for this unveiling.</p>
<p>Four development studios are <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> on the new Battlefield installment: franchise creator DICE is spearheading the multiplayer experience, while Criterion is working on content across both single-player and multiplayer modes. Motive is leveraging its expertise in storytelling and action (they crafted the single player campaign for Star Wars Battlefront II and worked on the Dead Space remake, in addition to making Star Wars: Squadrons) to deliver an engaging campaign for players to explore, which they <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> to be inspired by the movie Civil War and the TV show Lioness. Finally, Ripple Effect is working on a new Battlefield experience "fueled by the unique Battlefield DNA". This could be some sort of variation on the extraction shooter/battle royale formula.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will have to compete against <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. We don't have the release date yet, but it's safe to say it will be between late October and early November, just like most Call of Duty games. The new Battlefield could launch later and try to capitalize on potential discontent from COD users.</p>

<p>The once-lost GBA chapter returns this Summer</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It's been another week of action-packed showcases and to top it off, WayFoward gave fans another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>A new trailer was shared during the 'IndiaMania 2025' showcase, with extended gameplay footage on display. It highlights how this modern version of the revived GBA project will include "more action, more environments, and more transformations" than before.</p>
<p>This "once-lost chapter" in the Shantae saga is scheduled to arrive in <strong>Summer 2025</strong> on the Switch and multiple other platforms. In some related news, the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae">Shantae</a> title was recently made compatible with the Switch 2 thanks to a recent firmware system update.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Bandai Namco remastered the PlayStation Vita exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/freedom_wars_remastered">Freedom Wars</a> for the Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>If you've been wanting to give this action RPG a go since then, there's now a demo available on Nintendo's eShop. The full game is also currently on sale in the US for <strong>$29.99 USD</strong> instead of $39.99 USD.</p>
<p>In our review, we said this game was a welcome addition to the Switch library - reviving one of the PS Vita's most unique and enjoyable games, even if there were a few setbacks in terms of story and performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Its core gameplay is challenging and satisfying in equal measure, with plenty of customisable options and upgrades to keep you hooked."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:176132 @ 1751107762 -->
<p>Since launch, the development team has also rolled out some updates for the game to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/freedom-wars-remastered-updated-on-switch-here-are-the-patch-notes">improve the overall experience</a>.

<p>When the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lunar_remastered_collection">Lunar Remastered Collection</a> arrived on the Switch in April, it had a bit of a rocky physical launch.

<p>Now, though, this has changed with GungHo Online Entertainment America announcing the Althena's Treasure Box will be made available in the US and Europe as a "limited-edition" release. This special collector's boxset includes "one-of-a-kind" items based on Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete and Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ipumqw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

The top five are all worth at least $40, with the top three going above $50. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to some other sets, that's all-in-all fairly reasonable... unlike the $500 plus you're looking at for the rarest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-destined-rivals-cards">Destined Rivals singles</a> right now!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While other recent sets have more expensive cards in general amongst their top ten, the special illustration Charizard ex is still among the priciest cards in the recent TCG right now, regularly floating between $170 and $185.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Ivysaur - 167/165</h2><div catalogid="adb6b196-6dcd-4a7e-ab99-4844468d534b" id="223551"><div id="223551" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ivysaur - 167/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Glancing at 151’s full-art holofoil of <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ5OY?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ivysaur</a>, it’s not hard to understand why it’s a pricey contender to start off this list. Drawn by Yoriyuki Ikegami, who has been working on the TGC since the Crown Zenith days, this Ivysaur is a beautifully drawn card featuring the Seed Pokémon in a forest, staring into the water and seeing its former self as a Bulbasaur staring into the water.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a vibrant, colourful card with a bit of emotion under the surface. Plus, this is a solid card for gameplay as well. Its 100HP makes it a bit tanky for a Stage 1 card. While it’s three-Energy Vine Whip dealing 80 damage feels standard, Leech Seed being able to heal and pepper damage at the same time is a nice bonus. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Charmeleon - 169/165</h2></div><div catalogid="7c24db06-3ef7-4529-8884-6d778802c567" id="223549"><div id="223549" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Charmeleon - 169/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re back to a Stage 1 illustration rare, but this time of a <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q473ld?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charmeleon</a> drawn by Miki Kudo, a long-time Pokémon TCG artist who’s been around since the 2016 Generations set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When looking at all three full-art versions of the Charmander evolution chain, you can see that Kudo has gone for a mountainous theme, respective to what’s thought of as a Fire Pokémon’s natural habitat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of gameplay, needing to discard an Energy each time for the already costly Fire Blast may seem cumbersome, but its 90 damage could quickly turn the tide depending on early game situations. That said, it shouldn’t be much trouble anyway if you plan on evolving it quickly. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Bulbasaur - 166/165</h2></div><div catalogid="bed8f282-efd4-4afd-87c6-ac9db6851a4e" id="223550"><div id="223550" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bulbasaur - 166/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first of the illustration rares beyond the standard 165 cards in 151, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWYJrA?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulbasaur</a> is another Ikegami card that captures what Pokémon fans love about the original Grass starter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While collectors can enjoy its adorable face, sitting under a tree and loving life, also having Leech Seed as an attack with 70HP makes it a pretty reliable Basic Pokémon that can at least take a hit or two at the start of a match. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Alakazam ex - 201/165</h2></div><div catalogid="10253fac-98fb-4225-b3a0-8d6e29fef852" id="223541"><div id="223541" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alakazam ex - 201/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first among the pricey ex cards of 151 is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgj3E?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alakazam ex</a>, who can quickly stack some serious damage, both by using its Mind Jack to take advantage of your opponent’s benched Pokemon, and Dimensional Hand to deal damage from your own Bench. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Drawn by Shinya Komatsu, it wouldn’t be surprising if this Alakazam ex’s design is one of your favourites among 151 like it is mine. Set in the back of a home with potion bottles and books everywhere, testing its psychic abilities with those iconic spoons, it’s a thoughtfully done yet cosy sort of card that shows Komatsu understands Alakazam’s genius and drive to gain the edge in battle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Squirtle - 170/165</h2></div><div catalogid="cac6fcfd-399f-4bf5-81aa-16cdfe3d67fb" id="223540"><div id="223540" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Squirtle - 170/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The illustration rare of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgw7B?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Squirtle</a> is where 151 starts to get pricier, but it’s not hard to understand why when you look at its artwork and who illustrated it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Placing the Tiny Turtle Pokémon in the ocean water at the beach, this Squirtle was drawn by Mitsuhiro Arita, a veteran artist who has been working on Pokémon cards since the TCG’s very inception and has drawn almost 700 of them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The risk of its Withdraw attack and the two-Energy cost of a 20-damage Skullbash doesn’t make it the best gameplay-wise. And yet, with the amount of jaw-dropping detail put into Squirtle and the ocean waters themselves, this can more be considered a work of art than a playing card.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Charmander - 168/165</h2></div><div catalogid="b440d385-5030-4d17-9b9e-27c615da2908" id="223539"><div id="223539" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Charmander - 168/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that we’ve reached Kanto’s Fire-type starter, it’s the illustration rare <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL82wM?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charmander</a> that turns out to be the most valuable among the original three, compared to Squirtle and Bulbasaur. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also illustrated by Miki Kudo, you can see its design is much like Charmeleon’s in a mountainous canyon, but this time at the bottom. The crowning touch for this theme is further down this list, but its duo Fire attacks, one dealing damage and another removing a troublesome Stadium card, this Charmander is a must for any Kanto-based Fire deck when its full evolution chain has been added. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Zapdos ex - 202/165</h2></div><div catalogid="d90cc191-aa00-4caa-900a-660bf81f4aac" id="223538"><div id="223538" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zapdos ex - 202/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Conjured up by the artistic talents of Shiburingaru, who has been of part ot the Pokémon TCG since 2022’s Brilliant Stars, 151’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwOG3?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zapdos ex</a> is stunning, with a majestic illustration featuring the electric bird soaring through the sky with its fellow Legendaries, Moltres &amp; Articuno. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its ability and moveset are nothing to overlook either. Along with Voltaic Float giving it flexibility for an easy retreat, Zapdos’ Multishot Lightning attack gives it the capability to shred through your opponent’s benched Pokémon as well as those active. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Venusaur ex - 198/165</h2></div><div catalogid="9434fc56-5232-437f-b0a8-b70052fba801" id="223537"><div id="223537" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Venusaur ex - 198/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A vivid and colourful card design, even more so than its pre-evolutions, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ5LY?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Venusaur ex</a> looks both peaceful and intimidatingly stoic at the same time. Another card by Yoriuki Ikegami, it’s fitting for the fully evolved Grass-type starter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also like Bulbasaur and Ivysaur, it’s fairly tanky as well with 340HP, paired with it being able to steadily heal your team and inflict Poison plus Confusion to your enemies too. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Blastoise ex - 200/165</h2></div><div catalogid="f195fc8d-ec53-4736-a93b-bcadc97a550e" id="223536"><div id="223536" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Blastoise ex - 200/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The second most expensive card in 151 is this resplendent vibe of a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWYJLA?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blastoise ex</a> card. Another by veteran Mitsuhiro Arita, there are multiple reasons this special underwater-themed card has drawn quite a high price. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As well as its very pretty illustration facing the final Squirtle evolution underwater, it’s just as Venusaur ex, with the ability to deal more damage. While its HP isn’t as high, its Solid Shell reduces damage, while its Twin Cannon attack can deal up to 280 damage at a time at the cost of two Energy cards, even though you have to discard Energy cards each time you use it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Charizard ex - 199/165</h2></div><div catalogid="c67f18cf-0db2-4d1d-b6be-06f80faf129c" id="223535"><div id="223535" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Charizard ex - 199/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At over $173 in market price in writing, the 199 full-art <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wR0dx?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard ex</a> is both the most expensive in the Pokémon TCG’s 151 set, but also the most exquisite in terms of design. The crowning jewel of Miki Kudo’s illustrations, this Charizard completes the trilogy: starting with Charmander at the bottom of the mountainous canyon, Charmeleon slightly higher up, and Charizard itself soaring above with a fiery volcano in the background. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That, combined with the natural nostalgia for the practically priceless <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/11/pokemon-just-hit-us-in-the-nostagia-with-updated-pokemon-base-set-cards"><u>Charizard from the base set</u></a>, is arguably why this is the most expensive card in 151 by over $100. Although its Brave Wing and Explosive Vortex attacks make it a strong damage-dealer, you might want to keep this one in a special case rather than a tournament deck if you manage to pull one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like in other current sets such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-back-in-stock-amazon-new-updated-2025"><u>Prismatic Evolutions</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-destined-rivals-cards"><u>Destined Rivals</u></a>, and even the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-mega-symphonia-sets-announced-for-2025"><u>upcoming Mega Evolution set</u></a>, 151 has plenty of rare holofoil cards that have driven up a high market price on sites like TCG Player. In this case, though, it’s all of the full-art holofoil editions of Kanto favourites, also known as “illustration rares”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

<p>A fusion of "belt-scroll action and fighting games expertise"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Last year, Arc System Works lifted the lid on <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_revive">Double Dragon Revive</a></strong>, but one thing missing at the time was a Nintendo version.</p>
<p>Now, during the company's latest showcase this week, a Switch version has been confirmed for release alongside other versions of the game on <strong>23rd October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This new entry will "revive" this classic beat 'em up series in a new form tailored to modern playstyles. It will also be leveraging Arc System Works' fighting game development experience to deliver a modern beat 'em up "that pursues an exhilarating gameplay feel".</p>
<p>Development producer Tatsunori Ishikawa says the team is pouring its "full effort into development" to ensure the latest entry in this 38-year-old series is released in fighting form.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's been confirmed if you pre-order the game, you'll receive the exclusive classic <strong>Double Dragon Dodgeball</strong>. Pre-orders are also available for this upcoming release in physical and digital form.</p>
<p>Here's some additional PR from Arc System Works official game page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Double Dragon Revive - The Fusion of belt-scroll action and fighting games expertise"</p>
<p>"In Double Dragon Revive, players will find modern belt-scroll action and exhilarating gameplay. Both longtime fans and newcomers to the series will once again be able to experience the action-packed thrills of the Lee Brothers as they face off the powerful foes of their city!</p>
<p>"Players will find the beloved characters from the golden age of arcades recreated in modern 3D graphics with a unique style! Powerful foes from their past return to face off against the Lee brothers. <em>Double Dragon Revive</em> will feature familiar boss characters from earlier entries along with new bosses. Face the intimidating Shadow Warriors all in this brand new style!"</p>

With the recent release of Nintendo Switch 2, many players are jumping into the Nintendo Switch ecosystem for the first time, and there are dozens of amazing games waiting for them. There is no bigger Nintendo franchise than Super Mario, and the Nintendo Switch received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-mario-games-on-nintendo-switch">many of the plumber's best entries to date</a>. Today, you can save on select Mario games like Super Mario Odyssey, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a>, and more. It's not every day that Nintendo games go on sale, especially from the Super Mario series, so don't miss your chance to save with these limited summer deals.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Deals on Mario Games for the Switch Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury brought one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/editors-choice/games/wii-u">best Wii U games</a> to Switch, and it's better than ever with a brand-new expansion. The base game has 12 different worlds to explore, with both local and online co-op available for up to four players. New to this version of the game is Bowser's Fury, an entirely unique experience that features 100 different Cat Shines to collect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even at $41.99, Super Mario Odyssey is well worth the price of admission. It's still arguably the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-super-mario-games">best Mario game</a> to date, featuring a giant sandbox to explore, hundreds of collectibles, and an unbelievable soundtrack. For 3D platformer fans, Odyssey is nothing short of a masterpiece, and it's a game you can replay time and time again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> is another game that was given a second life on Nintendo Switch, having first released on Nintendo 3DS in 2013 as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/21/luigis-mansion-dark-moon-review">Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon</a>. Finally, there's also the Ubisoft-developed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-review">Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope</a>. This sequel to Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle improves on nearly everything from its predecessor, with all sorts of humor and chaotic battles awaiting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're buying for your Nintendo Switch console, the eShop will be your best bet. However, if you wish to purchase a key to either gift to a friend or redeem on your console, Humble Bundle has the same Mario games on sale for similar prices.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Steam Summer Sale Is Also Live Now</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to Nintendo's sale, Steam has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-summer-sale-best-pc-game-deals">also launched its annual summer sale</a> on PC games. If you're looking to find some discounts outside of Nintendo, this is one of the best times of the year to do so. Below is a quick roundup of some of the best discounts in that sale as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

                <p>A really cool parkour game is being delisted from Steam on June 30, but you still have a chance to grab it for dirt cheap. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/supermoves/" data-ref-id="5000-612689">Supermoves: World of Parkour</a> is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1959580/Supermoves_World_of_Parkour/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on sale right now for just $0.79</a> ahead of its removal next week.</p><p>Despite being a blast to play, Supermoves has had a bit of a tragic life following its release last year. Based on both critical and Steam review response, Supermoves is a blast, combining Mirror's Edge-inspired freerunning with some cool multiplayer modes. However, the game did not sell particularly well, and developer Makea Games was forced to shut down back in April.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a0SDDAIds" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W9a0SDDAIds" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Tomi Toikka, the founder and former CEO of Makea Games, stated that he has been in negotiations to try to retain control over the Supermoves IP, but to no avail. As he shared in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1959580?emclan=103582791474310960&amp;emgid=803443087671039373" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a final update</a> announcing the delisting, Makea's financing structure apparently prohibits any path for Toikka to keep the game on sale. He wrote, "After shutting down Makea Games, I had hoped I could salvage the game IP to be preserved in another game company, so players could still play the game they own online, and maybe it could see a resurgence in new players one day. But sometimes the cost of doing business is losing something you love."</p><p>As part of the process of removing the game from sale and the restrictions imposed by Makea's liquidation proceedings, Toikka is also shutting down all of Supermoves' multiplayer features. This means that the game can only be played offline, and while there is a single-player mode that will remain fully functional, much of the original game will be rendered unusable.</p><p>Being forced to essentially eliminate a large swath of his own game has, understandably, made Toikka frustrated and upset. "If you care about digital preservation, independent development, or public R&amp;D policy, I hope the fate of Supermoves sparks a wider conversation about how we keep creative work alive, even when the business behind it closes its doors," he wrote. "I'll cherish the time I spent working on the game with the greats at Makea Games forever. I just wish I could have played the game online with my future kids someday."</p><p>If you're interested in checking out the game, grab it as soon as possible, as it'll be gone for good on Monday, June 30. The base game goes for $0.79 right now, and the deluxe edition--which includes some cosmetics as well as a copy of the soundtrack--is available for $2.43.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here at Aftermath, we only pick winners, as evidenced by our decision to become the first video game website ever (to our knowledge) to <a href="https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-mayor-nyc-adrew-cuomo-eric-adams-minecraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endorse a political candidate</a> in newly minted NYC Democratic mayor-in-waiting Zohran Mamdani. The pick was a no-brainer: He speaks his mind, he wants to make the city cheaper, and he <a href="https://x.com/PanasonicDX4500/status/1937982130178691098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">probably knows who Sephiroth is</a>. But, contrary to popular belief, he’s not our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/new-york-city-might-get-its-first-gamer-mayor-years-before-winning-the-democratic-primary-11-year-old-zohran-mamdani-had-his-heart-set-on-simcity-3000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>first</em></a><em> </em>gamer mayor. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we relay some unfortunate facts.</p><p>This time around, we celebrate Mamdani’s win by bringing on a whopping TWO guests: First, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxrn.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Max Rivlin-Nadler</a> joins us to talk about how <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hell Gate</a> – a fellow worker-owned publication – punched well above its weight during this election, <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/mayoralforum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">organizing a forum</a> that leading Democratic candidates (excluding Andrew Cuomo) showed up to and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFqqr2hmqZc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosting an election night livestream</a> that aired in bars across the city.&nbsp;</p><p>Then former Kotaku writer turned professional <em>Genshin Impact</em> advocate turned laid off person (hire them!) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/six6jiang.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sisi Jiang</a> comes on to share their experience knocking on over 1,000 doors for the Mamdani campaign – part of a wider canvassing effort that resulted in an unprecedented turnout for a leftist candidate. Lastly, using the <a href="https://x.com/souljagoyteller/status/1937816227692597617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scant information available</a>, we attempt to divine what kind of gamer Mamdani is.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can get Mamdani on the show, or at least pester his people until they let us ask him who he mains in <em>Super Smash Bros</em>.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Some people have been making the assertion that Zohran is going to be our gamer mayor, simply because of his age and because he knows what <em>FIFA </em>is. But I have really bad news: Unfortunately, our first gamer mayor – at least, in terms of policy – is Eric Adams, who did actually invest millions into gaming-related initiatives.&nbsp;</p><p>Those include a degree program in game making, regular student <em>Minecraft </em>tournaments that were about combatting climate change, and most recently the NYC Video Game Festival, which took place in May and kicked off the so-called “Summer Of Games,” which encompasses a bunch of events that have happened in previous years, but packages them all together as a New York City initiative. Regrettably, considering his many other sins, Eric Adams has been kinda good on this.</p><p><strong>Sisi:</strong> You know what? This is exactly what gamers deserve. We don’t deserve a good gamer mayor; we deserve Eric Adams, gamer mayor – the same mayor who said random shit like “All my haters are the waiters at my table of success.” That is the most gamer mayor behavior.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> But I don’t think he knows games. If you tried to ask him Mario lore, he’d be like “Well, he’s the king of the Mushroom Kingdom.” He’d know enough culturally to lie about it, but it would all be just slightly off. [You’d have to tell him] “Mario’s not the king of the Mushroom Kingdom. It’s a different guy.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Even just the other day, he <a href="https://aftermath.site/kai-cenat-eric-adams-nyc-fanum-nypd-giveaway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met up with Kai Cenat</a>, one of the most popular streamers on Twitch. When he entered the room, you can hear Eric Adams saying “I just want my video game,” and it’s like, did you think you were gonna get a video game out of meeting with a Twitch streamer? Are you making a joke? The context is not fully there, but it’s a very odd thing for him to say when walking to shake hands with Kai.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’d be funny if he knew who Kefka was, but he doesn’t know who Sephiroth is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-dlc-success-bonus"><h3>Bucking The Industry Trend Of Post-Launch Layoffs, Lies Of P Devs Received $7,500 Bonuses, Switch 2s</h3></a><p>"This bonus payout is both a celebration of that achievement and a significant turning point as the Lies of P franchise progresses to its next stage.”</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/drumeo-youtube-covers"><h3>YouTube Channel Drumeo’s Freestyle Drum Covers Make Me Want To Take My Shirt Off And Yell “Hell Yeah”</h3></a><p>You haven’t lived until you’ve heard this particular cover of Bring Me The Horizon’s “Can You Feel My Heart”

                <p>If you're craving some FPS gaming this summer, you'll want to check out Humble's latest bundle deal, the 2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle. The deal lets you grab each mainline entry in the BioShock and Mafia series on PC for just $18. Like other Humble Bundle deals, the company donates a portion of proceeds to charity--in this case, the bundle supports Covenant House, which provides food, shelter, immediate crisis care, and ongoing services to homeless and trafficked young people. You can also adjust the revenue split between Humble, 2K, and Covenant House before checkout.</p><p dir="ltr">Humble's 2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle offers a tiered payment option, and the more you pay, the more games you get.</p><p dir="ltr">If you only want the Bioshock series, you can grab the base $10 tier that includes the Remastered Editions of BioShock 1 and 2, alongside the original BioShock Infinite. The enhanced editions of Bioshock 1 and 2 included in this bundle offer improved graphics and UI, with support for up to 4K resolutions. It's also worth noting that the version of Bioshock Infinite included in the bundle does not include the Season Pass DLC content, and must be purchased separately.</p><p dir="ltr">If you pay $18 or more, you'll also unlock the Definitive Edition versions of Mafia, Mafia II, and Mafia III. All three Definitive Editions feature upgraded graphics, as well as all story DLC and additional content from the original versions. Owning all three also unlocks bonus in-game costumes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4522700-4522023-mafia-bioshock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522700" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4522700-4522023-mafia-bioshock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522700"></a><figcaption>Humble's 2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4522700-4522023-mafia-bioshock.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While all six games in the bundle are first-person shooters, BioShock and Mafia offer very different gameplay experiences. The BioShock series is a more cramped, atmospheric series set in fantastical alternate-history worlds. The original BioShock was a huge hit when it first released, thanks to its solid gunplay, improvisational combat abilities, and unique, deep-sea steampunk setting of Rapture City. Bioshock 2 returns players to Rapture, and casts them as one of the first game's most intimidating enemies, the Big Daddy. BioShock Infinite breaks away from the underwater adventures of the previous two games and sends players to Columbia, an airborne city of miracles with dark secrets.</p><p dir="ltr">Mafia, on the other hand, are open-world crime thrillers, each of which takes place in a different historical era. The first Mafia game is set during the 1930s in Illinois, Mafia II spans the 1940s and 1950s in New York, and Mafia III takes place in Louisiana during the late 1960s.</p><p dir="ltr">The 2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle is available at Humble until July 9.

It also includes some bug fixes, tweaks, and improvements, such as a change to how stamina is consumed while skateboarding.</p><p>The off-road skateboard is added to the inventory on sale at the Shred Shack, where it'll cost you $1,500. While minor in the grand scheme of things, it lets you live out your mountain-boarding dreams. If you're of a certain age, it might even let you reminisce about the mountain-board levels in Rocket Power: Beach Bandits for the PS2.</p><p>This patch also tweaks a couple of other skateboarding-related things. First, the developer notes that it implemented some minor changes for skateboard animations. Second, stamina consumption while on a skateboard has changed from instantaneous to gradual, which will likely smooth out the skateboarding experience.</p><p>Other bug fixes and changes include fixing instances where players could not knock on certain doors, reducing stamina consumption while pushing on a skateboard, and improving some pricing issues. You can read all of the changes in the patch notes below.</p><p>Developer TVGS has recently stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/future-schedule-1-update-content-will-be-decided-by-players/1100-6532269/" data-ref-id="1100-6532269">big content updates will be decided on the basis of player input</a>, and that a first major update is coming soon.</p><h3>Schedule I version 0.3.6f6</h3><h4>Additions</h4><ul><li>Added off-road skateboard</li></ul><h4>Tweaks/Improvements</h4><ul><li>Skateboard stamina consumption is now gradual rather than instant.Tweaked some IK constraints for skateboard animations.</li></ul><h4>Bug fixes</h4><ul><li>Fixed not being able to knock on the door of the tall brick building next to the overpass.</li><li>Fixed not being able to knock on the doors of the blue apartment building.</li><li>Fixed skateboard pushing consuming excessive stamina.</li><li>Fixed mis-indexed loading bays at the docks warehouse.</li><li>Fixed broken font at the French restaurant.</li><li>Fixed customers accepting unpackaged product, even when displayed success chance is 1%.</li><li>Fixed the packaging station Mk2 being slower to use for NPCs compared to Mk1.</li><li>Fixed Salvador coca seed pricing.</li><li>Fixed a networth calculation bug.</li><li>Fixed a random generation bug causing 'Aspen Death' to be a very common output.</li><li>Modified the pawn shop's pricing algorithm to be a bit less predictable.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>One of the best perks of owning a Switch 2 is its exclusive <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/gamecube-games-are-coming-to-switch-2">GameCube library</a> on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. The service launched with three titles, and we’re getting our first new addition in the form of Super Mario Strikers next week.</p><p>Super Mario Strikers originally launched on GameCube in 2005 (making 2025 its 20th anniversary), and is an extreme soccer game starring the cast of the Mushroom Kingdom. The arcade-style sports title sees players executing over-the-top special shots and maneuvers, and features various game modes such as Grudge Match, Cup Battles, and Custom Battles. Like Mario Kart, players can use items such as shells and mushrooms to turn the tide of a match.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It's worth noting that Strikers was one of the confirmed "coming soon" titles shown during the GameCube library announcement trailer. Other titles shown that are slated to arrive in the near future (by Switch Online standards) include Super Mario Sunshine, Luigi's Mansion, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Chibi-Robo, Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, and Pokémon Colosseum.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers can play Super Mario Strikers when it arrives on July 3. It joins the already available The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soulcalibur II, and F-Zero GX. You can view the full list of currently available games on the entire Nintendo Switch Online classic games service <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2024/04/24/nintendo-switch-online-every-nes-snes-game-boy-n64-sega-genesis-gba-and-gamecube">here</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/27/super-mario-strikers-is-the-next-gamecube-title-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2 will bring new creatures to hunt, new weapons to forge, and new ways to deck out your hunter on Monday, June 30. A presentation during Capcom Spotlight last night detailed what the update has in store, while also teasing what’s to come in the months after.</p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, director Yuya Tokuda, and art/executive director Kaname Fujioka revealed that Lagiacrus, a beast that debuted in Monster Hunter 3 Tri and last appeared in Monster Hunter Generations, will make its return in Wilds. You can watch the lengthy presentation at the 24:10 mark.&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/omnl-EMxfYE?si=4I9NoMVVRcbwskHM" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omnl-EMxfYE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As an aquatic creature, his inclusion introduces more underwater portions to the game, as well as exclusive new actions to defend yourself while submerged. Don’t worry, though, you’ll also spend plenty of time on land fighting it. Slaying Lagiacrus rewards new materials to forge themed weapons and armor.&nbsp;</p><p>Lagiacrus won’t be coming alone. Joining it is Seregios, a creature from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate who has been revamped for Wilds. Battling Lagiacrus and Seregios will appear as 8-star tempered monsters that require a minimum Hunting Rank of 31 and completion of the main mission “A World Turned Upside Down.” For Lagiacrus, players must also complete the side mission “Forest Doshaguma.”</p>

<p>In terms of crafting, Title Update 2 also lets players craft the final weapon in a tree to unlock its design as a layered weapon. New photo mode options are on the way, such as brightness settings and filter effects, and the ability to hide their Handler, Palico, and Seikret in the Character Display tab. Players will also have the option to choose which Support Hunters they bring to their party. Finally, the update introduces new paid and free DLC, such as four free dance gestures and the premium Cosmetic DLC Pack 2.</p><p>Looking ahead to the future, Capcom also teased the arrival of Arch-tempered Uth Duna on July 30. This creature will appear as a limited-time event quest and a free challenge quest, available at HR50.</p><p>Before that, on July 23, The Festival of Accord: Flamefete seasonal celebration kicks off. It will feature limited-time Grand Hub decorations, meals, gestures, equipment, and more. The Monster Hunter Rathalos Telecaster guitar created by Fender for the series’ 20th anniversary will also reappear in the game starting on August 27. Lastly, we get a tease for Title Update 3, slated to arrive in September.</p><p>For more on Monster Hunter Wilds, check out our <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds/happy-hunting-playground">review</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/27/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-features-returning-beasts-new-cosmetic-options-and]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>If you’re looking for a webcam that works with the Nintendo Switch 2’s new GameChat mode that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/video/685229/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-c-button-mario-kart">lets you video chat with friends and see their faces within games</a>, it looks like the biggest brand in PC accessories is still your best bet.</p></div><p>Logitech is the first webcam maker to confirm to <em>The Verge</em> that the vast majority of its cameras work — all of them, in fact, save for the high-end Logitech Brio 4K.</p><p>“All of our webcams except Brio 4K work out of the box with Switch 2,” Logitech spokesperson Leila Lewis definitively tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>When the Nintendo Switch 2 launched three weeks ago, webcam manufacturers had no idea which cameras would be compatible with the new Switch, and some of the best-reviewed cameras simply didn’t work. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682008/which-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2">It was a weird mystery, a wild west</a>, and webcam makers had to figure it out on their own.</p><p>Many didn’t even have a Switch 2 to test with, my sources tell me, and had to compete with consumers to buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">the fastest-selling game console of all time</a>. Nor did Nintendo provide compatibility guidelines, it seems, as manufacturers like Elgato and Ugreen had to reverse-engineer why their seemingly compatible cameras weren’t showing up when they plugged them in.</p><p>But that mystery now seems to be solved — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato">the answers are not what we expected</a>! — and manufacturers are now seemingly free to update any of their firmware-updatable webcams and make them compatible with the new Switch.</p><p>Logitech doesn’t seem to be promising an update for the Brio 4K. “Brio 4K is built with the security features of Windows Hello that are not supported on the Switch 2 anyway,” Lewis tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>But again, all its other webcams reportedly work — which won’t be all that surprising to anyone who’s been following the webcam saga. When Nintendo and webcam makers weren’t originally able to provide lists of working webcams, Redditors <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l5mgn0/tested_usb_cameras_with_switch_2_master_list/">crowdsourced their own list,</a> which includes far more working webcams from Logitech than any other manufacturer.</p><p>A few Redditors say you can even get the Brio 4K working if you want, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1lflhz6/logitech_brio_4k_webcam_working_on_switch_2/">with a firmware downgrade</a>. Do that at your own risk, though.</p><p>So far, Elgato and Ugreen have committed to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato#:~:text=USB%20transfer%20mode-,Ugreen%20says,-its%20CM826%20/%2055512">upgrading specific cameras</a> to work with the Nintendo Switch 2. Obsbot has generically confirmed it will do some sort of firmware updates, and Insta360 is still looking into it. Anker is non-committal.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/694565/logitech-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The video game industry has received a lot of bad news lately: Even at the biggest, most profitable companies, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MDc3Mjc0NiwiZXhwIjoxNzUxMzc3NTQ2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWUQ0VkxEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.iMkVuxzB6m6hT_Rpwa-NQCTCvDapSt1DaRfpnGaqUSw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people are getting laid off</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studios are closing</a>, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/wonder-woman-video-game-canceled-gaming-studios-shut-down-1236146772/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and games are being canceled</a>. A small number of massive games — like <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>, which are both games and platforms — take up a lot of attention. It feels hard for any one new video game to succeed, which is why people were so excited to hear not only about the success of Neowiz and Round8 Studio’s <em>Lies of P</em>, but about the way the company was celebrating that success.</p><p>South Korean outlet The Elec <a href="http://.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37284" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a story last week</a> saying that Neowiz was marking the launch of its <a href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Lies of P</em> DLC <em>Overture</em></a> by giving its employees two weeks of paid time off, Nintendo Switch 2 consoles, and a $7,500 bonus. Round8 Studio head Jason Park confirmed the bonuses to Aftermath, saying that these bonuses are “a special advance payment to celebrate [the] successful launch of the DLC,” but are only one part of the total bonus that employees will receive.&nbsp;</p><p>“The substantial, performance-based incentives will continue to be paid out annually,” Park said. “We base these yearly incentives on our operating profit and distribute them to the development team. We anticipate that early next year, when the 2025 performance incentives are paid, it will be a very exciting and rewarding time for our development team.”</p><p><em>Overture</em> was released on June 6, described by Neowiz as “a dramatic prequel to the acclaimed soulslike action RPG.” Chris Person, <a href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-is-good-overture-annoucement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted <em>Lies of P</em> enjoyer</a>, said in his review of <em>Overture</em> that the DLC is “the best parts of the game executed with confidence.”</p><p>The original game was a success by the typical metrics of sales, with three million copies sold <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/lies-of-p-sales-top-three-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the studio</a>. But Park said that Round8 Studio and Neowiz aren’t necessarily concerned with the sales or revenue of the game as a “primary goal.” Instead, they aim to create games that score above 85 by fans and critics on places like Metacritic or OpenCritic. “We firmly believe that if we focus on crafting games that resonate with and are acclaimed by our fans, sales and revenue will naturally follow,” Park said.&nbsp;</p><p>This was important to how the team approached <em>Overture</em>. “When developing <em>Lies of P: Overture</em>, our focus wasn't on specific sales figures,” Park said. “Instead, we aimed to tell the untold hidden stories from the past for the fans who loved <em>Lies of P</em>, and to provide an enhanced experience that improved upon any aspects that felt lacking in the main game. Ultimately, we believe the development team created a truly satisfying result, and we also achieved our goal critics-wise. This bonus payout is both a celebration of that achievement and a significant turning point as the <em>Lies of P</em> franchise progresses to its next stage.”</p><p>Park acknowledged that the success of <em>Lies of P</em> and the <em>Overture</em> DLC — <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/lies-of-p-overture/critic-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which has an 84 rating on Metacritic</a> and <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/18664/lies-of-p-overture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an 85 rating on OpenCritic</a> — is not the work of “a single director alone.” It’s a team effort, and that’s why the entire team is rewarded in this way.</p><p>“As you know, creating a truly great game isn't possible through the efforts of a single director alone. We believe that a truly excellent game is built through the collective dedication of every developer involved in the project, all striving to make the game experience rich and immersive,” Park said.</p><p>He continued, “Many team members have even said that receiving this kind of support and encouragement from fans was a dream come true for them as developers.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-zohran-mamdani-fifa-sim-city"><h3>Congratulations To Zohran Mamdani, NYC’s (Second) Gamer Mayor</h3></a><p>"Unfortunately, our first gamer mayor – at least, in terms of policy – is Eric Adams"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/drumeo-youtube-covers"><h3>YouTube Channel Drumeo’s Freestyle Drum Covers Make Me Want To Take My Shirt Off And Yell “Hell Yeah”</h3></a><p>You haven’t lived until you’ve heard this particular cover of Bring Me The Horizon’s “Can You Feel My Heart”

                <p>Details about new multiplayer modes for the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 may have been inadvertently leaked. One of the companies involved in development on Black Ops 7 accidentally posted information about a developer-only playtest in the Xbox Call of Duty app, potentially giving a glimpse at what players can expect from the next Call of Duty title.</p><p>First <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported</a> by CharlieIntel, someone apparently set a bunch of images and message of the day cards public for an internal playtest that is scheduled for this weekend.

Use your wingsuit to flank and reach objectives before your enemy. The first team to reach the score limit wins." </p><p>The leaked details also revealed a game mode called Overload, which seems to be similar to Halo's old Neutral Assault game mode.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Gaming laptops come in various shapes and sizes, though many of the heavy hitters remain thick and beefy machines that maximize cooling to get the most out of their powerful chips. Most are awash in RGB lighting and edgy designs geared towards capital-G Gamers, but there are also thinner, lighter options that are more portable and less showy. </p><p>Our go-to recommendation that checks the boxes for most people is, and has been for a while, the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. It’s a gaming laptop that doesn’t forget the “laptop” part. The G14 is a versatile machine for both play and work, and it travels exceptionally well.</p><p>Other great, though pricey, recommendations include the big and heavy Asus ROG Strix Scar and Lenovo Legion Pro 7i, or the Razer Blade 16 for lots of graphics power in a thin and sleek design.</p><p>The most important part of any gaming laptop, just like desktop PCs, is the graphics card. Laptop GPUs can’t stack up to full-size cards that reach much higher wattage in desktops, but that doesn’t stop the likes of Nvidia from making things a little confusing with the naming scheme on its RTX brand of GeForce cards. So keep in mind that, for example, an RTX 5090 laptop card doesn’t come anywhere near the performance of a desktop 5090. Desktops may always win out in raw performance, but gaming laptops are a simpler turnkey solution that can easily go places (yes, even the ones that feel like you’re toting around a cinderblock). </p><p>Even more confusing: the same GPU in one laptop may not perform as well in another if it’s throttled by thermal constraints. We try to test a wide range of gaming laptops, as well as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops">regular laptops</a>, and these are the ones we confidently recommend.</p><div><h2>What we’re looking for</h2><section><p>Our gaming laptop testing involves a mix of synthetic benchmarks and experiential testing (playing a bunch of graphically-intensive games). We run benchmark tests like Geekbench, Cinebench, and 3DMark; as well as in-game ones from titles such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Black Myth: Wukong.

It can be your full-time gaming machine as well as your commuter-friendly everyday laptop. Asus <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155889/razer-blade-14-2024-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-comparison">redesigned it in 2024</a> and toned down its more playful aesthetics for a sleeker, refined look, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338219/blink-and-youll-miss-these-zenbook-duo-and-rog-zephyrus-updates">for 2025</a> it just got a modest chip bump with RTX 50-series graphics and the ability to charge via USB-C on either side (but you still need to use its proprietary charger for max wattage). </p><p>It now starts at $1,799.99 instead of $1,699.99. But you get a little more for your extra money since even the base Zephyrus G14 comes with a lovely, high-res OLED display capable of a 120Hz refresh rate, and it still has a great keyboard and trackpad. Games play well on high settings, though due to the thin chassis, the G14 — and even its 16-inch sibling, the Zephyrus G16 — are known to get a little hot to the touch, and their fans are quite noisy.</p><p>Zephyrus laptops are never going to offer quite the same performance as much thicker models, like the Asus ROG Strix or other chunkers running equivalent GPUs — they just don’t have as much thermal headroom. But if you want a jack-of-all-trades notebook that puts gaming at the forefront, the G14 (or G16, if you want to go bigger and have the budget) is unlikely to steer you wrong.</p><div><p id="u4ab2G"><h2>The most powerful gaming laptop</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->4800</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Top-tier gaming performance in a laptop</li><li>4K Mini LED screen is massive, looks great, and gets very bright</li><li>Mechanical keyboard is loud but feels awesome to type on</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Astronomically expensive</li><li>Battery drains very fast, even during regular tasks</li><li>Fans get loud</li><li>120Hz refresh is half the speed of cheaper laptops with 2.5K OLEDs</li></ul></div></div></div><p><em><em><strong><sub><em>CPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>GPU: </em></sub></strong><em><sub>Nvidia Geforce RTX 5080, RTX 5090 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>RAM:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 64GB, 96GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Storage:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 2TB, 6TB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Display:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 18-inch Mini LED 4K (3840 x 2400), 120Hz display, 1,000 nits, 100 percent DCI-P3 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Dimensions:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 15.9 x 12.08 x 1.26 inches / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Battery:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 99.9Whr / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Weight:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 7.93 pounds</sub></em></em></em></p><p>The MSI Titan is your pick if budget isn’t a concern. It <em>starts</em> at a ridiculous $4,799.99 with Intel’s flagship Core Ultra 9 285HX CPU and Nvidia’s second-highest GPU, the RTX 5080. The RTX 5090 configuration costs $5,799.99 or more with expanded storage and RAM. The Titan pairs these flagship chips with a massive 18-inch 4K / 120Hz Mini LED screen that gets incredibly bright, along with 64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD.</p><p>It’s loaded with RGB (including an illuminated haptic trackpad), a mechanical keyboard by SteelSeries, five USB ports (two of which are Thunderbolt 5), and a four-speaker / dual-woofer sound setup. It can tackle most games you throw at it on ultra settings. The screen may not be as fast as other laptops with 2.5K / 240Hz panels, but 4K at 18 inches looks so crisp. You have to pay out the nose for this no-holds-barred experience, but the nearly eight-pound behemoth is about as powerful as laptops get right now.</p><p>In the past, our choice for this tier of laptop was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23840504/asus-rog-strix-scar-x3d-gaming-laptop-price-review">Asus’s ROG Strix Scar 17</a> using one of AMD’s X3D chips. That model was especially unique since it was significantly cheaper (under $4,000). Perhaps the <a href="https://us-store.msi.com/Laptops/Gaming-Series/Raider-GE-Series/msi-Raider-A18-HX-A9WJG-052US">18-inch MSI Raider</a> with the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D and RTX 5090 could sway me away from the Titan, but we’ll have to try it out first. (At $5,099.99, the Raider isn’t exactly a budget pick either.)</p><div><p id="the-best-mid-to-high-tier-gaming-laptops-for-most-people"><h2><strong>The best mid-to-high-tier gaming laptops for most people</strong></h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->3200</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great graphics performance in the latest high-end games</li><li>Lots of ports and easy access to RAM / SSDs</li><li>Animated lid and wraparound RGB are fun</li><li>Very good QHD / 240Hz Mini LED screen</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Typical gaming laptop issues (pricey, hefty, and not great battery life)</li><li>Competition offers OLED screens</li><li>Customizing lid animations is a pain</li></ul></div></div></div><p><strong><sub><em>CPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>GPU: </em></sub></strong><em><sub>Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>RAM:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 32GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Storage:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 2TB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Display:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 16-inch Mini LED 2560 x 1600, 240Hz display / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Dimensions:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 13.94 x 10.55 x 0.9 to 1.21 inches / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Battery:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 90Whr </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Weight:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 6.17 pounds</sub></em></p><p>You don’t have to spend Titan money to land somewhere in the ballpark of excellent gaming performance. There are a few great options in the mid-to-high tier of gaming laptops, sporting RTX 5080 graphics (or the RTX 5070 Ti if you need to save a bit more). My top pick is the Asus ROG Strix Scar 16, followed closely by the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->2970</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great performance at 2.5K and even at 4K on an external monitor</li><li>Beautiful OLED screen</li><li>One of the best keyboards in this class of gaming laptops</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>No face or fingerprint unlock</li><li>Numpad makes things slightly cramped, with off-center trackpad</li><li>Lenovo’s apps are slightly more invasive with notifications than others</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-strix-scar-16-16-2-5k-240hz-gaming-laptop-intel-core-ultra-9-hx-32gb-ram-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-2tb-ssd-off-black%2F6632087.p%3FskuId%3D6632087" rel="sponsored">16-inch ROG Strix Scar</a> is decked out with a wraparound RGB light bar that creates a colorful underglow and a dot-matrix LED lid for adorning fun illuminated animations. The Strix Scar’s game performance is exceptional, with its RTX 5080 nearly matching the 5090 in the much thinner <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/649577/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-review">Razer Blade 16</a> — and for $1,200 less.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-pro-series/legion-pro-7i-gen-10-16-inch-intel/len101g0039">Lenovo Legion Pro 7i</a> is a similarly specced 16-incher, offering the same CPU and GPU in a better, metallic build. It’s got its share of RGB lighting, but it’s done a little more tastefully than the Asus. Meanwhile, the Strix Scar’s 2.5K / 240Hz screen is a Mini LED display that’s bright, colorful, and visually pleasing. It matches the resolution and refresh rate of the OLED on Lenovo’s Legion Pro 7i, but the OLED on the Lenovo is even better, with a punchier look.</p><p>It’s a bit of a toss-up between these two: the Lenovo has the better screen and build quality, yet it lacks face or fingerprint unlocking. But the Asus is $200 cheaper, and I prefer the trackpad and better key spacing of its numpad-less design. You can’t go wrong here, so picking one based on small nuances like that or just whatever you can get a deal on is fair. (The Lenovo has dipped to as low as $3,099 at retailers like <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1875949-REG%2Flenovo_83f50052us_16_legion_pro_7.html%2Fspecs" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a>, and a savings of $400 is significant.)</p><div><p id="csm3NI"><h2>The best budget gaming laptop</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->850</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Good pricing</li><li>AMD or Intel CPU options</li><li>RTX 4050 is fine for 1080p gaming</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>16:9 aspect ratio is outdated</li><li>Not a ton of ports, and only one of them is USB-C</li></ul></div></div></div><p><em><em><strong><sub><em>CPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> AMD Ryzen 7 7445HS, Intel Core i5-13420H / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>GPU: </em></sub></strong><em><sub>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>RAM:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 16GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Storage:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 512GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Display:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 15.6-inch IPS, 1920 x 1080, 144Hz, no touch option / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Dimensions:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 14.09 x 10.04 x 0.93 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Battery</em></sub></strong><em><sub>: 70Wh </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Weight:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 5.06 pounds</sub></em></em></em></p><p>Our previous pick among budget gaming laptops was the HP Victus 15 with an RTX 3050 GPU, which cost around $800 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23438982/hp-victus-15-gaming-laptop-review-specs-price">in 2022</a> when it wasn’t on a steep sale for less. It had a 60Hz screen and just 8GB of RAM, which feels a little paltry for gaming on Windows 11 in 2025. Now, you can get the same chassis with a 1080p / 144Hz screen, a newer RTX 4050 GPU, and either AMD Ryzen 7 7000-series or Intel 13th-Gen CPU for around $850 to $900.</p><p>Nvidia has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692045/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5050-desktop-laptop-gpu-gddr6-gddr7">recently announced its RTX 5050</a> laptop GPU, which is set to slowly trickle out into new laptops for about $999. We’ll have to see how that stacks up in future testing.</p><p>The Victus isn’t going to wow you with the best screen or highest-quality components for a keyboard or trackpad, but it does emphasize a solid graphics card in an affordable package. It’s the kind of laptop that will excel with live service games like <em>Minecraft</em> or <em>Fortnite</em>, as well as indie titles. Just don’t expect high or ultra settings on the latest AAA games. With the right expectations, a more inexpensive gaming laptop like the Victus can treat you well.</p><div><p id="VRjKsk"><h2>A sleek 16-inch gaming laptop</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->4900</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great fit, finish, and build</li><li>Slim and sleek design for a gaming laptop</li><li>Excellent OLED screen comes standard</li><li>Very good performance, especially in DLSS 4 supported games</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Starts expensive and gets expensive-er</li><li>Middling battery life</li><li>Thinness aside, minimal improvements over last year’s model</li><li>A cheaper 5080 laptop may be money better spent</li><li>The matte black finish smudges easily, and the Razer lid logo is still a little cringe</li></ul></div></div></div><p><em><em><strong><sub><em>CPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> AMD Ryzen AI 9 365, Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>GPU: </em></sub></strong><em><sub>Nvidia Geforce RTX 5060, 5070, RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080, RTX 5090 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>RAM:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 16GB, 32GB, 64GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Storage:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 1TB, 2TB, 4TB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Display:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 16-inch OLED, 2560 x 1600, 240Hz / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Dimensions:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 13.98 x 9.86 x 0.59 to 0.69 inches / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Battery</em></sub></strong><em><sub>: 90Wh / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Weight:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 4.71 pounds</sub></em></em></em></p><p>The Razer Blade 16 has long been touted as the MacBook Pro for gamers, and after thickening up for a few years, it’s back to an ultra-thin chassis without much compromise to performance. It’s flush with ports, has a great keyboard and massive trackpad, and its AMD chips can be paired with a variety of Nvidia GeForce RTX GPU — ranging from the 5060 for $2,399.99 to the top-tier 5090 for a much steeper $4,499.99.</p><p>The Blade sports a lovely 16-inch OLED display with 2560 x 1600 resolution and 240Hz refresh, even for the entry-level configuration. The look of its stealthy matte black design and green Razer logo may not be to everyone’s liking, but pair that with its thinness, and you’ve got something that can travel and blend in almost anywhere.</p><p>I tested the RTX 5090 version in our review, and while it’s impressive, it can be a little hard to justify spending $4,500 without getting the maximum capabilities of that flagship GPU, since the Blade 16’s thinness throttles the 5090. But it’s such a nice overall package if you want your gaming laptop to do it all.
