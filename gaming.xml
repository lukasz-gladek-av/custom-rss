            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The battle between <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/704606/subnautica-2-delay-krafton-unknown-worlds-bonus"><em>Subnautica 2 </em>publisher Krafton and the three former executives</a> at its developer Unknown Worlds continues. Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire — the three executives who Krafton terminated earlier this year — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/704956/subnautica-2s-fired-bosses-are-suing-krafton">have filed a lawsuit</a> detailing the alleged attempts by Krafton to torpedo the early access release of <em>Subnautica 2</em> with the express purpose of avoiding paying a promised earnout bonus of $250 million.</p><p>“Krafton’s actions have already severely damaged fan anticipation and undermined the potential release of Subnautica 2,” the lawsuit says.</p><p>That earnout was promised by Krafton to the former executives and roughly 100 developers and was to be paid should Unknown Worlds hit revenue goals by the end of 2025. <em>Subnautica 2</em>, slated for early access release sometime in late 2025, would have all but assured those goals were met.</p><p>According to the lawsuit filed today in a Delaware chancery court, Krafton also knew <em>Subnautica 2</em> was on track to meet if not exceed the revenue target to trigger the payout and began to take steps to essentially prevent that. The original <em>Subnautica</em>, an underwater survival adventure game, was a critical and commercial success, and its sequel has become the second most wishlisted game ever on Steam.</p><p>The lawsuit details a meeting between Krafton’s US and Korean employees concerning the marketing strategy for<em> Subnautica 2</em>. After that meeting, Krafton’s US employees, who worked closely with the<em> Subnautica 2</em> team, reported that Kafton’s attitude about the game had changed.</p><p>“Upon their return, the El Segundo team—Krafton employees—reported to Gill that Krafton’s leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game.”</p><p>The lawsuit additionally states that Krafton’s US employees explicitly revealed to the Unknown Worlds founders that “Krafton’s legal team was combing through the agreements looking for any opening to terminate the Founders if they proceeded with the planned release.”</p><p>The lawsuit provided the details of the deal in which Krafton purchased Unknown Worlds back in 2021. The lawsuit says that part of that deal was an agreement that the founders would maintain control of the company and the release schedule of <em>Subnautica 2</em>, while Krafton could not impede the game’s development nor fire Unknown Worlds’ founders without cause.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, Krafton launched a campaign to do both. Krafton allegedly failed to follow through on several of its development responsibilities for <em>Subnautica 2</em> including pulling marketing and localization support. “Indeed, one of Krafton’s El Segundo publishing employees reported to Gill that Krafton Headquarters told all Krafton teams to stop all creative tasks related</p><p>to Subnautica 2.”</p><p>The lawsuit claims that Krafton took these obstructionist actions to delay the game to explicitly avoid the $250 million payout. At a meeting between Krafton CEO Changhan Kim and Charlie Cleveland, Kim allegedly stated that, “if Unknown Worlds released the game on its planned timeline [...], it could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton.” Krafton declined to comment.</p><p>After the initial story broke regarding the alleged reason for <em>Subnautica</em>’s delay, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that Krafton <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707905/some-potentially-good-news-for-subnautica-2s-developers%E2%80%99">agreed to extend the timeline for the earnout</a> to account for <em>Subnautica 2’</em>s later release. Previously, the company denied that it delayed <em>Subnautica 2</em> for any other reason but to polish the game. Earlier this week, an internal document regarding <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s development <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/">were leaked on Reddit.</a> The document, consisting of two pictures taken of a computer screen, outlined the content originally planned for the game’s early access launch and how some material had to be changed or removed to meet the release date.<br>Krafton acknowledged the veracity of those documents saying, “Given these circumstances, Krafton has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to confirm the authenticity of the document,” possibly to bolster its argument that <em>Subnautica 2</em> was not ready for its early access release.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/708676/subnautica-2-former-ceo-lawsuit-krafton-sabotage]]></content:encoded>

They also say they tried to negotiate for developers who had joined the team later and were not currently eligible for bonuses to receive them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The former leaders claim that upon learning this, Krafton began to suggest the game be delayed, allegedly combing through contracts to determine if they had a legal standing to force a delay, despite the contract saying the decision lay with Unknown Worlds. They say that Krafton even went so far as to take action to make it difficult or impossible for it to release on time. Krafton began offering feedback that the game was not ready for its early access launch, pulled marketing materials, and refusing to follow through on certain pre-launch commitments. Ultimately, the founders say this culminated in Krafton letting the three of them go earlier this month and officially delaying Subnautica 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Krafton has since extended the bonus period for the remaining employees to receive their earnout if targets are hit, notably Krafton has claimed that the former leadership was eligible for 90% of the bonuses, meaning Krafton would only have to pay a maximum of $25 million if targets are met, not $250 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The founders' lawsuit accuses Krafton of breach of contract and demands payout of the full bonus promised as well as damages and other costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The drama around Subnautica 2 kicked off earlier this month when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-developers-entire-leadership-team-replaced-in-shock-move-krafton-said-will-bring-renewed-energy-and-momentum">Krafton announced suddenly</a> that it was replacing the three founders with former Striking Distance CEO Steve Papoutsis effectively immediately, which Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ousted-subnautica-2-developer-breaks-silence-after-shock-removal-to-find-that-im-no-longer-able-to-work-at-the-company-i-started-stings">claimed was a "shock" to them</a>. In the following weeks, reports have emerged regarding the $250 million bonus promised to staff, and Krafton has made statements accusing the former leaders of neglecting their duties and saying that Subnautica 2 was not in an acceptable state for launch. In particular, Krafton alleged that Cleveland was told to stop devoting time to a personal project and focus on his duties at the studio. The lawsuit, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ousted-subnautica-2-leadership-files-lawsuit-against-parent-company-krafton-as-row-over-250m-bonus-gets-personal">filed last week</a>, counters that this personal project was a Subnautica film, and was worked on at the explicit request of Krafton.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The readiness of Subnautica 2 remains an open question. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leaked documents</a> since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-drama-gets-even-messier-as-krafton-confirms-internal-document-leak-is-real">verified by Krafton</a> confirm that Unknown Worlds was receiving feedback from the publisher that the game was not ready for early access launch.

The raid happened on April 15, and police allegedly even took the YouTuber’s personal phone and didn’t return it until June. <br></p><p>According to Salicini’s video explaining the entire situation, law enforcement in Italy is apparently not required to disclose what he is being charged with or who specifically brought the charges against him until the initial investigation is finished. At that point, a judge would decide to dismiss the case or take it to trial.</p><p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Salicini about his legal issues. </p><p> The complaint Salicini received from Guardia di Finanza cites him violating Article 171ter of Italian Copyright Law. That same complaint also lists Sony and Nintendo, but it’s possible that Italy’s Ministry of Economy and Finance was responsible for bringing forward the charges against the YouTuber. Salicini believes this is because he has reviewed retro handhelds from companies like Anbernic, which sometimes come pre-loaded with classic game ROMs. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-valve-pc-dolphin-emulator-piracy-copyright-1850658946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-valve-pc-dolphin-emulator-piracy-copyright-1850658946">While emulation is legal</a></span>, ROMs exist in a weird, murky grey area.<br></p><p> The law that Salicini might have violated was written in 1941 and comes with a maximum punishment of €15,000 and up to three years of jail time. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/f/un-aiuto-per-chi-vorra-e-potra-ad-un-semplice-nerd-onesto&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/un-aiuto-per-chi-vorra-e-potra-ad-un-semplice-nerd-onesto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salicini has started a GoFundMe to help cover his legal fees</a></span>.

                <p>The MCU's version of the Fantastic Four is finally making its debut on July 25, and it will come as absolutely no surprise whatsoever that it looks like Marvel's First Family <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1945175707698499656" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will receive Fortnite skins</a> to mark the occasion. But it also appears they're bringing with them something a little more unusual skins for this sort of collaboration: a set of four pairs of Nike kicks, with each pair themed after a member of the Fantastic Four.</p><p>The shoes were added to the files with Tuesday's patch and decrypted when the shop updated on Tuesday evening. The set includes a pair of <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=19012" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Harbor Blue Air Max 90s</a> for Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=19009" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">clear Air Force 1s with a blue swoosh</a> to represent Sue Storm/the Invisible Woman, <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=19011" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">red and orange Air Max 95s</a> for Johnny Storm/the Human Torch, and <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=19010" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">orange Dunks</a> for Ben Grimm/The Thing. The set <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1945272679033929884" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will apparently have a bundle</a>, which would make this the first Kicks bundle to come with more than three pairs. We don't know when these shoes will land in the item shop, but it will likely be during the week before Fantastic Four: First Steps hits theaters on July 25.</p><p>What's particularly interesting about these shoes is that, like all Nike kicks in Fortnite, all four of these pairs are real shoes that were available to purchase. These Fantastic Four Nikes were originally released in 2006 as a tie-in with Fox's Fantastic Four movies, which hit theaters in 2005 and 2007, and you can read more about them over at <a href="https://sneakernews.com/2012/07/10/classics-revisited-nike-fantastic-four-pack-2006/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sneaker News</a>.</p><p>The best part of this set is that the clear Air Force 1s are a major new novelty for Fortnite kicks, as you can see the color of the sock that a skin is wearing with the shoes. That marks the third pair of novelty Air Force 1s, after the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=18299" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">solid white</a> and <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=18301" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">solid black</a> pairs released in May that give off unique trails as you run.</p><p>This isn't the first time Fortnite has imported some tie-in kicks to the item shop. During Star Wars season in May, the shop offered three pairs of Crocs and three pairs of Nikes that were themed after Star Wars characters.</p>

Then, next year, the game will get a physical release for Nintendo's new system with "the full base game on a 64GB cartridge."</p><p dir="ltr">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will launch September 25 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox, and Switch--with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworld-preorders-are-live-on-console-and-pc/1100-6532225/">preorders already available</a>. This is the first release window <a href="https://www.sega.com/news/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-faq" rel="nofollow ">Sega has provided</a> for the Switch 2 version, adding that Switch players who pay the $10 upgrade fee for Switch 2 will carry over their progression. That also means the Switch 2 edition of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will cost $70 (the same as PS5 and Xbox Series X) instead of Switch's price point of $60. Last but not least, cross-platform matchmaking is a go on Switch 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unknown-worlds-lawsuit-claims-krafton-intentionally-delayed-subnautica-2-to-avoid-250m-payout.1245591/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill filed a lawsuit last week alleging that publisher Krafton intentionally obstructed and delayed the development of <em>Subnautica 2</em> in what they describe in the complaint, which was unsealed to the public and reviewed by Aftermath on Wednesday, as the company's "desperate efforts to avoid paying the earnout, and its flagrant contractual breaches in pursuit of that goal."</p><p>Unknown Worlds is responsible for <em>Subnautica</em>, the 2018 underwater survival game that, by all measures, was a hit. Krafton, the major South Korean publisher known for <em>PUBG Battlegrounds</em>, acquired Unknown Worlds in 2021 for $250 million, plus a bonus of $250 million that would be paid out by meeting certain milestones. Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill were fired in July before Krafton delayed the game into 2026, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thereby putting the bonus payout in jeopardy</a>. Bloomberg reported last week that Unknown Worlds leadership intended to share the money with the studio's roughly 100 employees, which would have earned staff "hundreds of thousands of dollars to seven figures" each, per Bloomberg's report. Krafton, <a href="https://krafton.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a statement published on its website</a>, said the fired executives "abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them."</p><p>Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill disputed that, and announced they were filing a lawsuit, the details of which are now public. In it, the executives lay out the timeline that claims Krafton was worried about <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s projected success and how much money the company would have to pay out. "As momentum for <em>Subnautica 2</em> was building, the reality of what this would mean for the earnout hit Krafton. When that happened, everything changed," lawyers wrote in the complaint.&nbsp;</p><p>Several Unknown Worlds' "publishing colleagues" from Krafton's El Segundo office met with Krafton in South Korea to "finalize the marketing and advertising strategy" in April, and when they returned to the United States, told Gill that "Krafton leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game," per the complaint.</p><p>"The El Segundo colleagues informed Gill that Krafton’s legal team was combing through the agreements looking for any opening to terminate the Founders if they proceeded with the planned [redacted] release," lawyers wrote. "The El Segundo colleagues told Gill it was clear that Krafton was aiming to avoid paying the earnout."</p><p>Lawyers write that Krafton “engaged in a months-long campaign to delay <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s release,” including that the company “pulled key marketing materials, refused to follow through with crucial partnerships, and reneged on long-standing commitments to handle important prelaunch tasks.” The 58-page lawsuit, filed in early July in the Delaware Chancery Court, goes into detail on what the fired executives call an “obstructist agenda” — Krafton allegedly stopped paying vendors, which impacted Krafton’s marketing support, like trailers and a PC Gamer magazine cover; pulled localization help, back-end services like “analytics and server infrastructure,” legal support for contract review, and policy review for the game’s terms of use. The executives claim, via one Krafton employee in the El Segundo, California, office, that Krafton employees were instructed to stop “<em>all</em> creative tasks related to <em>Subnautica 2</em>” and to stop communicating with Unknown Worlds.</p><p>In May, the executives allege, Krafton “advanced the new company line” that “<em>Subnautica 2</em> was not ready.” That included a milestone review, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/lXgAdej" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which has since leaked online</a>, in which Krafton described the game as lacking polish and “market impact.” It showed biomes being removed, fewer creatures, and cut content — signifying “the need to reassess the timeline and roadmap,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the leaked documents that Krafton has since confirmed as real</a>. The executives, in the lawsuit, characterize this review as Krafton’s “obstructionist tactics,” saying that the people who did the review were not experts in survival games nor releasing early access games. The executives pushed back the feedback, according to the lawsuit, and showed that playtest data from community members “unequivocally confirmed that the game was ready to go.” (Earlier in the lawsuit, lawyers call out Krafton’s previous early access game, <em>inZOI</em>, as launching with “less content and being less developed than <em>Subnautica 2</em>; allegedly, Krafton executives expected <em>Subnautica 2</em> would “easily double” <em>inZOI</em>’s 1.1 million sold copies “with proper publishing support.”)</p><p>Krafton began sending letters — “an intimidation campaign,” per the complaint — to the founders on June 10, “falsely accus[ing] the Founders of failing to fulfill their contractual responsibilities and violating their fiduciary duties.” On June 18, according to the document, a Krafton executive met with Gill to “attempt to get the Founders to accept a lower earnout.” The executives claim the offer “did not allow them to share the earnout with the full team, so the Founders declined.” Negotiation continued through late June before Krafton fired the three executives and removed them from the Unknown Worlds board of directors. Steve Papoutsis was named CEO of Unknown Worlds and Krafton announced the game would be delayed until 2026.</p><p>“Krafton flagrantly breached both the letter and the spirit of the promises at the very core of its agreement to purchase Unknown Worlds,” lawyers wrote. “It promised to leave creative and operational control in the hands of the Founders. Promise broken. It promised to consult with the Founders before taking any action that could harm the earnout. Promise broken. It promised not to take any action with the primary business purpose of frustrating the earnout. Promise broken. And it promised not to terminate the Founders without Cause. Promise broken.”</p><p>The lawsuit also details continues in detailing what it describes as Krafton’s attempt in “harming Unknown Worlds’ relationship with its fan community” by posting on the game and studio websites “a statement apologizing for Subnautica taking ‘far longer than any of us ever intended’ and making allegations about Cleveland and McGuire’s alleged roles.” It also includes the community response to the public dispute, including headlines, YouTube screenshots, social media posts, and Reddit threads commenting on — and worrying about — the executive firings and subsequent delay.</p><p>The executives say Krafton breached their purchase agreement contract and want the court to order the company to pay up the earnout fee, reinstate the founders’ jobs and board of directors seats, and pay other damages. The purchase agreement signed by both the fired executives and Krafton allegedly made it so the founders would “maintain operational control of the Group companies in all material respects, including (for both existing and new products) product roadmap, launch, planning, partnering, budgeting and employee matters,’ so long as at least one of the three of them was still employed.”Krafton declined to comment. On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg reported</a> that Krafton intends to “extend the schedule for a potential bonus payout” for Unknown Worlds. Forty or so Unknown Worlds employees will be “eligible to share a $25 million bonus” if revenue goals are met by the end of 2025, “with a possible short-term expansion,” per the report. Bloomberg sources said the schedule for that $25 million bonus has been extended a year, and that Krafton will “advance a portion of the studio’s projected 2026 profit-sharing bonus pool,” something separate from the $25 million bonus, to all employees in 2025.</p><p>You can read the lawsuit below:</p><p><em>This story has been updated.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms"><h3>A Salute To The 13%</h3></a><p>Let them live a little</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/horror-anime-crunchyroll-netflix-hikaru-takopi"><h3>Your Guide To Feel-Bad-Anime Summer</h3></a><p>The Summer Hikaru Died and Takopi’s Original Sin are a throwback to the disturbing, horrifying anime of yesteryear</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/high-wheel-bike-race-frederick"><h3>The Penny Farthing Is Alive And Well In 2025</h3></a><p>The National Clustered Spires High Wheel Race takes place every summer in Frederick, Maryland</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/unknown-worlds-lawsuit-subnautica-2]]></content:encoded>

					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PC</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Nostalgia is only going to get you so far, when revisiting something from your youth. Sometimes it'll get you too far, and as a critic, it's important to be aware of those instances, so you're not ignoring the faults in a game or product to the detriment of your work. Thankfully, that's not something I had to worry about at all with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 when I sat down to begin playing it for my review.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>I have practically no nostalgic love for the series. I was the right age to play them growing up, I had the right console with a PlayStation 2 that still works to this day, and yet the four titans of video game history that are the four Pro Skater games, missed me as I was growing up in my gamer youth. </p>



<p>My skateboarding video game journey didn't begin until EA's Skate games. A fact that I'm slightly regretting ahead of what's sure to be a microtransaction-filled Skate 4 that might play the way I prefer, but I'm dreading will be ruined inch by inch with each monetization update that threatens to take all the fun out of just skating around and doing some sick tricks.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>That's why I've had so much fun playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4. It's not a perfect remaster, but for the most part, it accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is to be a fun return to two classic skateboarding games. Some of the new maps don't stand out as much as old classics, and I do wish that the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 half of the game was more of a faithful remaster to the original game, instead of the entire setup being changed, but it cannot be denied that these games are pure skateboarding fun. </p>



<p>All of my early interactions with the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series came from playing them at friends' houses, so this is the first time I've gotten the chance to sit with games in this series for hours. I have fond memories of playing Tony Hawk games at friends' houses, and that's where the nostalgia kicks in the most for me. Ironically, a game published by Activision is making me nostalgic for a time when you weren't chasing anything in a game beyond high scores and wacky characters, and you could unlock the full breadth of available options just through playing the game for hours. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, that's where the reality of the video game industry in 2025 kicked in for me, as I saw the two deluxe edition-exclusive characters, DOOM Guy and Revenant, on the roster of skaters. At least Bam Magera is included and unlockable through in-game progress, but I also would have personally liked to see more special characters not within the Tony Hawk universe beyond DOOM Guy, Revenant, and Michelangelo.</p>



<p>That aside, this remaster, and the time I've been spending just getting on my board and running through Foundry, the Zoo, Alcatraz, or the Airport, has honestly made me feel like I was escaping the real world in a way that few other games are able to achieve. Part of this can be chalked up to the nostalgia of it all. Another part, I recognize, comes from my real-world experience of heading out on my longboard to get out of my own head when I've needed to take some time and not think about life for a while. Riding has always been a special kind of flow state for me that I've always felt to be distinct to what I experience when I get deep into a game. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 was the closest I can remember a video game has come to getting me into that specific flow state. The gameplay gets me there, every time, and I just wish the soundtrack played a meaningful role. Your mileage may vary on the soundtrack, but the more than 50 songs featured in this remaster fail to do anything for me more often than not. I don't dislike all of the songs, but I've found that I'd rather listen to my own music library when playing, which is a tad disappointing, considering how the soundtracks to these games have been recognized as a key part of the experience. </p>



<p>Only 10 of the songs on the soundtrack are from the original game, while the rest of the 50+ titles are new. As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/less-than-20-of-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4s-soundtrack-is-made-up-of-songs-from-the-original-games/">VGC</a>, Tony Hawk himself claimed to have made a few decisions on the soundtrack and opted to change things up this time around, featuring newer or different songs from artists featured in the original games. Maybe if Tony Hawk could put some boygenius on the soundtrack, we'd have some more common musical ground.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Out of the new parks, Pinball is the standout, though most of the parks feel very new to me, since, as I've said before, this has been my first time really sitting with these parks and spending a lot of time with them. The only problem with that is that the new parks, save Pinball, negatively stand out compared to the original levels that made these games so famous in the first place. It's not that they're bad; they're just not close to the same quality as the original parks. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ultimately, my time playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 has been a much-needed break from the world. Setting my mind's clock back to a time before generative AI tools threatened everyone's jobs, before I had to worry about next month's rent, and before I spent every day watching some new atrocity pop up on my timeline. It's excellent, flowing gameplay that feeds into the kind of platforming challenges I can't get enough of is enough to have anyone daydreaming about the days of their youth.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 is a successful remaster for anyone wanting to shut out the world and grind away your problems for a while, and remember simpler times. The classic Tony Hawk gameplay only seems to have gotten better with age, and the custom parks are sure to keep you skating for hours after you've washed the career mode. Even though it's not a faithful remaster of THPS 4, and your mileage may vary on the soundtrack, any fan of the series would do themselves a disservice to skip out on grabbing this remaster bundle.</p>

          <p>Valve's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/valve-we-want-to-allow-everything-on-steam-including-something-that-you-hate/">famously permissive</a> rules for what games are and are not allowed on Steam got a little less permissive this week, seemingly in response to outside pressure from some of its partner companies. In <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamworksDocumentation/commit/fddd59b5395cc3c1c74574650dbf5784612d0521">a Tuesday update</a> to the "Rules and Guidelines" section of <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding">Steam's Onboarding Documentation</a>, the company added a new rule prohibiting "Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or Internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content."</p>
<p>On its own, the new rule seems rather vague, with no details on which of the many kinds of "adult only content" would belong in the "certain" subset prohibited by these unnamed payment processors and ISPs. But the trackers over at SteamDB <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lu32vdlsmg27">noticed</a> that the publication of the new rule coincides with <a href="https://steamdb.info/history/events/?before=64657809">the removal of dozens of Steam games</a> whose titles make reference to incest, along with a handful of sex games referencing "slave" or "prison" imagery.</p>

<p>Valve isn't alone in having de facto restrictions on content imposed on it by outside payment processors. In 2022, for instance, Visa <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/08/visa-pauses-pornhub-ad-payments-ahead-of-child-sexual-abuse-trial/">suspended all payments to Pornhub's ad network</a> after the adult video site was accused of profiting from child sexual abuse materials. And PayPal has routinely disallowed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/07/paypal-sets-down-stricter-regulations-for-file-sharing-sites/">payments to file-sharing sites</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/paypal-blocks-vpn-smartdns-providers-payments-over-copyright-violations/">VPN providers</a> over concerns surrounding piracy of copyrighted materials.</p>

But the team has gotten pretty good at detecting cheaters and banning their accounts. </p><p>One interesting stat that Chess.com’s Fair Play team shared in the blog post is that nearly 40 percent of closed accounts are less than two weeks old. This means the team’s methods of finding and punishing naughty players and bots are doing a solid job of catching cheaters early. But Chess.com thinks it can do an even better job at keeping cheaters out. </p><p>“One of the ways we’re tackling this phenomenon is by screening players more frequently early in their journey on the platform,” said Chess.com’s Fair Play team. “This means we’re generating reports for players that essentially serve as checkpoints as they play more games. It is entirely reasonable (and expected) that it may take time for someone to establish their rating, so these checkpoints go beyond games played and rating earned, but also include strength of play and over 100 other gameplay factors.”</p><p>The team also shared that it uses algorithms to look out for extraordinary examples of cheating or inhuman behavior. With only 30 people watching and 20 million games a day, it makes sense that the team would need extra help.

        <p>"Corporate cowardice in action".</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Valve has introduced new - and worryingly vague - guidelines aimed at the adult-only game development community, forbidding content that may "violate the rules and standards" set by credit card companies, internet network providers, and more.
</p>
<p>
It's not precisely clear when Valve introduced this <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding">latest rule</a> stipulating what developers "shouldn't publish on Steam", but it appears to have been added sometime in the last couple of months. So what's now banned from the platform? According to Valve, "Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by [its] payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers."
</p>
<p>
There's some small nod toward additional clarity, but it's not much. Valve suggests developers should "in particular, [avoid publishing] certain kinds of adult only content", but provides no specifics beyond that. Banks have long been skittish about providing services to businesses where sex and adult entertainment may be a factor, but - as this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/16/sex-discrimination-why-banks-shun-workers-in-adult-entertainment">2021 article from The Guardian points out</a> - their inconsistency has proven a challenge for business owners. Which might be where Valve's own decision to err on the side of vagueness was born.
</p>
<p>
Valve, of course, has made headlines recently after a number of controversial sex games appeared on its store, so it's easy enough to imagine banks and similar financial services getting uncomfortable when a platform hits the news for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk">publishing content featuring extreme sexual violence</a>. And it seems Valve may have become skittish in return. As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lu32vdlsmg27">noted by SteamDB</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-introduces-new-rule-prohibiting-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-that-might-make-visa-or-mastercard-unhappy-financial-deplatforming-in-action/">PC Gamer</a>), it appears the company - which previously said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-backs-away-from-content-policing-says-it-will-allow-everything-on-steam">would "allow everything" on Steam</a> unless illegal or "straight up trolling" - has been frantically pulling incest-themed games from its store in recent times.
</p>
<p>
The vagueness of Valve's wording means confusion and concern among adult content developers is likely to intensify as they grapple with the reality that financial institutions may now be the ultimate arbiters of ever-changing acceptability on Steam. And some have expressed concern this new authority may start impacting the availability of LGBTQIA+ content as corporations buckle to appease the US government's continuing attack on queer rights.
</p>
<p>
"It's the quiet normalisation of financial censorship and it's going to hurt LGBTQ+ games and devs," YouTuber NoahFuel Gaming <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/noahfuelgaming.bsky.social/post/3lu2ngnm3hc26">wrote on social media</a>. "Banks like Visa and Mastercard are now backdoor moral authorities... They already pressured Patreon, OnlyFans, and others to remove NSFW content. Now Steam is next. And guess who they'll target first? Queer, transgressive, or "unusual" games... Queer content gets flagged as 'explicit' even when it's PG... If banks raise a fuss, they'll nuke anything that could be controversial. And they'll say, 'It's out of our hands.' Corporate cowardice in action."
</p>
<p>
Valve hasn't yet publicly addressed its new policy but we've reached out for more information.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo just announced the two leads of its live-action <em>Legend of Zelda</em> film, and unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690607/chris-pratt-mario-nintendo-illumination-animated-movie-december-2022-release-date-cast">celebrity-packed <em>Mario</em> movie cast</a>, <em>Zelda</em> will star <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/708143/nintendo-zelda-movie-casting-bo-bragason-benjamin-evan-ainsworth">two young, lesser-known actors</a>: Bo Bragason as Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. You may not have heard of them, but there’s a good chance they’re going to be a part of the franchise for a while.</p><p>Choosing stars who are in their teens (Ainsworth) and early 20s (Bragason) makes a lot of sense. In the games, even the “older” Links and Zeldas are still typically young adults, so Bragason and Ainsworth seem like they’ll fit the mold. (Yes, I know Link and Zelda are technically older than 100 in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom,</em> but they look good for their age.) The choice of younger actors gives them both room to grow into the roles in any potential sequels — which, given Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671949/nintendo-switch-2-era-risks">growing ambitions beyond video games</a>, the company must already be starting to consider.</p><p>We can look at Nintendo’s recent expansion of Mario beyond games as an example of what might be in store for <em>Zelda</em>. <em>The Super Mario Bros. </em>movie, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review">surprisingly good</a>, quickly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">surpassed $1 billion at the box office</a>, and a sequel is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/10/24096213/super-mario-bros-movie-2-sequel-2026">set to debut in 2026</a>. A <em>Donkey Kong</em> spinoff <a href="https://www.theverge.com/analysis/706610/donkey-kong-movie-copyright-notice-nintendo-strategy">might also be in the works</a>. Both franchises are featured in Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan">theme</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293604/super-nintendo-world-theme-park-donkey-kong-country-osaka-date">parks</a>, too. It’s not hard to imagine Nintendo applying the same blueprint for the Zelda franchise.</p><p>The <em>Zelda</em> movie has the potential to be a similarly huge hit. The franchise is arguably as popular as it has ever been; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> was the fourth-best-selling game on the original Switch, after all, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> was an excellent followup. If this first <em>Zelda</em> film is even halfway decent, Bragason and Ainsworth might be representative of Zelda and Link for an entire generation of fans.</p><p>The two aren’t complete unknowns – Ainsworth voiced Pinocchio in Disney’s 2022 version of the film and played a major role in Netflix’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21508362/haunting-of-bly-manor-review-netflix"><em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em></a> – but Nintendo is still taking a gamble by hinging a potentially risky adaptation on them. They’ll likely be in good hands with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23951339/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-live-action-nintendo">Wes Ball as director</a>, though, who is known for his work directing the <em>Maze Runner</em> trilogy and <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>.</p><p>Nintendo is borrowing from a proven strategy here. Warner Bros. recently introduced its <em>second</em> trio of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/674752/hbo-harry-potter-cast-dominic-mclaughlin-arabella-stanton-alastair-stout">young leads for <em>Harry Potter</em></a>, and they’ll be the faces of a new decade-long series for HBO, much like Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint were before them for the <em>Harry Potter</em> films. Netflix has similarly stuck with the <em>Stranger Things</em> kids <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707540/stranger-things-5-teaser-trailer-netflix">all the way through the end</a>, even though the first season debuted nearly 10 years ago.</p><p><em>The Legend of Zelda</em> film could be Nintendo’s next breakout cultural moment when it debuts <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682751/legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie-date-delay">in May 2027</a>. If it is, we’ll probably be seeing a lot more adventures starring Zelda and Link.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/708494/nintendo-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-leads-stars-long-time]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">GameFly is running an <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xJP1?object_uuid=848aaa0c-ba68-4e83-981e-ef794d5afd9c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">impressive sale</a> right now on PS5 and Xbox Series X games, plus Blu-ray movies. It’s definitely worth checking out if you’re looking to save money on recent AAA games. You can get PS5 deals like Elden Ring Nightreign for $27.99 and Doom: The Dark Ages for $39.99. You’re not likely to find those kinds of discounts anywhere else for quite a while on new copies of those games, especially after Prime Day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The caveat is that all of the games are pre-played (more info on that below). You can shop the <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xJP1?object_uuid=848aaa0c-ba68-4e83-981e-ef794d5afd9c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">whole sale here</a>, or read on for our picks.</p><p id="shop-the-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Shop the sale">Save Up to 50% Off Pre-Played Games at GameFly </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun twist on the From Software formula perfected in the original Elden Ring. It turns the game into a three-player co-op roguelite. It might not be for everyone (see our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review">review</a> for details), but $27.99 makes it much more palatable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom: The Dark Ages may be available for Xbox players on Game Pass, but that doesn’t apply to PS5 owners. So this is a great way to play through it at significantly less than the new game MSRP. Check out our 9/10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a> for more info on that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also on sale are Civ 7, Monster Hunter Wilds, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and many more. You can even save cash on Blu-rays like Mickey 17 and Mufasa: The Lion King. Lots of savings to go around.</p><p id="should-you-buy-from-gamefly"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Should you buy from GameFly?">Is GameFly a Good Place to Buy Used Games?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything you buy from GameFly is “pre-played,” meaning it’s been sent out to GameFly customers. That said, everything GameFly sells in these sales is in good condition. It also comes with brand-new new cases and inserts where applicable. I’ve bought games in previous GameFly sales, and I never would’ve guessed they were used, aside from arriving without shrink wrap. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these games are also “100% guaranteed,” so if you have any problem with them, you can get a full refund. Buying pre-played games is a good way to pick up recent games at way cheaper than new pricing. And this sale knocks even more money off the pre-played discount, which is essentially stacking a deal on a deal. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

Including the INIU 10,000mAh 45W Power Bank for $12, a 5-pack of six-foot USB-C charging cables for $6.99, the Superman 2025 Steelbook 4K Blu-ray, and TCL’s 55-inch QM6K Mini LED Smart TV for $449.99, $350 off its usual price.

This also mean said chase cards are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-cards-2025">worth significantly less</a>, but Japanese cards are far easier to get perfect grades in given they're always busting out of booster packs in perfect condition. Want a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Pokémon card collection</a> on a budget?

Whilst that unfortunately means it's still way above MSRP, some of these sets are at the best prices they've been in the last month.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">This Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet and Violet base set prices have been shifting noticeably ahead of the final sets Black Bolt and White Flare, with Psychic-type Illustration Rares like Ralts 211/198 and Kirlia 212/198 each climbing 28 percent this month while Gardevoir ex 245/198 now sits at $54.99 after a 25 percent jump. Miraidon ex and Koraidon ex are both trending upward as well, holding value around $23.99 each. At the same time several cards are sliding down as Fidough 213/198 dropped 15 percent, Armarouge 203/198 is down 11 percent, and Pachirisu 208/198 fell 19 percent. The steepest dips hit Dondozo 207/198 and Starly 221/198, now around $9.99 each after dropping 30 percent and 37 percent respectively, reflecting a market that is narrowing in on long-term playability and collector interest.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As newer Pokémon TCG sets grab the spotlight, Paradox Rift is seeing its high-rarity SIR ex cards drop in value while several Illustration Rares quietly climb due to shifting collector interest and low inventory. Cards like Altaria ex, Gholdengo ex, and Steelix have dropped between 16% and 25%, while Illustration Rares including Morpeko, Plusle, Minun, Groudon, and Iron Valiant ex are climbing fast, with Morpeko leading at a 43% increase. This mirrors earlier trends where less flashy cards gain traction as availability tightens.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Edge of Eternities Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering’s next set, Edge of Eternities, officially launches August 1 with preorders now live on Amazon for bundles including Play Booster Boxes, Commander Decks, and Collector Booster Boxes. Blending Magic’s iconic gameplay with science fantasy themes such as flying space whales and alien races, Edge of Eternities introduces four new mechanics: Void, Warp, Station, and Lander Tokens. Fan-favorite tribes like Eldrazi and Slivers return alongside reprints of coveted Shock Lands. Wizards of the Coast is gradually revealing more details, with a full card gallery arriving July 18 and prerelease events happening July 25 through 31, so now is the time to lock in your preorder if you want first access.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Pricing Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a bit of a mixed back for Magic: The Gathering prices this week, so it's always worth double checking eBay before TCG Player and Amazon for a last minute bargain. Also, whoever thinks a Theros Beyond Death booster is worth north of $700 needs to have a word with themselves.</p><p id="nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-worl"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart Worl">Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225375"><div id="225375" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Invites available now on Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still struggling to get your hands on Nintendo Switch 2?

I also like that you can rewind or fast forward during duels which makes testing out new strategies a lot more flexible.</p></div><p id="superman-blu-ray-digital"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)">Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225245"><div id="225245" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I was hoping to grab the steelbook edition of Superman but it looks like that’s already sold out. The standard Blu-ray is still available though if you’re just looking to watch the movie without the collectible packaging. James Gunn delivers a Superman story that feels fresh while staying true to the character. There’s a solid balance of action, humor, and heart, and it sets a strong tone for what’s next in the DCU. If you’re into superhero movies that keep things grounded while still feeling big and cinematic, this one’s worth picking up.</p></div><p id="split-fiction-ps5"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Split Fiction (PS5)">Split Fiction (PS5)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225246"><div id="225246" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Split Fiction (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I grabbed Split Fiction on PS5 recently and it’s been a great pick for co-op sessions. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">We gave it a 9 out of 10</a> and after playing it I can see why. It focuses on split-screen teamwork where you and a partner have to sync your actions to clear each challenge. I really like how each level introduces new mechanics and switches between sci-fi and fantasy settings so it never feels repetitive. Mio and Zoe’s story adds some extra depth too since they do not get along at first but that dynamic makes the whole adventure feel more personal as things ramp up.</p></div><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-earbuds"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds">Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225247"><div id="225247" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">AirPods Pro 2 are one of those earbuds I keep noticing for their mix of sound quality and thoughtful features. At $199, they offer a strong balance of value and performance. The active noise cancellation blocks out a lot of background noise while adaptive audio automatically adjusts based on your surroundings. You get four sizes of silicone tips for a customizable fit, and once those are set they stay comfortable even through longer listening sessions. The personalized spatial audio and hearing aid features add extra depth, giving them more flexibility than just a standard pair of wireless earbuds.</p></div><p id="dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switc">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225248"><div id="225248" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake</a> caught my attention for how it brings that classic RPG feel into a modern format. At $34.99, it’s a pretty big discount compared to the usual price, which makes it an easy pick if you’ve been waiting to try it. The HD-2D visuals really stand out with that mix of pixel art and depth that makes the world feel fresh but still familiar. Battles stick to the traditional turn-based system but with small updates like adjustable speed and auto-battle, so it doesn’t feel stuck in the past. The soundtrack ties it all together with that same timeless vibe DRAGON QUEST fans already know.</p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-illustrated-t"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (T">The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (Tolkien Illustrated Editions)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225249"><div id="225249" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (Tolkien Illustrated Editions)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lord of the Rings Illustrated Edition feels like more than just a regular hardcover.

That's because Update 2.3 is on the way, arriving tomorrow, and features new quests, vehicles, Photo Mode additions, PC tech improvements, VRR on consoles, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Update 2.3 is the last big update, says CD Projekt Red (we believe them this time, considering Cyberpunk 2 has moved into pre-production as of May), and hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC tomorrow. Switch 2 players running through Night City via Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will have to wait for a "later date" to receive the Update 2.3 additions, however.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/McF9Ak1r7L8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/McF9Ak1r7L8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"This patch introduces 4 new vehicles, the AutoDrive feature, self-driving Delamain cabs, and more," the <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes">patch notes</a> read. "It also contains update for CrystalCoat and Photo Mode, as well as support for AMD FSR 3.1 Frame Generation, Intel XeSS 2.0, and HDR10+ gaming on PC, among others."</p><p>Update 2.3 also brings Cyberpunk 2077 to Mac computers running on Apple Silicon. You can purchase the game via the Mac App Store and the other usual PC storefronts.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year, Ubisoft <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a $1.25 billion bailout from Tencent</a>, resulting in the creation of a new subsidiary – partially owned by Tencent – that will take charge of Ubisoft’s three biggest series: <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. While details of how the operation will function remain sparse, we now know who’ll head it up: co-CEOs Christophe Derennes, former head of Ubisoft Montreal and managing director for North America who’s been with the company for over three decades, and Charlie Guillemot, whose main distinguishing feature is that he’s Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot’s son.&nbsp;</p><p>Is Guillemot the very definition of a nepo baby? I mean, yeah, sure, probably. Don’t worry about it, though!</p><p>"I’d like to address this question directly, if I may," Guillemot said in response to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a question from Variety about nepotism</a>. "I completely understand where it comes from, and I want to be clear about it. Yes, I’m Yves’ son. That’s not something I hide from. But my appointment isn’t only about family ties; it’s about what Ubisoft needs at this moment. ... What matters now isn’t my name, it’s the work ahead."</p><p>Guillemot also reassured Variety that he’s spent the past decade "building experience both inside and outside Ubisoft,” which is true. For example, he ran the Ubisoft studio behind <em>Tom Clancy’s Elite Squad</em>, which found itself in the crosshairs of controversy in 2020 after launching with an intro that was widely panned for <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-apologizes-for-tom-clancy-game-imagery-that-sug-1844892904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playing on right-wing conspiracies about Black Lives Matter</a>. He then struck out on his own to launch a Web3 studio called Unagi, which has predictably pivoted into AI but is also still clinging desperately to NFTs, before beaming back onto the Ubisoft fathership.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft has faced a great deal of criticism for its continued status as a pop ‘n’ pop (‘n’ pop ‘n’ pop) shop. The company was founded by five Guillemot brothers – Yves, Christian, Claude, Gérard, and Michel – in 1986, with four remaining in positions of power at the company to this day. However, recent times have not been kind to the Guillemot family’s reputation; allegations of widespread sexual abuse, harassment, and discrimination <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-and-insomniac-face-dozens-of-allegations-over-mistreatment-of-women" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit the company in 2020</a>, leading to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-france" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the conviction of three former Ubisoft executives</a> following a 2025 trial.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft’s business has also swirled a precarious drain in recent years, with sales of expected hits, like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, coming in “<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/star-wars-outlaws-coming-to-steam-in-november-sales-have-been-softer-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">softer than expected</a>” while longer-tail online games like <em>Skull And Bones</em> and <em>XDefiant</em> have floundered and failed. Despite this, the Guillemot family reportedly <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ubisoft-buyout-talks-are-reportedly-progressing-but-theres-one-small-hitch-the-guillemot-family-wants-to-stay-in-charge-but-tencent-isnt-so-sure-about-that/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fought to remain in charge</a> during pre-deal talks with Tencent, and now, here we are.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, best of luck to Charlie in his new role. After all, everyone deserves a little nepotism, as a treat.</p><p>“Ubisoft is at a pivotal moment,” he told Variety. “What’s expected of me is to help push the company forward by bringing energy, focus, and by relying on the incredible expertise that already exists across the teams. I see myself as someone here to contribute, support, and help create the right conditions are in place for everyone to do their best work.”</p><p>Sure! Cool!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft have recently <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/">set up a new subsidiary</a> within their company which will focus on three&nbsp;core games, Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry.&nbsp; The set-up also involves $1.25 billion in investment from the French game publisher from Tencent.</p>
<p>Heading up this new take are two fresh-faced individuals ready to bring a new dynamic to Ubi.. oh wait. Scratch that, it’s being headed up by Christophe Derennes who launched the Montreal studio, and has been with the company 35 years, and Charlie <em>“Do you know who my Dad is”</em> Guillemot. Charlie is most famous for running Owlient, which made free to play game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howrse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howrse</a> in the late 2010s, and Unagi, which has made four web3 games that <a href="https://www.unagi.games/#token" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use NFTS</a>.&nbsp; Sounds just the chap to look after Rainbow Six, maybe they will add horseback combat with some gorgeous NFT horse armour.</p>


<p>We know that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/10/assassins-creed-codename-red-is-going-to-japan-codename-hexe-infinity-also-confirmed/">Assassin’s Creed: Codename Hexe</a> is on the way along with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/10/assassins-creed-codename-red-is-going-to-japan-codename-hexe-infinity-also-confirmed/">Animus hub</a> which will tie together all the games, but we’ve not heard anything about a new Rainbow Six or Far Cry.</p>
<p>“Today Ubisoft is opening a new chapter in its history,” Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot wrote for the announcement. “As we accelerate the company’s transformation, this is a foundational step in changing Ubisoft’s operating model that will enable us to be both agile and ambitious. We are focused on building strong game ecosystems designed to become evergreen, growing high-performing brands and creating new IPs powered by cutting-edge and emerging technologies.”</p>

<p>Rumours of a hostile takeover of Ubisoft appear quite regularly, but so far, the Guillemot family has remained in charge.</p>

<figure><a title="Dum Dum - Cyberpunk" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/16c53ae5eadcd/dum-dum-cyberpunk.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CDPR</em></figcaption></figure><p>Cd Projekt Red <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes">has announced</a> a new update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> on Switch 2, adding in four new cars and a boatload of improvements.</p>
<p>There's no release date for the update at the time of writing, but we'd wager it probably won't be too far off. It's hitting the PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC tomorrow (that's <strong>17th July 2025</strong>). We'll let you know as soon as we get more details on the Switch 2 release.</p>
<p>For now, let's see what's in store, shall we?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Vehicles</strong></p>
<p>Added 4 new vehicles, including several Side Jobs tied to acquiring them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete <em>The Hunt</em> and <em>The Beast In Me</em>).</p>
<p>An additional side job unlocks the CrystalCoat™ feature for it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred"</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete <em>The Beast in Me: Badlands</em>, <em>The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo</em>, <em>Transmission,</em> and <em>Search and Destroy</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Reward from a new side job (to unlock, purchase 1 Yaiba vehicle, purchase at least 3 vehicles through AUTOFIXER, and complete <em>Reported Crime: You Play with Fire...</em>).</p>
<p>If you fail the side job, the vehicle can later be purchased through AUTOFIXER.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Available for purchase on AUTOFIXER.</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing AutoDrive! This cutting-edge, autonomous driving feature will take you to your chosen destination (i.e. job objective or placed pin on the map). If you have no set destination, it will take you on a leisurely ride through the streets of Night City. Simply hop in any of your vehicles, make sure you're on a road, and hold H (PC) / Left Stick (consoles) to activate. This feature is disabled when you enter combat or when your vehicle is heavily damaged.</li>
<li>Implemented Cinematic Camera for AutoDrive. Hold Q (PC) / D-Pad Right (consoles) to activate. Sit back and enjoy cinematic views of Night City as you cruise toward your destination.</li>
<li>Self-driving Delamain cabs are now available on demand! Simply open the menu to call vehicles, then select "Delamain Cab" from the list to request a ride. This feature unlocks after completing the job <em>Don't Lose Your Mind</em> (regardless of outcome) and receiving a message from Delamain.</li>
<li>Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ is now available for vehicles from partner brands, including motorcycles. Additionally, the infamous hacker known as Cosmetic_Troll exploited a vulnerability and created a cracked version of Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ technology for lower-end vehicles. Please note, however, that some models do not support the technology, such as heavily modded nomad vehicles and job-related vehicles.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where unique color schemes did not work properly on the Mizutani Shion MZ1 and MZ2.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where unique color scheme could not be applied properly to the Villefort Deleon "Vindicator".</li>

<li>Added a confirmation pop-up when exiting Photo Mode to prevent accidental exits after setting up the perfect shot.</li>
<li>Added more customization options to the Look-At Camera feature, including an option for only the character's eyes to turn toward the camera instead of their entire body.</li>
</ul>
<p>Added improvements to Lighting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added multiple new stickers and frames, including iconic quotes and stylish overlays that let you turn your screenshots into Night City postcards – perfect for sharing memories from the City of Dreams.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Jobs &amp; Open World</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cyberpsycho Sighting: Bloody Ritual</em> - the "Crack the ritualist's shard" objective now properly disappears from the Journal after completing the objective.</li>
<li><em>Sex on Wheels</em> - now properly appears in the Journal after receiving the message from Jake Estevez.</li>
<li><em>Shot by Both Sides</em> - fixed an issue where selecting a specific dialogue option in the conversation with Bree created a nameless, iconless item in the player's Inventory.</li>
<li><em>Shot by Both Sides</em> - fixed an issue where the button to go to the lower level didn't appear on the elevator panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>

<li>Fixed an issue where the sound of V's Radioport could be randomly interrupted by the Radioports of nearby NPCs.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where <em>History</em> by Gazelle Twin and Trash Generation played too loudly compared to other songs on the radio.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Sports FC 26 Gameplay, Release Date Revealed With A New Trailer Claiming FC 26 Fixes Key Problems Players Have With The Series]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-release-date-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-claiming-fc-26-fixes-key-problems-players-have-with-the-series.1245477/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has announced that its annual football simulation game series, EA Sports FC, will return on September 26, 2025, with EA Sports FC 26. Alongside Zlatan Ibrahimovic as the cover athlete for the Ultimate Edition of the game, Jude Bellingham and Jamal Musiala have been revealed as the main cover athletes. EA also showed players their first look at gameplay for this year's entry into the long-running series, with a trailer that claims EA Sports FC 26 includes fixes for several key issues players have with the games. </p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-reveal-this-week-zlatan-cover-athlete/">EA announced that it would reveal EA Sports FC 26</a>, teasing the return of Ibrahimovic as one of the cover athletes. The process these games usually follow, is that the first trailer features very little, if any gameplay, and is instead a vehicle for introducing the tone of the year's entry, cover athletes, and the release date. We got all of that in today's trailer, and on top of it, we got a good look at some gameplay, and the improvements that EA is touting. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSi0iJYSQ24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Throughout the trailer, text bubbles appear posing as comments from players criticizing different elements of gameplay, such as the complaint that EA is too slow to show actual gameplay. EA attempts to change the narrative at the top of the trailer, switching from a cutscene to gameplay, and into a sequence where EA shows changes and fixes it has made in EA Sports FC 26 that solve the problems players have with the games.</p>



<p>The message of this year's entry is "<em>Innovation powered by you in every mode</em>," and that the overhauled gameplay experience has been built directly on player feedback. Whether that's actually how it'll feel when players get to test it for themselves remains to be seen.</p>



<p>"<em>FC 26 reflects our ongoing commitment to building this game with and for our community,</em>" said John Shepherd, vice president and general manager of EA Sports FC in a press release. "<em>We are players too, and that shared passion drives everything we do. This year brings an overhauled gameplay experience, new tournaments and live events in FUT, all-new archetype customization in clubs, and a career mode that comes alive through evolving challenges. We can't wait for players to feel the difference this September and help shape the future of FC</em>."</p>
