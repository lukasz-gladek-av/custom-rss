                <p dir="ltr">There are apparently over 30 new games available to stream via the cloud on PlayStation Portal without using a PS5--and they're all part of the Classics catalog. A new report states that almost every original PlayStation and PSP title that's included with the PlayStation Plus Premium membership now works on the handheld device.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/ps-portal-ps-plus-premium-streaming-update-march-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TrueTrophies</a>, Sony has silently added the PlayStation Classics for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-update-introduces-cloud-streaming-beta/1100-6527882/">the PlayStation Portal cloud-streaming beta</a>. The highly requested feature--which removes the requirement of utilizing a PS5--arrived in November and remains in beta. PlayStation Portal owners must opt in, and originally, only PS5 games part of the PS Plus catalog could be played. Now the library reportedly includes titles like Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow, Twisted Metal 2, and MediEvil: Resurrection.</p><p dir="ltr">Last summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-update-will-let-you-play-in-more-places/1100-6524351/">a PlayStation Portal update offered up the ability to play in more places</a> with better public Wi-Fi access. The device basically pops up a QR code when trying to connect at airports and hotels, so a smartphone is needed to complete the process.</p><p dir="ltr">In November, a report stated Sony was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-reportedly-developing-a-ps5-portable-system/1100-6528023/">developing a PS5 portable system</a>, with plans to compete against <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and Steam Deck. Meanwhile, Microsoft apparently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-planned-for-later-this-year-report/1100-6530020/">might launch an Xbox-branded handheld later this year</a> in partnership with Asus.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-playstation-portal-just-isnt-good-enough/1100-6519416/">The PlayStation Portal</a> launched in 2023.</p>

                <p>Nvidia has confirmed that Half-Life 2 RTX will get a demo on March 18, giving us a glimpse of what this Valve classic would look like if it were made in 2025, not 2004.</p><p>This demo is meant to be a showpiece for Nvidia RTX Remix, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-remix-half-life-2-rtx-demo-launching-march-18/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">which exited beta today</a>, March 13. As the video below shows, this gives <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/half-life-2/" data-ref-id="5000-14786">Half-Life 2</a> features it didn't have before, like full ray tracing and multi-frame generation. While the final version of Half-Life 2 RTX will contain the full game, this demo will only feature the Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt levels.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j31ISEd8xRM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j31ISEd8xRM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>First teased in 2023, Half-Life 2 RTX is not made by Valve but by the fans-turned-developers at Orbifold Studios. Positioned as a DLC mod for the official version of the game, Half-Life 2 RTX overhauls the shooter's visuals utilizing Nvidia RTX Remix, an open-source platform that can be used to enhance preexisting games with Nvidia technologies like DLSS 4, RTX Neural Rendering, and Reflex. Nvidia wants modders to use RTX Remix for fan-made remasters, and is backing Half-Life 2 RTX to show what RTX Remix can do.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Half-Life 2 RTX's demo</a> will be released on Steam on March 18. The full version will be released "at a later date," according to Nvidia. It'll be free for those who own <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Half-Life 2 on Steam</a>.</p>

			<p>Lossless Scaling's new <a href="https://wccftech.com/adaptive-frame-generation-is-lossless-scalings-latest-feature/">adaptive frame generation</a> is a great proof of concept that can deliver consistently smooth output with low base framerates even on mid-range system configurations.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a quick look at the new feature introduced to the upscaler earlier this month, highlighting how, even on a mid-range system powered by a Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and an RTX 4060 GPU, the feature is capable of delivering consistently smooth 120 FPS output with low base framerates, high settings and even ray tracing at 1440p resolution in Control, and at native 4K resolution in Starfield. While the experience is far from perfect due to visual artifacts and the massive latency caused by the low base framerates, which is only partially alleviated by tech like NVIDIA Reflex, the new Lossless Scaling feature is an amazing proof of concept, also considering how it does not rely on any specific hardware technology.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lossless Scaling Dynamic Frame-Gen To Screen Refresh Rate: Impressive!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KfDjUUnN6OI?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Everything that Lossless Scaling offers is great for games that do not support upscalers from major vendors, but DLSS, FSR, and Intel XeSS will continue to be the better options for games with official support. AMD's upscaler, in particular, has made some impressive steps forward with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/">latest version</a>, delivering an image quality that is on par with the previous version of DLSS, which still retains the crown of the best upscaler currently available thanks to the introduction of the superior Transformer model which can deliver <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-super-resolution-performance-better-dlss-3-8-quality/">impressive image quality with lower input resolution</a> than the previous CNN model.</p>

                <p>Finnish game developer Remedy has published its <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/a8f88925-c5bf-41db-8ac4-5e6693c8b229/remedy-annual-report-2024.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">annual report for 2024</a>, and included in the document is the disclosure of how much money the company is spending on its upcoming games. This is something of a rarity in the video game business, as many other publishers and developers hide development budgets.</p><p>Remedy said the "initial" development budget for Control 2 is €50 million ($54 million USD). As announced previously, Annapurna Pictures is funding 50% of the game's development budget, and both Remedy and Annapurna plan to create "original stories" spanning film and TV based on Remedy's game franchises.</p><p>FBC: Firebreak, meanwhile, carries a development budget of €30 million. FBC is a session-based, multiplayer PvE game that will be "mid-priced." It'll also be available at launch via PC Game Pass, Xbox Game Pass, and PlayStation Plus. Remedy owns the Control IP, of which FBC is a spin-off.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="377186020" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

The average salary of a Remedy employee in 2024 was €63,907 ($69,284), which was up from €63,822 ($69,162 USD) in 2023 and €60,103 ($65,149 USD) in 2022, but down from €67,862 ($73,500 USD) in 2021. This average excludes salaries for Remedy's CEO and members of the board of directors.</p><p>Remedy's CEO, Tero Virtala, made a salary of €210,240 ($227,958 USD) in 2024, the same exact number he made in 2023. His total pay package was larger in 2024, though, as it also included €79,820 ($86,500 USD) in "long-term incentive rewards," giving him a total pay package in 2024 of €290,060 ($304,000 USD). Virtala also has a stock option plan that could prove to be lucrative in the future, but in 2024, he did not exercise or sell any options in 2024.</p>

This year, Game Developer sat down with the finalists&nbsp; for the IGF’s Nuovo and Grand Prize nominees ahead of GDC to explore the themes, design decisions, and tools behind each entry. Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>INDIKA </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">takes the player on a journey of religious self-discovery alongside the title character of the same name. Oh, and the devil is along for the ride as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer had a chat with Dmitry Svetlov, writer and director of the multi-award nominated title, to discuss how telling this story as a game was important for its exploration of religion and its effect on our lives, using the character’s mental state as a means of creating complexities and puzzles within the game’s environments, and what appealed to them about adding faith points into the game when they serve no actual in-game purpose.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Who are you, and what was your role in developing </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>INDIKA</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm Dmitry Svetlov. I'm the founder of Odd Meter studio and the writer and director of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>INDIKA</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's your background in making games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I started making my first games in school using BASIC, then spent a long time working on an unreleased indie game. In 2018, the studio's first game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sacralith: The Archer's Tale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was released, where I worked as a programmer, game designer, and wore many other hats. And now, the latest—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>INDIKA</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>INDIKA</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first details of the story appeared in my head many years before development began.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game was developed in UE4. We used mocap (including facial). Nothing particularly special.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>INDIKA</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> is an exploration of religion's effect on the self and an examination of faith. What drew you to explore these subjects in a video game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For me, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>INDIKA</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is first and foremost a story about humanity's eternal struggle with itself, and religion is the perfect companion for this theme. Because it's specifically in religious, mystical, "objective" reality where the fight against "evil" very quickly displaces the original aspiration toward "good." And yes, this topic has always been very interesting and close to me, as I spent a lot of time in church as a teenager and visited women's monasteries with my mother multiple times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did the form and possibilities of the video game format enhance the themes you wanted to explore with this game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>INDIKA</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the theme of "Game" itself resonates quite strongly. The Game became a very important metaphor for our story. The game we all play, according to rules we didn't make up, waiting for the reward that's destined for us in case of "victory," and living in fear of punishment in case of "defeat.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges did this format create in exploring these themes?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I would say this format actually provided many opportunities not available to other art forms like film or books. Though, to be honest, we're still at the beginning of our journey in mastering these possibilities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>INDIKA</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> weaves puzzles throughout its world as physical manifestations of crises of faith. What thoughts went into creating puzzle elements and interactions that fit with the game's themes? How did you create new interactions for the player while keeping your themes firmly in mind?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We tried to make the gameplay moments reflect the protagonist's state whenever possible so that the world would literally tear apart when Indika's inner world is ready to break into pieces. So that the world would become physically confusing and deadlocked when Indika loses understanding of what's happening. So that the characters would literally destroy the world around them on their path to their goal, and so on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The game features a striking, realistic style in most places, but its past events reflect the pixel art style of older video games. What drew you to have both styles represented in this game? Why have the protagonist's past represented with a pixel art style? And how did you decide what to do for the mini-games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You've probably noticed that contrasts are the foundation of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>INDIKA</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s aesthetics. Therefore, we wanted the protagonist's dark and gray present to look even more dreary in contrast with her bright and joyful childhood with a time when life seemed and was a fun game. As for the gameplay, we chose the type that best suited the story being told. There's no particular depth to it.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The game features a faith point system that the game overtly tells the player is largely pointless. What drew you to add this element to the game (and its accompanying skill tree), and why did you make sure to go out of your way to tell the player it was all for nothing? Why was this system important to add when it's (technically) of no importance at all?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As I mentioned before, the idea of showing human perception through the lens of a game became one of our cornerstones. And although technically it doesn't change anything, all players continue to collect these points, including the developers. I think it can be viewed as a small social experiment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you decide how to represent the devil throughout the game? What drew you to largely show the devil through shadow and voice?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On one hand, the devil is Indika herself—that "bad" part of her that she dreams of getting rid of. On the other hand, it's us—the force that's always behind our shoulder. And even more simply—it's the voice that forever whispers things we would never dare to say out loud.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You have mentioned in an interview with </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/may/02/indika-russian-orthodox-church-fairytale-game-dmitry-svetlov-interview">The Guardian</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> that your own experience with religion is deeply tied to the creation of I</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>NDIKA</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>. How did creating this scathing look at religion and its effects affect you? What did it feel like to create an experience like this—to tell this story? How did it feel to be mired in Indika's thoughts and questions throughout the course of development? How does it feel to have examined and told them to their conclusion now?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What was it like? Honestly—the best experience of my life. In general, doing something that moves you most in life is a luxury that few can afford, and I never cease to be grateful to life that I, and our incredible team, had such an opportunity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What do you hope players take away from this game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I would like players not to take something away, but rather, for the game to take away a small piece from at least someone. After all, we so often look for simple answers in art and so often remain dissatisfied when we're left alone with uncomfortable unanswered questions. But isn't that the best thing that any experience can give us?</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/control-2-has-entered-full-production-remedy-entertainment-confirms.1133304/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/control-2-full-production-remedy/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Control 2 has entered full production and is now Remedy's third game in full production, the company confirmed in a new update shared today.</p>
<p>In Remedy's <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/app/uploads/2025/03/remedy-annual-report-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual report</a>, the Finnish company confirmed that the full-blown sequel to the action-adventure game released back in 2020 is now in full production, besides<a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/"> FBC: Firebreak</a>, the co-op game set in the Control universe previously known as Project Condor, and the Max Payne 1&amp;2 remake, which entered full production <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/">last August</a>. Besides confirming the change of development state for the game, the new update doesn't provide any new information on the game, which will be powered by the studio's proprietary Northlight engine and will push the boundaries of action and storytelling, which Remedy has been successfully doing for years.</p>
<p>In proper Remedy fashion, Control 2 was teased in the Alan Wake 2 - The Lake House DLC expansion released last year. While it does a great job offering more of what the base offers, the expansion is a must-play only for die-hard fans of the base game and the Remedy Connected Universe, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-whos-the-real-monster/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>With its great atmosphere and tight story pacing, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House retains the same elements that made the base game so engaging. The lack of significant new mechanics and its very short length, however, make it a worthwhile purchase only for the most die-hard fans of Alan Wake 2 and the Remedy Connected Universe.</em></p>
<p>Control 2 is now in development for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-3-5m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-are-apparently-sitting-at-around-3-5m.1133301/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-3-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>sales are sitting at around 3.5 million, a figure that seemingly encapsulates the game's sales on both PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>This figure comes via analyst <a href="https://kabutan.jp/news/marketnews/?b=n202503130535" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hideki Yasuda</a> (note: article is in Japanese, so we're using machine translation), who cites recent comments by Square Enix head Takashi Kiryu during a financial results briefing call.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Square Enix said back in September that both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">had not met its "expectations"</a> with regards to sales, so it looks as though the company was expecting more than the 3.5 million figure quoted here.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-3.5m-combat.jpg?itok=jEyBIo1l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-3.5m-combat.jpg?itok=tR3RIhS1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>sales are apparently sitting at around 3.5 million.</figcaption></figure><p>Yasuda also reiterates that&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3&nbsp;</em>remake <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations" rel="nofollow">outsold expectations</a>, calling the game a "huge hit" and pointing to its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">two million sales</a> (at last count; that figure may well have increased since then).</p>

<p>It's been almost two years since&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>was released, and a few days after the game's initial launch in June 2023, Square Enix said it had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-shipments" rel="nofollow">shipped three million copies</a>.</p>

<p>However, it's important to note that "shipments" and "sales" aren't necessarily the same thing; it is, after all, entirely possible that not all of those three million copies were sold to customers, at least initially.</p>

<p>Assuming all of those copies were indeed sold, that would mean&nbsp;<em>FFXVI&nbsp;</em>has picked up another half a million sales for itself since launch, which isn't particularly impressive given that it's a mainline&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>game with a (presumably) pretty hefty budget behind it.</p>




<p>If you're not up to speed with&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, it's the latest mainline installment in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>series (although it's far from the sixteenth actual game in the franchise).</p>

<p>The game revolves around Clive Rosfield, a man who must navigate a world of political intrigue and strife while also coming to terms with a burgeoning power he shouldn't have.&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>moves further away from the series' RPG roots; it's essentially a character action-style game rather than a JRPG.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>right now on PC and PlayStation 5. If you want to know what our Andrew Stretch thought of the game, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xvi-review" rel="nofollow">check out his review here</a>.</p>

An Android version is also currently in development.</p><p>We should note, however, that Skich has no games available at launch. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172642/aptoide-ios-game-marketplace-hands-on-europe">Aptoide</a>, another gaming-focused third-party iOS app store, had eight basic titles when it launched last June, by comparison. Skich CEO Sergey Budkovski told <em>The Verge</em> that games will “start appearing on the platform in March,” and that the platform has received requests from around 20 developers “so far.”</p><p>A 15 percent fee will be applied to developers for every purchase made on the Skich Store, including in-app purchases from games downloaded through it, compared to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24216181/apple-eu-app-store-services-fee-external-links">20 percent fee that Apple applies to EU developers</a>.</p><p>“We’ve developed a Tinder-like recommendation system that perfectly matches gamers with games,” said Budkovski. “The algorithm behind it is powered by 240 genres, which is 14 times more than one can find in the App Store.”</p><p>We haven’t seen many third-party app stores launching since the DMA came into force in March last year. Even with an empty roster of gaming titles, that makes Skich notable, but we won’t be able to see if it truly does provide more optimized recommendations until it rectifies that issue.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> players among us have been gazing cautiously at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inzoi">inZOI</a>, a new neighbourhood and life management game from Krafton. I am cautious for essentially two reasons. One is that the game makes use of live generative AI: you can stuff its jaws with text, images and video to create items such as outfits and animate your pet humans, here known as Zois. Your Zoi's "actions and thoughts" are also based on "small machine learning" tech, which as the name implies is a teenier species of generative AI that commonly runs live on the user's own hardware. Going by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">the Steam page </a>disclosure, the actual base game assets weren't AI generated, but then again, Steam AI disclosures can be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">rather unrevealing</a>.
</p>
<p>
We've published a fair bit about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">the risks and potential abuses of generative AI tools in video game development</a>, so we'll be looking at that in more depth when the game hits early access on 28th March. In the meantime, here's the second reason I'm cautious: inZOI's key selling point over its obvious (and massively updated) rival <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> is that it has photorealistic visuals, and frankly, they creep the hell out of me.</p> <!--more-->
<p>So does the fact that all the Zois in the marketing screenshots appear to be fashion models. I feel like I'm stuck in a window display with a bunch of possessed marionettes, screaming at shoppers to bust me out before they harvest my bone marrow. Accordingly, the first thing I thought when Krafton released the system specs - see image below - was "please let there be a potato mode that makes everybody look like an honest, god-fearing PS1 NPC".
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
The system specs accompany <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2456740/view/518581441632667234?l=english">a blog post</a> that lays out how to achieve optimal settings, including choice of storage and resolution and which kind of ray tracing to implement. We'll let hardware editor James be the judge of all that, thanks. 
</p>
<p>
The devs are naturally well aware that their gleaming Unreal beastie innately requires more juice than other life sims, and are keen to ensure that as many people get to play as possible. "As mentioned earlier, inZOI delivers high-quality graphics and realistic city-level simulations, which require higher system specifications," they write. "While these requirements ensure the best possible gameplay experience, we remain committed to making inZOI accessible to more players. We plan to implement a feature that automatically adjusts game settings to provide the best possible experience. Additionally, we will continue working on optimizations to improve performance while finding ways to lower system requirements without compromising overall quality."
</p>
<p>
To accompany the post, they've knocked together one of those comparison videos in which builds running at different settings are steadily erased by a merciless horizontal screen wipe, as though whole dimensions were being repeatedly deleted by some kind of spacetime eruption. The vid also shows off some close-ups of NPCs who, in fairness, pretty much look like regular people rather than varnished catwalk vampires.
</p>

<p>
Still, there's no "true" potato mode here from the looks of the video. That's a shame, because I think running games on absurdly low specs often reveals fascinating things about their art direction. Given a dev team who are really committed to low-end play, you sometimes get what feels like a distinct game. For example, I find <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a> rather lovely when you boil back the resolution and detail. Sometimes it's more intriguing when the min spec implementation is crude. There's another game I can't quite recall which becomes a mesh of free-floating pipes and chimneys when you oblige it to run in Abacus Mode. Any recommendations, dear reader?

But if you’d prefer to play wide, you’ll quickly learn that <em>Civilization VII</em> revitalized its city system to include towns, which you may upgrade. But why would you want to?

    <p><em>Civilization VII</em> has a lot of visual polish, and great gameplay systems. A flurry of patches have been improving other aspects, too.

<p>A month ago, <em>Civilization VII</em> launched to generally positive critical reviews, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1iolpfn/steam_reviews_eight_days_launch_history_civ7_vs/">user reviews on Steam</a> and Metacritic weren’t nearly so positive, at least at first.</p>
<p>Take a look at the Civilization subreddit, and you’ll see a general consensus: The bones of this game are great, and even most of the radical changes to the classic formula (like breaking the game into much more distinct ages) are a welcome refresh.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there’s a sentiment that players are disappointed that some expected features are missing, some gameplay elements need additional polish, and most of all, the user interface was a bit of a mess at launch.</p>
<p>A month later, developer Firaxis has already released a few patches and has more planned. As the game’s state continues to evolve, this seems like a good time to check in on it.</p>
<p>I spent some time in the Civ community and spoke with Dennis Shirk, the game's executive producer, to learn how the launch went, how the game has changed since launch, and what its next steps are.</p>
<h2>Breaking with tradition</h2>
<p><em>Civilization VII</em> broke with tradition in a few ways—splitting the game into distinct ages that each play like a separate game, allowing anachronistic leader/civilization combinations, and removing worker units, to name a few.</p>
<p>You might have expected those to be the source of any controversy around the game’s launch, but that hasn’t really been the case. In my <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/civilization-vii-review-a-major-overhaul-solves-civs-oldest-problems/">review</a>, I wrote that those shifts take the franchise in a new direction, bring over the best ideas from competing titles, and address long-standing problems with the Civilization experience.</p>
<p>If you want a more traditional experience, you can go back to <em>Civilization V</em>, <em>Civilization IV</em>, <em>Civilization II</em>, or whichever your favorite was. Those games are infinitely re-playable, so there’s no need to retread with a sequel.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“Our rule that we live by at Firaxis is the rule of thirds. We want to keep one-third of the game the same as previous iterations, one-third tweaked and improved upon, and one-third new,” Shirk told me. “Did we lean farther into the last third than we have in the past? We may have, but it was a risk we were willing to take to deliver a completely new part of the experience.”</p>
<h2>A suboptimal starting position</h2>
<p>The Civilization <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/">subreddit</a> is full of positive responses to those changes, and the large contingent of Civ geeks on the Ars editorial staff are mostly in agreement that they’re good changes, too. (The game has been a frequent discussion topic in the Ars Slack for several weeks.)</p>
<p>The last month has seen players giving critical feedback, and Firaxis has been releasing patches to address complaints. For example, patch 1.1.0 on March 4 fixed some visual problems with the technology tree and made big changes to some victory conditions in the Modern Age, among other things.</p>
<p>Players have noted positive changes that weren’t mentioned in patch notes, too. Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1j46tg6/ai_is_significantly_better_in_military_after_the/">AndyNemmity posted</a> that the “AI is significantly better in Military” after a recent patch a week ago, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>I know most of you don't see the Military AI in the fog of war, but I work on the AI mod, and run a ton of autoplays. I am 10+ autoplays with the new patch, and the base game military AI is VASTLY improved.</p>
<p>Before, the AI would get stuck on the map in tons of different scenarios, often dying because they have an entire army stuck on the map, and can't use it. This is fixed. Now the autoplays look like actual militaries, warring, attacking, killing independents quickly and efficiently.</p></blockquote>
<p>The goodwill about the bones of the game and the positive responses to some patch additions are still accompanied by some consternation about the UI.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“Part of launching a game, especially when big changes are made, is figuring out what is resonating with players, and what may be an opportunity for improvement,” Shirk said when asked about the launch challenges. “In this instance, the UI did not meet players’ expectations, and we are committed to addressing that—although it will take time.”</p>
<p>There’s still a fair bit to be done, and modders have been filling the gaps. Modder Sukritact released a UI overhaul that addressed several complaints—including showing the gains and losses players will see if they replace a tile improvement or building with another one in the city view.</p>
<p>Players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1ixnyfd/sukritacts_ui_mod_now_shows_the_gains_and_losses/">praised these tweaks</a>, going so far as to call that example in particular a “game changer.” A few days later, it was announced on the Civilization Discord that Firaxis had hired Sukritact as a technical artist.</p>

      This mod by Sukritact adds much-needed information to the city view. The modder has since been hired by Firaxis.

<p>The community has speculated that the game was rushed out the door before it was ready, primarily citing the UI issues.</p>
<p>“In hindsight, our UI team needed more time and space to take the UI where it needed to go, to really expose the level of information our players expect,” Shirk admitted. “Our team has been working hard to address these issues through rapid patching, and players will continue to see support for the foreseeable future.”</p>
<p>That said, debate about the UI is happening in the context of a wider discussion about the scope of <em>Civilization VII</em>’s launch.</p>

<h2>A tale of 10 platforms</h2>
<p>Every mainline Civilization game in the past launched on just desktop platforms like Windows or Mac, but <em>Civilization VII</em> greatly expanded that. Depending on what counts (we’ll say here that the Steam Deck counts as distinct from Linux, and the Xbox Series S is distinct from Xbox Series X), there were 10 launch platforms for <em>Civilization VII</em>:</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<ul>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>macOS</li>
<li>Steam Deck</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch</li>
<li>PlayStation 4</li>
<li>PlayStation 5</li>
<li>Xbox One</li>
<li>Xbox Series S</li>
<li>Xbox Series X</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a lot to target at launch, and players in the subreddit have speculated that Firaxis was spread a bit thin here, making this part of the explanation for a relatively buggy UI on day one.</p>
<p>Some also speculated that the classic desktop PC platform got a worse experience in order to accommodate console and Steam Deck players. For example, players lamented the lack of a drag and drop feature for views like the policy selection screen.</p>
<p>The developers have made it crystal clear that PC is the top priority, though. “Our core audience is absolutely PC, so we always start there, and work our way outward, adapting UI systems along the way, iterating on different UX approaches,” Shirk said.</p>
<p>He added that the controller support was developed with a partner, suggesting that supporting consoles out of the gate might not have taxed the team working on the desktop interface as much as some feared.</p>
<p>At least in one respect, Firaxis has already publicly walked the walk: At one point it made the controversial decision to temporarily pause cross-save between PC and console so it could push updates to PC faster. Patching games on consoles requires a relatively slow and laborious certification process, but that’s not the case for updating a game on Steam.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some console and handheld players have complained about their version of the interface.</p>
<p>The most commonly named UI problem on console and handhelds is related to how the camera and hex selector could be moved across the map more efficiently. Currently, moving the camera is easy—you just use the left stick to pan around. But doing this doesn’t move the hex selector with it, so you have to drag that selector hex by hex all the way across the map.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Some similar games have a button you can press to bring the selector to where the camera is. In <em>Civilization VII</em>, the R3 button brings the camera to where the selector is, not vice versa—which isn’t useful.</p>
<p>Shirk talked a bit about the process of developing the controller-based interface and the challenges the team faced:</p>
<blockquote><p>We've been lucky enough to have some great partners help us develop the controller support, which added some strong console specific features like the radial menu. However, when you're working with different interfaces across different platforms, there are many assumptions that cannot be made like they can on PC. For example, a player using a mouse is not walled off from anything, but switch that to a controller, and a completely different thought process has to come into play.</p></blockquote>
<p>As for solutions, he added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re working to give all versions the attention they deserve. When it comes to UI updates, we’re having team members continue to look at the community feedback in-depth and see how we can improve the experience for players regardless of system.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I asked about drag-and-drop on desktop, and R3’s selection functionality on console and handheld, he said that “the examples you shared are among features we are tracking and exploring how to address,” and that the March 4 1.1.0 patch that brought some UI changes was just a start. He added that a 1.1.1 coming March 25 will be when “fans will really start to see the results of their feedback.”</p>
<p>“And to answer your original question, ‘R3’ is coming along for the ride,” he said.</p>

<h2>Following the legacy path to balanced gameplay</h2>
<p>It seems like the UI is on the right track, but some tweaks need to happen on the gameplay front too, as players and critics tell it.</p>

<p>There are complaints about the AI—something as old as the franchise itself, to be fair. Some improvements have already been made, but players continue to report that AI civs keep founding cities close to players’ capitals for no apparent reason, causing frustration.</p>

      "Ashoka traveled across the entire continent just to settle four tiles away from my capital," said DayTemporary3369, the Reddit user who posted this screenshot. They weren't alone in this complaint.

<p>Religion gameplay needs attention, as there’s no way to stop other leaders’ missionaries, leading to unsatisfying back-and-forth conversion gameplay. Similarly, players feel there aren’t enough defenses against espionage.</p>
<p>“If they're all allowed to target me at the same time, I should be allowed to defend myself from all of them, provided I have enough influence,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1ipdloa/current_civ_7_espionage_mechanic_be_like_everyone/">said</a> Reddit user Pay_No_Heed on the topic of counter-espionage. The complaint is reasonable, though a working design solution may not be as obvious as it seems.</p>
<p>Players have also complained that ages end too abruptly, and that holds true for the end of the game, which happens when the Modern Age concludes. It’s a quibble I also shared in my review. Many players are maxing out the game’s age length setting to combat this. Past Civilization games offered a “one more turn” option to extend the game past when someone had won. Firaxis has said this is coming to the end of the modern age in a future update.</p>
<p>There’s also the Civilopedia, the in-game database of concepts and help documentation. Players have noted it's more barebones than expected, with several key concepts lacking entries or explanation. Firaxis acknowledged this complaint and said it’s being worked on.</p>
<p>“Yes, with each update we’re improving what’s exposed in the Civilopedia, including more gameplay data, easier navigation, et cetera. Expect much more to come in future updates,” Shirk explained.</p>
<p>In general, the game needs to have more information exposed to players. The gap is big enough that Reddit user JordiTK posted the heavily upvoted “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1iq3hde/the_ultimate_list_of_things_that_civilization_vii/">Ultimate List of Things That <em>Civilization VII</em> Doesn’t Tell You</a>." It's almost 5,000 words long, with more than 100 items.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Almost every prior Civilization game has had players complaining that it didn’t explain itself well enough, but the sentiment seems stronger this time. For what it’s worth, Shirk says the team recognizes this.</p>
<p>“Internally, our primary design goal for <em>Civilization VII</em> was to focus and iterate on the new mechanics, to really make sure this design would sing,” he said. “This focus on the new probably led us to work with a few false assumptions about what base level information players would need with our legacy systems, and it wasn't something that came up as loudly as it should have in user testing.”</p>
<h2>It’s not “We Love the Developer Day” just yet</h2>
<p>While everyone in the community and within Firaxis agrees there’s still work to be done, the tone has improved since the launch because of these patches, and thanks to frequent engagement on Steam, Discord, and Reddit by the developer’s community manager.</p>
<p>The launch situation was made a little worse than it needed to be because of, strangely enough, confusion around nomenclature. Players who paid for the pricier special editions of the game were given “Advanced Access” a few days before the main launch date.</p>
<p>After it was apparent there were problems, some of the communications to players on storefronts and on Reddit called it "early access," causing a bit of a stir because until then players hadn't perceived the special edition advanced access to be the same as early access, which is a term typically used in the industry to let players know a game is incomplete and in a pre-release state.</p>
<p>When asked about this, a spokesperson for 2K Games (the game's publisher) gave a statement to Ars that read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our goal is always to deliver the best product possible, including during Advanced Access periods. With a game the size and scope of Civilization VII there will always be fixes and optimizations once the entirety of the player base is able to jump in. The intent behind the Advanced Access granted to purchasers of the Deluxe Edition and Founders Edition was not to offer a work in progress product, and we take the feedback delivered during that period seriously.</p>
<p>We’re working hard to make sure that players have the best experience in the world of 4X strategy for years to come, and player feedback remains critical in helping us grow and build the future of Civ.</p></blockquote>
<p>That suggests the use of “early access” was just a misstatement and not an attempt to cover for a rough pre-launch access period, but it wasn’t a great start to the conversation.</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Since then, though, some of the most critical problems have been addressed, and the studio shared a roadmap that promised “UI updates and polish” in patches on March 4 (1.1.0, already released), March 25 (1.1.1), and sometime in April (1.2.0). The roadmap lists “additional UI updates &amp; polish” for beyond April, too, confirming this will be a lengthy process.</p>

<p>This frequent communication, combined with the fact that players recognize there’s a good game here that needs some more polish, has meant that most of the discussions in the community during this first month have been pretty optimistic, despite the launch woes.</p>
<p>There was a time years ago when games were marketed leading up to their launch, but then the communication with players was over. In today’s market (especially for complex games like Civilization) there’s often a need to iterate in public. Players understand that and will roll with it if it’s communicated clearly to them. Firaxis stumbled on that in the opening days, but it’s now clear the studio understands that well, and the updates are rolling out.</p>
<p>We've seen a lot of rough launches for big games in recent years, and they often turn quite toxic. That said, the core Civilization community seems more patient and optimistic than you typically see in situations like this. That's a credit to Firaxis' years of goodwill, but it's also a credit to the moderators and other leaders in the game's community.</p>
<p>When I reviewed <em>Civilization VII</em>, I wrote that the core systems were strong, and that the game likely has a bright future ahead of it—but I also said it might make sense to wait a few weeks to dive in because of UI and balance issues.</p>
<p>It’s a few weeks later, and it looks like the game is on the right track, but there’s still a ways to go if you’re looking for an impeccably polished product. That hasn’t stopped me from enjoying the dozens of hours I’ve played so far, though.</p>

			<p>As part of its GDC 2025 news, NVIDIA announced that a free Half-Life 2 RTX demo will be released on March 18. Fans will have the opportunity to sample around two hours of gameplay of the work that Orbifold Studios has already completed, checking out the full ray traced graphics, remade assets, particles, and animations in the Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt levels.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, today marks the official release of the RTX Remix remastering suite, a little over a year after its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-open-beta-qa-with-nyle-usmani-past-present-and-future-of-the-generalized-modding-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Beta debut</a>. NVIDIA has introduced features like DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, RTX Neural Radiance Cache, RTX Skin, and RTX Volumetrics, all of which are, of course, included in the Half-Life 2 RTX demo. NVIDIA boasts frame rate improvements of 2.4x compared to the RTX Remix Open Beta, which only supported DLSS 3.5 Frame Generation, in Portal RTX, mainly thanks to DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and RTX Radiance Cache, although the runtime was also optimized and texture streaming improved.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RTX-Remix-DLSS-4-Multi-Frame-Generation-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>NVIDIA also offered a look at how RTX Skin and RTX Volumetrics improve the Half-Life 2 RTX demo.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Half-Life-2-RTX-Demo-RTX-Volumetrics-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>With a new Character Replacement feature, RTX Remix users will find it easier to remaster the original assets of old PC games. After working on the remaster in the Blender software, they'll be able to remap the skeleton in RTX Remix to get a properly remastered asset that works correctly.</p>
<p>NVIDIA said there are 150 compatible games (including <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Left 4 Dead 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/painkiller-rtx-remix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Painkiller Remixed mod</a>), not to mention 350 mod projects being actively worked on by a community of over 30K modders. PBRFusion 3 is also now available to easily remaster materials for Physically Based Rendering (PBR). This new version introduces the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom fine-tuned model for better upscaling of lower resolution textures</li>
<li>Custom fine-tuned depth model</li>
<li>Higher quality Normal Maps</li>
<li>Seamless Maps</li>
</ul>
<p>It generates normal maps, height maps, and roughness maps. You can find a guide <a href="https://huggingface.co/NightRaven109/PBRFusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>As a side note, NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-now-in-over-100-games-more-titles-coming-soon-neural-shading-support-directx-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that there are now over 100 games and apps with support for DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. They also confirmed the following titles will support the technology:</p>

			<p>NVIDIA has kicked off the official GDC 2025 news rounds with a bang, revealing that official RTX Neural Shading support will go live next month thanks to an updated DirectX Agility SDK Preview released by Microsoft. While the RTX Kit <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-with-neural-shaders-is-out-now-mega-geometry-and-neural-texture-compression-demos-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been available</a> via GitHub since last month, the DirectX support will accelerate RTX Neural Shading with GeForce GPUs Tensor Cores.</p>
<p>John Spitzer, NVIDIA VP of Developer Technology, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Neural rendering is the future of graphics and we are happy to partner with Microsoft to bring AI to programmable shaders in DirectX. All game developers can use Tensor Cores built into GeForce RTX GPUs to deliver next-gen realism and performance to Windows gaming.</em></p>
<p>Shawn Hargreaves, Direct3D Dev Manager at Microsoft, added:</p>
<p><em>Microsoft is adding Cooperative Vectors support to DirectX and HLSL, starting with a preview this April. This will advance the future of graphics programming by enabling neural rendering across the gaming industry. Unlocking Tensor Cores on NVIDIA RTX will allow developers to fully leverage RTX Neural Shading for richer, more immersive experiences on Windows.</em></p>
<p>For now, three main uses of RTX Neural Shading have been detailed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-neural-compression-technique-unlocks-16x-texture-detail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Neural Texture Compression</a> can create neural representations of thousands of textures in less than a minute, saving up to 7x VRAM/RAM compared to regular compression techniques.</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/neural-radiance-cache-technique-aims-to-make-path-tracing-faster-on-nvidia-gpus-thanks-to-tensor-cores-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Neural Radiance Cache</a> can infer theoretically infinite multi-bounce indirect lighting starting from just one or two bounces, optimizing visuals and performance.</li>
<li>RTX Neural Materials compresses complex shader code typically reserved for offline materials composed of multiple layers, such as porcelain and silk. It provides material processing that is up to 5x faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, this is just a preview. It will be a while before it's officially released, and then we'll have to wait for game developers to actually implement the features. However, owners of the GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs are future-proof in this regard since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new graphics cards</a> already support RTX Neural Shading.</p>
<p><iframe title="Zorah | Neural Rendering, Powered by GeForce RTX 50 Series and AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZtTtUyqGs-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In other GDC 2025 news, NVIDIA demonstrated an updated version of the Zorah demo first showcased at CES. A sample will be available next week with the following features: RTX Mega Geometry, RTX Hair, ReSTIR Path Tracing, and ReSTIR Direct Illumination.</p>
<p>Additionally, the NVIDIA RTX Unreal Engine 5 branch on GitHub was just updated with support for the RTX Mega Geometry and RTX Hair technologies. The former <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debuted</a> in the most recent Alan Wake 2 patch, while the latter will do so in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through an update</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NVIDIA-ACE-inZOI-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>NVIDIA also confirmed that its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACE AI technology</a> will debut when inZOI (whose system requirements have just been <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-will-require-a-rather-powerful-pc-ryzen-7-9800x3d-recommended-for-high-preset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>) launches in early access on March 28, offering an on-device language model exclusively available on GeForce RTX GPUs. NVIDIA ACE will also be integrated later this month in NARAKA BLADEPOINT: MOBILE PC VERSION, where the AI will be a helpful game companion. The same will be added to Black Vultures: Prey of Greed, an upcoming MMOFPS by Korean developer WEMADE, previously codenamed <a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/korean-games/newsView/ked202305080012" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Means War</a>.</p>

With the unique thrills of great cooperative play so fresh in our minds, we wanted to look back at some other great co-op games that you can play with relative ease if you’re looking for something to play with a friend, family member, lover, or sworn enemy. Here are our picks for the 18 best co-op games you can play right now.</p></div><div><p>Hazelight got its start as a force in co-op games with <em>A Way Out</em>,<em> </em>which follows two criminals who escape from prison and are on the run. That could easily be a setup for a generic third-person crime shooter, but <em>A Way Out </em>marks the beginning of Hazelight’s inventive and varied co-op design. Everything you do in <em>A Way Out </em>is a team effort, whether it be setting things in motion for your prison break or escaping to freedom with the cops on your tail. The studio’s later offerings lean harder into fantastical premises and riff on more interesting cooperative ideas, but <em>A Way Out </em>is where it all began and it still holds up. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>  <em>A Way Out </em>established that Hazelight was skilled at creating memorable co-op experiences, but <em>It Takes Two </em>is where the studio really found its footing. The charming platformer puts you and a friend into the shoes of an estranged couple whose daughter wants them to remember why they fell in love in the first place, and that means using a spell to turn them into toys who have to overcome a series of challenges by working together. <em>It Takes Two </em>is constantly changing things up, giving both players different tools to use in wildly varied segments that are smooth, intuitive, and could easily have been extrapolated into separate, standalone games. — Kenneth Shepard </p></div><div><p><em>Split Fiction </em>is the culmination of everything Hazelight has done up to this point, taking the co-op action platformer structure of <em>It Takes Two</em> up a notch as it shifts nimbly between sci-fi and fantasy worlds to pay tribute to different pieces of genre fiction as well as a wide array of video games. The game is a bit more challenging than <em>It Takes Two</em>, however, so if you’re looking to ease someone into format, maybe start with the previous game before jumping right into Hazelight’s latest. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Often imitated but never duplicated, <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em> is still the best co-op shooter around some 15 years after its release. Many have tried to copy its format, but none have come close to beating<em> L4D2</em>’s mix of amazing level design, intuitive UI, fast-paced action, and perfect pacing. I’ve played so many memorable matches of<em> Left 4 Dead 2</em> with complete strangers who had no mics. Didn’t matter. We still had an amazing time mowing down zombies or killing survivors as special infected. Truly one of the all time greats. Pick this up ASAP, get some friends together on Steam, and have a blast. - Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>For most of its run, <em>Splinter Cell Conviction</em>’s cooperative campaign plays like most others in Ubisoft’s stealth franchise. It’s two players sneaking, shooting, and interrogating guards with a gun to their heads. However, what separates <em>Conviction </em>from its predecessors is its incredible and subversive ending, one that other games on this list would also go on to emulate. If you want a rock-solid stealth game with an intriguing espionage story full of twists and turns, you can’t go wrong with <em>Splinter Cell Conviction</em>. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Studio MDHR’s run-and-gun platformer <em>Cuphead </em>is notoriously challenging. But you know what makes it less so? Having a friend running and gunning by your side. Playing <em>Cuphead </em>with a friend is a surefire way to cut down your play time, as you’re able to revive one another after a death you’re sure was bullshit and you don’t even know what killed you. Co-op <em>Cuphead </em>is basically giving yourself a second, third, and fourth life. Playing it alone is just making it harder on yourself. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s<em> </em>tabletop inspirations are most apparent when you play it with friends. Yeah, hanging out with Larian’s party of would-be mind flayers makes for an incredible single-player RPG, but journeying through Faerûn with a group of friends playing as custom characters, getting into hijinks, and coordinating battle strategies together is the game’s chaotic potential realized. Like a good tabletop session, playing <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>with friends can either be filled with incredible moments of creative problem-solving and synergy, or it can be an absolute dumpster fire of everyone sabotaging each other and creating new problems. Sure, it’s still limited by the finite possibilities of Larian’s code, but it does a great job of emulating the concept. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>Super Mario 3D World </em>is another co-op game that can easily see the action devolve from jolly cooperation to playful trolling, with its ample opportunities to wreak havoc on each other. But even when the most annoying player is throwing you off the side of the map, you can’t beat four friends running and jumping around in a <em>Mario </em>level. <em>3D World</em>’s co-op brings the multiplayer madness of the <em>New Super Mario Bros. </em>sidescrollers to a 3D space. You’ll probably reach the goal pole faster on your own, but it won’t be nearly as memorable without a few hours of laughing together on the couch. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>What’s more cooperative than building something together? <em>Minecraft </em>needs no introduction as the best-selling video game of all time, but if you somehow don’t know about the game that spawned an upcoming Jack Black-led film <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-jack-black-steve-jason-momoa-trailer-1851639338&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-jack-black-steve-jason-momoa-trailer-1851639338">that looks pretty bad</a></span>, it’s equal parts survival adventure and creative suite. So many incredible things have been made in <em>Minecraft</em> that you might be intimidated by the game and hesitant to jump in. But in my experience, the best <em>Minecraft </em>experience is having a chill hangout with friends as you explore and build. It’s calming and therapeutic, almost like gardening with your pals. It gives you a digital space to hang out in without the stress of objectives or puzzle-solving. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Oh look, another Valve game is on the list. This time we’re spotlighting <em>Portal 2</em>, a game that shipped with a fantastic single-player campaign and didn’t need more. Yet, Valve also tossed in a damn fine co-op mode, too, complete with its own story, characters, levels, and mechanics. You’ll probably need to play this one with someone who has patience, loves puzzles, and has a strong stomach, as portal hopping can cause some motion sickness. But with the perfect person, <em>Portal 2</em> co-op is an amazing experience that is both immensely satisfying and fun. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>The <em>Lego </em>games aren’t the most complex of co-op experiences, but they are reliable and very easy to pick up and play, and there are so many different games and franchise adaptations that there’s bound to be something you and your friend are both interested in. Are you a <em>Star Wars</em> fan hoping to journey to that galaxy far far away? Looking for something <em>Marvel </em>you can play with your friends that isn’t as sweaty as <em>Rivals</em>? Or maybe you want to play a good <em>Horizon </em>game to help you and your buddy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-ai-aloy-ps5-horizon-zero-dawn-1851769086&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-ai-aloy-ps5-horizon-zero-dawn-1851769086">forget about the AI monstrosity Sony is cooking up</a></span>? You can find all of the above in the <em>Lego</em> games, so you and a friend can beat up blocky baddies and usually enjoy a funny spoof of your favorite franchises. They’re a fun, uncomplicated romp. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>My favorite kind of cooperative games are the ones that give everyone a role to play. <em>Operation: Tango </em>is one of the best examples of asynchronous co-op I’ve played because the tools it gives its two players could not be more different. One player is a field agent doing espionage and sick spy tricks, the other is a hacker who only sees what’s on their computer. Both players have to be locked in, communicating, and telling each other what they see to solve problems and accomplish their mission. There’s something incredibly satisfying about finding the answer to your field agent’s problem by solving puzzles and hacking into a system. <em>Operation: Tango </em>exemplifies teamwork better than most co-op games and can be completed in a sitting or two. Just make sure you play with someone who will be patient while you’re scrolling through all the hacking UI. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>Journey </em>is a little different than most of the games on this list in that you can’t queue up with a friend and guarantee that you’ll play through Thatgamecompany’s gorgeous playable screensaver together. You can play <em>Journey </em>by yourself, but throughout your trek through a desert up to a mountain in the distance, you’ll pass by other players making their own pilgrimage; you’re free to heed them as they try to help you find your way, or you can ignore them. However, <em>Journey</em>’s only form of communication is through chirps that don’t have a specific meaning, so you and your traveling partner will essentially create your own language by wordlessly chirping at one another as you move through the world. The expedition to the mountain is arduous, emotional, and beautiful to behold, and it’s also one that’s better when walking alongside another. Even if you don’t know just who it is you’ve been paired up with. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>When talking awesome co-op experiences, it’s too hard to pick one <em>Halo </em>game. And luckily, in the year 2025 we don’t have to because we have the<em> Master Chief Collection.</em> Now you and a friend (or a few more, depending on the game) can play through all of <em>Halo</em>,<em> Halo 2</em>, <em>Halo 3</em>, <em>ODST, Halo Reach</em>, and <em>Halo 4</em> together without having to swap games or consoles. And thanks to plenty of updates, the <em>MCC </em>is the best way to enjoy the action-packed and bombastic campaigns found in each game. Sure, you can play them solo, but having a buddy in your Warthog is always better. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>Like <em>Halo</em>, all of the <em>Gears </em>games—even <em>Judgement</em>—are fun co-op games. However, I’m going to specify<em> Gears of War 3</em> for this list as I think it’s still the best game in the series and it features 4-player co-op, too. This was only seen one other time, in the previously mentioned <em>Judgement</em>, and while I can imagine it was a pain to implement, it makes <em>Gears 3</em> so much fun to go back to in 2025. You can bring your whole crew and play <em>Gears of War 3 </em>all at the same time. And thanks to Xbox’s backwards compatibility and FPS boost, playing this aging cover shooter is as easy as chainsawing a Locust drone’s head off. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>Really, any <em>Borderlands </em>game is made 10,000 times better when you bring a friend or two along for the ride. But personally, <em>Borderlands 3</em> is my favorite to replay with friends these days and that’s mainly because of how good the combat and movement feel in this one. However, you could also check out <em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands,</em> which plays just as well as <em>Borderlands 3</em> but also supports crossplay and features a lot of cool magic and fantasy melee weapons. And best of all, when playing any <em>Borderlands </em>game in co-op, you will all be too distracted by each other to hear the cringey jokes. A win-win situation! — Zack Zwiezen </p></div><div><p>When the original <em>Diablo </em>arrived in 1997, the alluring pull of the Lord of Terror wreaked havoc on the work and school schedules of thousands, who couldn’t resist diving into the dungeons beneath the cathedral in Tristram with friends to slaughter monsters and score some sweet loot. The series and its emphasis on co-op continue to this day, of course, but if you ask me, the fun factor for co-op play peaked with the second game, 2000’s <em>Diablo II</em>. (To be clear, I like the tone, story, and core experience of <em>Diablo IV</em>, the series’ latest entry, but I also think the game is bogged down with live-service elements and obnoxious endgame grinds designed to keep you playing for the sake of keeping you playing, rather than because those grinds are actually fun or meaningful.)</p><p> Thankfully, <em>Diablo II </em>got a great modern refresh with <em>Diablo II: Resurrected</em>, a 2021 remaster of the 2000 game and its excellent <em>Lord of Destruction </em>expansion that makes hopping into Sanctuary with a friend and fighting the forces of evil on modern platforms a piece of cake. <em>Diablo II </em>is one of the most influential games of all time, cementing the very way we think about in-game loot in everything from <em>Borderlands </em>to <em>Fortnite </em>as having different color-coded quality tiers, and the appeal of its incredible classes, weapons, combat, and world is as apparent today as it was a quarter century ago. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
