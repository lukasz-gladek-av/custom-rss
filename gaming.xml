			<p>Today, inZOI Studio (a subsidiary of KRAFTON) unveiled the detailed system requirements and optimal settings for the highly anticipated life simulation game for PC. While the minimum requirements are more or less in line with what we've come to expect nowadays (they even require less RAM than <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomfall-will-require-rtx-2060-gpu-and-16gb-ram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomfall's</a>), to play at higher graphics presets, you will need a very powerful computer. The High preset even recommends AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which launched just a few months ago to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-3d-v-cache-cpu-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent reviews</a>, establishing itself as the best CPU gamers can buy when it comes to the quality/price ratio and its efficiency.</p>

<p>inZOI is powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5 and delivers not only high quality graphics but also high-fidelity simulations, the developer said in an attempt to explain the high requirements.</p>
<p>The studio has prepared eight different preset options to allow players to easily find the best visuals and performance for their system. These presets also confirm the inclusion of NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3, Intel XeSS, and ray tracing. There's no mention of Frame Generation, though.</p>

<p>The Better Graphics mode will focus on delivering the best image quality while playing inZOI at the expense of possible frame drops and longer loading. Better Performance, as you can easily guess, reduces visual quality and optimized simulation speed to increase frame rates.</p>

<p>It's worth reminding that inZOI <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-set-to-enter-early-access-in-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will launch on March 28</a> in early access. In the future, the developers will add an automatic system to adjust in-game settings according to the PC specs. Of course, they also plan to further optimize the game for a variety of configurations.</p>
<p>The game will also offer other interesting features, such as official mods (<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-partners-with-overwolf-to-bring-official-mods-into-life-simulation-game-inzoi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks to a partnership with Overwolf</a>) and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI companions named Smart ZOI</a>, who will be powered by NVIDIA ACE.</p>

The character Bailuan is looking to the left of the camera" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>is, all told, a pretty straightforward game. Talk to some guys on the overworld map, get into a battle, fight all the soldiers and capture all the bases, rinse and repeat until the game is done. Even the postgame lays a clear path forward for those who want to see and do everything the game offers. With that said, you can imagine my surprise once I realized that, with over 100 hours put into the game, I found some pretty huge secrets that I <em>totally </em>missed as I played.</p><p>It’s a shame, as some of these hidden scenes and battles are pretty awesome! So whether you’re aiming for total completion yourself, or you just want to pick the game up again, here are five secrets that you don’t want to miss.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="85431102d5f363e9dfa173dfbc30dc23" data-recommend-id="image://85431102d5f363e9dfa173dfbc30dc23" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

However, even after her semi-romantic date with Ziluan and her dramatic capture by Dong Zhuo, she almost completely disappears from the main story after Chapter 3. What happened with her and Lu Bu? Where did she go?</p><p>Don’t worry, these questions have answers! <strong>To uncover Diaochan’s fate and unlock her final Bond event, you must attain complete peace in the Sili Province</strong>. You’ll naturally bolster the peace gauge if you aim to unlock every story path in the game, but you’ll almost certainly need to grind skirmishes to max out the peace in this region completely. Once you achieve total peace, a letter will appear in the inn as long as you’ve progressed far enough in the story. This will lead you to one final conversation with Diaochan, uniting her and Ziluan as they discuss what the future will look like for them.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d382e72894616303d601d87dfcb2189e" data-recommend-id="image://d382e72894616303d601d87dfcb2189e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

Fortunately, it seems Koei Tecmo and Omega Force agree, as <strong>you can unlock an entire string of Bond events with Zhang Jiao by replaying Chapter One in New Game Plus.</strong></p><p>Maxing out this Bond can be a bit tricky, as you need to complete several missions that you can’t skip by visiting Shui Jing Retreat. However, once you see the first two Bond event cutscenes, you can skip to Chapter 2 to unlock the final scene.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="37be1337b9cc242d3f4b26a7e2940820" data-recommend-id="image://37be1337b9cc242d3f4b26a7e2940820" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from a cinematic in Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

You can save Dian Wei in Chapter 4, save Guo Jia in Chapter 5, and completely change the final Battle of Chibi by bringing Guo Jia with you and foiling Zhuge Liang’s surprise fire attack. With all these alternate outcomes, it’s <em>incredibly </em>easy to miss one <em>technically </em>unique cutscene that <em>only </em>triggers if you <em>don’t </em>save Dian Wei but <em>do </em>save Guo Jia. I <em>hope </em>my <em>use </em>of <em>italics </em>drives <em>home</em> how much <em>fun</em> I had <em>figuring </em>this <em>out</em>.</p><p>This scene genuinely adds functionally nothing to your experience, but it is a requirement if you want 100 percent story completion.

                <p>Ubisoft is "horribly mismanaged" and has failed to inform the public about supposed conversations with Microsoft and EA regarding possible acquisition deals. That's according to the Ubisoft minority shareholder AJ Investments, which said in a memo that it might organize a protest at Ubisoft's office in Paris to help elevate its concerns and get attention.</p><p>AJ Investments CEO Juraj Krupa said in a statement <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-plots-protest-outside-paris-hq-accuses-company-of-failing-to-reveal-discussions-with-microsoft-ea-and-others-allegedly-interested-in-acquiring-ips" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">seen by IGN</a> that Ubisoft is "horribly mismanaged by current management." The investment group, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-urges-company-to-make-drastic-change-amid-sinking-stock/1100-6526392/" data-ref-id="1100-6526392">previously urged Ubisoft management to make drastic changes</a>, said Ubisoft needs to disclose a "clear roadmap for recovery" amid "declining shareholder value, lackluster operational execution, and failure to adapt effectively to market trends."</p><p>Krupa went on to say that the private financial market platform MergerMarket carried a story that claims Ubisoft was talking to Microsoft, EA, and other companies about potentially acquiring unspecified franchises from Ubisoft. Krupa said Ubisoft management failed to disclose these discussions publicly.</p><p>A spokesperson for Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">reiterated what it said months ago</a>, which is that Ubisoft is in the process of conducting a strategic review of "transformation strategic and capitalistic options," but that the company does not plan to make public announcements until a possible deal materializes.</p><p>In addition to possibly Microsoft and EA, Ubisoft is reported to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">possibly be in discussions with Tencent about some kind of financing deal.</a> It remains to be seen how this might all materialize, but one possibility that's rumored is Ubisoft selling off individual franchises.</p><p>Krupa added that the latest delay for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> to March 20 caused Ubisoft's stock to decline in value, but mainly retail investors were harmed by this--not institutional investors like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Because Ubisoft did not act "appropriately," as AJ Investments sees it, the company is asking frustrated investors to join a protest planned for May.</p><p>Krupa said AJ Investments will call of its protest if Ubisoft's strategic review leads to an end result that increases shareholder value. It also hasn't ruled out suing Ubisoft.</p><p>"Ubisoft has continued to underperform compared to its industry peers, and it is time for the company to listen to its shareholders. This demonstration will be a powerful statement from investors who believe in the company's potential but demand urgent change," Krupa said.</p><p>As mentioned, Ubisoft's next big release is Assassin's Creed Shadows on March 20. It's been a tumultuous past year for Ubisoft, as the company's cost-cutting efforts have included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">mass layoffs and studio closures</a>, as well as the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210"> shutdown of XDefiant.</a></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Romance has become increasingly common in role-playing games in recent years, having had central roles in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, to name a recent few. But it was conspicuously absent from Obsidian's latest RPG, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, and I am not the only person to wonder why.</p>
<p>I had a chance to ask game director Carrie Patel why this was the case during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-serious-skyrim-to-cheerful-fantasy-obsidian-on-the-evolution-of-avowed-and-grappling-with-the-expectations-that-come-from-your-own-history">a post-release interview about Avowed</a>, and it turns out Patel had a lot on the matter to say. "Doing romance and doing romance well are two very different propositions," she said.</p>
<p>For starters, it's important that non-player characters don't lose their sense of self in a game just because you've shown romantic interest in them. "Part of doing romance well means not only a compelling romance path but also one that is faithful to the character being romanced," she said.</p>
<p>"It's always a bit of a letdown when you see a character who has a clear personality, and goals and interests, and suddenly, in the service of this romance that the player has embarked on with them, they now become the player's yes-person; they're happy with whatever you want and lose their sense of personhood."</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=equGBZBUjVg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>Number two: romance shouldn't be the only way you can get closer to, and deeper with, someone. A relationship should not only depend on - or be gatekept by - romantic interest.  "You need an equally compelling platonic path," Patel said, "because it's a shame if romance is the only right way to really get to that full level of depth with a character."</p>
<p>Finally - and Patel said she sees this a lot as developer and a player - if romance is used as a mechanic then it will be treated as one, potentially detracting from why it was there in the first place. "The more you introduce romance as a mechanic, and the more that you build systems around it, and metrics, and ways for players to bolster and measure their affinity and affection level with other characters, the more it becomes something people engage with as a system rather than as a relationship," she said.</p>
<p>Avowed, contrary to popular belief, does have a kind of companion relationship in it, but this isn't telegraphed at all through the game, or teased, or incentivised. You'll come across it if you speak regularly with the companion in question - I don't want to spoil who it is - but the intention was it should come up organically rather than be something you aim for.</p>
<p>"There's nothing that says 'hey this is a thing that can happen' - there's no system that's going to track your status with them - but if you're doing the kinds of things that you would do if you were interested in this character, you'll probably come across the option by the end of the game," Patel said. "And it should feel natural, organic, and surprising."</p>

</figure>
<p>This reminds her of a character from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> - Obsidian's sci-fi RPG, a sequel for which it's working on right now - called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outer-worlds-parvati-holcomb-is-a-rare-but-shining-example-of-asexual-representation">Parvati Holcomb, who we praised on Eurogamer in an article about asexual representation in games</a>.</p>
<p>"What works so well about the Parvati bar scene in The Outer Worlds is it just feels believable and relatable, because who hasn't gotten a drink with a friend and talked them through their romantic predicaments?" Patel said. "And by the same token, finding a relationship - an affection that blooms between you and someone you're spending a lot of time with - that's something that should feel organic and surprising, and not like this meter that you're tracking in the background to see how close you are to reaching the top."</p>
<p>Avowed was released in February to favourable reviews. I called it "one of this year's most pleasant surprises" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a>, relishing the game's sense of adventure and carefree attitude towards fun. It's very refreshing.</p>
<p>The game seems to have been a success for Obsidian and Xbox, too, leading to the question of what's next for it and the associated Pillars of Eternity series. Will there be a PlayStation 5 version, or an expansion, or a sequel? I put these questions to Patel in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-serious-skyrim-to-cheerful-fantasy-obsidian-on-the-evolution-of-avowed-and-grappling-with-the-expectations-that-come-from-your-own-history">my Avowed interview</a> and more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/niantic-scopely-sale-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/niantic-to-sell-gaming-division-to-saudi-funded-scopely-for-3-5b.1132251/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/niantic-scopely-sale-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Niantic has announced that it's sold off its gaming wing to the Saudi-funded mobile firm Scopely for the princely sum (no pun intended) of $3.5 billion.</p>

<p>The deal, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-niantic-saudi-rumor" rel="nofollow">rumored to be happening last month</a>, was confirmed today in a news <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/niantic-next-chapter?hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> entitled "Niantic's Next Chapter". Niantic says that Scopely will acquire its games, including <i>Pokemon Go</i>,&nbsp;<em>Pikmin Bloom</em>, and <i>Monster Hunter Now</i>, for the aforementioned sum "with an additional $350 million of cash from Niantic being distributed as part of the deal".</p>

<p>It sounds as though the development structure of Niantic's gaming teams won't be changing much; in its own <a href="https://www.scopely.com/en/news/scopely-to-acquire-niantic-games-business-which-includes-pokemon-go-one-of-the-most-successful-mobile-games-of-all-time" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Scopely says "all members of the Niantic gamemaking team" will join Scopely's staff and "continue to develop and operate their beloved experiences".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-now-niantic-sale-scopely.jpg?itok=qd4Db4zo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-now-niantic-sale-scopely.jpg?itok=YmkI-rFh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Niantic's sale of its gaming business includes games like&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Now</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>SVP Ed Wu says his team plans to use Scopely's "full commitment, experience, and resources" to make the game "the very best it can be".&nbsp;</p>

<p>For his part, Niantic head John Hanke says he's "confident" that Niantic games will remain a "bridge to connect people and inspire exploration" under Scopely, praising the new owners' "incredible live services" and "exceptional experience working with the world's biggest and most beloved intellectual properties".</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Scopely is the company responsible for mobile games like&nbsp;<em>Star Trek Fleet Command</em>,&nbsp;<em>Yahtzee with Buddies</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Monopoly Go</em>, which was the biggest mobile game launch of its year, <a href="https://www.scopely.com/en/news/monopoly-go-makes-history-as-the-biggest-mobile-game-launch-of-2023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">raking in over $1 billion</a>&nbsp;in 2023 alone.</p>

<p>The company is owned by the Savvy Gaming Group, a gaming investment company backed by the country's Public Investment Fund. Said fund also has shares in the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-becomes-nintendos-largest-outside-shareholder" rel="nofollow">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-buys-1-billion-stake-in-embracer-group" rel="nofollow">Embracer Group</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-arabia-pif-adds-stakes-in-capcom-nexon" rel="nofollow">Capcom</a>, among others.</p>

Appropriately, the new company will be called Niantic Spatial Inc., and its goal is "building spatial intelligence that helps people better understand, navigate, and engage with the physical world".</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Scopely's impact on Niantic's gaming properties will be, but it sounds as though the two studios don't intend to change much in the short term. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-atomfall-have-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Atomfall’s long-awaited release is considered low-key to many. It hasn’t received as much attention as other AAA rivals, but it should. So let’s see if it has Early Access to punch yourself a one-way irridatiated ticket to England. </p>



<p>We’ve bigged up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a> at Insider Gaming and believe its potential is boundless. Our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-played-again-most-anticipated-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview build</a> playthroughs have shown us the alternate lands of the UK for ourselves. Cumbria is usually one of England’s top hotspots for luxury, peace, and comfort. In Atomfall, it’s a literal fight for survival.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve wishlisted Atomfall or contemplated securing a pre-order, we’ve got everything you need to know about Atomfall and Early Access.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-atomfall-early-access">Can You Play Atomfall Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hell on Earth. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Atomfall has an Early Access option, meaning you can jump into the survival-RPG game before most people.</strong></p>



<p>Certain editions are slapped with exorbitant price tags—leaving players unwilling to part with large sums of money. However, Atomfall’s editions are more generous and include bonuses such as Early Access.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-atomfall-early-access">How to Get Atomfall Early Access</h2>



<p><strong>You need to pre-order either Atomfall Deluxe Edition or the Quarantine Edition to assure yourself of Early Access.</strong></p>



<p>There are three Atomfall editions to consider. But remember that <strong>only two of them have Early Access</strong>: The Deluxe and Quarantine Edition. The Standard Edition is an option, but only comes with pre-order bonuses and the game.</p>



<p>Furthermore, <strong>Atomfall Quarantine Edition is a PC-only version</strong> exclusively available in the <a href="https://shop.rebellion.com/products/atomfall-quarantine-edition?utm_source=LinkTree&amp;utm_medium=Atomfall&amp;utm_campaign=Quarantine+Edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rebellion Store</a>. </p>



<p>I wholeheartedly recommend you weigh up the pros and cons of getting Atomfall Early Access first. Then you can move onto the decision of choosing between the Deluxe and Quarantine Edition—unless you’re a console player, in which case the choice is easy!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-atomfall-early-access-start">When Does Atomfall Early Access Start?</h2>



<p><strong>Atomfall Early Access gets underway on March 24.</strong></p>



<p>This is three days before the official March 27 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfalls-release-date-has-been-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>. Depending on how excited you are and eager to get started, 72 hours is a lot. The extra price of admission is worth it for players desperate to see the aftereffects of the Windscale nuclear disaster.</p>



<p>You get more benefits in addition to Early Access, such as a Story Expansion Pack and in-game weapons and goodies. I’ve provided you with the information you need, so my job is done.</p>



<hr>



<p>We also have a detailed guide on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-atomfall-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall’s Xbox Game Pass</a> criteria. Plus, if you haven’t already, look at the RPG through a juicy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-atomfall-trailer-shows-games-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay features trailer</a>.</p>



<p>Is Atomfall looking like a Fallout clone? Or is it a potential Game of the Year contender in the making? Let us know down below.</p>

<p>Palworld players can finally play with friends across platforms, as a new crossplay update is planned for late March.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palworld’s Crossplay update will allow players to access multiplayer across all platforms and transfer Pals between worlds. Crossplay will be available on all the platforms the game released on, including Steam, Xbox, PlayStation 5, and Mac. More details about the update will be revealed on the day it is released.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PocketPair wishes to celebrate the new feature’s arrival in the community by offering a flat <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1899808005153251468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">25% discount</a> on Palworld on the PlayStation Store and Steam. The offer ends on March 27 on the PlayStation Store, and players are speculating that’s when this update will arrive. Currently, the developers haven’t provided a release date for crossplay in Palworld.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palworld is following its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-reveals-new-roadmap-for-one-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first-anniversary roadmap</a>, which was released early this year. Co-op crossplay and world transfer for pals have arrived, and now we are waiting on new collaborations and content partnerships. The developers are also continuing to work on introducing new Pals and features for players to try out in the game.</p>



<p>In other news, Palworld and Nintendo’s court battles continue as the latter has received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new patent</a> to help their case against PocketPair. Also, the game has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-32-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed 32 million players</a> within the first year. What are your thoughts on Palworld receiving crossplay later this month?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-roadmap-includes-lots-of-exciting-new-features-including-co-op-cross-play/1100-6528896/">Pocketpair confirmed that it would be arriving in 2025</a> alongside several other additions to the game. Improvements to world-object-placement and base Pals, new endgame content, and overall game optimization were also mentioned back then as part of several updates to Palworld ahead of its eventual full release.</p><p>Pocketpair also recently revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-reaches-massive-new-player-milestone-year-2-promised-to-be-even-better/1100-6529574/">Palworld had crossed a major player milestone</a>, as the game has exceeded 32 million players across all platforms it's currently available on, including Xbox's Game Pass and Game Preview programs. At the same time, Pocketpair has been involved in a legal dispute with Nintendo and The Pokemon Company, with the two companies <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-shares-more-details-about-nintendos-lawsuit-against-the-game/1100-6527664/">accusing it of infringing on several patents</a> owned by them.</p><p>Beyond that ongoing case, Sony and Pocketpair have also collaborated on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-and-sony-are-teaming-up/1100-6524828/">Palworld merchandise</a>, as the studio is aiming to grow the brand further with new business opportunities.</p>

This year, Game Developer sat down with the finalists&nbsp;for the IGF’s Nuovo and Grand Prize nominees ahead of GDC to explore the themes, design decisions, and tools behind each entry. Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> turns your personal living area into a spacecraft, filling it with strange machinery and alien plant forms. Whether you want to get to know your plants and their varied personalities or fly to entire worlds from your living room, this VR game offers striking places to visit and some interesting plants to care for.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer spoke with Doug North Cook, creative director of the Nuovo Award nominated game, to learn more about how they came upon the idea to make use of the player’s living space within a mixed-reality world, the design decisions that went into carefully making use of the player’s living space, and what appealed to them about having players care for plants when they’re soaring through the cosmos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Who are you, and what was your role in developing </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I am Doug North Cook, the CEO and creative director of Creature, the studio behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I can’t emphasize enough how much of a group effort this project was with our art director Ashley Pinnick and engineering director Mark Schram co-leading development with a much larger team. Their leadership, passion, creativity, and brilliance are what helped our team ship something that, at the start, felt impossible to build.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's your background in making games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of my background is actually in academia. I was a design professor focused on immersive technology leading a department at Chatham University in Pittsburgh until my friend Callum Underwood convinced me to leave to run VR at Robot Teddy (where we helped release </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last Clockwinder</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Among Us VR</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>No More Rainbows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and several others). I left Robot Teddy to focus on building </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and to build an XR-focused game label which also released the Meta Quest Game of the Year, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Maestro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the Apple Vision Pro Game of the Year, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>THRASHER</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The original concept for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was one of those magical moments where an idea lands nearly fully formed in your mind. I spent an entire day furiously filling a notebook to capture what I saw. The core concept revolved around this idea that if we were making a game in mixed reality and we couldn’t control the context that the user played the game in, then we needed to embrace the context and make it a core part of the game. We turned whatever room you played in into a starship and then we launched that room into outer space. Your room comes with you on an adventure, and in that way, it is a character in the story and the game feels different depending on where you play it. There is some deep magic in that.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A few days after having the original idea my wife helped me translate that initial vision into a pitch deck that I quickly shared around with the people who became the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team—the idea being to pull together people who had made some of the most important contributions to novel interaction, narrative, and technical design for immersive projects to date and get them all to collaborate on one project.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We built the game in Unity exclusively for the Meta Quest 3 series. This allowed us to do some techno-magic—integrating platform specific features to build a type of experience that is only just now possible to build.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> turns your home into a spacefaring craft. What appealed to you about taking the player's living space and adding fantastic elements to it? Why mix their reality with your creative alien technology and beings?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We often talked during development about the idea of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as an “assisted daydream” and that by grounding the player in their environment and slowing building up a shared illusion we can tap into the player’s imagination to fill in the gaps. We go really deep on the interactivity and responsiveness of the objects we put into your space so that you feel like they belong alongside the physical products in your space. We often see users move a chair to position themselves as the captain of the ship, move books from a shelf to make space for one of our plants—it is a type of imaginative play that demands a childlike approach. We wanted to instill in users a sense of wonder, delight, and awe.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges came from creating elements that would connect with the player's real world living space? What thoughts went into designing the various ship parts, technologies, and plants in such a way that they could connect with the player's world when living spaces are so varied in shape and structure?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was one of our biggest hurdles—making a contextless game that feels meaningful in any environment. Early on, we built consensus in the team around a few core design concepts that Ashley Pinnick, our art director, solidified into concept drawings and design language that dictated much of what the game became.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These included surface awareness—the idea that every object should meaningfully interact with the floor, tables, shelves, and any surface we can define at the platform level. A great example is the plant pots. If a user moves a pot towards a surface, the pot has legs that reach out from the bottom of the pot that land the pot on the surface and we cast a shadow on that surface—but if the player lets the pot go in mid-air the pot will turn on small jets that hover it in place. We try to ensure that players can interact with objects in a variety of ways and that they can discover through the natural course of play—learning alien technology as they go.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, we had ideas to augment the player’s space in more ways and have more visual overlays, but in the end what we found to be the most compelling with the current state of the technology was to have fewer objects that have a higher level of detail and richness. The plants are also aware of the space, the player, and each other in ways that can be surprising—one of the plants has a long tentacle arm that, if in reach of the helm, it will occasionally reach out and hit buttons on helm to turn on and off our holographic star map. Some of those plants are real rascals.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What ideas went into creating the various machines and ship devices so that they felt alien and creative, yet conveyed their usage in their design? How did you make a starship's controls feel intuitive?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, Ashley nailed down our organic, drippy, goopy shape language that serves as the basis for everything. We wanted the ship to feel soft, alive, and familiar all at once. We borrow some items from classic sci-fi like levers, buttons, and holographic projectors, but other items like our fertilizer creatures, and the contraption you use to access the dreams of alien plants, required multiple rounds of iteration to find something that was novel while still remaining accessible. We tried to focus on interactions that were simple yet surprising.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What appealed to you about focusing on caring for various plants in the game? About giving the plants various personalities for the player to uncover?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We were excited with the idea of making a game that encourages players to be caretakers and plant lovers—to find joy in nurturing. These are things we want to see more of in the world. With a mixed reality game, users are trusting us to build an experience in their home. We take this unspoken intimate contract really seriously and wanted to work to ensure that we created positive, magical memories for places. I think that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> imbues a little bit of magic into every space it is played in.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The personalities of the plants are a big part of this—they respond to your touch, they each have different needs, and they respond to care in different ways. Every player has a favorite (which ends up being placed in a place of prominence). They are somewhere in between plants and pets—a space we’d love to explore even more in the future.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you design the plants in order to convey their unique personalities? How do you create something that looks like a plant from another planet? How do you then show the player that plant's personality through its behavior and visual design?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When approaching the design of each plant, we tried to think holistically about the end-to-end experience of the player. The planet they find the plant on, the dream of the plant you enter into, the music in that dream, the interactions with the player—all of this comes together to paint a full picture of a complex entity. We tried to only occasionally borrow shapes and concepts for plants from Earth (like the flower on the eyeball plant), but for many of them we tried to focus on an interaction-first approach—you feed this plant, this plant wants to poke things, this plant plays tones when touched—and then we designed the plant to encourage and foster those interactions.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Finally, what thoughts went into the different worlds players could explore with their lander? Into creating whole worlds to amaze the player, and the ways in which they could interact with those worlds? When you were not bound by the limits of the player's living space, how did that alter your designs? &nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We went through several radically different concepts for the lander. We knew we wanted to keep the player in their room at all times but that we wanted to allow them to explore these worlds. We settled on the lander feed concept as something that would allow players to collect some lore, catch the vibe of the planet, and get a sense of the plant’s home world all while still keeping them grounded in their home environment.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To do this, we close all the exterior windows of the ship, dim the passthrough, and focus the player's view on the feed. We wanted players to enjoy these scenes as interactive vistas. This, like many of the interactions in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, are meant to invite the player to embody the narrative of the world where they are a researcher, explorer, and caretaker. We hope that players engage with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> less as a classic game and more as an adventure that they allow themselves to imagine going on. If you are willing to play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that way, the journey is worth the trip.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Paradox has announced a new core expansion coming to its strategy game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> this April, inspired by Genghis Khan and the Mongols.</p>
<p>Khans of the Steppe will arrive on 28th April as one of four key components comprising the game's fourth chapter.</p>
<p>The expansion will include the Steppe region as players take on the mantle of the Great Khan and lead conquests across the world, fulfilling the prophecy of the "Scourge of God".</p>

<p>Further, it will allow players to experience the traditions and culture of the Mongols as a young Genghis Khan; embrace Nomadic Governments to manage a mobile population; and utilise a new Tributaries system to forge alliances and secure resources.</p>
<p>Alongside Khans of the Steppe, the map will be expanded to include China, Japan and Southeast Asia, with each region having new types of government, special events, character roles and more. This area was previously unseen in the series.</p>
<p>Thirdly, a new event pack will task players with preparing an elaborate coronation to display wealth and power as a new ruler takes the throne.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Crowns of the World pack will unlock immediately on purchase, including six new historic royal crowns, four new hairstyles, and two beard designs for character portraits.</p>
<p>Khans of the Steppe will be available individually for £16.75, or can be purchased as part of the Chapter Four Pack including the other three elements costing £37.15.</p>
<p>The release of the fourth chapter is Paradox's big plan for Crusader Kings 3 in 2025. It follows 2024's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crusader-kings-3s-2024-roadmap-brings-legendary-tales-the-black-death-and-more">third chapter which brought the Black Death</a>.</p>
<p>Last year was a particularly tough time for the Swedish publisher, following a number of high profile cancellations and delays. That included the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-shuts-down-life-by-you-studio-following-sims-likes-sudden-cancellation">cancellation of The Sims-like game Life By You</a>, delayed DLC for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">performance issues</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">parting ways with Prison Architect 2 developer Double Eleven</a> after nine years on the series.</p>
<p>Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester acknowledged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-ceo-admits-it-made-the-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-following-cancellation-of-life-by-you">the company "made the wrong calls in several projects"</a>, which deputy CEO Mattia Lilja and chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-must-refocus-to-rebuild-trust-and-survive-bosses-say-after-life-by-you-cancellation">addressed in an interview with Eurogamer</a>.</p>
<p>"When it's inside the core, even if we make a mistake or we launch something that may be not up to par, we are generally able to fix it over time and we don't stop... we're not abandoning those projects," said Lilja. "We're going to keep working. And when we have games that do work, we show that we understand what people want and we can absolutely give that to them."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But rather than being packed with more of the suspenseful violence that helped make <em>The Last of Us </em>one of the most well-known game franchises of all time, I hope the sequel leaves it behind entirely. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,195922,195896" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>(<strong>Note</strong>: this post will discuss the ending of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, so if you’re only discovering the story via the TV show, there may be what you consider <strong>spoilers ahead.</strong>)</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler Warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler Warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The remarks, which Druckmann made during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with <em>Variety</em></a></span>, aren’t the worst news I could have heard about the future of <em>The Last of Us. </em>If my choices are between another hyperviolent entry in the series and no game at all, I’ll choose the latter, because while I admire the first two games, I don’t think there’s anywhere meaningful left to take from the violence at their core. The characters have  already suffered so much, endured so much, and wrought so much violence themselves; what’s to be gained from seeing them continue to be trapped in this vicious cycle, enacting even more brutal violence on each other?</p><p>No. In my opinion, the only place to go from the second game’s crescendo of brutality and bloodshed, which ultimately sees one major character spare the life of another she has fought very hard to kill, is to explore who these characters become and what they’re left with <em>after </em>breaking the cycle. The only meaningful way forward for the series, it seems to me, is in seeing these characters forge some kind of new path for themselves that, at long last, leaves the violence which has exacted such a terrible price behind.</p><p>In all likelihood, such a game would never get made because that violence is considered core to the series’ marketability. The nailbiting and often staggeringly brutal combat is what makes them blockbusters. And yet, if any studio working in the so-called “AAA” space can challenge the notion that a game in a franchise like <em>The Last of Us</em> needs to involve violence, it’s Naughty Dog. After all, this is the team that produced the work which, more than any other game up to this point, goes against the conventional wisdom about M-rated AAA games: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-left-behind-the-kotaku-review-1521786675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-left-behind-the-kotaku-review-1521786675"><em>Left Behind</em></a></span>, the story-focused DLC expansion for <em>The Last of Us. </em></p><figure id="" data-id="5741f95ef83c7d4f4b0d1bcbffaae87f" data-recommend-id="image://5741f95ef83c7d4f4b0d1bcbffaae87f" data-format="png" data-width="1654" data-height="925" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Riley make goofy &quot;romantic&quot; gestures in a photo booth in a moment from The Last of Us: Left Behind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie and Riley make goofy &quot;romantic&quot; gestures in a photo booth in a moment from The Last of Us: Left Behind." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5741f95ef83c7d4f4b0d1bcbffaae87f" data-recommend-id="image://5741f95ef83c7d4f4b0d1bcbffaae87f" data-format="png" data-width="1654" data-height="925" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Riley make goofy &quot;romantic&quot; gestures in a photo booth in a moment from The Last of Us: Left Behind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This release took mechanics that had been components of the original game’s brutal combat—stealthy sneaking, brick throwing, and so on--and recontextualized them as the stuff of bonding and play between Ellie and her friend (and crush) Riley while they explore an abandoned mall. <em>Left Behind </em>did still have combat in it; Ellie had to fight both humans and infected in the game’s “present day,” in between flashbacks to her trip to the mall with Riley. Even so, the DLC chapter<em> </em>illuminated the possibility for releases to exist in the AAA space that are more about storytelling, character interaction, and environmental exploration than about traditional video-game action.</p><p>So here’s what I’d love a follow-up to <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>to be: a new chapter, perhaps somewhat akin to <em>Left Behind</em>, that de-emphasizes combat or abandons it altogether, and focuses its energies entirely on bringing the story to a close that shows the characters carrying on their lives now that the circle of violence has been broken. Who can they be, now that they are no longer pursuing vengeance? What kind of relationships can they form? What kind of world can they try to build, for themselves and each other? I think these are fascinating questions, rich with storytelling possibility. I especially want to see Lev, a character introduced in <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>who is only just beginning to come into his own by the time the game ends, get to discover and define himself.</p><p>Truth be told, I think the shocking violence of the existing two games could be given new meaning if we really get to see the characters, at long last, finding their way out of it, out of its limiting and destructive patterns that have cost them all so much. We are not doomed to live that way. We can make better choices. And the remarkable thing about such a game is that, in illuminating new possibilities for the lives of its characters, it would also show new possibilities for the realm of AAA games. </p><figure id="" data-id="1014788c3765f300446ece32a500b47a" data-recommend-id="image://1014788c3765f300446ece32a500b47a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1299" data-height="724" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie looks at a skyline on an overgrown city street in a moment from The Last of Us Part II." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie looks at a skyline on an overgrown city street in a moment from The Last of Us Part II." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1014788c3765f300446ece32a500b47a" data-recommend-id="image://1014788c3765f300446ece32a500b47a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1299" data-height="724" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie looks at a skyline on an overgrown city street in a moment from The Last of Us Part II." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I don’t think it has to be a 25-hour epic like <em>Part II </em>was.

I think that game looks rad, and I hope it sells like hotcakes. But what if, in addition to doing mainstream commercial work like that, Naughty Dog was able, with Sony’s full support, to produce something riskier, something less commercial that defied the rigid expectations that hold so much sway in mainstream gaming? Isn’t there value in making bold artistic choices, in broadening people’s notions of what’s possible within a space? It may not make heaps of money, but I bet a move like that would earn respect and be very exciting to those who care about games as an art form.</p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://carolynpetit.medium.com/broken-people-broken-worlds-thoughts-on-the-last-of-us-part-ii-a012de5d2acf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://carolynpetit.medium.com/broken-people-broken-worlds-thoughts-on-the-last-of-us-part-ii-a012de5d2acf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a piece about <em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a></span>, I lamented all the things the game, in its endless, indulgent violence, didn’t show us:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Why don’t we get to see Ellie doing the work of trying to be a better person? Why don’t we get to see her trying to rebuild things with Dina, and trying to internalize what Joel said to her, that she deserves to love and be loved? Because these remain the limits of AAA games. Because that’s the part where no shooting happens, and therefore it remains outside the scope of a game like this. Because we’re still so trapped.</p></blockquote><p>We don’t have to be trapped anymore, though. Naughty Dog has demonstrated that it’s more than capable of brilliantly creating the kind of interactive storytelling that could give <em>The Last of Us </em>the poignant, meaningful coda it deserves. I don’t really want a standard <em>Part III </em>for this series, not if it comes with even more of the horrifying, senseless, profoundly costly violence that has defined the series up to this point. But a game that breaks that cycle? That lets the series end on a note of tenderness, of muted, grounded hope for a better world or a different way of life? Yeah. That I’d like to see. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideki-kamiya-says-%E2%80%9Ci-couldn%E2%80%99t-allow-myself-to-kill-my-soul%E2%80%9D-on-his-decision-to-leave-platinumgames.1132185/</guid>

<p>In a new interview, Hideki Kamiya has explained in more detail on his decision to leave PlatinumGames in 2023.</p>



<p>Speaking with Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/03/09/150183.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Spark</a> and picked up on by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-on-leaving-platinumgames-i-couldnt-allow-myself-to-kill-my-soul" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Hideki Kamiya went into depth about his reason on leaving PlatinumGames in 2023.</p>



<p>“The reason I left PlatinumGames was because the company’s way of thinking was gradually shifting towards a modern model of game development that doesn’t place importance on the creators’ individuality,” he said.</p>



<p>He continued, “Even if it meant the end of my career as a creator, I couldn’t allow myself to kill my soul in order to work in an environment that I didn’t agree with.”</p>



<p>Hideki Kamiya was one of four founders of PlatinumGames, which was founded in October 2007. After leaving the studio, Kamiya went on to found CLOVERS inc. </p>



<p>Earlier this month, Kamiya <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideki-kamiya-scalebound-develop-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed interest in wanting to return to developing Scalebound</a>, a game that was in development in partnership with Xbox and announced in 2014. The game was cancelled by Microsoft in 2017 for apparent issues with Unreal Engine and a lack of experience at the studio creating some of the games core elements. In addition, it was also said that the game couldn’t live up to the players high expectations.</p>



<p>As for if Scalebound will happen again remains to be seen, but for now, we’ll have to wait for CLOVERS or Kamiya to announce their first project.</p>



<p>What do you think of Kamiya leaving PlatinumGames? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

I have every belief Pokémon Go will further flourish as part of Scopely, not only into its second decade, but for many more years to come, under the mission of discovering Pokémon in the real world and inspiring people to explore together,” Wu continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our new partnership, along with our decade long partnership with The Pokémon Company, means we can maintain this long-term focus. Scopely fully believes in our mission and ongoing goal to create the best Pokémon Go experience possible. Their focus will be to support our team, providing resources to continue delivering the gameplay you all know and love.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The entire Pokémon Go team is staying together through this partnership. The same people who have been guiding and building the game for years will continue doing what we love. We’re always continually adding to the game - Raid Battles, friends, Go Battle League, Routes, Dynamax/Gigantamax, and, of course, Pokémon Go Fest and our live events - which I look forward to continuing to do for many years to come. Scopely empowers their game teams as autonomous groups to go after the roadmaps that they’re inspired to pursue, and what each team believes is best for the player experience. This approach is extremely appealing to us at Niantic games. I have spoken to a number of game leaders at Scopely who have given me great confidence in how the company enables each game to independently develop and creatively thrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We will be joining a broader organization dedicated to games. I believe that Pokémon Go can continue to thrive with Scopely’s exclusive and long-term focus on game-making. Scopely’s status as a private company also means we can prioritize what’s best for you, our Trainers, for the long term. We believe that prioritizing short-term gains at the expense of our long-term mission would be counterproductive and self-defeating. Every interaction I’ve had with Scopely leaders has reinforced that we are in total agreement that the scale, longevity and most of all, real world community, of Pokémon Go make it truly special. We are united in protecting that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With Scopely’s full commitment, experience and resources, we’re going to make Pokémon Go the very best it can be – with incredible battles for thousands of Trainers at a time at our live events and new ways to connect to your friends and community, all while remaining focused on the excitement and experience of discovering Pokémon in the real world. We have invested to empower thousands of Community Leaders and Ambassadors who lead millions of Trainers to play together in the real world, and Scopely is in full agreement that this highly-admired program will be a priority to invest in together. The real-world community that loves Pokémon Go will remain our guiding light in all we do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our partners at The Pokémon Company have always been central to how we build this game together, starting with the physics of the first Poké Ball throw that we hand-tuned together. I am incredibly grateful for their daily wisdom, guidance, and careful stewardship of our shared vision for discovering Pokémon in the real world, and I’m very excited that our partnership with The Pokémon Company will continue as it has for the last decade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I won’t say that Pokémon Go will remain the same, because it has always been a work in progress. But how we create and evolve it will remain unchanged, and I hope that we can make the experience even better for all of you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have so much gratitude for the incredible joy of serving hundreds of millions of Trainers in our real-world community for the past nine years, and I truly believe the best is yet to come.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Niantic said it’s spinning off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-players-have-been-training-an-ai-to-auto-complete-the-real-world">its controversial geospatial AI business</a> into a new company, Niantic Spatial Inc., “enabling it to accelerate and scale even more rapidly.” Scopely is a $50 million investor in this new venture, which also has $200 million from Niantic itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Niantic Spatial will continue to own and operate its other real-world AR games, Ingress Prime and Peridot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-golden-age-the-rise-and-fall-resident-evil-monster-hunter-wilds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Monster Hunter Wilds breaking Steam records and Resident Evil more popular than ever thanks to Village and a handful of stellar remakes, it’s almost as if Capcom is incapable of failure. But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, after a string of critical and commercial flops, Capcom was on its knees. It had lost its way <em>and</em> its audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom was suffering from an identity crisis. Resident Evil, which established the survival horror genre, had lost its bite after Resident Evil 4. Another big hitter, Street Fighter, was on the ropes after the poorly-received Street Fighter 5. It could easily have been the critical end of Capcom and its much-loved games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in the darkness, there was light. A change in the way Capcom made its games, supported by a powerful new game engine, gave these much-loved series a new lease of life, and kickstarted years of critical and financial success that catapulted Capcom back into the big league.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil Lost Its Way</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/09/15/baitguardpng-9b2882.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Resident Evil 6 marked a low point for the mainline series. Credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">2016 was a bad year for Capcom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big Resident Evil game released that year was Umbrella Corps, an online co-op shooter  that was pummeled by reviewers and fans alike. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 5 was met by a collective eyebrow raise from longtime fans who could hardly believe this lackluster fighting game was the sequel to the brilliant Street Fighter 4. And Dead Rising 4, which featured the long-awaited return of beloved photojournalist Frank West, would end up being the series’ final new entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was the low ebb of a string of forgettable years Capcom had endured since 2010. The mainline Resident Evil games were met with diminishing critical reception despite strong sales. Street Fighter was on the ropes thanks to a poorly received new entry, and Capcom mainstays like Devil May Cry were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the company’s most popular and successful franchise at the time, Monster Hunter, was huge in Japan but struggled breaking into international markets.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this is a far cry from the Capcom we know today.  Since 2017, Capcom has been one of the few major development studios that has rarely missed a beat. The Osaka-based company has released a stream of hit games from its most famous franchises, racking up both sales and accolades. We’re talking about a run of releases that includes Monster Hunter World, Devil May Cry 5, Street Fighter 6, and a trio of industry-leading remakes plus an acclaimed soft reboot of the Resident Evil series. In short: lately, Capcom seems incapable of failure. .</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Achieving this success took more than simply learning from mistakes. Capcom had to re-think its entire strategy, from the type of players it targeted to the technology it used, to make such a turnaround possible. To learn more about this seismic shift, IGN sat down with four of Capcom’s leading creatives to find out how one of gaming’s most successful gaming companies tripped, fell, and picked itself up better than ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom was founded in 1979 as a maker of electronic game machines, or “capsule computers”. It rose to ascendency during the 80s and 90s thanks to 2D games like Street Fighter and Mega Man, and then made the all-important  jump to 3D with games like Resident Evil. Between 2000 and 2010 Capcom successfully transitioned many of its big, golden-era franchises into the modern age, a process that gave birth to one of the greatest games of all time: Resident Evil 4. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/11/29/re4speedrunbr-1565373045580-1638184942390.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The GOAT Resident Evil game? Credit: Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">2005’s Resident Evil 4 is considered by many to be a generational high point thanks to its ingenious mix of horror and action. But that mix altered the course of the Resident Evil franchise dramatically. At its core, Resident Evil 4 is a horror game, inspired by the likes of Friday the 13th, H.P. Lovecraft, and the works of John Carpenter. But sprinkled between the strands of its horror DNA are tremendously effective moments of Hollywood action cinema. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this ideal balance between horror and action was lost in  subsequent games.  In 2009’s Resident Evil 5, hero Chris Redfield punches a car-sized boulder with his bare fists, and infected enemies are gunned down in a car-chase sequence that’s more Fast and Furious than frightening.  The series was losing its identity and this was clear to both players and the developers like Resident Evil 4 remake director Yasuhiro Ampo who’s been working on Resident Evil games since 1996.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Overall throughout the Resident Evil series, we set up different goals, challenges, and things we want to try with each game… But this time, many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making,” Ampo says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This directional confusion would result in games like 2012’s Resident Evil 6, a game that tried to have its cake and eat it too. In order to please both action and horror fans, Resident Evil 6 split the game between six playable characters and three unique storylines. Each section catered to either horror or action fans, and so never achieved that all-important balance of both genres, which ultimately left nobody truly satisfied. Disgruntled fans shared their disappointment in these new, action-packed Resident Evil games online, while the developers continued experimenting with spinoffs that ventured into new territory like online co-op. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This downward trend was not exclusive to Capcom’s survival horror series, though. Not so long after the release of Resident Evil 4, the company’s Street Fighter team was also flying high. Street Fighter 4 was an instant hit thanks to its unique art-style and great cast of new and returning characters. It became an immediate hit at fighting game tournaments and in college dorms alike.But, like with Resident Evil, Capcom failed to match those highs with a sequel. Compared to its imaginative and full-fledged predecessor, 2016’s Street Fighter 5 was criticized for releasing barebones with hardly any single player content, as well as its abysmal online functionality. Fans cite a clear lack of polish and a confusing philosophy towards balance that made the overall experience just plain frustrating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it wasn’t just Street Fighter and Resident Evil that were struggling. Almost every key franchise struggled to make a mark. Devil May Cry, the studio’s popular, heavy-metal action game was seeing diminishing returns to the point where Capcom outsourced the next game in the series, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry, to UK-based studio Ninja Theory. While it’s gone on to become something of a cult title, DmC’s fresh take on the series’ mythology, redesigned protagonist, and sluggish 30fps frame rate was met with vitriol from online fans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after such a muted reception the series was shelved until further notice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This slate of misfortunes defines the Capcom of the early to mid-2010s. Key franchises struggled to replicate the successes of the past, while other titles were put in cold storage. New games attempting to capture the western market, like Lost Planet and Asura’s Wrath, also failed to land with audiences. There was the odd bright spot, like Dragon’s Dogma, the new dark fantasy RPG from Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno, but for the most part Capcom’s focus was all over the place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was clear something needed to change.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Street Fighter 5, The Lost Cause</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/10/27/streetfighter5-dhalsim-6jpg-996e0f.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Street Fighter 5 was a let down. Credit: Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">By the mid-2010s Capcom had begun to enact a number of strategy-shifting changes that would totally transform the company’s fate. Such changes had to begin small, and so the first matter of business was putting out the existing fires. Street Fighter 5 needed to be fixed. And so Capcom enlisted director Takayuki  Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to help steer the troubled game towards stability. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While neither were there from the ground floor of Street Fighter 5’s development, and therefore can’t detail why Street Fighter 5 was released in the state it was, the duo inherited a game that greatly needed some substantial fixes in order to regain the trust of fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There definitely were some challenges within the production of the game, and that was part of the reason why I was brought into the team,” Nakayama admits. “And because we were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/10/01/21630094529dcaaa5266cojpg-b6a32e.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Street Fighter 5 would be improved into Street Fighter 5: Arcade Edition. Credit: Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those constraints severely limited the scope of what the pair could achieve. And so rather than transform Street Fighter 5 into a S-tier game, much of the work Nakayama did was fixing the game’s most pressing problems and biding his time until work could begin on Street Fighter 6. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We just didn’t really have enough time to address some of the problems and challenges we faced in Street Fighter V," Nakayama says. "And so, with our hands tied behind our backs, we basically had to wait for those ideas to be brought back for the initial conceptual phases for Street Fighter 6, so we could tackle and do things properly for the next title."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this considered, why did Capcom not just end Street Fighter 5’s development and begin working right away on a sequel? If it was such a weight around the necks of the developers, couldn’t they just start from scratch? According to Matsumoto, abandoning Street Fighter 5 just wasn’t in the cards. <em><strong>“</strong></em>There wasn’t any sort of sense of like, ‘Okay let’s just end Street Fighter 5 and focus on Street Fighter 6.’ It was more like, while we were working on Street Fighter V, we were trying to figure out what we really wanted to do in Street Fighter 6 content-wise,” he says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Basically, we tried different things during the development of Street Fighter 5 to see if it worked and then we took the things that did work and applied that to Street Fighter 6. It was like the development of Street Fighter V was an ongoing process that helped us figure out, ‘Okay, what is it that we want to do for the next level?”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The team treated Street Fighter 5 as a lab where they could learn from their design mistakes and figure out what to do differently for the sequel. The years-long process required careful consideration of the game’s every core aspect, which informed  several important changes . There were numerous updates, starting with the fundamentals like steady improvements to the netcode and character re-balances, and progressing all the way up to new characters, V-Triggers, and even entire new mechanics like V-Shift, a new defensive move that provided a brief window of invincibility that the devs were considering introducing in Street Fighter 6 but decided to test in Street Fighter 5.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a much larger goal for all these improvements beyond just elevating the game to an acceptable level, though. Capcom was on a mission to rediscover the fun. At the end of the day, fighting games should be enjoyable to play, but Street Fighter 5 had become a somewhat frustrating discipline to master. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We both realized that fighting games are fun, and when you get used to them, it becomes more enjoyable and something you can essentially play forever as long as you have an opponent to play against,” Matsumoto says.  “However, one of the challenges that we faced with Street Fighter V is that we felt that there wasn’t a clear pathway that helped guide players to get to that level where they finally feel like they’re having fun and will want to continue playing.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Street Fighter had previously tried to be more approachable by lowering the difficulty, but this only served to turn off longtime fans. Instead, Street Fighter 6’s approach was to expand the tools available to new players while giving experienced fans everything they already loved about the series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While they could have cut their losses on Street Fighter 5 and immediately tried to win fans back with a sequel, Nakayama and Masuhiro knew that this would be a shortcut that didn’t grow Street Fighter in any meaningful way. But by sticking with Street Fighter 5 and using it as a testbed for new ideas, 2023’s Street Fighter 6 was able to launch as one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the entire franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Matsumoto and Nakayama were able to take the work put into Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition and apply the lessons they learned to Street Fighter 6, it was important that Capcom did not repeat these kinds of situations and be forced into having to overhaul games again. A significant shift in strategy was needed that would prevent such a disaster ever happening. And that’s where a couple of vital behind-the-scenes changes came into play.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Monster Hunter Took Over The World</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/11/08/monsterhunterworld-blogroll-1516867463450-1667927878979.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The start of the Monster Hunter revolution. Credit: Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Around the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Itsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.”&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">No other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Firstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch.The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the widespread adoption of mobile consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“20 years ago in Japan, having a network connection wasn't as easy, and there weren’t a huge amount of people playing Monster Hunter online. However, handheld consoles made multiplayer gameplay easy without internet access, and I regard it as a great success that we had players experience the game in this way, which was one of the ways we really wished for them to play and enjoy it, even in that era when online gameplay wasn't easy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s mobile games market, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the reality was that Monster Hunter <em>did </em>have fans in the west, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For World, we conducted focus tests across the world, and some of the feedback and opinions that we got during that process really affected how we designed our game systems and impacted how much success we had globally,”<em><strong> </strong></em>Tsujimoto says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really about getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 7 Began Turning Things Around</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2016/09/19/03bmpjpgcopyjpg-fe1366.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Welcome to the family. Credit: Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter had a winning formula.The challenge Capcom faced was finding ways to convince global audiences to give it a shot. But it was not such a straightforward task for every series in the company’s portfolio. When it came to Resident Evil, the development team had to decide which of the series’ intertwined formulas was a winner; gory action or survival horror. Ultimately it was Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi who made the call. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was around the time I was working on Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2. I was trying to test different things, try different approaches,” recalls Resident Evil 2 and 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Ampo recalls. “And around this time is when the R&amp;D teams were divided into R&amp;D division one and two. The executive producer of the Resident Evil series, Jun Takeuchi, took command of R&amp;D division one, and he set the core direction that the Resident Evil series needed to go back to its origins, to its roots.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Takeuchi ruled that Resident Evil must focus on survival horror as its guiding light. This proved to be the right decision. Resident Evil 7 was announced at PlayStation’s E3 2016 conference with a moody trailer shot in first-person, showing the insides of a dilapidated house. I was there in attendance when the Roman numeral for seven appeared, followed by the title Resident Evil. The convention hall roared in excitement.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“We cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There were, of course, questions about how Resident Evil could make the jump to first-person. By that point, third-person, over-the-shoulder gunplay had become synonymous with the series. It turns out, however, that in exchange for moving to a first-person perspective, Resident Evil regained something it had lost: It became scary again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With Resident Evil 7, the executive producer, Jun Takeuchi, made it clear that we cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary and about survival. So he made it clear that Resident Evil 7 would go back to its origins, it would be very cautious with its survival elements. And with that as a basis, then we would try new and different things,” Ampo says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game was a hit. While maybe not quite operating on the same level as Resident Evil 4, this significant shift in direction allowed for a welcome return to survival horror. Thanks to its unsettling and claustrophobic southern gothic setting, Resident Evil 7 ranks as one of the scariest games in the entire series. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Capcom wasn’t going to abandon the third-person perspective that was so key to the series’ DNA. While new mainline titles like Resident Evil 7 and 8 would stay in first-person, Capcom planned to release third-person games through a series of brand-new remakes, starting with Resident Evil 2. Capcom realized there was a demand for remakes thanks to the appearance of several fan projects at the time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was like, ‘all right people really want this to happen.’ So producer [Yoshiaki] Hirabayashi came up with the slogan: ‘Well, we’ll do it,’” Ampo reveals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is one of the best games in the entire series. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a perfect blend of horror, combining all the action and puzzles fans have come to expect from the series with a new menacing Tyrant system that allows the hulking Mr. X to continuously stalk you throughout the Raccoon City police station. Under Ampo’s direction, Resident Evil 2 Remake became the second best-selling Resident Evil game in the franchise’s history. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, Capcom would follow up its incredible success with a remake of Resident Evil 3, another PlayStation 1 game that could clearly benefit from a modern reinvention. But, following that, surely Capcom wouldn’t remake Resident Evil 4 – a game that still felt refreshingly modern despite being almost 20 years old. Why touch something many  considered to be almost perfect?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ampo reveals that there was some hesitation to tackle Resident Evil 4 for sure. “As you mentioned, [Resident Evil 4] was still a title that enjoyed some popularity. So there was a lot of internal discussion on how maybe it’s not a good idea. Maybe we don’t need a remake for Resident Evil 4, especially because Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But despite any initial hesitation, the team pushed through with a remake and the results speak for themselves. Resident Evil 4 Remake was another bonafide hit. Much of its success comes down to the biggest changes, which were focused on fine-tuning the action-horror ratio to achieve Takeuchi’s goal of keeping the series true to its survival horror roots. And so gone were some of the original game’s campier elements,  replaced by a moodier, darker tone that still kept the heart-pounding action hero moments.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/03/09/re4-chainsawdemo-1-blogroll-1678402594429.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Horror reborn. Credit: Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Around the same time as Resident Evil’s rediscovery of its horror core, longtime Devil May Cry director, Hideaki Itsuno, had a similar epiphany. After a brief sojourn into the RPG world with Dragon’s Dogma, Itsuno watched as the action genre began to soften in order to appeal to a more casual audience. And so when the chance to direct Devil May Cry 5 arrived, Itsuno saw an opportunity to challenge the audience of a genre he felt was in need of a good kick in the ass. He would do so in spectacular fashion, achieved by leveraging the company’s most powerful game engine to date.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Reason Behind The Change</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/06/11/dmc5-screen3-1528682163426.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The goal? Make the coolest game ever. Credit: Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I felt like the main trend with action games was to make action games that were very kind,” Itsuno admits. “Maybe, for me, a little bit too kind to the players, lending a hand to the player too much to my liking.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Itsuno took over director duties on Devil May Cry starting with the second game in the series, and has since helmed every new iteration, save for Ninja Theory’s DmC.  Following the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008, it would be almost 11 years before Itsuno directed another Devil May Cry game. But when he did finally return, he would oversee one of the most critically and financially successful games in the entire franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 10 years away from the franchise gave Itsuno time to figure out where he wanted to take the series. And more importantly he would return with a new arsenal of tech. "Technology-wise, there were not just little improvements that you would have when you work on a series consecutively," Itsuno says. "When there’s a wide timeframe, [the technology] changes significantly.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This vision coincided with the launch of Capcom’s new RE Engine. It’s the engine that most of Capcom’s games run on today. Replacing the old MT Framework that had powered everything from Dead Rising to Monster Hunter World, the major upshot of the RE Engine was its handling of photorealistic assets. This gave Capcom’s development teams access to higher levels of visual fidelity than ever before. It was also much nimbler than its predecessor, making it easier to implement changes if something wasn’t working as it should. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ampo tells me  the origins of the RE Engine thus, "So the original concept for the RE Engine was to allow for a development environment that was less stressful and could help us to make things quicker. Because it’s an internally developed engine, when we needed any additional tools, well, we could ask for them internally. They could be fixed somewhat quickly, internally, and also iterated on.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This meant Capcom’s developers could also trial-and-error development choices on the fly. This proved vital for Itsuno, whose goal was to make the “coolest” action game of all time. That meant a lot of trial-and-error to make sure everything from the way the game looked to the way it played was as slick and stylish as possible. The RE Engine’s combination of rapid development tools and photorealistic capabilities meant Itsuno was able to increase the pure style of Devil May Cry by magnitudes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Devil May Cry is a franchise that stands on being cool,” Itsuno says. “That’s what the franchise is, it’s about being cool. Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool. Anything I’ve seen on TV, in movies, and comics I’ve read, any sport experiences I’ve had, I try to distill everything that I think is cool into what the game is.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">A New Capcom Golden Age</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Since 2017, Capcom has released a game of the year contender on a nearly annual basis. In a time when major studios are struggling to find consistency, Capcom’s winning streak of 10 critically acclaimed games in less than a decade is a major outlier. That trend only looks to continue with Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Focusing on a central goal of creating globally appealing games, all built with a technologically advanced engine capable of powering a multitude of different genres, proved to be a formula for unprecedented success. The Capcom of today is able to elegantly switch from laser-focused fighting games to tight survival horror to sprawling open-world action RPGs without missing a beat. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But what’s more impressive is that Capcom’s mission of making global, mainstream games did not dilute its games in the slightest. Instead, Capcom appears to have found the ultimate balance of keeping its games true to themselves — whether that’s the pure survival horror of Resident Evil, competitive spirit of Street Fighter, or the unique battle systems of Monster Hunter — all while expanding the audience for these games by millions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of Capcom’s contemporaries are now finding themselves where Capcom was just a decade ago — fruitlessly chasing trends and losing sight of their identities. But for Capcom, the changes it made over the past decade has resulted in a new golden age that shows no sign of slowing down. Capcom may have fallen, but it has risen up better than ever. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked if they believe this is a new Capcom Golden Age, the directors largely agreed. Street Fighter’s Nakayama tells me, “It’s a very exciting time to be at Capcom right now. A lot of us are able to get excited about what we’re working on and are able to focus on things that we think are fun. So, yes, I guess a golden age may be one interpretation of that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter’s Tsujimoto put it more plainly: “Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year. Hopefully we can extend it as long as we can.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Indeed, account migration problems are at the heart of most of the negative reviews flagged as ‘most helpful.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“ ‘The GTA Online profile associated with this Rockstar Games account is not eligible for migration at this time,’ ” reported one disgruntled player. “If you think I'm throwing away nearly 700 hours of gameplay on one character so that you can make a few more bucks off me, then you can lick my anal orifice clean.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is an objective downgrade from the ‘old’ version. Gonna pretend this was never released and continue to enjoy Legacy version until the new game comes out when I'm 60.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm leaving a negative review mainly due to Rockstar deciding that some accounts should arbitrarily not be able to migrate, and if you ask for help from support, they just say they can't do anything about it,” reads another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can't migrate either of my two accounts," another negative review reads. "R* support is completely useless and can't help. With the game being over 10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ years old I am sure as hell not going to completely restart all my progress in Online just to get marginally better graphics (if that) and HSW and whatever other minuscule ♥♥♥♥ they added."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite these issues, GTA 5 Enhanced remains one of the most-played games on Steam, with a 187,059 peak concurrent player count since launch.

			<p>Dino Crisis may be the next CAPCOM series to see a proper comeback in the future, following the return of the Onimusha and Okami franchises, judging from some recent happenings.</p>
<p>As reported by Gematsu on Bluesky, CAPCOM trademarked Dino Crisis on March 4th in Japan. By itself, this doesn't mean much, as companies file a lot of trademarks that end up getting unused just to hold onto their IPs, but there are good reasons to be hopeful in this case. As highlighted by ResetERA forums member <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-trademarked-dino-crisis-on-march-4-in-japan.1131402/post-136887345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jawmuncher</a>, any trademark filed in Japan usually shows how a company has a real intention to do something with the IP, and there's a precedence of CAPCOM actually reviving a franchise following a similar trademark filing with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gameplay/">Onimusha series.</a></p>

<p>While the Dino Crisis series has been left dormant for a good while, the survival horror series by CAPCOM has already made a very small comeback with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">recent GOG releases</a> of the first two entries, complete with new features such as improved DirectX game renderer, new rendering options including V-Sync control, gamma correction, integer scaling, anti-aliasing and more, increased rendering resolution to 4K and color depth to 32-bit, improved geometry calculation, smoother animation, video and music playback, cloud saves support and much more. Hopefully, the re-release of the two classic games won't be the end of the series, although series creator Shinji Mikami believes CAPCOM has no reason to<a href="https://wccftech.com/shinji-mikami-says-no-need-for-dino-crisis-to-exist-when-monster-hunter-is-so-successful/"> bring back Dino Crisis while the Monster Hunter series continues to be successful.</a></p>

<p>Pokemon Go developer Niantic has confirmed that Monopoly Go maker Scopely has acquired its games business for $3.5 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Confirming <span>last month’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-developer-niantic-close-to-selling-games-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, Scopely has acquired Niant</span>ic’s game business, which includes titles like Pokemon GO, Pikmin Bloom and Monster Hunter Now. Their companion apps and services, including Niantic Campfire and Wayfarer, will also fall under Scopely’s umbrella after the $3.5 billion deal. Scopely has confirmed that “All Niantic game-making team members, along with tenured leaders Kei Kawai and Ed Wu”, will continue to develop and operate their beloved experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ed Wu, the Pokemon GO lead, has <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/moving-to-a-new-home-2025?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> the acquisition and believes it “will be a positive step” for the community and the game’s future. Ed Wu also assured players that the entire Pokemon GO team would stay together through this partnership, and with Scopely ’s “commitment, experience and resources,” they would make Pokemon GO the best it can be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scopely’s <a href="https://www.scopely.com/en/news/scopely-to-acquire-niantic-games-business-which-includes-pokemon-go-one-of-the-most-successful-mobile-games-of-all-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement post</a> also provides statistics about Niantic’s game business, including numbers for Pokemon GO, Pikmin Bloom, and Monster Hunter Now. Pokemon GO has over 20 million weekly active players and has been in the top 10 since its launch. Its trainers have explored more than 30 billion miles together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pikmin Bloom players completed 3.94 trillion steps in 2024 and hit its highest active player count last year. Monster Hunter Now launched with surpassed 15 million downloads in 7 months, and over 50% of the audience played the game every day of the week.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-immortal/" data-ref-id="5000-489022">Diablo Immortal</a> will receive another new class and crossover event this year according to Blizzard's newly revealed 2025 content plans for the free-to-play mobile ARPG.</p><p dir="ltr">The new class and event will all be part of a year-long series of updates and storyline Blizzard is calling the Epoch of Madness. Blizzard made a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-biggest-boss-battle-yet-is-fittingly-against-diablo-himself/1100-6528355/" data-ref-id="1100-6528355">big deal about Diablo's return last year</a>, but will now explore the aftermath of his defeat and the power vacuum left in his wake. Much of that will be setting up the rise of the Shardborne Albrecht, Diablo's former human host who has since been resurrected into a monstrosity all his own thanks to the power of the Worldstone.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4457780-diabloimmortalroadmap2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457780" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4457780-diabloimmortalroadmap2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457780"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4457780-diabloimmortalroadmap2025.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Blizzard did not reveal what the game's new class will be, but it will arrive sometime this summer between July and September. When the new class does arrive, it will be the third class added post-launch to Diablo Immortal, joining the vampiric <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-new-blood-knight-class-is-a-first-for-the-whole-franchise/1100-6515729/" data-ref-id="1100-6515729">Blood Knight</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-new-tempest-class-is-a-water-bending-warrior-priest/1100-6523206/" data-ref-id="1100-6523206">water-bending Tempest</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">What property Diablo Immortal will be crossing over with as part of the crossover event, set to start between April and June, is also anybody's guess. Last year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-is-getting-a-lich-king-boss-battle-for-wows-20th-anniversary/1100-6527585/" data-ref-id="1100-6527585">Diablo Immortal crossed over with Blizzard's own World of Warcraft</a> in a big way to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise and the 20th anniversary of Blizzard's MMORPG. Players could take on the Lich King himself, and along the way earn (or buy) cosmetics tailored after iconic weapons and armor sets from WoW.</p><p dir="ltr">The rest of Diablo Immortal's 2025 roadmap consists of about what you would expect--new story quests, zones, PvP events, and more will come throughout the year, though the game's The First and Last King update is covered up on the roadmap image and thus more shrouded in secrecy. Diablo Immortal will additionally celebrate its third anniversary in June.</p><p dir="ltr">As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>, Blizzard recently revealed more details about the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-8-delayed-but-will-feature-return-of-an-old-friend/1100-6529803/" data-ref-id="1100-6529803">delayed Season 8</a>, including how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-get-harder-next-season-with-both-a-difficulty-increase-and-xp-gain-decrease/1100-6530009/" data-ref-id="1100-6530009">leveling speeds and endgame difficulty will increase next season</a>. Season 8 will be all about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-8-is-all-about-bosses-and-its-bringing-back-a-fan-favorite/1100-6530012/" data-ref-id="1100-6530012">Diablo 4's endgame bosses</a>, and alongside a revamp of the game's existing boss summoning systems, will feature the return of an iconic boss from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3</a>.</p>
