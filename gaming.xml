			<p>Section 9 Interactive has entered a publishing partnership with Epic Games for an unannounced title. Section 9 comprises industry veterans, with some of them working on Little Nightmares and LittleBigPlanet PS Vita. On the Section 9 Interactive website, it says that they are "hard at work" on a new sci-fi action-adventure title that will be released for PC and the current generation of consoles. This studio is located in Malmo, Sweden, and the company is also currently hiring for an Environment Artist, 3D Artist, and Level Designer.</p>
<p>The new title will be made with Unreal Engine 5, and there are some glimpses of the game on their website. Of course, it comes with the notice that the footage is pre-alpha footage and is in no way representative of the final quality of the title. Section 9 Interactive also posted their news on social media, saying the following:</p>
<p>"We've entered a publishing partnership with EpicPublishing! Our team is very excited, as they've been tremendous partners in helping bring our creative vision to life. We appreciate everyone's support along the way and can't wait to share more soon!" <a href="https://x.com/section9int" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The X page</a> for Section 9 Interactive is sparse, but it shows that the company was a recipient of the Epic MegaGrants program in 2021. The social media page also shows off some short clips and gifs of the game they are currently working on, which has strong similarities to that of <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-iii-gamescom-hand-on-preview-surviving-together/">Little Nightmares</a>.</p>
<p>"Working with the Epic Games Publishing team has been an amazing experience for us," says Gustaf Heinerwall, Co-Founder of Section 9 Interactive. "Ever since our first meeting with the team at EGP we felt that this partnership was a perfect fit for our studio. They've given us incredible support and the freedom to fully explore our creative vision, which is all we can ask for in a publisher. We are thankful for this opportunity, and excited for what comes next."</p>
<p>By joining the <a href="https://wccftech.com/aquiris-studio-gets-investment-and-publishing-deal-from-epic-games/">publishing partnership</a> with Epic Games, the developers will still own their game's intellectual property rights while receiving funding for development costs, as well as support for when the game is ready to go to the market. During the development process, they will retain complete creative control of the project. Once the initial launch and costs of the game have been recouped, the developers will earn at least 50% revenue share.</p>
<p>Section 9 Interactive hopes to share more news about their upcoming project soon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frostpunk-2-roadmap-looks-ahead-to-dlcs-console-launch-and-more.1045692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-roadmap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has revealed the first&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap, detailing what's coming to the post-apocalyptic city-builder in the near future, and there's plenty on the way to keep you occupied.</p>

<p>Released in September,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">quickly crossed the profitability line</a>, selling 350,000 copies just a few days out from launch (which isn't bad considering the game is also available on Game Pass as a day one release).</p>

<p>Now, developer and publisher 11 bit is looking to the future, and following on from October's Patch 1.1, the next major drop you can expect for&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>is the appropriately-named Patch 1.2, which will arrive sometime before the year is out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=0_8kY5SF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=kg11pbox 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's plenty coming to&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>in the near future.</figcaption></figure><p>After Patch 1.2, you can expect a "free major content update" in 2025. 11 bit hasn't specified what will be included in this update, but the studio does say these updates are "inspired by [players'] feedback" and that they will "significantly impact your overall experience with the game".</p>

<p>A console launch is also on the cards for 2025, as are two major DLC packs, currently codenamed Spectrum and Aurora. The devs promise these DLCs will "add something completely new to the harsh world of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>", although they're remaining tight-lipped for now.</p>

<p>A third DLC launch is planned for 2026, but that's quite a ways off, as evidenced by the fact that this DLC doesn't even have a codename yet. Still, it shows that you shouldn't set your copy of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>down for too long.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, it's 11 bit studios' followup to the 2018 survival city-builder&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>. It's largely a similar experience to its predecessor, but it adds new mechanics like factions, new resource types, and city districts, plus lots more thorny moral decision-making.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. A release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S is also planned for the future. Our very own Andrew Stretch's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/frostpunk-2-review-balance-resources-or-city-will-burn" rel="nofollow">review of the game is right here</a> if you want to learn more about how it ticks.</p>

There are 180-plus fighters to choose from and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640">nearly half need to be unlocked</a></span>. Although it’s easy to assume that such a large roster would have minimal differences, there is more depth than stated. Every fighter is categorized into specific character types that determine their best traits and how to play them.</p><p>The problem is that there isn’t any real mention of these classifications in the game. We only know they’re a thing from marketing materials and a couple of brief overviews deep within the Battle Training mode. Fans are still trying to figure out which fighters belong to which character classes, which feels damn near impossible since a lot of the roster has elements from multiple types. While we might hope for a hypothetical update that will properly categorize all the fighters, we’re not entirely in the dark! Here are the notable differences we’ve found for every character type.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ad8a4b6ba53a803088009777d9ee6cae" data-recommend-id="image://ad8a4b6ba53a803088009777d9ee6cae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vegeta launches a flurry of explosive energy blasts.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We’ll start with the type that most players will use, whether they know it or not. <strong>Ki-Blast characters are the ones most known for their projectiles.</strong> They can comfortably attack from a distance with long-range beams or smother their opponents with rapid energy blasts. Most versions of Goku and Vegeta would be considered a Ki-Blast type.</p><p><strong>The best way to tell that a character is a part of this category is that their energy blasts cost less Ki compared to others</strong>. They can use projectiles a bit more often in combat without having to worry about running out of energy. Going hand-in-hand is the ability to just keep throwing out blasts. Most characters have a string of up to four or five blasts they can shoot before taking a short break. With some Ki-blast characters, such as Vegeta, you can keep mashing out projectile attacks until your energy is depleted.</p><p>Out of all the different types we talk about, these are the closest you have to all-rounders. They’re adequate at a little of everything and have more flexibility in how you play them. Others will meanwhile excel at specific qualities that can sometimes give them the edge in a fight.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ef9ccf98bf0c28d117aaf360af9c099e" data-recommend-id="image://ef9ccf98bf0c28d117aaf360af9c099e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Legendary Super Saiyan Broly grits his teeth as he prepares a green energy orb in his hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Legendary Super Saiyan Broly grits his teeth as he prepares a green energy orb in his hand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef9ccf98bf0c28d117aaf360af9c099e" data-recommend-id="image://ef9ccf98bf0c28d117aaf360af9c099e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Legendary Super Saiyan Broly grits his teeth as he prepares a green energy orb in his hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When it comes to characters in the <em>Dragon Ball</em> franchise, you’re either going to think of those who use giant energy beams or the hulking brutes who overpower their opponents. The latter is the basis for the Strength character type. <strong>The fighters of the Strength type move and attack a bit slower, but make up for it with powerful hits.</strong></p><p>Pinpointing a Strength type can be difficult.. Defining them purely on their attack damage is also less helpful when the whole roster adheres to the Destruction Point (DP) system. I’ve found that the larger and more muscular characters usually fall into the Strength category. Think of characters like Jiren and either version of Broly.</p><p>Some of these characters are unfazed by Ki-Blasts and weaker melee strings. They’ll still take damage, but they won’t be staggered and can still move and attack while being hit themselves. It’s a trait that’s typically exclusive to a Strength character’s highest form from my time testing. Both versions of Broly gain this special attribute with their respective third forms, although their second forms will also temporarily obtain it while entering Sparking! mode.</p><p>Most characters can cause a stagger against these particular foes with the fourth or so hit from their rush combo. This isn’t tied to landing a certain number of hits first. Instead, it appears that the latter halves of a Rush string commonly have more heavy hits. Further proving this is that both a fellow Strength character and a Giant character only need a single punch to cause a stagger. A Strength type’s primary weakness will be its slower nature. They should watch out for long-range attacks and opponents who like to dodge and attack from behind.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f145fb88bb31a5a37cc339e9fcbd38b0" data-recommend-id="image://f145fb88bb31a5a37cc339e9fcbd38b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Burter smiles as he kicks Imperfect Cell high in the air." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Burter smiles as he kicks Imperfect Cell high in the air." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f145fb88bb31a5a37cc339e9fcbd38b0" data-recommend-id="image://f145fb88bb31a5a37cc339e9fcbd38b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Burter smiles as he kicks Imperfect Cell high in the air." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Next up is the perfect inverse to Strength: Speed. Featuring fighters such as Burter, Kakunsa, and Dyspo, <strong>Speed-types are all about quick movements and even faster attacks</strong>. Their melee rush combos will typically consist of individually weaker hits, but they can dish out many more instead.</p><p>This means it will be much harder to land a counter or Sonic Sway against a Speed type. Still, the best way to play these characters is to dodge around the opponent and attack from the sides or behind. That’s an ideal strategy for any character, but it feels a lot more oppressive with faster ones like these. The last thing a quick fighter like this needs is to be cornered.</p><p>Read More: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-super-movement-how-1851700605&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-super-movement-how-1851700605">Super Movement Is A Vague <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> Mechanic You Need To Know About</a></span></p><p>I’ve also found that they’re more likely to have certain techniques. Each one I practiced with had access to moves like Super Movement or Violent Rush during Sparking! Mode. They also all had a Rush Chain that could end with a Delta Heavy Finish, which functions like the Tri-Attack from older entries in the series. Becoming familiar with these techniques is necessary to keep your opponents on their toes.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c958bc294255c7066a1ecf3ef255eb85" data-recommend-id="image://c958bc294255c7066a1ecf3ef255eb85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Android 17 stands in the middle of a fight against Super Buu in a city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Android 17 stands in the middle of a fight against Super Buu in a city." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c958bc294255c7066a1ecf3ef255eb85" data-recommend-id="image://c958bc294255c7066a1ecf3ef255eb85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Android 17 stands in the middle of a fight against Super Buu in a city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Out of all the character types, the Androids have some of the more distinct gameplay properties. <strong>Androids cannot raise their Ki with the manual Ki charging button</strong>, which all other characters make use of. They can use it to transition into Sparking! mode, but it might as well not exist before that gauge is filled.</p><p>The methods of raising their Ki depend on what type of Android they are. Just like they were in the story, an Android is either an energy absorption model or a perpetual energy model. Energy absorption models like Dr. Gero and Android 19 charge Ki with melee attacks or by absorbing blasts from their opponents. All the rest are perpetual energy androids who simply recover Ki over time.</p><p>Either way, Androids need to keep a close watch on their Ki gauge. Flying around and throwing energy blasts is a lot more costly for them. These characters should stay on the offensive with melee attacks and rush combos as often as possible. Since they don’t need to worry about regular breaks in the fight to charge up, they shouldn’t allow their opponent that time either. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dd5d26c0c442cc894be41c0bf48a72f5" data-recommend-id="image://dd5d26c0c442cc894be41c0bf48a72f5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The large bug-like Hirudegarn grabs Super Buu on the Islands stage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The large bug-like Hirudegarn grabs Super Buu on the Islands stage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dd5d26c0c442cc894be41c0bf48a72f5" data-recommend-id="image://dd5d26c0c442cc894be41c0bf48a72f5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The large bug-like Hirudegarn grabs Super Buu on the Islands stage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Although Androids have some pretty special gameplay qualities to them, there is one group that stands out even more.<strong> Giant characters are, true to their name, huge, lumbering fighters who tower over the rest of the roster.</strong> Some great examples include Great Ape Vegeta and Hirudegarn.</p><p>This difference in size gives them many advantages. Any attempts to throw a Giant charac ter will be unsuccessful in nearly all cases. They’re also impervious to most <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-impact-action-qte-guide-1851678426&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-impact-action-qte-guide-1851678426">Impact Actions</a></span>, with smaller characters only able to trigger Blast Impacts against them. In a related matter, only blast and energy beam supers will work and inflict damage. Characters that try to use a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589">Rush Super</a></span> against them will bounce back and have wasted their Ki.</p><p>They further share many traits with those from the Strength category. Their attacks, whether that’s close-range or projectile, will take out some big chunks of HP and send opponents flying. Giant characters also won’t stagger easily, remaining undisturbed from Ki blasts and weaker melee attacks.</p><p>However, they also amplify many of the setbacks from Strength characters. Such slow attacks are easy to dodge for opponents that are constantly moving around. It’s common for them to lose track and miss attacks depending on their positioning. Fighters from the same category can also be an effective counter. Another Giant can cause a stagger with one hit and they are the only ones who can trigger a unique Power Impact. The latter likely won’t happen often as it requires both to use a throw at the same time, even though their normal throws won’t work on each other. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7b1e89dfba4e298dc54df44b7d346d0d" data-recommend-id="image://7b1e89dfba4e298dc54df44b7d346d0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Future Trunks slices Super Buu with his sword on the Hyperbolic Time Chamber map.

Their goal is to bring the fight down to their level. Only the characters below fall into this tiny category:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Goku (Teen)</li><li>Master Roshi</li><li>Master Roshi Max Power</li><li>Mr. Satan</li></ul><hr><p>There isn’t anything wrong with diving headfirst into <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> and playing with your favorites. Each fighter is viable when it comes to having a good time and engaging in exciting battles. Despite that, you’re sure to have a better understanding of character match-ups when you know the pros and cons of each character type.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Donkey Kong Land 2 is the latest Game Boy title <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1861215895873298613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">now playable</a> through the Nintendo Switch Online membership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Land 2 is a platformer released for Nintendo Game Boy in 1996. It is a sequel to Donkey Kong Land, sometimes called Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong’s Quest. This game features Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong as the playable characters, both with different gameplay mechanics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game’s main characters have different movement systems, and players can control only one at a time. With Diddy Kong, players will be able to ride train tracks, cartwheel their enemies and swing on grappling hooks. On the other hand, Dixie Kong can float in the air using her Helicopter Spin and throw barrels at enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The end goal of Donkey Kong Land 2 is saving Donkey Kong from K. Rool, and players must go through 40 levels filled with traps, collectables, Kremlings, barrels, and bananas to do that.&nbsp;</p>

In comparison to the seamless design of the Magic Mouse, these Logitech Mac mice offer a traditional design with clearly defined buttons and different colors. It's worth noting that you'll need to purchase a Logi Bolt dongle to get them to work on a Mac via Bluetooth, but these are very affordable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-956-000007-LOGITECH-Bolt-Receiver/dp/B09JL9Y1WS?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and you can get one for around $13</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Logitech MX Anywhere 3S is on sale for $61 for its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Anywhere-Wireless-Bluetooth-Any-Surface/dp/B0CVFJ1YSX?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black version</a> and $68 for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Anywhere-Wireless-Bluetooth-Any-Surface/dp/B0CVFHSH35?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pale Grey model</a>--a nice discount from the usual $80 MSRP. This is a lightweight mouse optimized for Apple MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac, and iPad tablets, and it features an accurate sensor, USB-C quick-charging, an 8K DPI sensor, and a very precise scrolling wheel. Logitech also offers a version for Windows PCs, so if you like its compact design, you'll be covered if you want to use it on a PC running Microsoft's operating system.</p><h2 dir="ltr">MX Anywhere 3S (Mac)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4405695-logitech-mx-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405695" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4405695-logitech-mx-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405695"></a><figcaption>MX Anywhere 3S</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4405695-logitech-mx-1.jpg"></figure><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Anywhere-Wireless-Bluetooth-Any-Surface/dp/B0CVFJ1YSX?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a> -- $61 ($<del>80</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Anywhere-Wireless-Bluetooth-Any-Surface/dp/B0CVFHSH35?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pale Grey</a> -- $68 ($<del>80</del>)</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">MX Anywhere 3S (Windows)</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Scrolling-Any-Surface-Programmable-Bluetooth/dp/B0BPY4ZQXG?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black </a>-- $68 ($<del>80</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Scrolling-Any-Surface-Programmable-Bluetooth/dp/B0BPY1JM2Q?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pale Grey</a> -- $65 ($<del>80</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Scrolling-Any-Surface-Programmable-Bluetooth/dp/B0BPY51TZ3?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rose</a> -- $68 ($<del>80</del>)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Scrolling-Any-Surface-Programmable-Bluetooth/dp/B0BPY4ZQXG?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logitech MX Master 3S</a> offers a high-performance option for MacOS and iPadOS users, as this mouse is equipped with easy-to-reach thumb controls.

			<p>The list of games and applications that feature RTX technologies continues to grow, with games having access to NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and advanced ray-tracing integration. This makes those who have GeForce RTX cards have a prettier and more immersive experience. With more than <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-rtx-games-engines-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">600 games and applications</a> utilizing these technologies, there is no sign of the list slowing down any time soon. This week, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-2-void-crew-towers-of-aghasba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three more games</a> joined the ever-expanding list, with more to come in the future. This week sees Void Crew, War Thunder and Towers of Aghasba join the list of games featuring<a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-extensive-preview-of-nvidia-rtx-effects-and-performance/"> RTX technologies</a>. Below is a breakdown of how you can expect to utilize them in the game.</p>
<p>Void Crew has just been released from early access and is a fun co-op roguelite title from Hutlihut Games and Focus Entertainment where you get to play as a METEM-chosen clone warrior, where you and your friends have to embark on a Pilgrimage. As you explore and get deeper into the unknown, you come across the HOLLOW, an alien force like no other. It's up to you and your friends to face off against them to try and bring peace back to the people. Void Crew will be utilizing DLSS Super Resolution, allowing GeForce RTX gamers to accelerate the performance of the game with the advanced technology.</p>
<p>Next up on the list is War Thunder. This game is far from new, as it was first released in 2013. However, since its release, it's received a new coat of paint and looks better than ever. There are hundreds of tanks, ground military vehicles, planes, and warships that will look even better by using DLSS Super Resolution and NVIDIA Reflex. War Thunder just received a new update, which also added support for hardware-accelerated ray-tracing effects to make the game even more immersive and stunning. These options include ray-traced ambient occlusion, ray-traced water, and ray-traced shadows, for example.</p>
<p>Finally, Towers of Aghasba is the latest game to join the roster of games with RTX technology integration. This game is hot off the press and is currently in Early Access. In this game, you get to explore an open-world with fascinating flora and fauna. You will meet some interesting characters along the way, and you can help breathe life into the world, as well as create your very own island civilization. If you are playing this title, you will be able to use DLSS Super Resolution for a faster and smoother experience in Towers of Aghasba.</p>

			<p>New Alan Wake 2 PlayStation 5 Pro improvements are being researched by developer Remedy Entertainment, but it will take the team weeks to implement them.</p>
<p>Following the release of today's new <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.2.5 update</a>, which introduces some improvements to the base game and Night Springs and The Lake House expansions alongside some fixes, the Finnish studio commented on the lack of PlayStation 5 Pro-specific improvements, saying that player feedback is being heard, and more research is being done on how to improve performance. As the game's PlayStation 5 Pro support was the work of many months, it will take the team more than just a few weeks to implement changes and improvements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">🛠️ A new update for Alan Wake 2 has been released. It includes (fingers crossed) fixes for the missing Pat Maine radio shows, and more fixes, improvements and additions.</p>
<p>As always, update notes are here: <a href="https://t.co/zqW9QhguFF">https://t.co/zqW9QhguFF</a></p>
<p>Please allow additional time for the update to… <a href="https://t.co/DO5Fyl2dnI">pic.twitter.com/DO5Fyl2dnI</a></p>
<p>— Alan Wake 2 (@alanwake) <a href="https://twitter.com/alanwake/status/1861394569448894731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While the Alan Wake 2 PlayStation 5 Pro patch has the merit of finally bringing ray tracing to a console version of the game, the improvements are far from the best we have seen among all Pro-enhanced titles. PSSR, in particular, struggles to deliver significantly better image quality than on the base console, showing how the upscaler currently isn't a good fit for 4K resolution with a low internal resolution like that of the game. Hopefully, Remedy Entertainment will be able to work some of its magic in the future and enhance this version of the game to deliver better image quality and performance.</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-omens-of-destruction-dlc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/total-war-warhammer-3-omens-of-destruction-dlc-announced-for-next-month.1045617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-omens-of-destruction-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Creative Assembly have announced&nbsp;<em>Omens of Destruction</em>, the next major DLC pack for grand strategy game&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3</em>, and it's due to arrive alongside a major free update for the game next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/39" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official Creative Assembly website,&nbsp;<em>Omens of Destruction&nbsp;</em>launches on December 12th, and it brings three new Legendary Lords with it, all of whom have their own combat perks and campaign bonuses to look forward to.</p>

<p>Your first Legendary Lord is Skulltaker, a champion of Khorne who seeks - you guessed it - skulls for the skull throne. He brings new units with him as well, including legendary heroes Skarr Bloodwrath and Skyla Anfingrimm, as well as "a host of acolytes".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-omens-of-destruction-dlc-skulltaker.jpg?itok=mzen7Cbv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-omens-of-destruction-dlc-skulltaker.jpg?itok=FF5mqwA1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Total War: Warhammer 3</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Omens of Destruction&nbsp;</em>DLC includes Legendary Lords like Khorne's Skulltaker.</figcaption></figure><p>The second Legendary Lord is Gorbad Ironclaw, "one of the most infamous of all Orc Warbosses" who's probably about the closest thing to a master strategist the Orc faction can boast. Like Skulltaker, he brings his own additional units and heroes.</p>

<p>Finally, the Ogre Kingdoms gain Golgfag Maneater, a mercenary with a fearsome reputation who'll fight for anyone if the price is right. He's an anti-infantry "blender" who can tear through soldiers using his "barbaric" weaponry.</p>

<p>These three will arrive alongside Update 6.0, which brings a free Legendary Lord in the form of Khorne's Arbaal the Undefeated, as well as faction updates for Khorne, Orcs &amp; Goblins, and the Ogre Kingdoms.</p>

<p>As with previous&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3&nbsp;</em>DLC packs like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-reveals-shadows-of-change-dlc-with-3-legendary-lords-more" rel="nofollow">Shadows of Change</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-thrones-of-decay-lords" rel="nofollow"><em>Thrones of Decay</em></a>, it'll be possible to buy all three Legendary Lords separately if you'd rather pick up just one or two of them.</p>




<p><em>Total War: Warhammer 3&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Its&nbsp;<em>Omens of Destruction&nbsp;</em>DLC, as well as its major 6.0 update, both launch on December 12th.

            <p>Here are some orc names I quite like. Haters will tell you these “aren’t real orcs”, but those fools are forever trapped in a stifling prison forged from the failures of their own imaginations. Suck it, haters:</p>

<p>An orc that even these despicable haters are forced to admit is real, however, is Gorbad Ironclaw. If you look very carefully, you may spot him below, in the new trailer for Omens Of Destruction - the next expansion for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>.

<p>The folks at Creative Assembly sent me a document, and in that document is some information about what’s to come in both Omens Of Destruction and the accompanying free update. If I were so inclined, I could write this information out in a natural, conversational tone, interspersed with my own commentary. As I’m sure many of you are aware, however, that commentary would mostly just be me going “wow! Neat!”. Instead, here’s the free-range information, uncorked and unbesmirched by the flaky preservatives of opinion. </p>
<blockquote><strong>SKULLTAKER, THE HERO SLAYER (KHORNE) </strong>
<p>Cloak of Skulls: Skulltaker must seek-out and defeat powerful enemy lords across the heroic
pantheon of the Warhammer World. With each skull added to his cloak, powerful new
abilities and traits can be earned and upgraded.
</p>
<p>A force of daemonic destruction, Skulltaker excels at hunting down and duelling enemy lords
before cleaving through ranks of troops with his two-handed Slayer Sword. His Cloak of
Skulls passive ability grants increasing spell resistance and ward saves the more he kills.</p>
<p>New units from the Blood God’s domain enter the fray, including two legendary heroes;
Skarr Bloodwrath and Skyla Anfingrimm, followed by a host of acolytes including the
Bloodspeaker, Slaughterbrute, Bloodbeasts, Wrathmongers, Skullreapers, and Khorngors.</p>
<strong>GORBAD IRONCLAW, THE BRUTAL UNIFIER (ORCS) </strong>
<p>Da’ Plan: A tenacious tactician (for an Orc), Gorbad must experiment with unique battle
strategies for his armies to employ, granting a deadly of exotic battle bonuses and army
compositions that can overcome any challengers.</p>
<p>Riding into battle atop his fierce Warboar, Gnarla, Gorbad penetrates the enemy lines with
devastating charges before engaging in close combat with his mighty axe, Morglor ‘the
Mangler’. His ‘Da Great Leader’ ability which activates when troops are in his vicinity,
granting increased melee attack and defence.</p>
<p>New units joining Gorbad’s Waaagh! include the legendary hero Snagla Grobspit
accompanied by warriors such as the Savage Orc Great Shaman, Night Goblin Big Boss, Black
Orc (Axe &amp; Shield), Mangler Squiqs, Colossal Squig, Arachnarok (Flinger), and Bolt Throwa.</p>
<strong>GOLGFAG MANEATER  (OGRE KINGDOMS) </strong>
<p>Mercenary Contracts: Ever keen to lace his pocket with gold, Golgfag helps clients
throughout the Warhammer World settle their warring disputes by taking on all wars they’re
involved in and conducting hostile actions against their enemies for handsome reward.</p>
<p>An anti-infantry blender, Golgfag tears through hordes of infantry with the aid of barbaric
weaponry. His globe-trotting nature also gives him access to a variety of exotic abilities such
as Dead Eye which allows him to take a powerful shot from his pistol causing huge damage</p>

<p>The good word of Korl Morx has failed to reach Creative Assembly, however, so you will have to pay for all this stuff (please don’t tell me “that’s not how communism works” I just wanted to write ‘Korl Morx’ again). If you don’t feel like spending any money, though, there are some free goodies, too. These’ll include the series 100th Legendary Lord, Khorne champion Arbaal The Undefeated, who’s defeat trait I’d look forward to reading if there wasn’t already twelve other characters with some version of ‘the undefeated’ in their names. You’ll also get faction updates for Ogres, Khorne, and - my boys and yours - the greenskins.</p>
<p>Wow! Looks neat! I especially liked the part where I get some more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> to play with. Easily my favourite part!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>The weekends are full of time, which means it's also easy for them to slip away. </em></p><p><em>We live in an era where it's never been easier to pick up a new hobby, or follow a new sport, and, once again, watch time slip. What keeps our attention, and for how long? How do you fill in knowledge, analysis, and history gaps? If you pay for a subscription to a publication, isn't that the same as reading it? No? Hmm.</em></p><p><em>This week, with the NFL season in full swing, Rob and Patrick mull how they spend their weekends watching the world's greatest athletes race cars and throw footballs and mull what it means to be "effective" during a period where you should be allowed to be lazy.</em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@tjdragotta?ref=remapradio.com"><span>TJ Dragotta</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Last year, I remember Austin proposed a name for this time of year: The Feast. It’s the playoffs in MLB and WNBA, the football season is through its creaky opening weeks and most teams are still approaching their peak condition and preparation, some soccer leagues are nearing the crescendo and others are just getting started, the auto racing seasons are in their final stages, and somewhere in all this the NBA and NHL are going to start up again. If you are into sports of almost any type, early autumn is one of the greatest times of year as well as one of the most challenging to keep up with.</p><p>There are times I feel almost burdened by how much my love of sports is being indulged this time of year. A typical Sunday might start with an F1 race in the morning and proceed smoothly into a day of NFL games until deep into the evening. That might be more than 12 hours of sports! Thing is, I don’t <em>really </em>have 12 hours in a weekend where I can just sit on the couch petting dogs and watching sports. There’s too many other things that I also value: giving those dogs a walk, tackling projects around the house, playing games, catching up on reading…I almost wish I could run the day twice, enjoying one version of Sunday where I just soak up the games and races I want to see, and then after a nice rest tackling the Sunday where I spend most of the day enjoying other hobbies and getting out of the house with my family.</p><p>There have been times I’ve split the difference a bit by reading and playing games while keeping sports on in the background. Turn-based games are pretty fantastic for slower parts of an event. Still, I struggle with the sense that when I’m “multitasking” between watching the Bears or an F1 race and playing a video games, I’m not really following anything particularly well. There are few things I find more frustrating than looking up and realizing I have no idea why the scoreboard has changed, or pulling my gaze back to an article to see a completely unfamiliar passage in front of me.</p><p>You keep a pretty busy schedule between work and family obligations, but you also follow Chicago sports and the NFL more broadly pretty well. I am curious, how do you tackle this kind of year? Do you just force yourself to make some firm choices about what you’re engaging with, or do you find you’re able to juggle your attention from sports to other pursuits without chafing?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@julesrodr?ref=remapradio.com"><span>julia rodriguez</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>I’ve gotten pretty lucky. You can’t pick your family and you can’t pick your neighbors. It wasn’t until COVID-19 that my children became friendly with the neighborhood kids during an era when their options were hanging out with us or hanging outside. Those friendships lasted beyond the most intense parts of social isolation <em>and</em> we became friends with the parents in the process. The strongest of those relationships is with one couple in particular, and guess what? They love drinking beer and watching football all day. Our Sunday ritual is getting together with them, letting the kids run wild, and enjoying our afternoon. It’s very easy to imagine a different version of my life where I’m far more hands-on during Sundays, or required to be out of the house to keep them entertained, and I’m that dad sneaking in a few minutes here or there on their YouTube TV app to figure out why the Bills game has flipped scores.</p><p>We used to time my eight-year-old’s naps with the start of Bears game! Oh, honey, are you rubbing your eyes? Could you have taken a nap at 11:00 am? I’m sorry, but we’re going to find a way to keep you up for another hour, so that we can ensure your nap at least takes us through halftime. But my kids broadly don’t take naps anymore, so instead, the world has blessed me with Sundays where my primary obligation is asking my neighbor to change the Sunday Ticket lineup on his second garage TV and, if I’m lucky, to pick up my four-year-old and run her around the yard when the Bears actually manage to score a touchdown.</p>

<p>2K has announced a ‘Complete Sunset’ of their launcher, removing it from every Epic Games Store and Steam game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sunset of the 2K Launcher was <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34845053169939--2K-Launcher-Complete-Sunset#h_01JB9YXRZ3YFJBHS1QPZ5DP40N" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> on November 18; however, a follow-up update on November 25 led to its complete removal from Steam. The “2K Launcher Beta” created for Sid Meier’s Civilization V was also removed. Players will see that their 2KLauncher folder has been turned into a text file called 2kLauncherRemoved.tx, which can now be deleted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players might still find the 2K Launcher pop-up even after this update, and there are some troubleshooting procedures that they can follow to remove it entirely. The first method is closing and reopening Steam completely. Next, rebooting the PC is always a good idea. Also, for Epic Games, you will need the game to be updated to its most recent version. Check out this <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/32209414429203--2K-Launcher-Removing-2K-Launcher-Files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">guide</a> to learn how to remove all the additional launcher files.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After 2K Launcher’s shutdown, games like Bioshock Remastered, Bioshock 2 Remastered, Bioshock Infinite, The Quarry, and Marvel’s Midnight Suns will launch directly when you click Play. Other games like Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition, Civilisation V, and more will use Steam and Epic’s launchers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a new PGA Tour 2K game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been confirmed for 2025</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-leak-reveals-upcoming-promo-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokemon TCG Pocket’s latest leak</a> has revealed upcoming promo cards.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-eshop-and-online-services-to-close-down-in-china-in-2026.1045587/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-eshop-online-closing-china-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it will shut down the eShop and all Switch network services in China in 2026. No reason has been given for the shutdown.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.nintendoswitch.com.cn/topics/57ea6913-1a17-4afa-b325-a1a1a8596e15" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a notice</a> posted on the official Chinese Nintendo website (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-eshop-closing-2026-in-china" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), the eShop will cease selling games and software on March 31st, 2026, after which point you won't be able to buy any games from the eShop, nor will you be able to download demos, trials, or free games.</p>

<p>Following that, on May 15th of the same year, you won't be able to download games from the eShop, and you won't be able to redeem codes either. That means you won't be able to buy any DLC, and it also seems to mean you won't be able to download games you already own.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-odyssey-eshop-closure-china.jpg?itok=clxwOBnG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-odyssey-eshop-closure-china.jpg?itok=0WvP487i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch eShop, as well as all of the console's network services, will be coming to an end in 2026 in China.</figcaption></figure><p>On the same day, all Switch-related network services will also be shut down, so you'll no longer be able to play Switch games online with your friends at that point.</p>

<p>You can see a full list of all of the games that will be affected by the network shutdown <a href="https://www.nintendoswitch.com.cn/support/software_affected.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. It's in Chinese, and we're using machine translation for it, but it seems relatively accurate to me (although I have little to no knowledge of Chinese as a language).</p>

<p>In order to compensate Chinese Switch gamers for this decision, Nintendo will give away up to four Nintendo games for users via their WeChat account. You'll need to have activated your Switch console, and you'll need to have stuck to the Terms of Use as well.</p>

<p>The list has a couple of...unusual entries using machine translation, but games like&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Yoshi's Crafted World&nbsp;</em>can be redeemed, as well as&nbsp;<em>Kirby Star Allies</em>,&nbsp;<em>New Pokemon Snap</em>, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-eshop-closure-china-new-pokemon-snap.jpg?itok=o1tMZUrf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-eshop-closure-china-new-pokemon-snap.jpg?itok=I6sOdYmB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're a Switch user in China, you could be entitled to a free copy of&nbsp;<em>New Pokemon Snap</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The giveaway starts on November 27th and runs until March 31st, 2026, and you'll need to use WeChat's game redemption applet in order to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>Do note that you'll have to download whatever games you decide to grab before May 15th, or else your free games will be gone for good. It's also worth noting that as far as we know, this doesn't affect the eShop anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>News of the eShop's closure in China comes amid fevered speculation about the Switch 2, which Nintendo is due to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">reveal sometime before April</a>. It's not clear what this might mean for the Switch 2 in China.</p>

Players can still edit and use those older avatars (aka Xbox Original Avatars) after the newer ones are deprecated, as Microsoft writes:</p><div><blockquote><p>You can continue to update your gamerpic using the Xbox Avatar Editor app until January 9, 2025. After this date, any further changes to Xbox Avatar-themed gamerpics will need to be made through the Xbox Original Avatars app. To do this, launch the Xbox Original Avatars app, press the&nbsp;<strong>Menu</strong>&nbsp;button and select&nbsp;<strong>Take a photo</strong>. From there, you can adjust your avatar’s&nbsp;<strong>Animation</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Background</strong>. Once you have the gamerpic you like, press the&nbsp;<strong>View</strong>&nbsp;button&nbsp;and then select&nbsp;<strong>Save as gamerpic</strong>.</p></blockquote></div><p>If you’re fond of your Xbox Avatar, now might be a good time to get as many screenshots of it as you can. You’ll still be able to edit it until the January 9th shutdown. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s not to say you should be tempted to fork over real money just yet! There are plenty of cards to fill out your custom build and in-progress dream decks alike.</p><p>In addition to useful Item and Supporter cards, we’ll also be including Pokémon with unique abilities and decent attacks that call for Colorless Energy. That last part is especially important, since Colorless Energy requirements can be fulfilled by any Energy you attach to it. These cards have you covered for any type of deck you’re making!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="61eda78304533bd1ec3b6db7e9126d54" data-recommend-id="image://61eda78304533bd1ec3b6db7e9126d54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Persian card shows a large muscular cat lounging." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Persian card shows a large muscular cat lounging." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="61eda78304533bd1ec3b6db7e9126d54" data-recommend-id="image://61eda78304533bd1ec3b6db7e9126d54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Persian card shows a large muscular cat lounging." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Starting this list is Persian, which might initially sound like a tough sell. Not only does its Shadow Claw attack require two Colorless energy and only deal 40 damage, but it’s a stage-one Pokémon and will require you to evolve a Meowth just to bring it out. What makes it worth it, however, is the Shadow Claw’s ability. You’ll flip a coin with every attack, with heads forcing your opponent to discard a random card from their hand. This effect can greatly disrupt any player’s plans when you remember every deck is only 20 cards. </p><p>Additionally, Meowth isn’t a bad card itself. Its Payday attack might deal a measly 10 damage, but its effect lets you draw a card with each attack. Both this ability and the one from its evolution can be pretty handy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a10e884acca1e2a89db5a230f3cb4f24" data-recommend-id="image://a10e884acca1e2a89db5a230f3cb4f24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The yellow Heliolisk card shows the lightning-type lizard in action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The yellow Heliolisk card shows the lightning-type lizard in action." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a10e884acca1e2a89db5a230f3cb4f24" data-recommend-id="image://a10e884acca1e2a89db5a230f3cb4f24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The yellow Heliolisk card shows the lightning-type lizard in action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Next is the only Pokémon on the list that isn’t a Colorless one. Heliolisk is a stage-one lightning-type Pokémon that evolves from Helioptile. Its Quick Attack, which uses two Colorless energy, makes this an attractive inclusion for a deck. It’s a pretty unique attribute. So many evolved Pokémon require at least some energy that matches their type. The attack also does a base 50 damage, with a coin flip potentially adding an extra 40 if you land a heads.</p><p>Heliolisk’s biggest problem is its pre-evolution Helioptile. It’s only a basic Pokémon and its Tail Whap attack requires one Lightning energy. If your deck doesn’t have enough Lightning types to necessitate that energy, Helioptile will essentially be worthless for you before it can evolve it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a3f896205d3be65c6fc14d85521a1b4f" data-recommend-id="image://a3f896205d3be65c6fc14d85521a1b4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Kangaskhan card shows the Pokémon carrying their young and getting ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Kangaskhan card shows the Pokémon carrying their young and getting ready." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a3f896205d3be65c6fc14d85521a1b4f" data-recommend-id="image://a3f896205d3be65c6fc14d85521a1b4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Kangaskhan card shows the Pokémon carrying their young and getting ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Sometimes your deck needs a tanky Pokémon that can stall while you build up your main strategy. Kangaskhan is one of the best at this approach as a basic Pokémon with 100 HP. Just as impressive is its Dizzy Punch attack. For just one Colorless energy, you can flip two coins and inflict 30 damage for each one that lands heads.</p><p><br>Luck can be a tricky thing with this card, however. Getting two tails and dealing no damage at all isn’t a great situation. However, the chances of dealing 30 or 60 damage are worth taking in my opinion. This is especially true when you consider the high HP and low energy cost.

Pidgeot has the Drive Off ability, which allows you to switch out the opponent’s Active Pokémon once per your turn. The opponent will be able to choose which of their benched Pokémon will take the new active spot. It’s basically like using a Sabrina card for each turn.</p><p>Drive Off is a separate ability that doesn’t rely on its attack. Speaking of, a 70-damage dealing Wing Attack isn’t too bad for two Colorless energy either. You can comfortably use Drive Off whether Pidgeot is in the Active spot or on the Bench. Still, how useful this is depends on personal preference. You’ll need to include both of its pre-evolutions just for the chance to benefit from the ability. No matter how beneficial and disruptive the ability is, that’s a lot to accommodate for.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c0426164f663a227bf4bb654d0b7c9ac" data-recommend-id="image://c0426164f663a227bf4bb654d0b7c9ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The duck-like Pokémon Farfetch’d carries a leek in its mouth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The duck-like Pokémon Farfetch’d carries a leek in its mouth." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0426164f663a227bf4bb654d0b7c9ac" data-recommend-id="image://c0426164f663a227bf4bb654d0b7c9ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The duck-like Pokémon Farfetch’d carries a leek in its mouth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We could not have a list like this without including one of the most helpful cards. Farfetch’d is a simple, basic Pokémon that can hit hard thanks to its 40-damage Leek Slap. What separates this attack from everything else added so far is that it only requires one Colorless energy.</p><p>That isn’t to say the card is completely OP. Farfetch’d is less likely to survive a turn once some ex or stage-two Pokémon are out on the field. They’re typically more effective during the initial few turns. That being said, I have come across situations where bringing in this vegetable carrying bird to dish out a quick 40 damage was helpful for closing matches.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6b93756987474a874512e44b68e58eb5" data-recommend-id="image://6b93756987474a874512e44b68e58eb5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Potion card shows a potion bottle in mid-spray." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Potion card shows a potion bottle in mid-spray." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6b93756987474a874512e44b68e58eb5" data-recommend-id="image://6b93756987474a874512e44b68e58eb5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Potion card shows a potion bottle in mid-spray." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Poké Ball isn’t the only Item card to keep in all of your decks.

It can feel more effective when weaker Pokémon are attacking each other, instead of stronger ones that can easily deal closer to 100 damage. An easy way to get help with that is to include more than one copy in your deck. Again, healing isn’t that common of an effect during this first expansion.

It’s identical to the Pidgeot ability, except you don’t need to bring out two other cards to play it.</p><p>This card can be used almost any time during a match. The obvious choice is to switch out a tough Pokémon in hopes of one that’s easier to knock out. In the early turns, where there sometimes isn’t much on the field, you can also use it to take out a basic Pokémon that you know your opponent will want to evolve. Even when your opponent has a full bench of options, causing a switch like this is bound to be a hindrance to their game plan.</p><hr><p>Adding these cards to an incomplete deck is sure to round it out and give it some better legs to stand on. There is a better chance to get most of these before finding the right ex card for your meta build.

<p>Marvel Rivals’ ambition is matched by its star-studded roster, list of iconic maps, and excitable community eager to play. However, one big question circling Marvel Rivals is if the shooter is free to play, or if you need to pay a fixed price to get your heroic groove on.</p>



<p>Fans of the MCU—and Marvel in general—can rest easy as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals release date</a> is nearly upon us. An ensemble shooter with a list of playable characters so almighty it’s enough to make your eyes water—I’m not crying, you are. Marvel Rivals takes the hero shooter literally by supplying a roster chock-full of some of the most notable superheroes and villains in media.</p>



<p>Several successful alpha and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-beta-surprises-players-with-thor-and-another-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beta tests</a> have set the scene, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-roadmap-reveals-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> ahead is promising, and it’s nearly time to say “Action!” and let the chaos unfold. No doubt you want to play Marvel Rivals, so let’s see if greatness requires a gratuity.</p>

<p><strong>Marvel Rivals is a free-to-play</strong>, third-person shooter, meaning, <strong>you don’t have to pay a penny to play NetEase Games’ shooter</strong>—a free download and a stable internet connection are the only requirements.</p>



<p>The live-service model continues to be a trendsetter for many shooters and fellow online multiplayer platforms. It’s no surprise to see Marvel Rivals adopt the F2P formula with contemporaries such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tests-avoid-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suicide Squad</a> showing how a <em>paid</em>, live-service title can fail.</p>



<p>So, if you want to enjoy all Marvel Rivals has to offer without spending a single penny, you go right ahead. Of course, Rivals has an abundance of microtransactions and Season Passes filled with content for players who want to more out of the shooter, but it’s entirely optional.</p>



<p>Thankfully, every current character is available at launch, and according to the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/news/20240821/40185_1174687.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official site</a>, “<strong>All heroes will be unlocked and free-to-play at launch and beyond</strong>, ensuring every player can fully immerse themselves in the experience of becoming their favorite Super Hero without any barriers!”</p>

<p>According to a new report, Sony and Kadokawa have been discussing a partnership for years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since Sony sent a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kadokawa-confirms-acquisition-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter of intent</a> to Kadokawa, the entire gaming community has been wondering whether this acquisition will go through, and now new information has come to light. According to a <span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-26/sony-s-pursuit-of-kadokawa-anime-looks-like-a-great-takeover-idea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg report</a></span>, Sony and Kadokawa have been “testing the waters for a potential combination for years.” However, the issue seems to be the “degree of commitment.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the report states, Kadokawa wants Sony to acquire them completely or not purchase anything at all. On the other hand, Sony only wants ownership of assets related to anime and video games, which will help build their IP portfolio. The Kadokawa group has several game developers under its banner, including heavy hitters like FromSoftware, Spike Chunsoft, Gotcha Gotcha Games, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Sony is developing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-developing-playstation-handheld-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Handheld</a> that will rival the likes of Switch and Xbox. Also, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-sales-better-ps4-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro sold better than the PlayStation 4 Pro</a> in the same period. What are your thoughts on Sony and Kadokawa discussing a potential combination for years?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

But where does Echoes of Wisdom fit in? After <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/character/zelda/en/history/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent update</a> from Nintendo itself, fans finally know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>, which flips the franchise's famous formula on its head by having Zelda as the playable character, is part of the ‘Hero is defeated’ timeline, a fork generated by the seminal Ocarina of Time if Ganon defeats Link. From there, Echoes of Wisdom takes place after the 2015 3DS game Tri Force Heroes, but before the very first Zelda game, released in 1986 for the NES.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ominously, Nintendo notes the “Decline of Hyrule Kingdom” that followed the events of Echoes of Wisdom, but came before the first Zelda. Here’s Nintendo’s official blurb on the game’s entry:</p><blockquote>The hero Link sets out to rescue Princess Zelda, who was captured by Ganon. Following a fierce battle, Link defeats Ganon, only to be swallowed up by an eerie rift. It was as if he'd been stolen away... All across Hyrule, more mysterious rifts are forming and taking the people of Hyrule away. Nobody is safe — not even the king himself and his advisers, who have also gone missing. Princess Zelda must set out on an adventure to save her father — the king of Hyrule — the people, and Link.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/26/screenshot-2024-11-26-123857-1732626477149.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Echoes of Wisdom's place on the Zelda timeline is now official. Image credit: Nintendo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This particular timeline fork ends with 1987’s side-scrolling The Adventure of Link, the direct sequel to the first Zelda game. The ‘Hero is Triumphant’ fork includes two timelines of its own: Link’s child and adult eras. The child era continues with the likes of Ocarina of Time follow-up Majora’s Mask, whereas the adult era includes Game Cube masterpiece Wind Waker. Still with us?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, that’s where we’re at for now. But does any of this matter? One person who doesn’t care about the Zelda chronology is producer Eiji Aonuma, who last year told IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-producer-eiji-aonuma-doesnt-really-care-about-the-series-chronology">overthinking the Zelda chronology could limit the development team's creativity and vision</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course there will be new Zelda games released, no doubt for Nintendo’s Switch successor, and we’ll have this timeline debate all over again. The question is, what’s the next Zelda game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-moves-on-to-brand-new-the-legend-of-zelda-game-rules-out-tears-of-the-kingdom-dlc">Nintendo said it had no plans to release DLC for Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and confirmed it had moved on to a brand new game in the series. In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202309/06314767.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Famitsu</u></a>, Aonuma left the door open to a return to the Hyrule of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, potentially setting up a third game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the first place, the reason I decided to make this a sequel to the previous work was because I thought there was value in experiencing a new game in that Hyrule place,” Aonuma said. “If that's the case, if a new reason arises, we might return to the same world again. Whether it's a sequel or a new work, I think it's going to be a completely new game, so I hope you're looking forward to it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
