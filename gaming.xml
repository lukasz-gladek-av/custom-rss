        <p>An unexpected, thrilling, and deeply emotional voyage that will challenge everything she thought she knew. First released in 2002, <em>Syberia</em> became a reference in the <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,272 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> genre, praised for its unique atmosphere, sharp writing, and the richness of Benoit Sokal’s artistic vision. This remaster is a new opportunity to (re)discover the masterpiece, following in the footsteps of other titles from Benoit Sokal such as <em><a title="Games > Syberia: The World Before [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/syberia-the-world-before">Syberia: The World Before</a></em> and the newly released <em><a title="Games > Amerzone: The Explorer's Legacy (2025) [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/amerzone-the-explorers-legacy-2025">Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy</a></em>.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A Faithful and Stunning Overhaul</strong> – Meet Syberia’s iconic characters fully redesigned and explore the game’s most emblematic locations brought to life in beautifully enhanced 3D.

Dive into a clockpunk adventure where realism blends seamlessly with dreamlike wonder.</li><li><strong>A Moving and Unforgettable Story</strong> – Experience a deeply human narrative, as Kate Walker’s legal assignment turns into a profound journey of self-discovery.

            <p>Early access for Fantasy Life i on Xbox Series X/S version has been delayed.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1924089583471562809">dropping an unexpected head's up</a> about a possible delay earlier today, developer Level-5 has now confirmed that today's early launch on Xbox Series X/S will not go ahead as planned due to an "ongoing technical issue on Xbox's end".</p>

<p>"Early Access for the Xbox Series X|S version of Fantasy Life i, originally scheduled to begin at 3:00 PM GMT on May 18, has unfortunately been delayed due to an ongoing technical issue on Xbox's side," the developer said on social media. "As of now, the issue remains unresolved and players are still unable to play on Xbox platforms.</p>
<p>"We truly want players to dive into [Fantasy Life i] as soon as possible and it's incredibly frustrating for us that we cannot yet make that happen," the statement added. "We are continuing to work closely with the relevant teams to restore access as soon as possible, but are currently unable to provide a specific time for when Early Access will begin. We will share updates on this account and our official website as soon as we have more information."</p> <div>

<p>The team said it would be "reviewing possible measures to compensate for the delay" and will "share more" once details are confirmed. The statement closed on confirming the issue does not affect early access on Steam or PS4/5.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time will launch for all players across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S (hopefully), Switch, and PC via Steam on 21st May. We first got word of Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">Nintendo Direct in February 2023</a>. At the time of its announcement, the game was set to release in 2023, but it later saw its launch nudged back.</p>
<p>Away from Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Level-5 also has a new Professor Layton game in the pipeline</a>. It's known as New World of Steam and will place the Professor as something of a newcomer himself, in a story which moves the series' action to America.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fall Guy director David Leitch is in talks to direct the movie adaptation of Gears of War.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gears-of-war-movie-david-leitch-director-1236212544/">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Leitch is in negotiations to direct and produce the film with Kelly McCormick and their 87North production company in partnership with game developer, The Coalition. We already knew Jon Spaihts, whose Dune screenplay was nominated for an Oscar, is also on board as script writer.</p>

<p>Netflix did not comment on this latest development but has previously said this will be an adaptation of the Gears of War "video game saga", suggesting it'll be more faithful to the source material than Universal's stalled effort.</p>
<p>Netflix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-live-action-movie-and-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix">announced</a> it had acquired the rights to adapt Gear of War into a movie in November 2022, following earlier unsuccessful attempts by New Line Cinema to get a live-action adaptation off the ground. That version, first trumpeted in 2007, had abandoned all pretence of being set in the game's universe by 2019, when the project became permanently stuck in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-movie-is-still-go-gets-screenwriter">development hell</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-e-day-dev-the-coalition-drafts-in-people-can-fly-as-partner-studio">People Can Fly is working with The Coalition on the next Gears of War game, Gears of War: E-Day</a>. Late last year, we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro are reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-movie-could-be-picked-up-for-multiple-millions">bid numbers in the "multiple millions"</a> were reportedly on the table for the adaptation of EA's fan-favourite co-op adventure, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Cloud Imperium Games has responded to players unhappy about the recent introduction of "<a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/7956894">pay to win</a>" flight blades in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a>, admitting it "missed a step".</p>
<p>While Star Citizen's community doesn't typically shy away from financially supporting the game's 12-year-old early access period, on this occasion, players took umbrage that even though the blades give an undeniable in-game advantage, they had been introduced as a premium item that could not be earned organically through gameplay.</p>
<p>The fallout has been so intense, CIG has now posted a statement, stressing to players that they will be able to obtain flight blades through the in-game currency aUEC "in our next patch this June" and said that "for future gameplay kit introductions, we’ll ensure these items are obtainable in-game on day one".</p>

<p>"We're pushing 11 patches this year instead of 4. We're crushing more bugs than ever, building more exciting content, moving faster than ever to make the Persistent Universe a better experience for everyone, and in moving that fast, we missed a step," stressed Tyler "Zyloh-CIG" Witkin (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/after-raising-over-usd800-million-from-its-community-star-citizens-developer-delays-the-release-of-a-new-ship-upgrade-as-players-baulk-at-having-to-pay-for-it/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"To be clear, the new Flight Blades will be obtainable for aUEC in our next patch this June. We followed our usual approach by offering early access on the pledge store to help support development. But after some reflection, we've decided that for smaller components like Flight Blades or bomb racks, they should be available in-game at the same time they appear on the store.</p>
<p>"The choice has and should always be yours," the statement continued. "If you want to support the project early, you can, but it's not required.</p>
<p>"Thanks to everyone who's weighed in, especially those who brought the heat constructively. This game has always been shaped by the community," Witkin concluded." Star Citizen wouldn't exist without your passion and support, or your scrutiny and feedback. We hear you, and we take it all to heart."</p>
<p>Not all players were mollified, however.</p>
<p>"This is meant to be constructive, but you cannot keep the status quo and move up the in game part a little faster and act like you have solved the root of the problem," <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/7954429">responded</a> one. "This is a bandaid to calm people down, but the root issue here is that you continue to sell more and more items in the game that have a wider impact on what a player would do day to day.</p>
<p>"Everyone knows the convienence of the pledgestore would outweigh any gameplay in an MMO that is meant to be played and slowly gained progress over years…"</p>
<p>"Flight blades were kept from players in PTU with complete radio silence from CIG only for them to pop up in the store once the patch hit LIVE," <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/7955870">added</a> another. "They wanted to cash in on the FOMO during Invictus, and have not changed course. This isn't an act of goodwill, this is a non-apology and business-as-usual for CIG."</p>
<p>Another said players "deserve what we tolerate", <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/7959094">stating</a>: "These flight blades feel so gimicky, and having them locked to a single type of ship is just greedy design.</p>
<p>"If we accept this and CIG makes money off these blades, then we deserve more pay-to-win features. "Vote with your wallet, citizens! I've been following the project since 2.6 and I was happy with the development till they changed the ship prices to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a> online prices (and economy). That was a hard pill to swallow, but seeing these flight blades come out in this manner, it just paints a clear picture of things to come."</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Red Dead Redemption is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, May 18, 2025. Below, we look back at the western in the context of its cinematic inspirations.</em></p><p>Stories about the American West, just like stories about knights or ninjas or other iconic figures, are not a monolith. There are stories fantastical and grounded, silly and serious, traditional and rebellious. Red Dead Redemption is a spaghetti Western in the same lineage as so many of Sergio Leone's movies, like A Fistful of Dollars and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Even among other open-world games and the other games in its own series, Red Dead Redemption is a singular experience. It delivers on the fantasy of playing a legendary gunslinger in a grimy American West. And there will never be another game quite like it.</p><h3 dir="ltr">A Look Back at the Red Dead Trilogy</h3><p dir="ltr">The Red Dead games are a trilogy, though we rarely think of the first entry, Red Dead Revolver. All three games in the series are wildly different takes on the Western; even though the most recent two have consistent characters and a chronology to them, they could hardly be more different in presentation, tone, and style.</p><p dir="ltr">Red Dead Revolver, developed by Rockstar San Diego (originally Angel Studios) and funded in part by Capcom, is a linear action game with a simple revenge narrative. Stylistically, it has more in common with a comic book or anime than any Western film or the rest of the games in the Red Dead series. There are limbs flying everywhere, and it sports over-the-top bosses like a huge guy with dynamite strapped to his head and steel plates on his arms as shields.</p><p dir="ltr">Red Dead Redemption 2, on the other hand, is a Western epic with more in common with True Grit or Open Range than with something like Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars. It works overtime to represent its characters and setting as accurately as possible (with notable exceptions like the treatment of the people of Appalachia). It's so interested in authenticity that historian and professor Tore Olsson wrote an entire book on where RDR2 succeeds and comes up short with regard to representing reality and came away with the conclusion that, despite some mistakes and some places where more depth would be warranted, the game got more right than not.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496370-ss_b23f5fe259eed0aead274b670e357d087fa3b1f4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496370" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496370-ss_b23f5fe259eed0aead274b670e357d087fa3b1f4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496370"></a><figcaption>Red Dead Redemption</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496370-ss_b23f5fe259eed0aead274b670e357d087fa3b1f4.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Red Dead Redemption</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">That brings us to the middle child, 2010's Red Dead Redemption, a game that takes inspiration from the Spaghetti Western movies. The term Spaghetti Western refers to a genre of film made primarily between 1960 and 1978, and produced in Europe--most commonly Italy and Spain.</p><p dir="ltr">Prior Westerns were often about mythologizing the American West. Cowboys were clear heroes or villains, and the lines between good and evil were clear and easily delineated. Spaghetti Westerns blurred those lines, making the villains charming and the heroes surly and difficult to be around.</p><p dir="ltr">They also went hard on style. The opening sequence of A Fistful of Dollars is iconic, with silhouettes of gunslingers battling it out, backed by whistling and chanting music unlike anything the cinematic Old West had ever seen.</p><p dir="ltr">We see all that at work in Red Dead Redemption. The graphics and music often take direct influence from Sergio Leone's movies. The music especially stands out here. Composed by musicians Bill Elm and Woody Jackson, Red Dead Redemption uses some traditional instruments like the jaw harp, but it also broadens out from that with the score combining, for example, the sound of a smooth harmonica with grimy, heavily distorted electric guitar.</p><p dir="ltr">The story, too, feels entirely of a piece with Spaghetti Western sensibilities, for better and worse. There are some parts that haven't aged well. The character known as Irish stands out here as a poorly written character built on gross stereotypes of Irish people that sours your replay of an entire section of the game. Even that feels like something straight out of a Spaghetti Western, though, where characters were broad and often built on simple themes or stereotypes.</p><p dir="ltr">Other, more elemental parts match up though, too. John Marston is a Good Guy, but he isn't a <em>good guy</em>. He's not rising to a challenge, but being blackmailed into an impossible situation. He's abrasive, too. Even those of us who love the game can agree that Marston's voice takes a bit of time to warm up to. On the opposite side is the immediately charming Dutch van der Linde: a guy with big ideas and a smooth, deep voice. Side characters like the snake-oil salesman Nigel West Dickens are broad, goofy, and unreliable, while characters like Bonnie MacFarlane tempt John toward an "honest" life that would come with heavy compromises, which he can't afford to even really dream about. Landon Ricketts, the aging American gunslinger that John meets in Mexico, represents the characters played by actors like Lee van Cleef in movies such as For a Few Dollars More--wise killers who have earned that wisdom with blood and loss.His battles against his former comrades are only triumphant in that you survive them. They're not victories over evil. John doesn't want to be there, but the axe over his wife and son's heads has forced his hand, and he has to do that dirty work. His old friends have gone sour, providing some justification for his actions, but they're not evil.</p><p dir="ltr">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid isn't a Spaghetti Western per se, being an American production, but it lands smack dab in the middle of the Spaghetti Western era, and shares enough of that broad, comedic tone and grimy quality to work here. John Marston's final moments are a take on the movie's iconic ending, in which the characters end on a freeze frame over the sound of a hail of gunfire. John opens the barn to see more lawmen than he could ever take down, all aiming at him. He gets his final moment and empties his revolver into the crowd, but he was never going to get to live a peaceful life. As much as he might try, it was not much more than a dalliance for a life-long gunslinger.</p><p dir="ltr">Red Dead 2 feels like a slog when I try to imagine re-playing it--all these mean people making mistakes and killing each other, and a beautiful landscape full of terrible people. It's undoubtedly a beautiful and incredibly written and realized game. But sometimes you want A Fistful of Dollars more than 3:10 to Yuma. Red Dead Redemption is the answer. Despite being full of cruelty, it is an adventure about a reluctant hero with the skills and grit to get himself out of so many bad situations, given all the grandiosity and flamboyance of those movies that inspired it.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>For more on Red Dead Redemption's 15th anniversary, read why its story <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-is-at-its-best-when-it-shuts-up/1100-6531573/" data-ref-id="1100-6531573">works best when it shuts up</a>.</em></p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Red Dead Redemption is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, May 18, 2025. Below, we consider that it may be better at showing than telling.</em></p><p dir="ltr">As a rule, Westerns are sincere. Sure, there are outright farces like Blazing Saddles. Plenty of classic Westerns like Rio Bravo have a warm, comedic side. Even dark epics like the Searchers have moments of levity. But even when they are funny, Westerns play their archetypes straight. They are easy to make fun of because they are so unfeigned. In this context, Red Dead Redemption struggles to find its place. It imports Grand Theft Auto's satire into a bare and somber world. In many moments, protagonist John Marston is the only voice of reason among cliches and caricatures. When Red Dead Redemption talks, it is often cheap and unserious. When it shuts up, it manages a real poetry, thanks to its austere landscapes and unpretentious world.</p><p dir="ltr">First, let's dig into its writing. RDR is a sunset Western, set in the waning days of Western expansion. Marston is a man out of time: a cowboy criminal in a world that wants to kill him (and will). Marston is foolish. He hunts down his former compatriots on the behest of the US government, because he hopes they will keep his promise to return his family to him and leave him alone. He is wrong. The killings he undertakes swing back on him and his family alike.</p><p dir="ltr">This tragic arc is compelling, but a relatively narrow portion of the game is spent on it. Far more time is spent on Marston cavorting with scoundrels to track his targets. These characters are mostly cliches. Nigel West Dickens is a sniveling snake-oil salesman. Irish is, well, a drunk Irishman. Agustin Allende is a cruel dictator, and Landon Ricketts a noble marshall. Like Rockstar's other other open-world games, RDR's story missions are largely siloed off from the rest of the game. Many of them are just ride-alongs: long discussions on horseback, after which there might be a shootout. A huge portion of RDR's runtime is listening to inane characters prattle on as Marston scolds, tut-tuts, or shrugs his shoulders.</p><p dir="ltr">In this regard, the game's treatment of Mexico is particularly egregious. The Mexican Revolution was one of the most complex conflicts of this time period, with dozens of factions. RDR reduces this to two sides: an oppressive government and a revolutionary army led by the charlatan Abraham Reyes, who only wants power for himself. Marston aids both sides to progress his own goals, thereby holding himself above the conflict altogether. He frowns as he helps the dictator destroy a village and shakes his head as the revolutionaries celebrate their victory. The game's pessimism is not bleak, but cheap.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496369-ss_8d45239f5f6ed57bcf7a3b6bf7f5b23fa7d76a57.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496369" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496369-ss_8d45239f5f6ed57bcf7a3b6bf7f5b23fa7d76a57.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496369"></a><figcaption>Red Dead Redemption</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496369-ss_8d45239f5f6ed57bcf7a3b6bf7f5b23fa7d76a57.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In part, the RDR’s political commentary feels incomplete because of Marsten himself. He is both an emblem of the United States’ worst sins, a hired gun meant to kill political dissidents and petty criminals alike, and a victim, a detainee forced to do labor the government won’t dirty its own hands with. This is a meaningful tension that RDR does not flesh out. If anything, Marsten’s plight is directly compared to the native peoples of the game. Both have been displaced from their homes. But Marsten is exactly the kind of white frontiersman who drove so many native peoples from their homelands. Because of the game’s satirical tone and Marsten’s wise-guy, above-it-all posture, it cannot mine that tension for drama.</p><p dir="ltr">The game even undercuts its most effective moments. When Marston crosses the border to Mexico, an original song by José González plays. I still remember reaching this moment for the first time. Dawn scattered light across the virtual desert. Blood-red dirt and sky shone in an unbroken line. But this moment is preceded by Irish's drunken hijinks. The grandeur of RDR's world makes the needle drop land, but it is a moment that the game does not build to or descend from.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the hardline separation between the delivery of RDR's narrative and its wide-open world is an asset as much as a weakness. This is no Ubisoft checklist world. RDR's side activities, particularly its minigames like poker and liar's dice, exist on their own terms. You can't capture outposts to spread your influence or win a tournament to become the most renowned poker player in the West. Instead, there's a seat at the table for you, if you want to play a hand or two, but the dealer will deal with or without you. RDR's random events can feel aggrandizing. Marston always arrives just in time to stop a highway robbery or rescue a fair maiden from vagabonds. But Marston can get swindled too. Highwaymen will try to take his horse or bandits will hide behind rocks to try and ambush him. These systems work in tandem to make the world feel separate from the player. The sun sets and rises. The same folks get drunk at the local bar every night. Marston wanders between them.</p><p dir="ltr">RDR's simulacra of the natural world helps that sense of separateness, of things acting and moving without your input. The game features extensive hunting and foraging mechanics. Even if you don't engage with them, creatures scatter in the bushes by the roadside, herds of buffalo and cattle graze in grassy fields, and a chance encounter with a bear can ruin your day. This does result in some silly video game hijinks--the game’s predators will attack you for no reason--but there is also a wildness that can settle into its quiet moments.</p><p dir="ltr">A large part of that wildness is that the game is still gorgeous. Each one of its biomes has a distinct character. It has its share of spectacular vistas, pulling on real-world locations like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/red-dead-redemption/2018/10/23/17986758/red-dead-redemption-best-western-game" rel="nofollow ">Monument Valley</a>, but it is also willing to trade in mundanities: a well-worn dirt road, a chicken coop after dusk, playing horseshoes in the backyard. Rockstar's obsession with granular, background simulation <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/red-dead-redemption-2/red-dead-redemption-2-horse-testicles" rel="nofollow ">can be absurd</a>, but it is also obviously a part of how its games feel unique. RDR is also quiet. There are no chattering radios or blaring car horns. There is only the desert. RDR can feel meditative, even boring, in a way few video games do.</p><p dir="ltr">The ending is where the best parts of RDR's talkative side and its quiet side align. After completing his task, Marston returns to his farm and his family. His wife Abigail and his son Jack are not cliches. Both have complex feelings for the man who has been so absent from their lives. The game takes its time unraveling these threads. In the meantime, Marston works like an ordinary man. He does chores. For the game's last few hours, there is a feeling of merely being in the world.</p><p dir="ltr">The ultimate, violent interruption of Marston's quiet life is all more heartbreaking for how long it takes to come. The force of Red Dead Redemption's final images help explain its outsized reputation. Marston promising his family he'll find them when he knows he'll die. A deep breath before facing the agents sent to kill him. Blood pouring from his mouth as he tries to stand. There is plenty of wanton violence in RDR, but this is a moment that feels actually senseless. It's all because of how quiet it is, how much build-up leads to here. It is emblematic of RDR's politics that a white settler is the ultimate, symbolic martyr of US state violence. That in no way takes away from the specter of death RDR summons at its conclusion.</p><p dir="ltr">But here's the thing: One of RDR's primary inspirations is Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian. At once beautiful, bleak, and absurd, the novel follows a band of men as they murder for money along the line between Mexico and the US, loosely based on the real-life Glanton gang. Blood Meridian is ash and gunpowder printed to page. So much of RDR's power is derived from it, the game can't help but feel derivative. Furthermore, it reaches emotional depths RDR can't offer in a fraction of the time. But what those can't offer is RDR's aesthetic embodiment. The spontaneous sunrise of a clear desert night, a coyote howl, a distant campfire, as you ride into the darkness.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>For more on Red Dead Redemption's 15th anniversary, read about its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-there-will-never-be-another-spaghetti-western-like-it/1100-6531443/" data-ref-id="1100-6531443">spaghetti western cinematic inspirations</a>.</em></p>

            <p>Semiwork has outlined the next batch of changes coming to its fan-favourite co-op horror game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/repo">REPO</a>.</p>
<p>In a new, and brilliant, video, designer Pontus discussed a revamp of the game's health and re-gen systems, as well as give us a sneaky peek at a devastating new weapon that's slated to arrive, too.</p>

<p>After a cheeky nod to the not-remotely-secret spam-E-as-the-level-loads health glitch - which, sadly, will not be making a return any time soon - Semiwork said it was "listening to feedback", including taking "another look at health balancing in general, as well as crystal balance".</p>
<p>"We are tweaking the health system so that it will be easier to heal your entire team," designer Pontus explained. "We'll be adding a team discount for the health kits, so the more players you are, the cheaper the health kits will get. Also, the truck will be more generous with its health recovery when Semibots return to the truck."</p>
<p>This means that below Level 5, players will get 50 HP when successfully making it back to the truck, and after level 5, you'll regain 35 HP. From Level 10+, it'll be 25 HP.</p>
<p>"We want the health kits and the crystals to be more attractive to buy, so they will have a similar cap on the pricing," Semiwork added.</p>
<p>That's not all. There is also enemy re-balancing on the way, especially as some enemies, like Robe, can't be stunned by lighter items. The fix for this, Semiwork said, is to make enemies more "unsteady" below Level 5 so they'll be easier to stun and push over.</p>
<p>"We always take a look at glitches that become popular, or even mods," he added. "And we take that as a sign that we need to tweak or change the gameplay design, or add to it."</p>
<p>We're also getting something called the Cart Cannon and the Cart Laser, which are exactly what they say on the tin.</p>
<p>"We hope that this weapon, together with the other things, will be at great disposal for your Semibot team."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/667948/maze-mice-pc-early-access-small-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There have been a lot of <em>big</em> games this year that have felt all-consuming, like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> or <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. <em>Maze Mice</em> offers something different: a small, pick-up-and-play experience that takes a bunch of ideas from some classics and adds a clever twist.</p><p>The game, from <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> developer TrampolineTales, mixes elements of <em>Pac-Man</em>, <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and even the classic <em>Snake</em>. As an adorable, pixelated mouse, you zip around a maze to get blue experience gems that are guarded by cats. When you pass by the cats, they’ll wake up and start chasing you, sometimes creating a hilariously long line of felines. (Cute ghost cats will also appear and inconveniently float right into your path.) All the action takes place on one screen, so it’s easy to see where everything is at any given time.</p><p>When you get enough gems, you can pick from a selection of three power-ups. The upgrades are often a little silly, like knitting needles that fly through the air to attack the cats pursuing you, but as with <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, it’s fun to experiment with different abilities to create interesting builds.</p><p><em>Maze Mice</em>’s most interesting feature is that time only moves when you move, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/25/11110138/superhot-review-video-game-pc-mac-linux">like in <em>Superhot</em></a>. When you inch forward, the enemy cats inch forward right behind you, but when you’re not moving, they’re frozen, too. Your abilities are all on cooldowns, and the time on those cooldowns also only advances when you move forward. It all means that instead of the growing sense of being overwhelmed that you might get while dodging ghosts in <em>Pac-Man</em> or fighting hordes of monsters in <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, <em>Maze Mice</em> gives you time to sit and think about where you want to go next — even if you have 10 cats on your tail.</p><p>I really like how it all works. You’re still dealing with lots of enemies, but instead of the anxiety of having to fend them off in real time like in other games, it’s all much much more laid-back. The charming atmosphere and catchy music help make the experience feel more welcoming than stressful, too.</p><p>After runs, you’ll unlock new upgrades and characters for future runs based on your score. I’m a big fan of a mine weapon that blows up when I get the cats following me to walk over it. And my favorite character so far is a mouse named Jazz with sunglasses and a saxophone — who starts with a saxophone weapon. Such a cool little guy!</p><p><em>Maze Mice</em> is in early access, so it should get more content down the line. It seems like there’s a generous amount to play with already; TrampolineTales launched the game this month <a href="https://blog.trampolinetales.com/a-really-big-change-to-maze-mices-release-its-a-good-thing/">with 30 characters and 63 upgrades</a>, meaning there’s a lot to dig into. But the thing I love most about it is that I can play for a few minutes after an hourlong <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> level and feel like I actually accomplished something – even when those pesky cats eventually catch up to me. </p><p><em><sub>Maze Mice is available now in early access on PC.</sub></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>With Borderlands 4, Gearbox Software is pushing toward a far larger, seamless world, and that factored into the developer's decision to drop the minimap seen in previous installments.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvsx1FzIKEg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PAX East 2025 panel</a>, Gearbox founder and president Randy Pitchford explained:</p>
<p><em>This is the biggest (by far) universe that we've built, and it's seamless. There's no load times. You see something anywhere on the screen, a mile away up in the sky, and you will be able to get there. We made a big freaking world. And a lot of the things you do can be local space, but a lot of the things you do or want to do are out there, and a local space map is not a good way to navigate when you're thinking about objectives and opportunities, several at the same time, that might be miles away. A compass really helps us do that.</em></p>
<p>The other aspect that played into Gearbox's choice is that Borderlands 4 will be much more vertical than its predecessor. Pitchford added:</p>
<p><em>The other thing that the team really wanted to commit to is to push the boundaries of design and environment. Instead of just a single flat plane, they embraced a lot of verticality. You're going to have more verticality in Borderlands 4 than you've ever seen before in a Borderlands game by far, and when you have a layered environment, a top-down two-dimensional view is extremely confusing. With a compass with arrows that tell you if things are up or down, you have a much better sense of spatial awareness, and we want you to play the game, not the map. So, we made a commitment, and we put all of that investment into this compass system.</em></p>
<p><em>You still have the big map. It's one click away and we put more cool stuff in there than we've ever done before. We even have an AI-driven kind of navigation system that'll give you a GPS on the big map to show you the line of where you can go, and there's even an in-world companion, Echobot, that has some features there that'll help you navigate.</em></p>
<p>Pitchford didn't rule out adding a minimap to Borderlands 4 at some point in the future (presumably after launch), but told fans to play the game first before judging.&nbsp;That'll happen <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on September 12</a>, when the game is planned to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. A Nintendo Switch 2 version will release later, and Pitchford talked about that, too, as you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-very-powerful-is-perfect-for-borderlands-4-says-randy-pitchford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our previous report</a>.</p>

            <p>
It's been a little under a year since the vehicular combat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-speed-freeks">Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks</a> launched into early access, and yesterday developer Caged Element Inc. announced that it'll be receiving its 1.0 launch next week, May 22nd. There are a couple notable changes that come with this launch though. For starters, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/wired-productions">Wired Productions</a> are taking over from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/plaion">Plaion</a> on publishing duties. As the devs explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2078450/view/541105873081074235?l=english">Steam post</a>, the reason this matters to you is the second change, which is that you'll have to pay for it when it arrives next week. Some of you, anyway.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Anyone that played the early access version of the game will be getting the full release completely for free. That's great for that subset of people, though perhaps a small bummer for anyone that was interested but prefers to avoid early access games. Ah well, it won't be very expensive, as it'll only launching with a discounted price of $16 (the full price hasn't been shared just yet, though I doubt it'll be much more than that).
</p>
<p>
A press release also says that microtransactions are also being removed from the game with this change. Anyone that earned or bought in-game currency, called Teef, will still be able to spend it for the next 12 months. Anyone that is new to the game with the 1.0 launch won't be able to the in-game store where you can spend Teef. There'll also be some DLC packs coming at launch, which I'm assuming will be the same bits you'll be able to pick up with Teef, though this wasn't clarified in the press release.
</p>
<p>
Caged Element explained that moving away from free-to-play does have its benefits. For one, player-hosted matches with custom settings will be possible, alongside hosting private games. There will also be a new free-roam mode to "explore any map and create custom races."
</p>
<p>
It's probably worth noting that the game won't be playable from this coming Tuesday, May 20th to the 22nd, launch day, so don't panic if you can't get your freek on.

These days, when there's so many games coming out that I feel like an overwhelmed dog with free reign in a butcher's, there's no sweeter sentence to me than "this game will take you no longer than two hours." I know for some people length is everything (don't), but personally I love a short, good time (seriously, leave it out). So the second I saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/formless-star">Formless Star</a>, an eclectic little creature cataloguing game, and read that it was one to two hours long, I was immediately in.

Here's the low down: you are Anemo, a researcher sent on a mission in a spaceship to a planet called the Formless Star to collect data on the many animals that live there. There's around 60 for you to find and learn about, all of them weirder than the next. You might find Flodeboller, a marshmallow-looking creature that hangs out in hot areas even though it's very uncomfortable with the heat, but just forgets it could leave any time it wants. There's Boy, who is a boy! Or Sylvia, an animal that evolved from a crashed spacecraft (you should definitely hang out with Sylvia, I would die for them).

Gameplay is pretty simple, you just kind of go up to each of these animals and interact with them, and then you get a Pokedex-esque entry that'll likely be a quirky goof. The world itself is randomly generated, changing itself every time you step out, different animals appearing on a fresh generation. 
</p>
<p>
It is primarily a game about vibes, those vibes being a funny, oddball, Game Boy Advance looking game with a, I want to say, healing soundtrack. It's just a lovely place to hang out for an hour or two, simplistic or not. Think of it almost like a walking simulator, but in 2D.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most impressive of all is how unique each of the animals feel. Something I often feel let down by in non-Pokemon creature collectors is how uninspired the designs are. I understand that that might come down to not having the resources, but the range of designs in Formless Star, a game predominantly made by a single person, splendidland, does kind of show that when it comes to this type of design work, you just need to get weird with it.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, it's pay what you want over on <a href="https://splendidland.itch.io/formless-star">Itch.io</a>! Meaning you can just download it for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free</a> if you like, or you can chip in a bit of dosh to support the dev. Which you should do, because it's a delightful little gem that has a nice simple message to it.

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-has-great-optimism-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-but-wont-necessarily-bring-all-games-to-the-platform/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is weeks away from launch at the time of writing, and while there's plenty of excitement, there are still plenty of questions and anxieties about how all the changes coming with the console will land.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-will-likely-be-widespread-due-to-limited-cartdrige-options/">Game-key cards</a> are one of the changes that players aren't happy about. If you didn't know, Game-key cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 are physical cartridges you can buy in your local video game store or online, just as you would any physical copy of a game, but they are not, in any way, a copy of the game you're buying. There's no game data on them; they're just a key, and the game you're buying will be installed on your console through a digital download.</p>
<p>We've seen that before with PlayStation and Xbox game discs, and with some Nintendo Switch games that have a limited amount of the game's data on the cartridge, with the rest downloaded. But that isn't stopping players from being upset in a whole new way about game-key cards.</p>
<p>At least, for now, we can expect that games like Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and whatever the next 3D Mario game is will all be released as proper physical editions, where the game is on the cartridge you buy in a store or online instead of just a key for a digital download.</p>
<p>Of course, the stipulation that Nintendo has no plans to do this for titles that Nintendo develops means that any Nintendo-published titles could still be released as game-key card versions. We should also expect plenty of third-party studios to go the game-key card route instead of spending the extra money to release proper cartridges.</p>

            <p>A new report alleges that Marathon developer Bungie is in "chaos" after the studio was forced to admit that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">an external artist's work has been used within upcoming game Marathon without consent</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/17/new-marathon-info-bungie-morale-launch-worries-and-changing-plans/">Forbes</a> claims morale at the studio is in "free fall" right across the organisation, with one source telling the outlet "the vibes have never been worse".</p>
<p>The issue came to light earlier this week following recent playable alpha tests of Marathon, from which <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">artist Fern Hook recognised their designs</a> had been used. Responding via its less-visible <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262">Marathon Dev Team social media account</a>, Bungie wrote that it had "immediately investigated" Hook's claim and found that, yes, a former artist at the company had swiped the designs.</p>

<p>Then, in an ill-timed and palpably awkward livestream last night, the developer revealed it would not be sharing any Marathon gameplay due to the ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>"Our show is a little bit different today," explained game director, Joe Ziegler, at the beginning of the stream. "We had planned to show a lot more stuff, but for a lot of reasons we're about to get into, we decided not to show a bunch of this stuff. But we are going to be discussing a lot about what we learned through Alpha, some of the plans that we're going forward with."</p>
<p>Ziegler later said part of the reason Bungie wasn't showing any gameplay was because the team was "still scrubbing all of our assets to make sure that we are being respectful of the situation".</p>
<p>"It came to our attention that an artist who worked on Marathon in the early stages of pre-production took a number of graphic elements from a graphic designer, without permission or acknowledgement, and placed them on a decal sheet that was then checked in, in 2020," added art director Joe Cross, reading from a statement.</p>
<p>"The decal sheet included icons and text elements. These elements ended up in our alpha build and there is absolutely no excuse for this oversight, and we are working on, and 100% committed to, our review process to ensure instances like this don't happen again on Marathon or at Bungie."</p>
<p>Forbes now reports sources at Bungie say the explanation given publicly about the incident - which is that a former employee is responsible - is the same reason given internally, but "morale was in free fall" as the team scrambled to recover from the latest in a line of plagiarism accusations. With changes to its marketing plan - which pre-dates this week's incident - and possible amendments to its playtesting plans, as well as now an audit into what should be every single graphic element used on Marathon, some fear the shooter will struggle to hit its 23rd September release date.</p>
<p>Forbes also intimates staff have been uneasy with the direction of development, saying, "as far back as five years ago, devs were telling [management] what would and wouldn't work and were often ignored. Many have said previously that it needed to have some sort of PvE component".</p>
<p>"Sony and Bungie legal" are reportedly looking into what happened with the stolen assets, but Bungie's decision not to share <em>any</em> footage in yesterday's livestream is perhaps telling enough.</p>
<p>Marathon is set to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 23rd September.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At a time where there is constantly word of this or that game shutting down, even successful ones, it will never fail to surprise me that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xi">Final Fantasy 11</a> is still going. You can't play it on PS2 anymore, but there's still an active community on PC even now. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> just celebrated its 23rd anniversary yesterday in fact, with a new update video and <a href="http://www.playonline.com/pcd/topics/ff11us/detail/22548/detail.html">letter from the producer</a> Yoji Fujito released to highlight some of the new and upcoming features.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For one, in a future update more monsters are getting added to Limbus. There's also a new morale gauge system coming to Besieged that gives your forces a stat boost. Perhaps most interesting of all is a feature you might take for granted in modern MMOs, which is the introduction of the character race change service. Dodgy name aside, this will allow you to change your character's race, gender, face type, hair colour, and size.

<p>
Updates over the last year even added in something as small as gamepad configuration adjustments, and as big as a new master trial, Wing of War.
</p>
<p>
Fujito's letter further explained that even now, the team is looking to help new and returning players, particularly solo ones, have an easier time with the game. Currently there's something called the alter ego system, which is similar to Final Fantasy 14's trust system in that you can recruit NPCs to help you on quests. According to Fujito, the devs will be looking to allow you to upgrade these alter egos "as a means of enhancing the solo player experience." They have other plans to smooth things over too, which is honestly a little wild to me for a game that's been running for so long.
</p>
<p>
I've not dived into Final Fantasy 11 myself, there's always too many games for me to play to even consider touching an MMO. Still, it's comforting in a strange way that knowing that it's there, trudging along, ready for myself or anyone else to give it a go. Kudos to the team!

            <p>
Earlier this week, it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blade-pc-will-release-on-11th-june-according-to-leaked-trailer-montage-of-technical-improvements">leaked</a> and then later confirmed that <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1923048769245020481">Stellar Blade</a>, that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>-esque one with the jiggle physics cranked up to the max, would be coming to PC next month on June 11th. This was obviously welcome news to the kind of people who enjoy that sort of thing (more or less no judgement here). But it quickly became apparent that there was a bit of a caveat: the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game isn't available to pre-order in all regions on Steam.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, you'll probably remember how a lot of Sony published games on Steam aren't available in every territory because of their annoying PSN requirement. That was at least <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">dropped by Sony somewhat earlier this year</a>, so it's a bit confusing why <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> isn't available in all regions. In fact, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/shift-up-corporation">Shift Up</a> don't even seem to know why this is the case, as in a Dwitter post they explained that they are "closely discussing the region lock issue with the publisher and are doing our best to resolve most of it as soon as possible."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">🔸️We are closely discussing the region lock issue with the publisher and are doing our BEST to resolve most of it as soon as possible.<br>🔸️As shown in the test chart below, the DRM has been hard tuned to maintain the same average frame rate, with even higher minimum frames in… <a href="https://t.co/JDimvKiKte">pic.twitter.com/JDimvKiKte</a></p>— StellarBlade (@StellarBlade) <a href="https://twitter.com/StellarBlade/status/1923430874391118044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
They also clarified that connecting a PSN account is "entirely optional and never required." It's clear they know how badly this has been received across the board by PC players, and it sounds like this has been a bit out of their hands.
</p>
<p>
Outside of trying to get this region lock problem sorted, Shift Up also sought to make it known that the "DRM has been hard tuned to maintain the same average frame rate, with even higher minimum frames in some cases", and the mods will be "fully supported without any restrictions." I'm sure people plan on making perfectly regular mods for this game. Definitely not having a vision of something weird and questionable, no sir.

        <p>But company is confident player account information remains secure.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Guilty Gear Strive developer Arc System Works has suffered a "data leakage due to unauthorised access".</p>
<p>In a brief <a href="https://www.arcsystemworks.com/notice-regarding-data-leakage-due-to-unauthorized-access/">statement</a>, the company said that while its systems had been illegally accessed by a third-party and data was leaked, it didn't believe the leak included any "personal information or player account information".</p>

<p>"We regret to announce that we have discovered that our systems were illegally accessed by a third party and that data held by us was leaked to outside parties," the statement read.</p>
<p>"As of May 12, we have not confirmed the leak of any user personal information or player account information due to the unauthorised access. We are working diligently to determine the cause of the unauthorised access and the extent of the impact with the help of outside experts, and we will inform you if any new facts are discovered as a result of the investigation.</p>
<p>"We sincerely apologise to all for any inconvenience and concern this may cause. We are truly sorry."</p>
<p>The statement closed on imploring people not to try and access the data that was allegedly leaked, "as there is a possibility that it may cause malware infection".</p>
<p>What information, exactly, the leakers <em>did</em> manage to access remains to be seen. Arc System Works hasn't said if it was employee data or information pertaining to unreleased or unannounced game projects, but <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/guilty-gear-strive-source-code-leak-explained-season-5-characters-discovered-3193826/">Dexerto</a> reported earlier this month, before Arc's statement, that Guilty Gear Strive's source code was leaked, including "new data" about the game's story and characters.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't the first time a studio's plans been hacked and prematurely leaked. In December 2023, PlayStation-owned Spider-Man developer Insomniac had detailed plans of future projects published online, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">stolen from the company by hackers</a>, and then ransomed for $2m. The files include a project roadmap for the next decade and beyond including an array of unannounced projects, plus production details, art assets, and personal information on Insomniac employees.</p>
<p>Perhaps more famously still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90-gta-6-videos-and-screenshots-have-allegedly-leaked-online">90+ videos and screenshots from Rockstar's then-unannounced GTA 6 also leaked online early in September 2022</a> after a hacker managed to access its internal systems.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
