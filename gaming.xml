            <p>Nvidia have released the latest in an unusually frequent series of GeForce driver hotfixes, with the vast majority of identified issues affecting the newest RTX 50 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> specifically. <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5652">GeForce Hotfix Display Driver version 576.26</a> targets various crashing and flickering problems with, among others, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> – though it’s the growing regularity of these patch jobs that’s more disquieting than any particular instance of game breakage.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While driver hotfixes have been rare during previous GeForce generations, a recent flurry has seen them averaging about one every two weeks, from the 572.24 hotfix for a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a> startup crash on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a> to the black screen scourge of 572.75, and now both the 576.15 and bumper-size 576.26 versions being deployed within the same day. Peering through their patch notes reveals that by far the most common thread is the RTX 50 series, which is hardly a ringing endorsement of their software stability.</p>
<p>I should say that I haven’t experienced any such problems myself while reviewing these cards, which performance-wise, range from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review">pretty decent</a> to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review">enormously disappointing</a>. Still, I am but one hardware editor, and even the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/564309/announcing-geforce-hotfix-driver-57626-released-42/">Nvidia forum post</a> announcing the latest hotfix leads into a raft of community replies reporting various continuing problems. Driver version 576.02, the most recent stable driver, is repeatedly identified as a breaking point, and with two hotfixes having now been sticky-plastered on top of it, the accusation carries some weight.</p>
<p>It's true that 'stable' drivers are faced with potentially meddlesome time restraints, as they’re usually released in support of either key new games or a new piece of hardware (the RTX 5060 Ti, in 576.02’s case). Still, that’s been the case with GeForce drivers for donkeys’ ages, so can’t really shoulder the blame for the sudden uptick in problems and resultant hotfixes. In any case, if you’ve been having hiccups with your own GeForce GPU, <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5652">give version 576.26 a download</a> and hope you won’t need another one for a while. It’ll need to be a manual installation, as hotfixes aren’t released through the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-nvidia-app-is-out-now-justly-banishing-geforce-experience-to-history">Nvidia App</a> like stable drivers are.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Composer Grant Kirkhope has shed light on why he wasn't credited by Nintendo in the Super Mario Bros. Movie for the inclusion of his DK Rap from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>.</p>
<p>Back in 2023 after the film's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-rap-composer-criticises-mario-movie-for-not-crediting-him">Kirkhope shared his frustration on social media</a>, calling the decision "fucking depressing". Other pieces of licensed music were fully credited.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Kirkhope explained how he spoke with Nintendo after the film's release but the company made the decision to not credit any music it owns - including the DK Rap.</p>

<p>"I did have communication with Nintendo as I wanted to find out why they just didn't put my name on it," said Kirkhope.</p>
<p>"They said we decided that any music that was quoted from the games that we owned, we wouldn't credit the composers - apart from Koji Kondo. Then they decided anything with a vocal would get credited, so the DK Rap scores there. But then they decided if we also own it, we won't credit the composers. And that was the final nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>"I said I appreciate you've got your policies and all the rest of it, but by the time the credits roll in the movie to show the songs, the theatre's completely empty, everyone's gone, it's only me and my wife and my two kids sat there going 'look daddy's name!'. I said 'for the sake of a couple of lines of text…', but that was that."</p>
<p>Bowser's Fury, another song used in the film but also owned by Nintendo, was likewise not credited.</p>
<p>Kirkhope heard from attendees of test screenings the DK Rap had been included, but he had assumed it was just test music and would be removed.</p>
<p>He added: "It's bizarre how they just sampled it straight from the game. They just plugged in the N64 and sampled it and looped it. There's no re-recording done, straight out the game. So it's me playing guitar on it. It's the lads from Rare doing the [sings] 'D-K' thing. They're all the performers on the track. So they're all in the movie uncredited."</p>
<p>So if Nintendo owns the rights to the DK Rap, does that mean we could see it added to the Nintendo Music App anytime soon?</p>
<p>"I wonder," said Kirkhope. "They have put some of Dave's [David Wise] stuff on it. They do own it all so it's up to them. I don't think they ever really liked DK 64 that much. That's a rumour we got back through the cycle of whispers from Nintendo when we were at Rare. I don't know if that's true or not."</p>
<p>It's certainly notable that Donkey Kong 64 is one of the few games from the N64 not included on the Switch Online collection.</p>
<p>Still, it appears the theme of Rambi the rhinoceros will be in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, as a post in the Nintendo Today app suggests. Kirkhope himself replied on social media: "Well fancy that...Rambi lives."</p> <div>

The <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5652">576.26 hotfix driver</a> is based on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649599/nvidia-driver-576-02-bug-fixes-crashes-download-game-ready">576.02 driver release</a> earlier this month, which itself included a large amount of fixes for bugs and crashes.</p><p>This latest hotfix driver includes all the fixes in the 576.15 hotfix that was released last week, including a fix for the newly introduced <a href="http://GPU temperature bug">GPU temperature bug</a>. It also addresses flickering issues in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, track corruption on <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, and <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> randomly crashing on RTX 50-series cards. There are a variety of fixes for <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, <em>Dead Island 2</em>, and <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> on RTX 50-series GPUs, too.</p><p>Nvidia has also included yet another supposed fix for black screen issues plaguing a range of LG monitors when using DisplayPort 2.1 mode. There’s also a fix for “grey screen crashes with multiple monitors” and “momentary display flicker occurs when running in DisplayPort2.1 mode with a high refresh rate” on RTX 50-series cards.</p><p>This is the fifth time Nvidia has released a hotfix driver over the past couple of months, which is a highly unusual amount and speaks to the persistent bugs and crashes that Nvidia GPU users have been reporting since the release of the RTX 50-series in January. I wrote last week that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/653115/nvidia-gpu-drivers-black-screen-crashes-issues">Nvidia’s GPU drivers are a mess</a>, and just a week later we already have another hotfix that attempts to address the latest problems.</p><p>It’s a far cry from three years ago when Nvidia was proudly boasting of its driver quality, and mocking AMD for releasing beta drivers. “We don’t release sub-par beta drivers with minimal testing, let alone multiple conflicting beta drivers forked from different development branches that support different games and products, which confuse customers,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fgame-ready-driver-program-ultimate-gaming-platform%2F" rel="sponsored">said Nvidia</a> in April 2022.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Classic RPG remasters</a> drop from the shadows, surprise GOTY contenders <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">spring from the cracks</a>, but life goes on in the sleepy oxen-powered villages of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a>, the medieval <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> from Slavic Magic and Hooded Horse. Well, not entirely.</p>
<p>Change is afoot in oxen country, as detailed in a round-up of update plans for the game’s first birthday. What did you get for your first birthday? I think I got: the continued affection and/or tolerance of my parents, after a year of being puked and widdled on. Manor Lords is getting: an upkeep system, various visual or UI rejigs, and a boost for the AI’s capabilities that ranges from non-player town-planning to the navigation of fortresses.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Founded by Grzegorz "Greg" Styczeń, Slavic Magic have grown since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-publisher-reassures-players-struggling-to-buy-at-launch-that-well-run-those-25-discounts-often">the absurd success of the early access release</a>. “Since launch we’ve welcomed Nathan (map design), Tom and Kurtis from Flix Interactive (programming), Niklas (AI), Basia (2D art), Nicolas (3D art), and Darren and James (game design). We’re also still working with QLOC for QA needs — and more folks are helping behind the scenes, such as Daniel,” reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/573753783490708647?l=english">a merry Steam post</a>, before unleashing a horde of suheadings that “is not a full changelog or final list”, but “should give you a good idea of where development is headed.”  
</p>
<p>
Let’s get stuck in, then. As regards new buildings, they’re working on a quarry for “endless” stone mining on rich deposits, and a lime kiln that will be required for advanced construction. Planned visual changes include revamps for the UI and map resource nodes, and some overhauled castle pieces. But the juiciest bits appear to involve the AI, which can now build and run a small village, making use of concepts such as burgage plots, backyard and living space extensions that didn’t exist in the early access launch version. 
</p>
<p>
“A lot of work was done to make sure the AI could use the plot tool properly,” the devs add. “We're still working on improving its city planning skills and will soon start working on its trading capabilities and farming.” Letting the AI build villages has also obliged a new approach to the game’s marketplace, though the Steam post doesn’t go into detail.
</p>
<p>
The devs are also making changes to the Record View, with a new screen for regional production and consumption. They’ve tweaked the approval system so that recent events have more impact than older events. And they’re working on a contentious-sounding upkeep system, “which means a smithy will need a constant flow of tools, and deep mines need a flow of planks”. It’s terrible to see the concept of “flow” invading the hitherto stolid pasture lands of the Middle Ages, but I do find the thought of planks cascading down a mineshaft sort of poetic.
</p>
<p>
Continuing with the theme of flow, there’s a nice bit in the post that breaks down the appetisingly maddening challenge of having units pathfind through castles that have several floors. “The whole world in Manor Lords was always coded in 2D, which made collisions simpler to resolve and made the game more optimized,” Slavic Magic explain. “However, this meant we can't have "proper" gates where people stand on top and walk below at the same time (they'd collide with each other). 
</p>
<p>
“I decided to investigate this and rewrite the pathfinding to support multiple floors," the post goes on. "However, it's still being tested whether the extra computation cost is actually worth it (it's literally only for the gates, which in theory can be cheated by garrisoning in and out from the gatehouse doors).” Read the rest for a not very medieval, but undeniably cool development gif of militant rice grains struggling to escape a spiderweb of waypoints. 
</p>
<p>
Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-early-access-review">liked the original early access version of Manor Lords</a>, to the point that he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-did-a-medieval-peasants-raw-sour-breath-sound-like-manor-lords-composers-tell-us">interviewed the composers</a> and also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-followed-this-ox-around-in-manor-lords-for-a-day-to-see-what-wisdom-it-could-teach-me">stalked a cow for clicks</a>. Slavic Magic had planned to keep the game in early access for “around a year”, but it sounds like 1.0 is a ways off.

            <p>The Russian government has threatened to seize the assets of studios behind free-to-play tank battler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-tanks">World Of Tanks</a>, according to state media. Russia has accused the game companies' executives of "extremist activities" in relation to the war in Ukraine, although they provide no evidence in the legal action. The seizure casts a grim shadow over both Wargaming (the original developers of the game) and Lesta Games, a Moscow-based studio who were once owned by Wargaming and who took over the free-to-play game in Russian territories. It's Lesta Games who seem to be taking the brunt of the government hostility.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The assets of Lesta Games were subject to a "statement of claim" by Tagansky District Court of Moscow on April 17th, reports <a href="https://ria.ru/20250426/genprokuratura-2013563207.html">Russian media site RIA</a> (translated by Google). The prosecutor general names Lesta's executive Malik Khatazhaev as the target of the seizures, but also the owner of Wargaming, Viktor Kisly. Lesta have filed a complaint in return to challenge the decision.</p>
<p>"The company is working in full compliance with the legislation of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus," said the developer in a Telegram group, as <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/24/04/2025/680a30609a794772af778315">reported by RBC</a>. "So we have no grounds for any fears or concealment of information. We have not violated anything and we have nothing to fear."</p>
<p>To clear up any confusion, Wargaming are the original creators of the tank game - a studio that began life in Belarus but later grew to have studios across Europe, eventually heavily relocating their work to Cyprus. They bought the Russia-based studio Lesta Games in 2011. </p>
<p>Fast forward to April 2022. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Wargaming <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/world-of-tanks-studio-fires-creative-director-who-voiced-support-for-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/">fired a creative director</a> who supported Russia's aggression and later announced they were<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wargaming-are-closing-their-studios-in-belarus-and-russia"> cutting ties with their Russian and Belarussian studios</a> and would no longer do business there. World Of Tanks was still playable in those regions, though, and became managed by Lesta Games, who once again became a legally independent business. </p>
<p>None of that distancing and repositioning seems to convince the Russian government, however. CEO of Wargaming, Viktor Kisly remains named by the prosecutor general as part of an "association carrying out extremist activities" and is therefore a target of asset seizure. The prosecutor's claim attached headlines from the media reporting World Of Tanks events that showed support for Ukraine by raising money for ambulances (you can see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXF43c5rpCE">a trailer for that event here</a>).</p>
<p>"Wargaming made a strategic exit from the Russian and Belarusian markets three years ago," said Wargaming in <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/russia-moves-to-seize-world-of-tanks-developer-over-ukraine-support/">a response to VGC</a>. "The company disposed of its business in Russia and Belarus to the local management at zero cost and on a debt-free, cash-free basis, with no consideration to take it back. Wargaming doesn’t have any assets or business interests in Russia and Belarus."  </p>
<p>This isn't the first time Wargaming have been directly targeted by the Russian state for its sympathetic response to Ukraine. The company's chief business development officer was added to the country's terrorist watch list in 2023, as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/belarusian-kgb-adds-world-of-tanks-studio-boss-to-terrorist-list/">PC Gamer report</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The voice artist behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>'s Yennefer of Vengerberg has told Eurogamer that she doesn't know yet if her character will return in CD Projekt's in-development <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>.
</p>
<p>
Work on The Witcher 4 ramped up in earnest last November, following several years of pre-production. Now, over 400 staff at CD Projekt are assigned to the game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">though it won't launch until at least 2027</a>.
</p>
<p>
Still, we already know the basics - that The Witcher 4 is a continuation of CD Projekt's existing trilogy, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ciri-as-witcher-4-protagonist-really-really-interesting-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-says-geralt-voice-actor">Ciri will now be its protagonist</a>, and that hero <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">Geralt has already been locked in as reappearing in some form, still voiced by Doug Cockle</a>.
</p>
<p>
But what about Yen? After Geralt and Ciri, sorceress Yennefer is arguably the next most important. Her relationship with Geralt is featured in numerous Witcher stories, and the character is also a prominent part of Netflix's The Witcher TV series.
</p>
<p>
"I don't know any of this," claimed The Witcher 3's Yennefer, Denise Gough, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI_ObQcMOwv/?igsh=MWlrMWt3anFqZ21xbg==">when asked by my colleague Mat Jones</a> what she knew of CD Projekt's progress on The Witcher 4.
</p>
<p>
Gough - now starring in the Star Wars series Andor as Dedra Meero - went on to suggest she hadn't known what to expect when recording for The Witcher 3 years ago.
</p>
<p>
"I didn't know what I was doing," Gough continued. "I'd never done a video game before. And then lots of, usually men, would come up to me in sound departments on film sets, would come up and go [whispers] 'are you Yennefer?' And I was like 'who's Yennefer?'"
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">Eurogamer recently sat down with The Witcher 4's game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber</a> to try and tease some information about when the game will be set, and how much Geralt might appear.
</p>
<p>"Currently, he's having the best time of his life," Kalemba joked, when we asked whether Geralt would be back in action and playable at any point. "[He's] playing with some wine, and dealing with vineyards. This is where we left him last time. But obviously we can promise that Geralt will appear, but we cannot tell you if it's going to be playable or not right now. But yeah, he will appear. He's going to be present in The Witcher 4."</p>
<p>As for Netflix's TV adaptation, we just got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-peek-at-liam-hemsworths-geralt-on-set-in-the-witcher-season-5">first proper look at Liam Hemsworth in the role of Geralt</a> on set while filming its fifth season.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The A Minecraft Movie team is leaning in - or trying to counteract - the viral rowdy cinema  behaviour memes by introducing sing-along 'Block Party Edition' screenings.</p>
<p>These screenings will allow you to burst forth with your best Lava Chicken recital, while being backed up by a fellow chorus of Steves all there for the same thing. Or, you know, you can just yell out "Chicken Jockey" at the top of your lungs. The A Minecraft Movie lot wants you to "meme" along with the film.</p>
<p>In the words of Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures: "You know the moments. You know the lines. You love the songs! Now it’s time to get loose, laugh out loud and belt out those lyrics like a true diamond-tier fan."</p>

<p>If this sounds like your thing, you can book tickets for A Minecraft Movie: Block Party Edition now, with the screenings themselves happening on 2nd May. Not all cinemas are participating, though, so you will need to check your local listings.</p>
<p>If you aren't sure exactly what I am talking about when I write words like "Chicken Jockey" or "Lava Chicken", well then truth be told I am a little jealous. My children know all about these memes already, and will periodically just come out with them in the middle of supper/homework/the night and so on. They haven't even seen the film…</p>
<p>Anyway, Chicken Jockey refers to a moment in the film where Jason Momoa's Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison gets ready to fight a baby zombie riding on the back of a chicken. Jack Black's Steve then says "Chicken Jockey".</p>
<p>Now, that may not seem like much of A Moment to you or me, but a viral trend has seen some younger viewers of A Minecraft Movie going feral, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">screaming out loud mid-film while launching their popcorn into the air when those words are spoken</a>. In fact, things got so chaotic, cinemas and Jack Black himself popped up asking people to dial it back.</p>
<p>In a clip shared on social media earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">Black stood up in front of a cinema telling those present "absolutely no 'chicken jockey'"</a>.</p>
<p>"Lava Chicken", meanwhile, is a little ditty sung in the film by Black's Steve, about what happens when you add lava to a chicken in Minecraft (it cooks).</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Lava Chicken entered the UK's official music chart, becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">the shortest ever entry in the official UK top 40</a>. The song itself is only 34 seconds long, and you can listen along below. </p>

            <p>A few years ago I found an old hardback tome of Solitaire rulesets on a garden wall. It was a bright, unambiguously pleasant day and I remember thinking 'oh, that's the wotsit that inspired those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-genteel-verdict-regency-solitaire">regency thingamajigs</a>'. So I took it home and tried my hand at a few variations, then forgot about the book entirely. After reading about Occlude, I can only wish my discovery had been more ominous, more foreboding. Why couldn't I have found the book in a secret cellar, its hastily painted-over entrance given away by the motion of air through a dream-catcher? Why couldn't it have been thrust upon me by a desperate man with hypnotic tattoos, pushed into my hands with a precautionary mutter to 'Ware The Onyx Triangle?'</p>
<p>This is the ambience cultivated by Occlude, a "single-player cosmic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> card game for the terminally curious", in which Solitaire is the basis for seven rituals involving Tarot cards, which steadily unlock access to an archive of fragmentary lore. Here's a trailer.<!--more--></p>

<p>I did enjoy my initial experiments with Actual Cardboard Solitaire. I've already forgotten the rules I picked up from that book, but I remember the gentle buzz of unhurried meticulousness, the satisfaction of stacks forming before me, and the sense of fathomless arithmetic at play beneath the table surface. It sounds like Occlude will be a touch more... agitating, partly because it could be an inventory of your character's awful past. </p>
<p>"Have you ever done something you regret?" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3547010/Occlude/">the Steam page</a> asks. "What if I told you there was a way to fix it? Make it so that something never happened at all; or perhaps, just happened differently. What if I told you it was as simple as a game of solitaire?"</p>
<p>The developers are Tributary Games, creators of political sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-of-the-castle">King Of The Castle</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thousands-can-scheme-against-you-in-political-sim-king-of-the-castle">Kaan rather liked</a>. Occlude is "smaller and tighter than KOTC, but just as ambitious," the developers add in the announcement post. "It's Solitaire, yes, but much, much more. It's got puzzle mechanics, and a mind-bending narrative that's a puzzle in it's own right. It's a game that is one thing but also another."</p>
<p>I mean, I could say the same thing of my breakfast today - a peanut butter and jam sandwich. But I do respect the desire to take Solitaire and futz around with the workings via hearty injections of, in this case, "Lynchian horror".</p>
<p>There's no release date yet, but Tributary are running some kind of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3547010/view/505075100350939381?l=english">marketing conspiracy game</a> if you want to get an early taste of the setting. Me, I'm off to dig out that Solitaire rulebook in the hopes that there's, for example, a diagram of a strange and frightening constellation inside the dust jacket.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Japanese developer PlatinumGames went through a rough patch with the launch of Babylon's Fall. The game published by Square Enix was the studio's first attempt at a live service title and it failed spectacularly, to say the least.</p>
<p>Despite a potentially intriguing setting, the execution was severely lacking, leading to poor critic reviews and <a href="https://wccftech.com/babylons-fall-reaches-zero-concurrent-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely low player numbers</a>. Francesco De Meo opined that a lot of the problems <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-babylons-fall-truly-one-of-the-worst-games-ever-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to do with monetization</a>:</p>
<p><em>Where the monetization, Battle Passes, and GaaS features have impacted the game the most, in my opinion, is where it mattered the most in a PlatinumGames action title: combat mechanics. At the end of the main campaign, it becomes possible to change each weapon's attack mode to Power and Technical Mode, with the latter essentially making the game feel more in line with other, better games by PlatinumGames. Additional mechanics unlocked during the campaign itself, such as elemental attacks and properties and the Gideon Coffin mechanics, also make combat considerably more fun than at the start of the campaign. Later quests also feature a much better design, with different traps, light platforming, and more varied combat scenarios. Also, the endgame, although not much different in terms of game flow from the main campaign, is considerably more fun than the base campaign, and it is much easier to find players for stuff like Sieges and so on, better executing the multiplayer action game premise of the experience.</em></p>
<p><em>The problem is that it is clear that all these features and mechanics have been held back on purpose only to retain players and potentially make them buy future Battle Passes and premium currency. If the best-designed quests and advanced game mechanics would have been made available earlier, would the game have been received slightly better? I definitely think so. The game wouldn't have scored 7s or 8s all around, no question about it, but more reasonable 5s and 6s.</em></p>
<p>Babylon's Fall live servers <a href="https://wccftech.com/babylons-fall-service-to-end-on-february-27th-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went down for good</a> on February 27, 2023, less than a year after the game's launch. However, the Japanese developer still plans to work in the live service genre. As first <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/platinumgames-new-online-action-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted by TechGamers</a>, they are <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/platinumgames/jobs/1-01-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> a Game Designer whose desired skills must include 'Experience working on online action game development' and 'Experience in level design for online or open field games'. Of course, it is possible that the studio would use Babylon's Fall learnings to make a much better live service product this time. At this stage, it is unclear whether this will be self-published or not.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PlatinumGames is working with Team Ninja on the single player action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, which will be released later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-beautiful-chinese-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in September 2021. Chinese developer Leenzee Games is developing it with clear inspiration from the Soulslike genre. According to the studio, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-has-been-upgraded-to-unreal-engine-5-for-improved-quality-and-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently upgraded to Unreal Engine 5</a> to offer better visuals and performance.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from our recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDC 2025 hands-on preview</a> penned by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>The story overview that 505 Games presented for Wuchang: Fallen Feathers focuses on the player character of Wuchang, a skilled female pirate warrior. Truth be told, in the time I spent suffering against a particularly malicious pair of bosses, there wasn't a shred of story exposition save for an NPC or two off the beaten path. That's exactly the way I wanted to experience to go, with the story being told through dilapidated shrines and the pervasiveness of demonic influences slipping through the cracks rather than being given a lore dump and being told explicitly why the whole world is going to hell. While I'm sure there's going to be a solid explanation for the demonic powers affecting the titular Wuchang and whatever the hell 'feathering' is, I'll gladly wait for the full release to start piecing everything together myself.</em></p>

From a wide variety of manga to lore encyclopedias, these books make the perfect gift for the Zelda fanatic in your life. Or if you just wanted to spruce up your own bookshelf, we got you covered. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-april-2025">Amazon's April book sale</a> might be over, but many of these are still available at a discount for the foreseeable future and make for great gifts.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Legend of Zelda Manga</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Penned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Himekawa" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Akira Himekawa</a>, the Legend of Zelda manga span almost the entire history of the games, with major manga series based on many of the mainline titles like Ocarina of Time and the Minish Cap. These are great for people new to manga wanting to dip their toes in, or die-hard fans of the games looking for deeper world building. All of these stories are available individually, but if you're a collector, you can get some of them in various collected box sets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 11 volume Twilight Princess Manga has its own boxed set, which includes the complete story and a poster. Additionally, the Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past manga by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotaro_Ishinomori" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shotaro Ishinomori</a> is a great quick read that's also available. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Legend of Zelda Encyclopedias</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're in the mood for something a little more educational, the Legend of Zelda encyclopedias are the perfect place to get a deep dive into Hyrule's lore, culture, and different races. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/09/the-legend-of-zelda-hyrule-historia-review">The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia</a> originally released in 2013 and gave fans the first officially established timeline. If you're unfamiliar, for years fans have meticulously speculated about a branching timeline that began in Ocarina of Time — one branch where adult Link defeats Ganondorf and one where he doesn't. It's a pretty interesting bit of lore that explains some of the settings in later and past games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Zelda Encyclopedia and Art &amp; Artifacts offer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/02/20-fascinating-facts-from-the-legend-of-zelda-encyclopedia">even deeper looks at the universe</a>, and include detailed breakdowns of the different items, characters, and enemies, as well as exclusive interviews with developers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Creating a Champion is an over 400 page companion to the 2017 game.

Explore the depths of Shu, enhancing your arsenal and mastering new skills harvested from fallen foes.

Augment the weapons in your repertoire with powerful enchantments, allowing for a unique approach to combat and strategy that suits your personal style.</p><p>Battle against grotesque abominations, drawing on ancient lore to challenge the creeping darkness that threatens the humanity that remains.

Will you reveal the truths of Wuchang’s curse and bring peace to Shu, or will you succumb to the encroaching horrors?

The lawsuit was filed in California on behalf of an underage plaintiff referred to as as 'Jane Doe', and takes aim at both platforms for allegedly enabling an accused sexual predator to harass and exploit Doe during interactions on each.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It notably concerns not only how Discord and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s system allegedly allowed for this interaction to take place, but also explores the action the two companies could've take to prevent situations like the one at the center of this lawsuit from happening. Additionally, the suit challenges the two companies' messaging on user safety, implying they knowingly make promises they can't keep.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This case, filed on April 21, 2025, accuses the two companies of "facilitating the sexual exploitation" of the plaintiff as the direct result of lax safety standards and misrepresentation of safety protocols to parents. It follows years of investigations about the risks of child sexual abuse on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and details how the failings reported in those investigations may have contributed to the harm of the minor.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/journey-and-sky-dev-thatgamecompany-announces-game-jam-with-10-000-in-prizes" target="_self" data-discover="true">Journey developer thatgamecompany to co-host game jam with $10,000 prize pool</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/parents-sue-i-roblox-i-for-allegedly-hosting-child-grooming-sexual-content">Roblox has faced lawsuits</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> over child safety in the past, but this appears to be the first lawsuit that levies accusations on both Roblox and Discord. According to the lawsuit, Doe's parents became aware she was being sexually exploited by an individual described in the lawsuit as a "known predator" through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Discord in 2022. That individual allegedly targeted her through two games within the wider </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ecosystem, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mic Up</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Write A Letter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and was able to send her messages through the "whisper" function even though her Roblox account "clearly displayed" she was a minor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In time, the plaintiff was convinced to share her Discord username with the accused predator, leading to conversations on the popular chat platform where she was then coerced into sending sexually explicit images. These events took place over the course of six months.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the lawsuit, Doe's parents were aware of the safety tools and resources intended to keep minors safe on Roblox but allege that the materials fall short. The lawsuit accuses both companies of failing to implement strong safety procedures and, beyond that, of misrepresenting the safety of their platforms to parents in order to maximize revenue, specifically describing how the plaintiff's father reviewed the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Parent's Guide before letting her use the platform and allowing her to play online. Following the incident and after her father blocked her from accessing Discord and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the plaintiff reportedly attempted suicide.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/io-interactive-co-founder-launches-new-studio-unveils-first-project-for-summer-2025" target="_self" data-discover="true">IO Interactive co-founder launches new 'consensus'-driven studio</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Are ">Are <span>Roblox</span> and Discord as safe as they claim?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lawsuit filed against Roblox</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and Discord dedicates several pages to the claims both companies have previously made about safety on each of their platforms, going as far as to call out executives like Roblox Corporation CEO David Baszucki by name for statements made to the press.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Developer Larian Studios has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-bids-final-farewell-for-real-this-time">officially bid a fond farewell to Baldur's Gate 3</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-last-ever-major-update-gets-a-long-awaited-release-date">April's massive Update 8 patch</a>, and with the team now focusing on the future, company boss Swen Vincke has shared a little more on why it ultimately decided against releasing a paid DLC expansion for the acclaimed RPG, calling it the "boring" option.
</p>
<p>
Vincke <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-director-hasnt-completely-ruled-out-dlc">first addressed the idea of Baldur's Gate 3 DLC</a> all the way back in September 2023, around a month after the game had launched to a stellar critical and commercial reception. At the time, he said building on the base game would be "very hard" for the team, but "not undoable". But just five months later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">all fan hopes for DLC were dashed</a> when Vincke confirmed the studio was "gonna move on", meaning no DLC and no <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 4. "We are not a company that's made to create DLCs, expansions," he explained. "We tried that actually, a few times. We failed every time - it's not our thing. Life is too short. Our ambitions are very large."
</p>
<p>
And now, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9ss">new interview with Game Spot</a>, Vincke has turned to the topic of DLC once more. When asked why Larian had ultimately opted against creating DLC for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> despite it being such a massive success, he replied, "It's boring, is really the honest answer. We tried to be in the DLC business, talked about that with BG3... there's just no passion... I mean happy player, happy business, but you also need a happy developer for a happy player. What we're doing now makes developers way more happy."

"We heard it's what we were supposed to do, right? You've got a huge game, a huge hit, and you've gotta make DLC this and DLC that and DLC there... and money's gonna pile up all high! And we just nodded and said, 'Yeah we'll make DLCs'. And then the moment that we had some time to think, we realised, 'What are you doing?'. Progressive insight is not a bad thing, so sometimes you go down the wrong path and then say, 'Oh fuck it', and just change course."
</p>
<p>
As for what Larian is doing now Baldur's Gate 3 is mostly all wrapped up (minus any lingering bug fixes), that remains a mystery. All Vincke would say during his Game Spot interview is that the studio is now "deep in the trenches" of its "next big thing" - a "crazy ambitious" project that's "shaping up quite well". And, of course, it's not the only thing Larian is working on, with Vincke having previously confirmed preparation for a second project is also underway. This, he admitted, is "not the easiest thing in the universe, because we make very complicated games, lots of permutations, lots of agency for players."

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-says-next-game-may-come-in-2029/">Larian Studios</a> boss Swen Vincke shared some of his thoughts on generative AI technology in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9ss">GameSpot</a>. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-fears-that-50-years-from-now-generative-ai-tech-will-replace-game-creators/">other major creators</a> are concerned the technology could eventually replace humans, Vincke doesn't necessarily share that concern.</p>
<p>It's not that Vincke is entirely against using AI and even generative AI in development for Larian Studios. He understands that it could eventually make a developer's work go faster, but he stops short of saying that it would actually make developing a game take less time.</p>
<p>"<em>I think the naive thing is to think that it will shorten them [development times]. I think that it's an age old truth, if you give a developer two years, they're going to take three. The same thing will be the case here, with what you're going to give them in terms of abilities to do stuff . If they have the ability to do things faster, they'll just do more, which is actually what you want.</em>"</p>
<p>But when it comes to the question of humans being replaced by generative AI technology just generating whole sections of games or entire games even to ship, Vincke doesn't think that'll happen. Nor does he think it's advisable to operate in that way, where generative AI is doing everything for you.</p>
<p>"<em>I don't think you would have a competitive advantage if you do, because that is what's going to be available to everybody, right,</em>" Vincke said.</p>
<p>"<em>If the baseline goes up because generation is available to everybody, fine, that's a new reality that we're in. But you're still going to want to create something special on top of that. I think that's where teams like us will make a difference, we're a very boutique team. We're actually crafting the situations and the flow of the story by hand, it's a thing that we do.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>When we talk to people about it, this is always the discussion. 'Oh my god, our jobs are going to disappear,' and, no, but you're just going to work differently, potentially. But you're still going to be making a difference</em>."</p>

These showings will encourage fans to “get loose” and sing and cheer as much as they want. The “Block Party” screenings will take place on Friday. Here’s how WB described them: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Warner Bros.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> has introduced plenty of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-and-different-in-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/">new features and improvements</a> to the game, but some things--namely, Star Wars Easter eggs--have remained untouched.</p><p dir="ltr">When Oblivion was originally launched back in 2006, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith was still fresh in many players' minds, having been released the previous May. In fact, a reference to the fiery ending of the film's infamous "high ground" scene was featured in one of Oblivion's opening quests, and 19 years after the game's initial release, the "Anakin Easter egg" is featured in Oblivion Remastered as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4483834-thelowground.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483834" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4483834-thelowground.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483834"></a><figcaption>You underestimate my power!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4483834-thelowground.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Early on in Oblivion's main quest, players will be directed to Kvatch, a city in Cyrodiil that has come under attack. This is where players will encounter their first Oblivion Gate. Shortly after stepping through the flaming portal to the Plane of Oblivion and dispatching a few enemies, players will encounter an NPC named Ilend Vonius, who comes running up from the left side of the screen. If players head in that direction, they'll pass a large pool of lava which, upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYlF9KLIL4">closer inspection</a>, has a charred corpse lying on its stomach, one arm outstretched toward the player.</p><p dir="ltr">The corpse is burnt to a crisp and missing a few limbs--an obvious reference to the state Anakin Skywalker is left in after losing a lightsaber battle against former friend Obi-Wan Kenobi on the volcanic planet of Mustafar at the end of Episode III. Though the corpse in the Plane of Oblivion clearly didn't make it, Anakin technically survives his encounter with Obi-Wan, but the duel effectively marks the death of Anakin Skywalker and the birth of Darth Vader.</p><p dir="ltr">Revenge of the Sith is <a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1916514570341859548" rel="nofollow ">celebrating its 20th anniversary this year with a theatrical re-release</a>, so it's not too surprising that Oblivion Remastered kept this iconic Easter egg in place and gave it a fresh coat of paint just in time for the infamous duel's 20th anniversary.</p><p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is currently available for Xbox Series X|S and PC.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grace-did-nothing-wrong.1175865/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/grace-sinners<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend, I did my part, joining the legion of theatergoers to see Ryan Coogler's period piece vampire film, <em>Sinners</em>, starring Michael B. Jordan. The film rips: I laughed, I went "Oh shit!" a bunch, and I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shineyezehuhh.bsky.social/post/3lnqlzo2vts2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wept when the credits rolled</a>. In the wake of seeing the film and seriously contemplating seeing it again, I finally peeked at some of the online chatter that <a href="https://x.com/tenstrife/status/1916568111714599378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I'd been avoiding</a> so that I could go into the film with as fresh eyes as an entertainment blogger who has watched its trailers could.&nbsp;</p><p>Given <em>Sinners</em>’ <a href="https://gizmodo.com/sinners-continues-to-take-a-bite-out-of-the-box-office-2000595288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive box office success</a>, it has unsurprisingly become a prime target for highfalutin discourse. Key among this is reductive interpretations, such as framing its message as "<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/invited-to-the-cookout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don't invite white people to the cookout</a>" or heralding religion as the cast's ultimate salvation, both of which fall short of encapsulating the film's essence and depth. However, one interpretation centering on a pivotal decision by an Asian character named Grace has veered into gross, toxic territory about the nature of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/02/983925014/the-history-of-solidarity-between-asian-and-black-americans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solidarity between Black and Asian Americans</a>. What began as lighthearted memes dragging Grace's choice like <a href="https://screenrant.com/avengers-infinity-war-star-lord-worst-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star-Lord's infamous moment in<em> Avengers: Infinity War</em></a> has spiraled into some assuming the role of armchair sociologists to argue her actions reflect transactional and insincere allyship between Black and Asian folks.</p><p>Frankly, the Grace discourse has gotten so out of hand that I feel compelled to tap into my inner <a href="https://youtu.be/49blWCj47AQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">F.D. Signifier</a> and weigh in on how I think these interpretations of the film's East Asian character are reductive and undermine <a href="https://gizmodo.com/in-sinners-honesty-leads-to-freedom-2000591961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the whole point of the film</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Spoilers for the movie you should watch.&nbsp;</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Sinners | Official Trailer 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7joulECTx_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Grace (Li Jun Li) and her husband, Bo Chow (Yao), are an Asian couple who not only share a deep friendship with Michael B. Jordan's Smoke and Stack but also represent the often <a href="https://nextshark.com/sinners-chinese-immigrants-mississippi-delta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under-acknowledged East Asian immigrant community in the Jim Crow-era Mississippi Delta</a>. As local apothecaries, they play a crucial role in supporting their community and are instrumental in helping bring the film's <a href="https://www.timeout.com/chicago/things-to-do/a-brief-history-of-chicago-juke-music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Juke party</a> to life. However, the merriment takes a dark turn when vampires, led by their Irish figurehead, Remmick (Jack O'Connell), surround the shed and start picking folks off one by one. In <em>Sinners</em>, vampires adhere to familiar lore, requiring an invitation to enter homes. However, a unique twist to their transformation is that they become part of a hive mind, with their spirits bound and unable to reach the afterlife unless pierced by a wooden stake. Amid the chaos, Grace asks Bo to retrieve their car so they can return home to their daughter, but tragedy strikes when he is also turned into a vampire.&nbsp;</p><p>As the story moves into the latter half of the second act, the main cast finds themselves in a drawn-out standoff with Remmick's growing vampiric horde. The horde even manipulates their collective consciousness to provoke or tempt the group into inviting them in and embracing eternal life with them. Matters reach a boiling point when Remmick, exploiting Grace's native tongue, gets gross about Grace and Bo's sex life and threatens their daughter. Understandably fed up, Grace bites Stack, whose hand muffles her mouth to keep her from screaming, and invites the vampires in, triggering the film's climactic showdown.&nbsp;</p><p>Many have taken to chirping on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bsolz_/video/7495464264832994603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://x.com/MajestyRia/status/1915496607296160223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, labeling Grace as the film's "<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Crash%20Out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crashout</a>" — yet another piece of Black slang that has increasingly become detached from its original meaning. Others have gone even further, branding Grace as bad optics for Black and Asian solidarity, calling her stupid, selfish, and the most irritating character in the movie. They argue she was never really down with the cause and abandoned her allyship the moment her proximity to whiteness threatened her family's peace, leaving Black folks in a lurch.&nbsp;</p><p>But Grace isn't a mom who acted out of selfishness; she's entirely in the right. Framing her decision as endemic to an "us vs. them" narrative between Asian and Black communities, where she and Bo were supposedly driven solely by profit margins to join the juke party and inevitably betray the group, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marmaryeesa2022/video/7495473894933941547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completely misses the point of the scene</a>. The group was already hesitating over their next move, with the alternative of holding out only leading to Remmick's horde growing stronger, taking over the rest of the town, and leaving them no safe haven. Even if they somehow enlisted the vampire-hunting <a href="https://x.com/bontmercy/status/1915226198231142887" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Choctaw Native American tribe</a> in some hypothetical <a href="https://kotaku.com/ryan-coogler-sinners-spinoff-sequel-theories-1851778090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MCU-styled expanded universe spinoffs</a> (please, no), the odds were stacked against them. <em>Sinners</em> had been building towards this moment, where the juke party inciting a last stand was the best bet to eliminate as many vampires as possible and prevent the threat from escalating further. Why get caught up in the bureaucracy of dealing with vampires when you can nip it in the bud?&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Yes, Sinners is THAT Good" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_l1_sErlPZ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Grace's decision also led to the most metal and heartbreakingly romantic scene in the film — her stabbing Bo in the chest as the two immolate together. It was a tragic end to them, but one that promised she'd reunite with her fine-as-hell husband in the afterlife. Her decision was essential, jolting everyone out of their stalemate and to squabble up; anyone saying otherwise is wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>The rhetoric framing Grace's pivotal decision as emblematic of anti-Black and Asian solidarity is not only gross but also entirely at odds with the film's overarching theme. <em>Sinner</em>s emphasizes how music connects us to our ancestry and builds bonds between folks within America's cultural melting pot. Grace's choice wasn't an act of betrayal — it was the most practical and necessary option given their dire circumstances. Twisting her decision into a narrative about false allyship drowns out the nuanced discussions this film genuinely deserves.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-xbox-microsoft-oblivion-bds"><h3>Big Sales Don’t Mean A Boycott Has Failed</h3></a><p>"You are creating the world you want to live in with very small actions, and that does build out"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ice-water-games-tenderfoot-tactics-xbox-store-removed-bds"><h3>Indie Dev Who Pulled Game From Xbox In Solidarity With Palestinian-Led BDS Hopes Others Will Do The Same</h3></a><p>"It's important to be able to use that limited amount of power to put whatever pressure we can on things"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/fallout-factions-battle-for-nuka-world-starter-set-review-rolling-dice-for<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While no stranger to the wargaming space, Bethesda and Modiphius have teamed up to create a smaller scale <em>Fallout </em>skirmish game; <em>Fallout Factions</em>. The <em>Fallout Factions: Nuka-World starter kit</em> contains everything you need to get together with a friend and take to the wasteland in a <em>Fallout</em>-skinned wargame.</p>

<p><em>Fallout Factions</em> is a skirmish game where two players will sit down across a battle map, place terrain, and battle it out with their custom armies. If you're someone familiar with wargaming and free movement skirmish games chances are you'll settle right in with <em>Fallout Factions</em>, but for someone who is new to the space this Starter Kit might be just what you need to get a foothold in the world.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of legacy games there's also something here for you with chances to upgrade your parties between battles, perfect if you have someone who wants to take you on in a rematch!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-factions-nuka-world-in-the-box.jpg?itok=Zn14-HvR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-factions-nuka-world-in-the-box.jpg?itok=Zcdc8rlJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Press X To Collect Everything In The Box</h2>

<p>To start off let's cover what's in the box.</p>

<p>Inside the <em>Fallout Factions: Nuka-World Starter Set</em> you'll find:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">A 70+ page rulebook (don't let that scare you)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">A large battle map (double-sided with a Nuka Cola pinup on the other side)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Twelve d10 – eight in the standard red color and four in Nuka Cola Quantum blue – for stat and attack rolls</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Crew Roster cards</li>
	<li aria-level="1">A small measuring tape</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Tokens for tracking character statuses and game features</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Buildable terrain elements</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Enough mini pieces to build two custom armies; one for the Pack faction and another for the Operators.</li>
</ul><p>I'll admit, when I saw just how many mini pieces there were, and understood how modular they could al be I was a little bit taken aback, but working my way through the rulebook it came to be much simpler than expected.</p>

<p>The rulebook starts by introducing players to the gameplay elements, starting with the basics like movement and combat, before introducing you to elements like teambuilding and gameplay scenarios, before providing you with a massive appendix of the factions of <em>Fallout Factions</em>, their ploys (perks), and weapons.</p>

<p>As a more visual learner I did have a bit of issues understanding how each of the games elements interacted with one another, often having to flip back and forth to make sure I understood how different elements interacted with one another. Finding a quick gameplay demo video ended up helping me understand the different elements far easier.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-factions-nuka-world-mini-building.jpg?itok=wu8KB_r5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-factions-nuka-world-mini-building.jpg?itok=QtewseaN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Building Your Team</h2>

<p>With enough pieces to create a team of The Pack minis and a team of The Operators you'll be able to start playing with a friend, but there is some assembly required. Each of the teams can be made up of a variety of permutations – how many captains and grunts make up the team, as well as what loadouts they have contributing towards a max team score of 250.</p>

<p>Instead of providing you with a ready to play team and team roster you're able to create the team yourself, and assemble the minis so they even have the correct weapons on display. For those who are already established in the game, and understand how to balance a team this is a great option, but for a new player that's a lot to put on them, especially when glueing the minis together is relatively permanent.</p>

<p>I was almost hesitant to put together the miniatures provided, instead opting to use proxies in case the team I built was horrible and I didn't want to be stuck with them. Alternatively, for someone with more confidence in their teambuilding abilities I'm sure they'd happily welcome the ability to literally build their own personalized army.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-factions-nuka-world-sniping.jpg?itok=9eOdZx79 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-factions-nuka-world-sniping.jpg?itok=K79OEFRD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Needing to build your own army also means there's a higher barrier to entry for starting the two player game as your friend also needs to pick their roster and assemble their fighters.</p>

<p>Once you've gone through the process of creating your teams you'll be able to pick a scenario, place your minis, and get started.</p>

<h2>Take Your Initiative Token</h2>

<p>With that setup behind you it's ready to start the game. Each Scenario is played out over a number of Rounds (normally three to five), these rounds consist of each player taking turns picking one of their models, and making actions until that fighter can't take any more, this is called being Exhausted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alternatively, a player might opt to end their turns before all of their fighters are Exhausted, this has the added benefit of letting you start first next round.</p>

<p>The actions that a character can make are fairly simple, if they're not within a melee distance of an enemy (unengaged) they can move, fire with a ranged weapon, or take an action to heal themselves. If they are within melee distance to another they can back off, becoming unengaged, or choose to Brawl with their Melee Attack.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-factions-nuka-world-melee-combat.jpg?itok=fuH_AWaZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-factions-nuka-world-melee-combat.jpg?itok=VzsRb0sW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For the most part the early game will have players picking a model, moving them to a good vantage point (making the model weary) and then having them attack an opponent (exhausting them).</p>

<p>There's a lot of strategy that comes from what each of your fighters can do, what order in the turn you choose to move them, and what their stats are. Do you want to put a heavy hitter in your opponents sights hoping you'll get them before they get you, or do you want to protect your own and bring them out as a trump card?</p>

<p>The game only lasts three rounds so it's important to get out there, do some damage, and work your objective.</p>

<h2>Combat In The Wastelands</h2>

<p>Each instance of combat is a roll off. For the fighter it's a bit complicated at first, you'll be comparing the Test stat of each weapon, that comprises of a number and the letter P for Perception or A for Agility. Then you roll the number of dice to your characters P or A stat, trying to get a number higher than the test.</p>

<p>A weapon might say 4A for it's test, and with an Agility stat of 3 you'll roll three of the D10 trying to get a 4 or above. For each that you roll above the test value it counts as a hit.</p>

<p>You then compare your hits against the Endurance of who you're trying to hit, for every point above their Endurance they'll take a point of damage.</p>

<p>While it might sound complicated it really just boils down to: "How much bigger is my number than yours"</p>

<h2>Scenarios</h2>

<p>The Scenarios that you pick to play will tell you not only where you'll be starting each faction, but also what objective you'll be competing over. Because of its shorter format, you won't have time to wipe out your entire opponent's faction, but you will need to hold an objective or complete some other kind of 'goal' that will give you a clear goal while you also try to stay alive.</p>

<p>On top of Scenarios where you'll need to claim an objective there's also Scenarios where one team will be defending the location of an objective, that one side will need to transport something across enemy lines, that they need to push into and claim enemy territory, and&nbsp;</p>

<p>Completing Scenarios will also grant the bonus of allowing you to level up your faction and grow their stories. This might be the chance to get new items that will influence the gameplay or to upgrade your fighters with perks.</p>

Even in the scope of this starter set the faction that you begin playing with can evolve over the course of a few battles.</p>

<h2><em>Fallout Factions Nuka-World</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Once I got to playing <em>Fallout Factions,</em> I was having a great time. Easy to understand turn orders and action economy, the most difficult thing to learn was the setup and rules.There's a nice level of customizability in the factions as you build them, but that can be a bit daunting if you're totally new.</p>

<p>For your first game, possibly before even putting together your minis I'd recommend checking out the <em>Fallout: Factions</em> - 'Welcome to Nuka-World' Quickstart Guide from Modiphius. It does a really good job of introducing you to a small round of gameplay, smaller faction, and teaches you through doing as opposed to teaching you the rules as they build upon themselves.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of <em>Fallout </em>and Skirmish games I can see this being a great entry point to a new world. If you've never picked up a Skirmish game before though the box as is might be a bit tough.</p>
