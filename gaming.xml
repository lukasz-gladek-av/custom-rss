		<p>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; The White Guardian has been announced by GUST and Koei Tecmo as the new game in the Atelier series. There is very little information outside of the name and the reveal trailer, except that the game is set in the land of Lantarna, and that it will feature new protagonists for the series. You can see the protagonists and some of the game world in the reveal trailer.</p>

<p>This is the second Atelier game in a month that has been announced by GUST and Koei Tecmo, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/27/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-revealed/">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</a> was announced back in August, also for a 2025 release. However Atelier Yumia is targeting an early 2025 release, while Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; The White Guardian is likely to release afterwards.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/12/atelier-marie-remake-the-alchemist-of-salburg-review/">Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg Review</a></h2>
<p>The last Atelier game we reviewed was Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg, and in that review Miguel said,<em>&nbsp;“Atelier Marie Remake is simultaneously a return to form and a fresh step forward for the Atelier series. It’s incredible to experience the roots of this series, and as sad as I am about the barebones storytelling, the shifted focus to time-management and calendar events gives the game an addictive farm-simulator vibe that kept me glued to it for hours. I’m excited to see how ideas from this remake come forward to inspire whatever this series has in store for us next.”</em></p>

<p>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; The White Guardian is expected to be released for PS5, PS4, Switch, and PC via Steam. Unlike Atelier Yumia, it does not appear that this will release will be coming to Xbox consoles.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fntastic-new-game-asset-flip-dataminers/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fntastic%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98honest-new-game%E2%80%99-discovered-to-be-an-asset-flip-by-dataminers.994656/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fntastic-new-game-asset-flip-dataminers/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Less than 24 hours ago, Fntastic announced a grand return to game development with a ‘2.0’ rebrand and a new game called Escape Factory. Last year, the shady and deceptive developer released The Day Before, a rug-pull of a game that was taken offline days later, leaving thousands of players stunned and seeking refunds.</p>



<p>To accompany the return, the team at Fntastic put together a Kickstarter campaign to fund the development of new games and to get the studio back on its feet. It has gone down with the community as well as a cup of cold sick, and as the company attempts to distance itself from those speaking out against them, dataminers have made shocking (but expected) revelations.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-round-2">Round 2</h2>



<p>On social media, dataminers dug into Escape Factory, the free-to-play game assembled by Fntastic ‘2.0’. In particular, <a href="https://x.com/bsimser/status/1839703934925165023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one user named ‘Occular Malice’</a> found that the game’s networking, lobby, and matchmaking mechanics are all examples of ‘Unity demo code’ that’s typically used by those learning to develop games.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the majority of the game’s codebase is made up of assets simply ‘flipped’ from the Unity store, many of which are free to use.</p>



<p>If that wasn’t bad enough, Fntastic has been removing comments on the Steam forum talking about this ‘deception’. The team has also been actively blocking anyone on social media speaking negatively or critically about the game and the rebrand. </p>



<p>When we reported the news regarding Fntastic’s attempt to resurface around 18 hours ago, the Kickstarter campaign had reached just £154 out of a goal of £11,646. It’s now sitting on £370 with 23 backers – and speaking frankly, anyone deciding to back this campaign will have nobody to blame but themselves when it inevitably goes belly-up.</p>



<p>Despite claims of honesty, transparency, and professionalism, <strong>nothing in the world </strong>will make gamers trust Fntastic ever again, and it’s laughable that they’re even trying to make a comeback.</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on this fiasco? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
Following last week's shock announcement Nintendo is suing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> maker Pocketpair for the infringement of "multiple patents rights", an IP expert has claimed it's "exceedingly plausible" Nintendo crafted its patent applications specifically to target Palworld.
</p>
<p>
Writing for <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendos-patents-were-designed-to-take-on-palworld">Gamesindustry.biz</a>, Andrew Velzen - an associate at law firm MBHB - started by summarising some of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent">intellectual property discoveries</a> legal experts have made so far since word of Nintendo's lawsuit surfaced last week, starting with four key patent applications highlighted by Japanese attorney Kiyoshi Kurihara. 
</p>
<p>
These patent claims, explains Velzen, all relate to different aspects of catching and/or riding "combat characters, "airborne rideable characters", and "field characters" using "player characters." Notably, all four patent applications were filed onto pre-existing "parent" patents by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company <em>after</em> the release of Palworld, and have ben accelerated to issuance using Japanese expedited examination procedures.

<p>
However, Velzen notes Nintendo didn't stop there. The company also filed two similar patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in May 2024, again after the release of Palworld, and several months after The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-says-it-will-investigate-and-take-appropriate-measures-following-claims-palworld-copied-designs">announced</a> it would be investigating whether Palworld infringes on any "intellectual property rights related to Pokémon".
</p>
<p>
One of these US patent applications (US-App-3) relates to the in-game activity of throwing either a "catching item" or "fighting character" in a virtual space, while the other (US-App-4) focuses on boarding an object - selected from several objects the player characters owns - in order to provide instructions causing it to move, with specific mention of this happening while airborne. As with its Japanese patent claims, Nintendo paid to have the examination of its patent claims substantially expedited.
</p>
<p>
"Based on this information," Velzen says, "it is not overly speculative to assume Nintendo filed [its US patent applications] with the intention of targeting Palworld." He adds it's also "exceedingly plausible that these claims were crafted to read on aspects of Palworld."
</p>
<p>
While Nintendo's lawsuit is only targeting Japan at present, Velzen notes it's of interest that the company's US patent claims have both been been rejected during the expediated examination process - US-App-3 "only for lacking subject matter eligibility" and US-App-4 for "obviousness". Nintendo still has until October to amend its claims and/or argue against the rejections to try and get its applications across the finish line.
</p>
<p>
"If (i) Nintendo's litigation proceeds reasonably successfully in Japan and no global settlement is reached and (ii) the claims in the patent applications above do not require substantial modification in order to arrive at allowance, Nintendo will undoubtedly have the opportunity to file a similar suit for patent infringement in the US," Velzen explains, before adding "These are, admittedly, two pretty substantial 'ifs'."
</p>
<p>
"Regardless, though," he continues, "I think we are seeing just how seriously Nintendo views the threat of Palworld."
</p>
<p>
In a statement last week, Palworld developer Pocketpair confirmed it had received notice of Nintendo's legal action, but said it was "unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon". It has, however, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">vowed to fight Nintendo's lawsuit</a>, to ensure small studios are "not hindered or discouraged from pursuing creative ideas".
</p>
<p>
The developer also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation">released Palworld for PS5</a> across 68 countries and regions this week, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworlds-ps5-console-release-on-hold-in-japan">Japan wasn't one of them</a>, leading many to assume Nintendo's lawsuit is to blame.

            <p>I must confess, it was not till this very hour that I envisaged the possibility of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> party consisting exclusively of clowns. There's a fine tradition of clown characters in RPGs - Sylvando from Dragon Quest XI, Harle from Chrono Cross, the Jester in Darkest Dungeon - but a whole party's worth? The full big top? The maximum cabaret? Madness! Delightful madness! Here's the trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clowned-king">Clowned King</a>, the next game from Moonana, developer of the colourful and melodious <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/keylocker-preview-bitsummit-turn-based-rhythm-rpg-cyberpunk">Keylocker</a>. I like it better than a custard pie full of razorblades. I like most things better than a custard pie full of razorblades, but this comes reasonably high up that list.</p><!--more-->

<p>Clowned King is a turn-based tactics-me-do set in the Moonlit Kingdom, a world of tinted glass and, from the looks of things, pugnacious brocolli. You are Matheus, a disgraced harlequin prince who "conceals his bloody past behind a mask of laughter", and you're on a mission to recruit some badass buffoons so that you can do a darkside Heath Ledger on your villainous father, the Mad King Marduk.</p>
<p>The game's battle system takes inspiration from "Disgaea, Fire Emblem and Brazilian culture", according to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3195150/Clowned_King/">Steam page</a>, and puts the spotlight on formations, which unlock special abilities. I wonder if the appropriate word here isn't "formation" but stagecraft? If this game doesn't make every last feature an expression of clown culture, it'll be a sorry waste of a premise, to say nothing of a solid 7/10 title pun.</p>
<p>We can also expect "an immense amount of mage class types", which feels apposite -  when clowns spec for melee, it tends to be because they're horror movie clowns, who favour axes over hand buzzers. RPG clowns are more of a bard variant, I guess. Combat aside, you'll be "[bonding] with leaders from opposing realms to help support your fight against the Mad King". Ah yes, clown politicking, so unlike the regular kind.</p>
<p>Clowned King is out... at some stage.  While you wait, why not sample precision platformer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-precision-platformer-clown-meat-you-have-to-cheer-up-a-godzilla-sized-clown-from-jupiter">Clown Meat</a>, in which you have to cheer up a jester of planetary scale and misery, who spawned within Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Or how about the classic point-and-clicker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dropsy">Dropsy</a>, in which the title character just wants a hug. Come to think of it, we're probably overdue a clown game in which the clown <em>isn't</em> an emblem or metaphor for sorrow and insanity. If you know of one, I'd love to hear about it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He added that it could come out or it could get cancelled. “This felt like such an interesting and useful nugget to include because it really just shows you that Blizzard cannot quit <em>StarCraft </em>shooters,” he said.<br></p><p>Previous attempts by Blizzard to make one a reality included <em>StarCraft: Ghost</em>, a third-person shooter about a Terran psychic espionage operative set after <em>StarCraft: Brood War</em>. It was announced in 2002 only to get indefinitely delayed once the Xbox 360 and PS3 generation arrived, eventually being officially cancelled a decade after its initial tease. </p><p>Then there was another project, codenamed “Ares.” According to Schreier’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sources-blizzard-cancels-starcraft-first-person-shoote-1835285125?_gl=1*t5msgm*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzQ1MTk5NS4xMDIuMS4xNzI3NDUzNDMwLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sources-blizzard-cancels-starcraft-first-person-shoote-1835285125?_gl=1*t5msgm*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzQ1MTk5NS4xMDIuMS4xNzI3NDUzNDMwLjYwLjAuMA..">report for <em>Kotaku</em> in 2019</a></span>, it was supposed to be a first-person shooter like “<em>Battlefield</em> in the <em>StarCraft</em> universe,” but it was eventually canned so Blizzard could focus exclusively on getting<em> Diablo IV </em>and <em>Overwatch 2 </em>out the door, which ended up taking another three or four years.</p><p>Third time’s the charm? Hay, who was the head of the <em>Far Cry</em> franchise before leaving Ubisoft and joining Blizzard in 2022, was previously heading up Blizzard’s survival crafting game project <em>Odyssey</em> before that got cancelled as well earlier this year amid <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192">a brutal round of Microsoft cuts</a></span>. Maybe Hay’s leadership, combined with Blizzard being part of Xbox now, will help this newest incarnation of a<em> StarCraft </em>shooter succeed where others failed. </p><p>It’s certainly easy to imagine it scratching a similar itch to Saber Interactive’s recent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-patch-3-0-chaos-arena-1851659411&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-patch-3-0-chaos-arena-1851659411"><em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em></a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-new-multiplayer-game-deadlock-lets-you-turn-cheaters-into-a-frog<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Valve has updated its new multiplayer game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> to let players turn cheaters into a frog.</p><p>Deadlock is a hero shooter that’s like a mash-up of all Valve’s previous games, including Team Fortress 2, Dota 2, and Counter-Strike. It’s in early development, with Valve updating all the time, which leads us to this week’s changes.</p><p>This week’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/deadlock/Deadlock_Patch_Notes_September_26/27:_New_Hero,_Map_Changes,_and_More">Deadlock patch</a> added a novel anti-cheat measure: turning a cheater into an in-game frog. If you spot a cheater in-game, you can either ban them then and there or transform them into a frog for the rest of the match.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/20367-5afd920938a15b06c92dbacbd525b980-1727450684828.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ban or frog? The choice is yours. Image credit: Valve.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Here’s the note in the patch notes:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added an initial Anti-Cheat detection system. When a user is detected as cheating, during the game session the opponents will be given a choice between banning the user immediately and ending the match or turning the cheater into a frog for the rest of the game and then banning them afterwards. The system is set to conservative detection levels as we work on a v2 anti-cheat system that is more extensive. We will turn on the banning of users in a couple of days after the update is out. When a match is ended this way, the results will not count for other players.</li></ul><p>And here’s how it looks:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Guys do you ever get this weird glitch in deadlock <a href="https://t.co/KxFqBJBg39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KxFqBJBg39</a></p>— Poggu (@poggu__) <a href="https://twitter.com/poggu__/status/1839438568110031076?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>According to ex-Counter-Strike developer Burton Johnsey, Valve built a system just like this for its legendary multiplayer shooter, codenamed 'FU Surprise Mode,' but it turned cheaters into a chicken. Unfortunately it was never released.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Holy crap, they finally built codename “FU Surprise Mode”?! </p><p>When I worked on VAC, Rich and I designed this for CS but the cheater was a chicken. <a href="https://t.co/Q6BKGTCZwj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Q6BKGTCZwj</a></p></div>— BurtonJ (@sptonjohn) <a href="https://twitter.com/sptonjohn/status/1839477885582905651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 27, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Deadlock isn’t properly released yet (it’s still invite only) but it’s already a big hit on Steam, where it’s usually in the top 10 most-played games. At the time of this article’s publication, Deadlock had an impressive 118,697 concurrent players on Valve’s platform.</p><p>This week’s patch introduced a new Deadlock hero called Mirage, and made several map, hero, and item changes. Valve has yet to announce a release date.</p><p><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://x.com/poggu__/status/1839438568110031076" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>@poggu__</em></a></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 11 Essential Tips For Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">During the final moments of Space Marine 2's campaign, Lieutenant Titus and his squad find themselves battling against the force of Chaos in the Immaterium. It's in the game's final cutscene that we see Titus reach out to destroy a Chaos artifact, nearly overwhelmed by the forces of the Warp. As he struggles, a voice (one that prior to Space Marine 2's patch 3.0 was attributed to Ultramarines Chapter Master Marneus Calgar) tells Titus "Rise, son of Gulliman." Titus then overcomes the Chaos energy and destroys the artifact.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, however, that voice is no longer attributed to Calgar. As the <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/90-space-marine-2-patch-3-0-26-09-24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> read, the update "fixed an unidentified voice at the end of the story that was assigned to the wrong character." With no new name assigned to the voice, fans are now speculating that the one telling Titus to "rise" may be none other than the Emperor of Mankind himself, using his psychic powers to speak to Titus directly from across the universe.</p><p dir="ltr">That would be a pretty huge revelation, largely because the Emperor, who has been on the verge of death and strapped to his Golden Throne (aka life support system) for 10,000 years, doesn't play much of a direct role in the Warhammer 40K universe. Fans now think Big E (as fans call him) may be in some way responsible for Titus's resistance to the Warp not only in Space Marine 2 but in the original Space Marine game as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The owner of the franchise, Games Workshop, isn't likely to confirm one way or the other. Space Marine 2 creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick in a <a href="https://x.com/MocapVeteran/status/1835234473882894538" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reply on X</a> did say the line "could be from the Emperor, but it's meant to be open to interpretation.</p><p dir="ltr">"It could be in Titus's mind, could be Calgar, or it could be the Emperor (though GW might disagree on that)," Hollis-Leick said. "I know who I meant it to be when I wrote it but I'll keep that to myself ;)."</p><p dir="ltr">Saber is currently "catching its breath" after the release of Space Marine 2, which has sold more than 2 million copies, but is already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2-dev-on-why-the-games-massive-success-is-dangerous/1100-6526626/" data-ref-id="1100-6526626">formulating plans for potential story DLC or a Space Marine 3</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/1900-6418276/" data-ref-id="1900-6418276">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 review</a>, we called Saber's sequel a "worthy successor to the original" that brings Games Workshop's universe to life "in all its grimdark splendor."</p>

                <p>Capcom is no stranger to ultra-expensive promotional merchandise for its games, and in its latest move, the publisher has joined forces with Fender to create a very flashy guitar.

The guitar was designed to evoke the "magestic presence" of Rathalos, both on the body and on the rosewood fretboard. It also comes with a (faux) tortoiseshell pickguard, even as we all continue to argue about whether dinosaurs were more like reptiles or birds. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375022-monsterhunterfender.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375022" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2400" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375022-monsterhunterfender.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375022"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375022-monsterhunterfender.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375023-mhfender1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375024-mhfender2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375025-mhfender3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375023,1300-4375024,1300-4375025" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15971423/4375023-mhfender1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15971423/4375024-mhfender2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15971423/4375025-mhfender3.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375023-mhfender1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375024-mhfender2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375025-mhfender3.jpg"></figure><p>The guitar's other features are mostly in line with a Fender Telecaster Custom. These include a humbucker in the neck position and a single-coil pickup in the bridge. The nut is also made of bone, though we're guessing it's not made from a monster you can hunt in the video game. The neckplate features a commemorative 20th-anniversary logo, and just like the games, the guitar is made in Japan. This is a rarity among Fenders, which are typically made in either California or Mexico. </p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds arrives on February 28, 2025 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. Seeing as Monster Hunter World was one of Capcom's biggest hits ever, expectations are certainly high. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-informer-gamestop-stores<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Video games retailer GameStop <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-has-been-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abruptly shuttered its magazine Game Informer</a> in August, <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nuking the site’s archives</a> in the process. Its staff was scattered to the winds, but now we know where some of their stuff ended up: in a GameStop at the Mall of America.</p><p>In a new video by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/minnmax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MinnMax</a>, a company that arose from previous Game Informer layoffs, a day exploring Minnesota’s giant mall takes a weird turn when Ben Hanson and Sarah Podzorski recognize a familiar Dark Souls statue in the window of a GameStop, which Hanson says “suddenly appeared here after Game Informer’s office was shut down.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Fashion Montage - Sarah Fixes Ben's Wardrobe" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FFgL4fmnXg4?start=3508&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>When they go into the store to ask about the statue, a GameStop worker tells Hanson that GameStop "brought all the statues and stuff to stores that could do high numbers” around Minnesota. The worker says GameStop managers “walked through” the Game Informer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3iM0PWqlK0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">office</a>, which also included a ton of unopened games that GameStop managers could take. The worker says that another Minnesota store, in Maplewood, also got some statues.&nbsp;</p><p>The worker says other Game Informer stuff was “sent back to the museum,” which seems to be a reference to the <a href="https://nvmusa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Videogame Museum</a> in Frisco, Texas. But on <a href="https://x.com/yozetty/status/1839455938861769020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, Hanson explained that “GameStop pulled in managers from Minnesota to load the U-Hauls and move Game Informer's stuff down to GameStop HQ in Texas. Into their old studio space specifically. Mixed reports on how much they were personally allowed to keep. No museum donations involved.”</p><p>After they leave the store, Hanson and Podzorski talk about the interaction. Hanson says, “That is so wild that that is the fate of the Game Informer office, is just let these GameStop managers come in and pick at it. I mean, I guess ultimately… what’s the difference? We kind of got to do that when we worked there, and weren’t we just GameStop employees as well?.. It’s not that I’m mad at the GameStop managers of course, like that’s frickin’ cool, it just seems so bizarre.”</p><p>“I don’t know that I have a right to be mad,” Hanson says later. “Like, what else are they going to do with those statues? It’s better to put it in a public space where people can see it, I suppose… It <em>feels</em> wrong, but the more I think about it, it’s better than sitting in Ryan Cohen’s basement.”</p><p>I’ll agree that it’s certainly better than everything being trashed or living out its days in the proximity of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftc-says-gamestop-ceo-cohen-pay-nearly-1-million-penalty-2024-09-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEO Cohen</a>, but if you needed more proof that the suits at the top have no idea about the <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-stupid-do-they-think-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actual value</a> of what they own, this is it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sequel-ghost-of-yotei-showcased-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement of Ghost of Yotei</a> was undoubtedly the highlight of September's State of Play. Fans certainly weren't expecting to see the long-awaited sequel of Ghost of Tsushima pop up on that broadcast.</p>
<p>After all, Ghost of Tsushima was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-becomes-the-fastest-selling-new-sony-ip-during-ps4-gen-with-2-4-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony's fastest-selling new IP</a> when it launched back in 2020, not to mention <a href="https://wccftech.com/npd-july-2020-ghost-of-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sucker Punch's best-selling game</a>, going on to sell over 13 million copies to date. It did so well that Sony immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-in-production-to-be-directed-by-john-wicks-chad-stahelski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fast-tracked a movie adaptation</a>, which is being handled by none other than John Wick director Chad Stahelski.</p>
<p>Usually, Sony's big first-party reveals are reserved for PlayStation Showcase events, but fans aren't exactly going to look at this particular gift horse in the mouth. In fact, they're already eager to learn more details about Ghost of Yotei.</p>
<p>Thankfully, developer Sucker Punch shared a few little tidbits about this sequel in an interview <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sequel-playstation.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published on The New York Times</a>. Creative Director Jason Connell said that one of the changes compared to Ghost of Tsushima will be a less repetitive open world.</p>
<p><em>One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again. We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, it could be argued that Ghost of Tsushima's main flaw was its repetitiveness, while the stunning visuals and memorable story and characters were its highlights. It is a flaw that the game admittedly shared with many open world games, so if Sucker Punch can truly improve in this area, Ghost of Yotei could be elevated far above many of its peers.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the developers also teased that the game will be a tale of 'underdog vengeance' for protagonist Atsu (voiced by Erika Ishii, who will be one of the female voices for Dragon Age: The Veilguard's main character Rook and has worked on many big games before, from Apex Legends to Destiny 2).</p>
<p>Players will even have 'more control' over her story, which could be taken as a hint that choices may be available at certain points of the plot. Lastly, we learned that firearms will be available as weapons, which makes sense as Ghost of Yotei is set in 1603, over 300 years after the events of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost of Tsushima</a>.</p>

Despite having tried my hand at it in the past, namely when the original iteration of it came out on consoles back in 2011, I’d never stuck around to see it through to the end, or even get past a few early bosses. However, in the middle of the summer of 2020, I needed <em>anything </em>to distract me from the trash fire that my life had become and booted up the remaster, which a friend had gifted me as a birthday present. It became my new hyperfixation and I mercilessly chipped away at it until I had finally toppled its greatest threats. It made me feel something at a time where I was beginning to feel nothing. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’m no aficionado, but I’m certainly more well-versed in From Software’s legendary catalog than I was four years ago. And because of that, I can tell you without a doubt that the <em>Dark Souls </em>series is well worth picking up. Yes, these are tough and sometimes maddeningly archaic games, and sure, you might have a hard time following any semblance of a traditional narrative throughout them, but in return you get one of the most beautiful and haunting experiences the medium’s ever produced.<br></p><p><strong>Beginning with </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-remastered-the-kotaku-review-1826393252&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-remastered-the-kotaku-review-1826393252"><em><strong>Dark Souls Remastered</strong></em></a></span><strong><em>,</em> which is now available for $20 on Steam, you can see how and where the storied series first kicked off</strong>. Famously, the original PC version of <em>Dark Souls</em>, annoyingly titled the “Prepare to Die Edition,” was really busted—it struggled to run on the platform at acceptable frame rates, and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140120011104/http://www.edge-online.com/features/dark-souls-producer-says-pc-version-was-rushed-problems-were-expected&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140120011104/http://www.edge-online.com/features/dark-souls-producer-says-pc-version-was-rushed-problems-were-expected" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">devs later admitted it was a rush job</a></span> to meet a growing market. The 2018 remaster of <em>Dark Souls </em>was an opportunity to not only release the game at a higher quality on new consoles, but to amend for the botched PC port—and it sure performed a whole hell of a lot better.</p><p>Now, you can properly drink in Lordran, one of my favorite settings in a video game ever. Everyone rightfully fawns over the first time the game transports you to Anor Londo, but I think every inch of that world is majestic and teeming with mysteries that have gone unexplained and will remain so forever. Everything from the Undead Burg through to the Kiln of the First Flame is so well considered in what it gives away and what it keeps close to its chest. And it all just so quietly gorgeous, too. <em>Dark Souls </em>rarely brings attention to itself—it’s never pomp-y, abrasive, or flashy—but it’s got some of the most expressive environments, often doing a whole lot with very little in places like the pitch black of the Tomb of the Giants, the sparse tree line and gloom of Darkroot Garden, and Ash Lake, the desolate beach at the end of the world. I love the feeling of <em>Dark Souls</em> world, like a fairytale gone wrong.<br></p><p>That feeling and texture extends to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-ii-the-kotaku-review-1540752877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-ii-the-kotaku-review-1540752877"><em>Dark Souls 2</em></a></span>, of which there are actually two versions currently on sale.<strong> The first is the original <em>Dark Souls 2</em>, and if you played it back when it was released in 2014, then this is the version of that polarizing title that you remember and it’s on sale for $20. However, it was remastered, and in some places even remixed, as <em>Scholar of the First Sin</em> a year later, and that is <em>also </em>$20 on Steam. </strong>Though both are seen as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-argument-that-dark-souls-ii-is-terrible-1568751704&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-argument-that-dark-souls-ii-is-terrible-1568751704">dark horses of the <em>Souls </em>games</a></span>, time has been kind to the ambitious and daunting sequel, which shares a lot of DNA with the studio’s biggest title, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257"><em>Elden Ring</em></a></span>. It is often a grueling game, having leaned harder into difficulty than the first title with mechanics like hollowing, which reduces the player’s maximum HP with every death. It is also one of the richest experiences in the series, positively swimming in unique and beautiful zones, as well as a bevy of challenging boss fights.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-3-the-kotaku-review-1770292396&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-3-the-kotaku-review-1770292396"><em>Dark Souls 3 </em></a></span>was the last game before the series went on hiatus back in 2016. Initially believed to be the end of the series as a whole, Miyazaki has since walked that sentiment back, though it’s now been almost ten years since this final-ish installment. By 2016, <em>Dark Souls </em>had grown in acclaim so much that the previously niche franchise finally exploded into the mainstream with this trilogy capper, which depicted the prolonged apocalypse of its own world. At the time, it built off of the foundation provided by <em>Bloodborne</em>, making the game much quicker than any past <em>Souls </em>title, which likely helped its mainstream appeal. It’s a game filled with the learnings of a team who’d been working in that world for about a decade, and that shows in its ambition and tone.<br></p><p><em>Dark Souls 3 </em>aims sky high with many of its boss encounters, which have gone on to become treasured bits of the series’ legacy, like the Nameless King, Dancer of the Boreal Valley, and Slave Knight Gael. It was also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-moment-in-dark-souls-3-that-made-me-go-oh-shit-1774931704&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-moment-in-dark-souls-3-that-made-me-go-oh-shit-1774931704">deeply nostalgic</a></span>, featuring countless callbacks to the original title, as well as the return of some locales like Anor Londo. It is the only one of the trilogy I’ve yet to play, but having seen it played countless times over the years, I can safely say that it is a sweeping and effective conclusion to the trilogy, that provides an inkling of a possibility for a follow up down the line. <strong>The base version of <em>Dark Souls 3 </em>is going for $30 on Steam while the deluxe edition, featuring the </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/with-dark-souls-3s-newest-dlc-the-series-finally-says-1793779999&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/with-dark-souls-3s-newest-dlc-the-series-finally-says-1793779999"><strong>pieces of DLC that function as an epilogue</strong></a></span><strong>, is available for $42.</strong><br></p><p>At the end of the day, <em>Dark Souls </em>is just one of those once-in-a-generation series that you just have to try. FromSoft has put out a number of other incredible games, some of which I think are even better than <em>Souls</em>, but none of it would’ve been possible without the impact of the original game and series that put the studio on the map and crystallized its ethos. <em>Dark Souls </em>is simply one of the most important games and series of our time, and if you love games, you probably owe it to yourself to check it out, especially while it’s so affordable. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Starting in January, companies selling digital games in California will have to “state in plain language” that they are buying a limited license and not the actual item. </p><p>“Ubisoft’s actions with<em> The Crew</em> further highlighted just how widespread this issue is,” said Irwin. <br></p><p>If a company breaks the law, it could face fines of $2,500 for each illegal listing and also could be found in violation of the state’s Unfair Competition Law. </p><p>There will be some exemptions, including games that are free to download or games that include an offline mode that would allow the game to run without a constant connection to the internet. </p><p>Irwin told <em>Game File</em> that she hopes the new law will help motivate companies to seek out longer licensing deals, look to create subscription plans, and think more about the future. For example, perhaps Ubisoft and other companies, wanting to avoid running afoul of this new law in California, will work to include actual offline modes in games like <em>The Crew: Motorfest </em>at launch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-crew-2-motorfest-offline-mode-servers-ubisoft-news-1851645034?_gl=1*setqgm*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzQ0OTYyNC4xODkuMS4xNzI3NDUyNDE5LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-crew-2-motorfest-offline-mode-servers-ubisoft-news-1851645034?_gl=1*setqgm*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzQ0OTYyNC4xODkuMS4xNzI3NDUyNDE5LjYwLjAuMA..">instead of adding them later due to online pressure</a></span>. </p><p>The plan here is to help consumers avoid having to pay a “premium for false ownership,” says Irwin. And while California might just be one state, it’s the most populated state in the United States. Millions of gamers live in California and businesses around the world won’t want to stop selling games in the state come next year.

<p>Deadlock was the top game on Steam in monthly active users (MAU) for the month of August. This according to the latest information released by Circana <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l55hwxzqoz2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>



<p>Despite people knowing of its existence and over 18,000 people playing it, Deadlock wasn’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-deadlock-announce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially revealed by Valve</a> until late in the month. Since then, the game has seen peaks of over 170,000 concurrent players while being an invite-only alpha.</p>







<p>As of writing, the game remains invite-only averaging more than 91,000 players at a given time. There’s also been no official announcement regarding the game opening up to more players or entering a beta stage.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-deadlock">What is Deadlock?</h2>



<p>For those who are unaware, Deadlock is a 6v6 team-based hero shooter. In a broader sense, the game is a MOBA similar to the likes of DOTA 2, Smite, and League of Legends. There are four lanes for teams to attack with creeps that drop souls you then use to upgrade your hero throughout the match.</p>



<p>The game currently features 19 heroes to choose from. All of them have different abilities ranging from being a healer to an assassin to a tank. All things expected in a MOBA.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-release-date-revealed.994524/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Miju Games has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>'s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>DLC, and it won't be long before you and your buddies can explore a whole new planet together.</p>
<p>During today's Convergence Showcase, Miju revealed that&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>will launch on October 9th. It'll be the first piece of paid DLC released for the game, although it has received a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-2023-roadmap-promises-updates-and-more">number of updates</a> since its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-release-date-10">initial launch</a>.</p>
<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>brings an entirely new planet for you (and, optionally, your friends) to explore and terraform. It'll have a whole new story and set of secrets to discover, so even if you think you've rinsed&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>, there should be plenty here for you.</p>

Miju says that you can play co-op alongside your buddies with just one copy of the DLC, so everyone doesn't need to buy it before jumping in.</p>
<p>That, says Miju, is why the DLC is "priced low", and why "only the host needs to own it"; the studio says it wants to "keep things fair and fun" in the world of <i>The Planet Crafter</i>, which is a pretty admirable goal.</p>
<p>The studio says the DLC will offer around 20 hours of gameplay and will feature a planet roughly "half the size of the original", and you'll discover an abandoned attempt to colonize said planet, as well as "megacorporations' role in its disaster".</p>
<p>You can check out the release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>right here via the Convergence Showcase.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>, it's a terraforming-focused survival game in which you must explore a hostile planet, survive its dangers, and terraform it so that it's suitable as a home for humanity.</p>
<p>The game features all kinds of systems and mechanics, including base-building, resource gathering, and machine crafting, all of which you'll need to utilize if you want to survive. The mix has proven pretty popular;&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-sales-million">racked up a million sales at last count</a>, and it's not done yet.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284190/The_Planet_Crafter/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Its&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>DLC will launch on October 9th and will set you back just $7.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/final-girl-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Between its deep thematic experience and variable gameplay, Final Girl is a single-player <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board game</a> that stands out from other <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">horror board games</a>. The game's title comes from the trope of the same name, which refers to the last surviving female character in a horror movie – think Jamie Lee Curtis’ Laurie Strode from <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/halloween-1978">Halloween</a> or Sigourney Weaver’s Ellen Ripley from <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/alien">Alien</a>.</p><p>In a sort of multiversal twist, Final Girl’s numerous expansions each feature different protagonists – all of whom have their own individual abilities – as well as new monsters and locations. Essentially, each expansion serves as its own unique horror game, paying homage to a classic horror film or story; however, the various expansions can be mixed and matched to pit any girl against any monster in any location.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h3 data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h3></p><div data-cy="catalog-view-trigger"><div><p><h3>Final Girl - Core Box</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Happy Trails Horror</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Haunting of Creech Manor</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Slaughter in The Groves</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Carnage at the Carnival</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Frightmare on Maple Lane</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Into the Void</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Panic at Station 2891</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: A Knock at the Door</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Once Upon a Full Moon</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Madness in the Dark</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: The North Pole Nightmare</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Terror From Above</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Final Girl: Terror From the Grave</h3></p></div></div><p>Don’t get it twisted and think that Final Girl is merely a novel experience for the hardcore horror fanatic. On the contrary, Final Girl is widely regarded as one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games"><u>best solo board games</u></a> that money can buy. Still, with a wealth of options when it comes to expansions, new players might be scratching their heads, wondering where to start. Well, fear not, as this handy guide offers you everything you need to know about the Final Girl Core Box and the series’ various expansions.</p><p id="final-girl-core-box"><h2 data-toc-title="Final Girl - Core Box">Final Girl - Core Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207799"><div id="207799" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl - Core Box</h3></p></div><p>IMPORTANT: REQUIRES AT LEAST ONE FEATURE FILM BOX TO PLAY</p><p>MSRP: $19.99</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 14+</li><li>Players: 1</li><li>Play Time: 20-60 mins</li></ul><p>Final Girl is a single-player horror tabletop series in which players take control of one of the titular final girls to fight pop culture-inspired monsters. Each expansion comes with its own set of unique mechanics and quirks, but players are generally exploring spooky locations, drawing various event cards, playing action cards, chucking dice, saving victims, and widdling down the villain’s health.</p><p>The first important thing to note about the Core Box is that it is not playable on its own. To borrow a dated but apt metaphor, think of the Final Girl Core Box as a VHS player and the Feature Film boxes (expansions) as playable tapes.</p><p>As every Feature Film box requires the Core Box, however, this is still a part of the first purchase any prospective Final Girl player will want to make. Included in the Core Box are the basic rules as well as the general components required to play any game of Final Girl.</p><p>Where players choose to go from here is largely up to personal preference, but I won’t leave you in the dark concerning recommended purchases. The remainder of this guide will mainly cover each expansion currently available in the order they were released. Under each expansion, I will discuss the various features as well as weigh out the pros and cons so you can decide which spooky adventure is right for you.</p><h2>Expansions (Feature Film Boxes)</h2></div><p id="final-girl-happy-trails-horror"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Happy Trails Horror">Final Girl: Happy Trails Horror</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207801"><div id="207801" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Happy Trails Horror</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Laurie &amp; Reiko</li><li>Monster: Hans - The Butcher</li><li>Location: Camp Happy Trails</li></ul><p>Happy Trails Horror is about as good a place to start as any. In fact, the Feature Films box is actually included with the Core Box in a separate Starter Bundle, which is listed for $39.98. However, it should be noted the bundle doesn’t save you any money compared to buying the two products separately, so there’s no financial incentive to opt for this route.</p><p>That said, Hans - The Butcher is a straightforward villain, making this an excellent place to start. Later villains can offer much more of a challenge, even for seasoned players, and may prove too frustrating for newcomers. Happy Trails Horror is the perfect entry point if you’re looking for a classic slasher akin to Friday the 13th.</p></div><p id="final-girl-haunting-of-creech-manor"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Haunting of Creech Manor">Final Girl: Haunting of Creech Manor</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207802"><div id="207802" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Haunting of Creech Manor</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Alice &amp; Selena</li><li>Monster: The Poltergeist </li><li>Location: Creech Manor</li></ul><p>Haunting of Creech Manor is one of the more unique experiences in comparison to other Feature Film boxes. First, The Poltergeist differs from other villains in that it cannot be damaged by the player. Rather, to win, the player needs to save a little girl by the name of Carolyn.</p><p>Still, while the novelty of Haunting of Creech Manor makes it stand out, difficulty can be a bit of a mixed bag. Winning or losing can feel more like a stroke of luck rather than requiring any actual skill. If the cards and dice don’t turn in your favor, it might feel like winning a round here is nearly impossible.</p><p>The change of pace makes this a must-play for experienced Final Girl fans, but it's perhaps best saved for a later pickup. That way, players can truly appreciate the unique blend of mechanics that Creech Manor brings to the table.</p></div><p id="final-girl-slaughter-in-the-groves"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Slaughter in The Groves">Final Girl: Slaughter in The Groves</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207803"><div id="207803" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Slaughter in The Groves</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Adelaide &amp; Barbara</li><li>Monster: Inkanyamba</li><li>Location: Sacred Groves</li></ul><p>Slaughter in the Groves transports players to Africa for a sight-seeing trip gone wrong where a masked killer is looking for revenge on behalf of their gods. Overall, it is an interesting idea, but it’s one accompanied by a high level of difficulty. Both the villain and the map present a wealth of challenges that can quickly result in frustration, even for veteran players.</p><p>Due to its sheer difficulty, Slaughter in the Groves should probably be a later pickup for most fans. However, those who are particularly gluttons for punishment may want to consider moving Inkanyamba and the Sacred Groves up their wish list.</p></div><p id="final-girl-carnage-at-the-carnival"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Carnage at the Carnival">Final Girl: Carnage at the Carnival</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207804"><div id="207804" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Carnage at the Carnival</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Asami &amp; Charlie</li><li>Monster: Geppetto - The Puppet Master</li><li>Location: Carnival of Blood</li></ul><p>Perhaps the biggest gripe fans of the series have against Final Girl is that it can sometimes feel a bit swingy. In other words, it may not matter how adept your Final Girl skills are; a couple of bad draws can lose you the game rather quickly. Unfortunately, that con is highlighted in Carnage at the Carnival.</p><p>The Carnival of Blood map contains numerous traps that make investigating treacherous. These traps can have damaging effects that make it nearly impossible for players to win the round if encountered at inopportune moments. Carnage at the Carnival mitigates this somewhat by making Asami, one of the included final girls, immune to traps, but that kind of defeats the point of the mechanic altogether.</p><p>That said, Gepetto - The Puppet Master, is an interesting villain in the franchise as he contains various puppet minions. Most of the villains in Final Girl fight alone, so this departure makes for an interesting twist. Due to the difficulty of the map, Carnage at the Carnival isn’t an ideal starting point, but Gepetto certainly makes this an intriguing selection for experienced players.</p></div><p id="final-girl-frightmare-on-maple-lane"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Frightmare on Maple Lane">Final Girl: Frightmare on Maple Lane</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207805"><div id="207805" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Frightmare on Maple Lane</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Nacy &amp; Sheila</li><li>Monster: Dr. Fright</li><li>Location: Maple Lane</li></ul><p>Both the Maple Lane location and Dr. Fright offer straightforward, albeit memorable, experiences that make this Feature Film box an excellent choice for beginners. Not to mention, the clear homage to the Nightmare on Elm Street series makes for a compelling and terrifying narrative.</p><p>The sleep mechanic, which requires players to fight Dr. Fight in their dreams, is an interesting twist on the Final Girl formula, and it doesn’t add a ton of bloat to the core gameplay, either. For players who already have Happy Trails Horror (or some other Feature Film box) in their collection, Frightmare on Maple Lane is a solid next option to look into.</p></div><p id="final-girl-into-the-void"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Into the Void">Final Girl: Into the Void</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207806"><div id="207806" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Into the Void</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Ellen &amp; Jenette</li><li>Monster: The Evomorph</li><li>Location: The USS Konrad</li></ul><p>This Alien-inspired Feature Film box is a fan-favorite due to its spaceship locale and its continuously evolving villain, The Evomorph. Unfortunately, what makes this entry so great is also what makes it a non-ideal starting point, a bevy of extra rules.</p><p>Those who really want to sit down and experience Into the Void (and you totally should, at some point) will first have to get familiar with the new ruleset introduced with The Evomorph and The USS Konrad. However, those who take the extra time to study up before playing will be treated to arguably one of the best boxes in the Final Girl series.</p></div><p id="final-girl-panic-at-station-2891"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Panic at Station 2891">Final Girl: Panic at Station 2891</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207807"><div id="207807" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Panic at Station 2891</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Kate &amp; Uki</li><li>Monster: The Organism</li><li>Location: Station 2891</li></ul><p>In this Feature Film box heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-thing-1982">The Thing</a>, players are tasked with testing patients to determine whether or not The Organism has assimilated them. This expansion differs from other Feature Film boxes in that each game begins without a monster. After the testing phase, however, there can be up to three baddies in one game at a given time.</p><p>The map itself is also rather unique because it features a hypothermia element due to the arctic setting. Not to mention, the distinct helicopter mechanic requires a bit of strategy that is not present in other box sets. As only three people can escape at one time via helicopter, players need to think through the most efficient way to save the many victims of Station 2891. Again, this is an excellent entry, but perhaps not the right one to start with due to all the added mechanics.</p></div><p id="final-girl-a-knock-at-the-door"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: A Knock at the Door">Final Girl: A Knock at the Door</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207808"><div id="207808" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: A Knock at the Door</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Ava &amp; Ginny</li><li>Monster: The Intruders </li><li>Location: Wingard Cottage</li></ul><p>A Knock at the Door is a home invasion expansion inspired by <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-strangers-2008">The Strangers</a>. As with the film series, there are three different intruders, each of whom can act as the main antagonist at any given moment. Because of that, tension in A Knock at the Door remains high throughout. There never quite feels like there is a moment when you're totally safe.</p><p>Constant tension coupled with an interesting crafting mechanic for potential weapon-building makes each playthrough potentially quite different. A box with only a single villain to focus on, like Happy Trails Horror or Frightmare on Maple Lane, might be a better place to start. Still, A Knock at the Cabin makes its case for being an excellent entry point thanks to its exceptionally strong theme and ample replayability.</p></div><p id="final-girl-once-upon-a-full-moon"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Once Upon a Full Moon">Final Girl: Once Upon a Full Moon</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207809"><div id="207809" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Once Upon a Full Moon</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Gretel &amp; Red</li><li>Monster: The Big Bad Wolf</li><li>Location: The Storybook Woods</li></ul><p>Despite being a later entry in the franchise, Once Upon a Full Moon is another recommended starting point for newcomers. The fairytale feel of this Feature Film box is universally understandable, even for those who haven’t seen their share of horror movies.</p><p>Not to mention, there aren’t a ton of extra rules to learn, either. Essentially, it serves as the Happy Trails Horror of the franchise’s second wave of releases. It’s just a straightforward good time that should quickly get new players to the table and up to speed.</p></div><p id="final-girl-madness-in-the-dark"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Madness in the Dark">Final Girl: Madness in the Dark</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207810"><div id="207810" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Madness in the Dark</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $19.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Heather &amp; Veronica</li><li>Monster: The Ratchet Lady</li><li>Location: Wolfe Asylum</li></ul><p>The swingy-ness of the Final Girl franchise reveals itself yet again with Madness in the Dark. Perhaps more than most entries in the series, this Feature Film box can either be defeated or bring a player to their knees in a relatively short period of time, largely depending on the luck of the draw. Still, Madness in the Dark contains some interesting ideas that make a visit to this creepy asylum worth the trip.</p><p>In particular, the floors of Wolfe Asylum are littered with collectible pills. These pills can be taken for a bonus effect or stacked together for more powerful abilities. However, this mechanic's potential side effects turn Madness in the Dark into a bit of a test-your-luck game. Whether you become an overpowered monster killer or simply go mad might just determine the outcome of your playthrough.</p></div><p id="final-girl-the-north-pole-nightmare"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: The North Pole Nightmare">Final Girl: The North Pole Nightmare</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207811"><div id="207811" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: The North Pole Nightmare</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $29.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Cindy &amp; Mrs. Claus</li><li>Monster: Krampus</li><li>Location: Santa’s Village</li></ul><p>In a special holiday edition of sorts, The North Pole Nightmare pits final girls Cindy the Elf and Mrs. Claus against Krampus. The unique aspect of The North Pole Nightmare (other than its theme) is the present mechanic, which can either help or hurt you, depending on whether or not these gifts come from Santa or Krampus.</p><p>The North Pole Nightmare is a solid addition to any collection, especially if you’re the type of person looking for a horror-filled adventure around the holidays. Not to mention, saving the day as Mrs. Claus is just some campy fun. However, like any holiday special, The North Pole Nightmare is probably best enjoyed by those who already have some experience with the series, as its twists and turns are likely to be more greatly appreciated by existing fans.</p><h2>Mini Expansions</h2><p>In addition to the various Feature Film boxes currently available, there are a handful of smaller vignettes worth considering that offer new villains and final girls. However, as these expansions don’t include locations, they must be paired with the Core Box and one of the Feature Film boxes.</p></div><p id="final-girl-terror-from-above"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Terror From Above">Final Girl: Terror From Above</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207812"><div id="207812" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Terror From Above</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $9.99</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX AND ANY ONE FEATURE FILM BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Melanie</li><li>Monster: Birds</li></ul><p>Again, smaller vignettes like Terror From Above and Terror From the Grave require the core box and a feature film box to be playable. Both vignettes, however, introduce a new protagonist and monster that can be taken to any in-game location. For example, the monsters of Maple Lane and Creech Manor can be swapped out with the killer birds included with Terror From Above. I’m not sure what killer birds would be doing on a space station, but you can definitely play that scenario out if you want to, as well.</p></div><p id="final-girl-terror-from-the-grave"><h3 data-toc-title="Final Girl: Terror From the Grave">Final Girl: Terror From the Grave</h3></p><div catalogid="e60b942a-4578-49ea-8052-f3b235f4b150" id="207813"><div id="207813" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Girl: Terror From the Grave</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $9.99</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE CORE BOX AND ANY ONE FEATURE FILM BOX)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Final Girl: Patsy</li><li>Monster: Zombies</li></ul><p>An encompassing horror franchise like Final Girl just wouldn’t feel complete without zombies. While zombies have yet to receive their own standalone Feature Film box, this vignette allows the iconic horror monster to go to any location featured in previous expansions. Want to fight zombies in space or at the carnival? Well, now you can.</p><h2>Final Girl Extras</h2><p>Even beyond the various Feature Film boxes and smaller vignettes, there are several items available with the Final Girl branding that you might be curious about. For example, there are miniatures of the many protagonists and monsters, promotional final girls, additional scenario booklets, and even storage boxes for collectors.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>With decades of iconic movie and pop culture monsters to take inspiration from, there is seemingly no end in sight for the Final Girl franchise. In fact, publisher Van Ryder Games has already completed a successful Kickstarter campaign for the latest slate of Feature Film boxes and is looking to make them available for purchase soon.</p><p>For those looking to get into the series, Happy Trails Horror, Frightmare on Maple Lane, and Once Upon a Full Moon are all great Feature Film sets to purchase first, along with the Core Box. However, if one horror homage, in particular, calls to you, there’s no reason you can’t start with any of the Feature Film boxes; it just may require learning a few more rules and some additional setup time.</p><p>Luckily, for those who think Final Girl might just become their next obsession/collection, many of the titles listed above can be found for well under MSRP at retailers like Amazon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-two-game-references-and-new-theories-from-the-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The first full <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-debut-trailer-shows-joel-and-ellie-5-years-after-the-events-of-season-1">trailer for The Last of Us Season 2</a> is officially here, giving us a look at Ellie and Joel five years after the events of the first season.</p><p>In the new season, creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann are starting to take viewers through the events of the second game, The Last of Us Part 2, and fans of the games will recognise plenty of familiar faces, as well as some new ones.</p><p>But alongside finally seeing elements from The Last of Us Part 2 in live-action, there are also plenty of hidden details and Easter eggs sprinkled throughout the teaser, as well as some brand new scenes that have sparked some tin-foil hat theories. So read on for everything we caught in <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-last-of-us-the-series">The Last of Us</a> Season 2 teaser trailer and what we think might be happening. Don’t worry, we’ll keep things spoiler-free, except for at the end where we’ll give you a big ol’ warning.</p><h3>Familiar Faces and Places</h3><p>Bella Ramsey is reprising their role as Ellie. Set five years after the events of the first season, Ramsey’s Ellie is now living in Jackson, Wyoming. In case you don’t recall, that’s the town from Episode 6 of Season 1 where Joel is reunited with his brother Tommy.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-13-screenshot-1727443296542.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Speaking of Joel, the teaser shows a Miller mailbox, illustrating that the Texan has also fully settled in Jackson after the events of season one. If their living situations correlate directly to those from the game, we can infer that Ellie’s moved into her own home at this point in time and Joel is staying nearby in the town.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-18-screenshot-1727443296544.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p> While they were traveling companions in the first season of The Last of Us, Ellie and Joel seem more distant in Jackson, as signaled by the stern look given by Ellie as she approaches her former travel buddy’s porch. Joel can be seen plucking away at his guitar, preparing to have a conversation with his proxy-daughter. If you’ve played the game, you’ll know the importance of the conversation about to be had here…</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-46-screenshot-1727443296544.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Gabriel Luna also returns as Joel’s brother, Tommy. He was last seen welcoming Joel and Ellie to Jackson, Wyoming where he lives as part of a larger commune of survivors. In the teaser Tommy is holding his trusty rifle, which makes sense given his talent for long-range shooting – something he passes on to Ellie in the video game. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-52-screenshot-1727443296545.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>He looks on as something approaches the walls of Jackson. Moments later, the teaser suggests Jackson comes under attack by Infected and we know that Tommy has a somewhat leadership role in the community.</p><p>Tommy is shown with his wife Maria played by Rutina Wesley. Last time we saw her she was pregnant, meaning there could well be a small child running around Jackson somewhere. Tommy is looking injured and the two look distraught over something. Given what we know about the game, this could be about any number of events that happen, but is most likely either a reaction to the aftermath of the infected attack on Jackson, or something much worse.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-32-screenshot-1727443296546.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Throughout the trailer we can hear Future Days by Pearl Jam. This is the same song Joel plays for Ellie at the start of The Last of Us Part 2. Weirdly, this song is somewhat of an anachronism as the song was released in October 2013, but the zombie outbreak in the game began in September 2013, weeks prior to the album’s release. </p><p>The HBO series actually started its zombie outbreak a decade earlier in 2003. Of course, in the trailer this song is used completely non-diegetically, meaning that Joel isn’t playing it himself here. It would certainly be odd for him to play a song that wouldn’t have yet been written by Eddie Vedder in the show’s timeline, so we wonder what grunge deep-cut he’ll go for instead to avoid creating some sort of Pearl Jam paradox.</p><p>And here is a closer look at the guitar Joel gifts to Ellie, complete with the iconic moth design on the neck. The guitar features heavily in The Last of Us Part 2 as an item that connects Ellie and Joel, given that he teaches her how to play the instrument. It symbolizes the father-daughter relationship between the two and is an enduring part of their connection. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-22-screenshot-1727443296544.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>That moth can also be seen on Ellie’s forearm tattoo that she received to cover up her infected bite. The symbolism of the animal being is that no matter how dark things get, you always have to draw yourself to the light in the world – something easier said than done in the world of The Last of Us.</p><p>Just after this, we see an exact reproduction of an early scene from the game where Joel is singing the aforementioned Pearl Jam song to Ellie, continuing the show’s habit of recreating cherished memories shot-for-shot from its source material.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-26-screenshot-1727443296544.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3>New characters for Season Two</h3><p>We’re going to see either Ellie or Joel play the guitar quite a few times this season, surely. Here Ellie is playing a guitar she finds in a Seattle music shop for Dina. Maybe it’s friendly, maybe it’s something more. </p><p>In the game, this optional moment sees Ellie play Take on Me by A-Ha. Although it’s not a required part of the gameplay, this moment is one of the most memorable from the games.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-36-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In the second season of The Last of Us, Dina is played by Isabella Merced. You might recognize her from Alien Romulus. While she’s also someone who grew up after the outbreak and is able to hold her own in terms of survival, she’s got a very different outlook on life than Ellie, showing that many people have adapted differently to the post-apocalyptic world.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-39-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Young Mazino from Netflix’s Beef will be playing Jesse, another resident of Jackson who is introduced in The Last of Us Part 2. A friend to both Ellie and Dina, we suspect that Jesse might be more important in the third season if indeed HBO decides to split up the second game into multiple seasons.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-48-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>This shot of Ellie and Dina riding around the town’s perimeters as part of a routine security duty echoes an early mission from the game, in which Ellie and Dina take on a scouting mission around Jackson.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-35-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>You can see an infected approach Ellie in this one scene. It certainly looks like the store that Dina and Ellie have to fight their way out of when patrolling the outskirts of Jackson in the game. But while this moment serves as a tutorial segment in The Last of Us Part Two, it precedes a chain of events that will alter Ellie’s life forever.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-58-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Another recreation of a moment from the game, this time early on in Seattle where Ellie and Dina travel through the city’s underground subway tunnels. The red light matches that of the game as they encounter several infected and clickers. We’ve been promised a lot more infected in season two of the show, and this is a great example of the horror they bring.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-34-screenshot-1727444344228.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>A shot of Ellie’s knife, the one left to her by her mother can be seen her. Ellie’s mom was a bigger part of the HBO series than in the video game, so perhaps the show will expand even further on Ellie’s relationship with her mother in the second season. We may also see the return of Ashley Johnson, who played Ellie’s mother in the HBO series and voiced Ellie in the video games as further pages from the American Dream prequel comic may be referenced.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-52-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Ellie is very upset about something. Knowing this story, it could be one of a number of things but we’ll take a swing and think we might know what moment this follows. We won’t spoil that one here, though. If you think you know, then join the club.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-36-screenshot-1727444344228.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Kaitlyn Dever makes her first appearance as Abby, as Catherine O’Hara’s nameless character (more on her in a bit) asks Joel, “What did you do?” Which if you know, you know. </p><p>You can also see a chain hanging from the fence post behind Abby, which may be a nod to one of the collectible dog tags from The Last of Us Part 2, so that’s a fun easter egg if that’s the case.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-2-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Abby is trapped between a wall and a collapsing fence, under siege from infected.

Who is it? Based on what we know from the game it’s likely Joel who’s come to help. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-12-screenshot-1727444344227.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Two horses are seen galloping, possibly away from the infected horde.

They are also the enemies of the WLF (Washington Liberation Front), who Abby is a member of.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-19-screenshot-1727444344228.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Seraphites worship the Prophet, a woman who had a vision that humans should return to living off of the land again, and abandon modern technology.

The WLF’s reliance on weaponry and brute force is the polar opposite of the nature-embracing Seraphites, and we expect to see this dynamic play out in greater detail when Ellie and Dina make their way to Seattle and see these two factions up close.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-32-screenshot-1727444344228.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Ellie is seen returning fire with an automatic rifle, a weapon she wields in the game. It’s unclear, though, whether she’s firing at the WLF soldiers in the shot before. The magic of editing!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-33-screenshot-1-1727444344228.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>A captured Seraphite is chained to a wall. Their captor is the leader of the WLF, Isaac Dixon, played by Jeffrey Wright. Wright reprises his role from the game, in which he voiced and mo-capped Dixon. This isn’t the first time this has happened in The Last of Us HBO series as Merle Dandridge also played the live-action version of Marlene, leader of the Fireflies, whom she voiced in The Last of Us Part 1. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-26-screenshot-1727444344228.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3>Things Not From the Game</h3><p>It was previously announced that Catherine O’Hara, best known most recently from reprising her role as Delia Deetz in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, would be joining the cast of The Last of Us in Season 2. However, details of her character were not revealed. It now appears that she will be playing an original character, seemingly a therapist. She’s introduced talking to Pedro Pascal’s Joel, who we see with longer hair here. He also appears to be grappling with his actions from the end of the first season, hence why he might be seeking out O’Hara’s presumed therapist in residence in Jackson, Wyoming.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-0-3-screenshot-1727444841733.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>We don’t know who she is for sure, though. Could it even be that she’s the aforementioned Seraphite prophet? A long shot, seeing as she’s long dead in the game, but it wouldn’t be the first time the show has made a big change. Trailers can be crafty and she might not actually even be speaking to Joel in this scene, after all.</p><p>This is another moment not seen in the game is a horde of infected charging towards Jackson. Is this why Tommy was seen carrying his rifle earlier?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-4-screenshot-1727444870981.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The infected horde from earlier return as they slam into the barricades of Jackson. It’s worth noting that no such event occurs in the game, so we’re seeing something new here. This may play into the theory that the events of the game may be changed to reflect original concept art of Abby being welcomed into the community of Jackson as she, Tommy, and Joel escape from the oncoming horde we saw them escaping from earlier.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-last-of-us-day-official-teaser-max-1-29-screenshot-1727444902074.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Here’s where we going to go into spoiler territory for the game, so if you haven’t played it, we’d recommend you stop watching now.</p><h3>SPOILER WARNING</h3><p>In The Last of Us Part 2, Abby shockingly puts an end to Joel’s newfound homely existence by introducing his skull to a golf club. It all happens very quickly, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-was-once-more-open-world-how-abbys-role-changed">Druckmann later explained</a> early drafts of the story we different, and that “Abby joined the community and you were playing as this new character until she betrayed Joel later on. And it just didn't work because Joel dying is the inciting incident, and you want to get to the inciting incident as quickly as you can.”</p><p>Could we see that version of events take place in season two of the show? The fact that a horde of infected is charging toward Jackson could mean that Joel and Abby are being chased back to the settlement instead of the chalet, which is the setting of his video game demise. Obviously, it’s all guesswork at this point, but it would be an interesting way for the season to go and give us a little more precious Pedro Pascal time.</p><p>And that’s all the game details we saw in the first trailer for The Last of Us Season 2. Will Joel teach Ellie Future Days, a song that shouldn’t exist in the series? Maybe it’ll be a different Pearl Jam song, or something else altogether. Let us know in the comments what you think it could be. The return of this version of the apocalypse will arrive in the form of seven episodes on HBO sometime in 2025.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft said the decision had been made in light of Shadow's recent release delay. As announced earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Assassin's Creed Shadows will now debut on 14th February 2025,</a> instead of its previously planned November arrival. Those who had pre-ordered the game will receive refunds.</p>
<p>In its own post sharing today's news, the EGX team said it appreciated this will be disappointing for those looking to go hands-on with Assassin's Creed Shadows. However, there are still more games for attendees to try out during the event, which runs from Friday 25th to Sunday 27th October.</p>

<p>Ubisoft announced it was delaying the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows on Wednesday. At this time, the developer said the game was feature complete, but would now receive further polish. It cited "softer than expected launch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a>" as a factor in its decision to move the release into next year.</p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-new-ubisoft-games-to-release-day-one-on-steam-starting-next-february">Ubisoft announced a full return to Steam</a>, with Assassin's Creed Shadows being the first game under the developer to get a day one release on Valve's platform since Starlink: Battle for Atlas, which released in 2019.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fender has teamed up with Capcom to create a Telecaster inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a>: the Monster Hunter Rathalos Telecaster.</p>
<p>The guitar's already listed in the <a href="https://www.fender.com/en-GB/electric-guitars/telecaster/monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster-rosewood-fingerboard-rathalos-red/5602600899.html?rdl=true">UK store</a> for £1850, which makes it one of Fender's pricier iterations. There's no option to pre-order just yet, although Fender says the instrument will be available from March 2025.</p>

<p>The guitar features the iconic Rathalos emblem, along with "guild marks subtly placed throughout the body and fretboard inlays".</p>
<p>"The bold original body colour, tortoiseshell pickguard, and sleek black hardware echo the [Rathalos'] ferociousness, making this a truly unique instrument," Fender says.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to bring this collaboration with world-leading guitar brand Fender to life in celebration of Monster Hunter's 20th anniversary," said Ryozo Tsujimoto, Monster Hunter series producer.</p>
<p>"The collaboration guitar features various elements that reflect Rathalos, one of the series' iconic monsters, with details such as claw marks, inlays, and patterns on the body. Additionally, plans are underway for in-game collaborations with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, so please look forward to that as well."</p>

<p>Japanese fans get a bonus limited edition model, too, called, confusingly, the Limited Monster Hunter Rathalos Telecaster. Pre-orders for that are now live, albeit restricted to Fender's flagship Tokyo store and Fender Japan's official online store. That version comes with a premium hard case, too.</p>
<p>Fans who don't have the best part of two grand lying around can also pick up exclusive guitar picks - there are 12 designs to collect - and a collector's pick case styled to look like the item box from the game.</p>
<p>Sounds like you won't be able to choose which pick you want to buy, though, as the "specific designs included remain a mystery until the package is opened". Also, "the pick products will be available for sale exclusively in the Asia-Pacific region", so it doesn't seem they'll be coming to the US or Europe any time soon.</p>
<p>The Japan-exclusive Limited guitar edition, however, will include the special pick case with all 12 pick designs.</p>
<p>Capcom recently revealed the PC system requirements for Monster Hunter Wilds, following news at this week's State of Play that it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-out-february-next-year">set for release on 28th February 2025</a> on PC (Steam), PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>The game will require 140GB of storage on an SSD and 16GB of memory. Minimum specs are for a 1080p upscaled resolution at 30fps, while recommended specs are for 60fps.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
