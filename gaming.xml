<figure><a title="Ragebound" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5d135f14b942b/ragebound.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Dotemu</em></figcaption></figure><p>Dotemu and The Game Kitchen have released a new patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>, adding in a whole bunch of new features, fixes, and improvements.</p>
<p>Perhaps most crucially, however, is the addition of a new performance mode targeting 60fps, but there's a catch... As detailed in <a href="https://x.com/Dotemu/status/1966139635454849150">Dotemu's announcement post</a>, the game will default at 30fps on the Switch, while it's recommended that only those on the Switch 2 activate the 60fps option.</p>
<p>There's also a really cool CRT filter available for those who really want to relive the good ol' days. Both this and the frame rate option is available by navigating to 'Options' and 'Video' via the menu.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tqzvxr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Now, let's check out the full patch notes:</p>
<h3>New features &amp; improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restart from Checkpoint</strong> option added.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hard Mode can now be unlocked by winning the duel against Ryu.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the Hard Mode being unlocked by finishing the game for the first time, you may unlock it earlier by winning the duel against Ryu on level 1-1. If you want to leap right away to Hard Mode, you will first have to prove yourself worthy of the challenge!</p>
<ul>

<li>A <strong>new alternative dialogue portrait</strong> for the Masked Agent on level 4-4 has been added.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<li>Kenji could climb a wall and leave the camera's field of view towards the end of level 3-5.</li>
<li>Large obstacle meant to be destroyed by Hypercharge was vulnerable to Kama Spider Weapon on stage 3-1.</li>
<li>Luring a Cursed Fire enemy towards the collapsing platform allowed Kenji to get stuck in level 3-4.</li>
<li>During Rhyvashi's boss fight, the big rock could block your attacks right after disappearing during a brief period of time.</li>
<li>In level 4-5 on Hard Mode, Kenji could be hit when skipping the cutscene in which he jumps onto a helicopter.</li>
<li>Motorbike could flip after jumping against a wall on stage 2-2.</li>
<li>In level 4-1, Kenji could roll through some steel containers which made him out of bounds.</li>
<li>Kenji could be killed by skipping the cutscene right after defeating Jagäzk on level 4-6.</li>
<li>Added support for DirectInput controllers.</li>
<li>If Kumori were to perform a roll attack whilst wearing the Black Spider Uniform, the default skin would be displayed during the animation.</li>
<li>Removed invisible ceiling on level S-6 on Hard Mode, near the end of the tree section.</li>
<li>Bio Grunts frequently remained locked in their attack animation for a brief time if Kenji was positioned close to their spawn point.</li>
<li>On level 5-1 you could lose control of Kenji or Kumori when starting Rhyvahsi’s fight.</li>
<li>On level 5-1, a long wait time was present after defeating Rhyvashi.</li>
<li>Kenji could climb over a wall and skip part of the level, causing camera issues on level 3-5 on Hard Mode.</li>
<li>The kill streak counter disappeared every time the game was paused or cutscene took place.</li>
<li>On level 3-2 on Hard Mode, a Hanging Demon enemy could end up frozen and unable to attack.</li>
<li>Level 4-4 boss shockwave projectiles could appear in the air rather than on a surface.</li>
<li>Striking Level 4-4 boss in the back with a Hypercharge attack pushed it to the other edge, making it behave incorrectly.</li>
<li>During the elevator section on level 4-4, drone enemies could attack Kenji while being outside the camera.</li>
<li>Bio Blocker's enemy projectile hitbox remained active after being killed.</li>
<li>On level 3-2, during the Eels boss fight, the camera could be unlocked if Kenji reached a low point of the arena.</li>
<li>Gurthka’s landing animation could not work properly when the boss fight started on levels 1-2 and 1-3.</li>
<li>Jagäzk’s ribcage was immune to the Grenade Spider Weapon.</li>
<li>On level 4-2, you could leave the camera bounds by using guillotine boosts on a helicopter.</li>
<li>Kumori’s Hypercharged roll-jump kunai projectile could traverse an enemy without hitting it.</li>
<li>On level S-8, a guillotine boost platforming section could be skipped by climbing a wall and moving through the ceiling.</li>
<li>On level 2-2 the player could lose control of the motorbike when reaching the outdoor area.</li>
<li>While playing as Kumori during a Demon Altar section, Kumori wouldn’t be able to manually hypercharge if Kenji’s health was too low.</li>
<li>Cyclops Demon's eye disappeared instantly rather than using a proper animation if the enemy was killed and the eye was away from their body.</li>
<li>Kenji could clip through the subway tunnel's ceiling during his epilogue.</li>
<li>Backtracking during Kenji's epilogue could cause inconsistent camera transitions.</li>
<li>Exiting the credits from the main menu caused the music to reset and make the portraits not move properly.</li>
<li>Many other performance improvements and bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Ragebound's frame rate was one of our biggest gripes when we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/ninja-gaiden-ragebound">reviewed it</a> back in August, and although those on the Switch might not benefit all that much from the patch, Switch 2 owners can now enjoy the game at a (mostly) silky-smooth 60fps. Glorious.</p>

            <p>The future of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> series will see multiplayer bits pushed "more predominantly", according to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot. The exec said this thing on stage at a conference in Saudi Arabia last month (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia">Game File</a>), around the same time he announced the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> DLC the company have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisofts-deal-with-saudi-arabia-over-free-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-has-reportedly-seen-staff-pushback">partnered with the Saudi government on</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Asked about the future of the series that brought us that one scene where the pirate guy talks about the definition of insanity before kicking you into a big hole, Guillemot said that the publishers' goal "on Far Cry [is] really to bring the multiplayer aspects more predominantly pushed, so that it can also be played for a long time by players."</p>
<p>Yves, believe me, you can play a single player game for a very long time. His comments come a couple of years on from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-working-on-far-cry-7-and-separate-far-cry-multiplayer-spin-off-game-says-report">reports claiming</a> that Ubisoft were working on both the next mainline entry in the series, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-7">Far Cry 7</a>, and a multiplayer-only spin-off. Kotaku's report at that point alleged Far Cry 7 will see the series move on from the Dunia engine, in use since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-2">Far Cry 2</a>. The muliplayer game was claimed by Insider Gaming to be an extraction shooter set in the Alaskan wilderness.</p>
<p>While Far Cry's always been more of a single-player romp of explosions and bullets for me, though the last couple of entries have obviously featured plenty of co-op in addition to traditional online multiplayer. I can't recall the matches and modes themselves being anything exceptional, if still fun. However, the map editors they came with were brilliant if, like me, you were a 15-year-old who liked building houses and hideouts, but reckoned getting really into Minecraft would be the final nail in your secondary school cool factor coffin.</p><p>Then again, maybe I'm not the person to ask given I've still not given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-6">Far Cry 6</a> a go, despite having played every other entry since 2. I just keep forgetting 6 exists, then remembering, reading <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/far-cry-6-review">reviews</a>, and concluding that it's probably not worth it until the next sale, by which point I've forgotten again. Far Cries 2 and 3 were the shooter's peak in my book, at their best when you were setting half of Africa on fire just to kill three guys or blowing an outpost into the sea. My dad, meanwhile, swears by the original and caveperson spin-off Primal.</p>
<p>I'd interrupt his latest Horizon: Zero Dawn playthrough to ask if he'd care about a multiplayer-only Far Cry, but I think I know what the answer'd be.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>All of that wall-rattling bass and gigantic surround sound coming from your expensive home theater audio setup is impressive, but if you’re watching a movie or TV show and you can’t make out the dialogue, what good is it? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">The Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus that’s on sale right now for just $180</a> makes those voices come through loud and clear while it puts money back in your pocket.</p>
<p>This limited-time deal takes $70 off the price of this compact, plug-and-play 3.1-channel soundbar that brings Dolby Atmos and DTS:X sound to any TV, and is also Bluetooth compatible so you can hear your favorite playlists and podcasts with the same brilliant, clear sound.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>From Box to Boom in Minutes</h2>
<p>You don’t need to be a high-end audiophile or electrician to get the Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus working within minutes of unboxing. Just connect it via the included cable into your TV’s HDMI eARC/ARC port, plug it into an AC outlet, and turn it on. The audio instantly moves from your TV’s built-in speakers to the soundbar, and if you’re connecting it to a Fire TV, you can use the remote control you already have to control both the TV and the soundbar — no coding or pairing necessary.</p>
<p>The compact 37-inch length and and light 8.8-pound weight of the Fire TV Soundbar Plus make it a natural fit on a mantelpiece below your wall-mounted big screen, or if you’re placing it on a TV stand, it’s low-profile enough to not block the screen. At that size and weight it’s also an easy speaker to mount to the wall. Wherever you end up placing it, the 3.1-channel sound is perfect for filling the room with rich, immersive sound without rattling the walls.</p>



<h2>All-Content Friendly</h2>
<p>The Fire TV Soundbar Plus’s voice-dedicated center channel ensures that you hear what’s being said, even during an action movie or live sports event, but that’s not coming at the expense of the rest of the sound. Four listening modes — Movie, Music, Sports, and Night — are all optimized to bring you the right sound mix at the right time. Connect your music source via Bluetooth and enjoy the extended bass from the built-in subwoofer, and hear the on-field ambient sound and roar of the crowd during the game while still hearing the play by play.</p>
<p>You don’t need to break the bank or break the walls of your home to wire up that monster surround-sound system in order to enjoy clear, high-quality sound. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">Not while Amazon’s running this great deal on their Fire TV Soundbar Plus — it’s just $180 right now in a limited-time deal you will not want to miss.</a></p>

Yes, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has finally been released — leaving fans searching for a fresh game to pin all their hopes and inevitable disappointment on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> release date seeming fairly assured, fans are suggesting some of Nintendo's second-tier series to hope for next. This includes Star Fox (missing in action since 2017's Star Fox 2), Golden Sun (sunset in 2010) and F-Zero (which has only seen the bitesize release of F-Zero 99 since 2004). And <em>what about Mother 3</em>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, tomorrow's Nintendo Direct will likely feature non-Nintendo games too.

(You probably do know.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This week's big Nintendo Direct airs tomorrow, Friday September 12, at 6am Pacific, 9am Eastern or 2pm UK time. It's set to be a bumper show, too, with an hour of announcements — and fan hopes of some big reveals by Nintendo are high. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond this year (and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is still slated for 2025, last we checked) we know relatively little of what Nintendo has cooking for Switch 2.

                <p>If you're looking for an alternative handheld controller for Nintendo Switch 2, popular third-party manufacturer GameSir just launched a new budget-friendly option that's worth checking out. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGP8CBQ7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameSir X5s is a $50 Bluetooth mobile controller</a> for Switch 1/2, iOS, and Android. It can hold devices measuring up to 8.38 inches and has several pro-style features and design elements that make it an intriguing substitute for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-14-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09Z1KQLW2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's Joy-Con 2 Controllers</a>.</p><p>The X5s isn't officially licensed by Nintendo. At this time, there aren't any official alternatives, and options are slim in general. I haven't tested the X5s, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamesir-g8-plus-nintendo-switch-2-handheld-controller-ergonomic-joy-con-alternative/1100-6532437/" data-ref-id="1100-6532437">I have used the higher-end GameSir G8 Plus on Switch 2</a> and were impressed by the ergonomics and build quality. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8JJRCJN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">G8 Plus retails for $80</a>--though it's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=New+%2450+Nintendo+Switch+2+Handheld+Controller+Has+Ergonomic+Grips+And+Pro-Style+Features&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-09-11+09%3A17%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-11+09%3A17%3A36&amp;fnarticle_id=6534654&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F8698108756%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-alternative-ergonomic-controller-gamesir-x5s-bluetooth-mobile%2F1100-6534654%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on sale for $70 at Walmart</a>--and has a few additional features.

Another advanced feature is dual trigger modes. The Hall Effect triggers can move linearly like a regular controller, or you can lock them as rapid-fire buttons. Speaking of rapid-fire, there's also a turbo function that can be assigned to the face buttons, bumpers, or triggers.</p><p>With GameSir's free mobile app, you can adjust stick and trigger sensitivities as well as the intensity of the dual rumble motors.

			<p>Per Famitsu's sales records published by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/famitsu-sales-9-1-25-9-7-25">Gematsu</a>, the PlayStation 5 has surpassed<strong> 7 million units sold in Japan</strong> as of September 7, 2025.</p>



<p>After the console hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-reaches-80-million-units-shipped/">80.3 million units shipped last month,</a> this is the latest hardware milestone reached, with an estimated 7,009,937 units sold in Japan between the PlayStation 5 Pro and the digital and physical versions of the base PlayStation 5 console.</p>



<p>It's leagues above the Xbox Series family of consoles, which have, according to the same list of Famitsu's latest numbers, sold only an estimated 682,927 units between the Xbox Series X/S, and is starting to catch up with the PlayStation 4, which has sold approximately 7,929,886 units in its lifetime.</p>



<p>The fact that PlayStation 5 is already catching up to the PS4 in the region shows how strong sales are in Japan for this current generation, though by that same token, it also shows just how strong the PlayStation 4's presence was in Japan, and how the PS5 continues to lag behind its predecessor in Japan, and across the world. And recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">price increases to the console across the globe</a> certainly won't help move units. </p>



<p>That said, when it comes to videogame console sales in Japan, PlayStation continues to be dwarfed by Nintendo and its family of consoles. The Nintendo Switch 2 has already sold an estimated 1,980,483, while the Nintendo Switch has sold an estimated 35,969,655 since 2017.</p>

            <p>Where do you go after making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dorfromantik-review-pc">Dorfromantik</a>, the 14th <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">best puzzle game</a> on PC? Unto infinity, chick. Unto infinity, and all the uranium-packed celestial masses it contains. Berlin-based Toukana Interactive are back with Star Birds - another “soft strategy” sim and laidback resource management game, in which you take charge of an avian asteroid-mining operation. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>The just-released early access build endeared itself to me instantly by having my bird captain quack like an Apple Macintosh, then sealed the deal with a procession of delightfully rotatable space boulders, some of which look like spangly Easter eggs and some of which look like handfuls of Emmental. Don’t call this a review, mind – I’ve barely played an hour, and the game won’t leave early access until at least this time next year – but I get the feeling Toukana are onto a good thing here. Another nice flourish: optional supply quests are presented as little dovecot windows from which a feathery Wesley Crusher peeks forth, waiting for you to accept their errand.

<p>An overview: Star Birds is broken into missions narrated by a cast of wisecracking astral warblers. The abundance of text dialogue is slightly stifling, for a puzzle game, but I suspect it’ll taper off beyond the initial tutorial sections. Each mission sees you parking your mothership next to a new asteroid field, and zooming on individual asteroids to build things and set up a production network. It starts with you socketing a launchpad into a crater, placing excavators on resource fields, and linking them to your launchpad with pipes to shuttle resources back to the mothership. 
</p><p>As the levels and story progress, you unlock and research new facilities, including chem labs that combine two kinds of resource into one. You’ll rarely find every resource you need for the quest at hand on any one asteroid. So you must build landing sites for rockets, and start moving resources between asteroids. All of this proceeds at a leisurely pace: no hazards, no mission timer.
</p>
<p>The UI consists of phat, pastel, pressable buttons that are begging for a touchscreen port. Pretty much every action is performed with the mouse. It feels like they’re treading a delicate line between efficiency and whimsy in terms of the controls, I must admit. I can imagine being annoyed by the act of dragging out snarls of pipework between structures, in a game with more threat or urgency, particularly because pipes can’t overlap. You'll probably have to go back and unravel them, whenever you need to alter the layout of your roids.
</p>
<p>In the context, though, I find the slight tangliness attractive. This is a factory sim that also wants to be a toy, and has so far stuck the landing. If you’re short of credits for construction, you can also pop down a buggy and drag out a path for it between piecemeal gold outcrops.
</p>
<p>I suspect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> players might find Star Birds too fussy, next to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dorfromantik-review-pc">bucolic immediacy</a> of popping down six-sided tiles, but people who loved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slipways">Slipways</a> and have at least a tolerance for ornithology puns should enjoy this. As may people who liked the vibe of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cobalt-core">Cobalt Core</a>, at the risk of setting a roguelike amongst the pigeons. You can find Star Birds on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719750/Star_Birds/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> actually have better cheat protection? Is another big Nintendo leaker getting overly zealous before the coming Thwomp stomp? Why does Ubisoft want to shove PVP multiplayer back into <em>Far Cry</em>? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I was up until 3:00 a.m. ET last night grinding the Depths in <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-hard-mode-time-changes-2000624664"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s new Deep of Night mode</a>. Who knew the answer to my<em> Destiny 2</em> burnout was an even more punishing loot chase that resets every 45 minutes?</p> <h2>Why are there so many leaks at Nintendo?</h2> <p>That’s what former Nintendo of America marketing staffers Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang ask <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vjxo31uVog">on their latest video</a> breaking down recent rumors about the upcoming Nintendo Direct. “They really do run a pretty tight ship on the first-party side still like we were saying,” Yang says. “Like, you’ve literally got the fear of God and being fired from your job. That fear was really real at Nintendo and you know we joke around about the Nintendo ninjas, like this is actual employees at the company. That is their job to investigate leaks. They’re a team at Nintendo that gets paid to do this and they are very elite. They’re very good at their jobs and and they will solve these cases.”</p> <p>The pair said a recent <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-leaks-mario-re7-smash-bros-2000624779">series of leaks from a user called SwitchForce</a> reminds them of Pyoro, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-leaks-youtube-pyoro-switch-2-1851563772">an infamous leaker</a> who appeared to be using a source with access to the backend of Nintendo’s websites to get information early. Pyoro later leaked his own source to <em>Bloomberg</em>, failed to break any more news after Nintendo changed how its new game pages go live online, and all but disappeared from the video game leaker-verse.</p>

 <p>“We all know what happened to Pyoro,” Ellis says. “So, I think just a word of advice to SwitchForce is be careful because, you know, yes, this can be an exciting thing of like, oh my gosh, everybody’s on pins and needles for my next update. You’re on pins and needles until you get that phone call or somebody shows up at your door and you disappear.”</p> <h2><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> will make progress in the war on cheating</h2> <p>That’s what Activision is promising <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05-reloaded#prompts">in its latest blog post</a>. It outlines how Ricochet anti-cheat features like Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 will help prevent more players from ruining matches with aim-botting and other exploits. “RICOCHET Anti-Cheat uses Remote Attestation, a process that verifies critical PC security settings directly with Microsoft, as part of its implementation of TPM 2.0,.” the company writes.</p>

 <p>It continues, “Other games may lean on Client or Local Attestation, where the system checks itself and reports back. The limitation with that method is clear: cheats can sometimes disguise or manipulate what’s being reported, effectively tricking the local system into giving a false ‘all clear.’ By contrast, Remote Attestation places the verification step with an external, trusted authority, making it exponentially harder for tampered machines to pass as legitimate.”</p> <p>Cheating will still be a thing online, but Activision says it’s getting better. “What matters, and where we’ve seen real improvement, is how quickly we adapt,” it writes. “In <em>Black Ops 6</em>, detections are faster, mitigations are stronger, and enforcement is cutting deeper into the networks that try to harm fair play. With <em>Black Ops 7</em>, hardware protections like Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 will add another layer of defense.”</p>

 <h2>Ex-Pokémon Company lawyer thinks developers will just ignore Nintendo’s latest patent</h2> <p>The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-patent-summon-digimon-2000624724">recently acquired another patent</a> for what sounds <a href="https://x.com/inkydojikko/status/1965804322081722834">like the auto-battling feature</a>&nbsp;from its most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvNJKIG51g8&amp;t=5">recent<em> Pokémon Violet</em> and <em>Scarlet</em> games</a>. It comes amid the ongoing legal fight with PocketPair over <em>Palworld</em>, but could seemingly have repercussions for lots of other creature collecting games. Or maybe not. “I wish Nintendo and Pokémon good luck when the first other developer just entirely ignores this patent and, if those companies sue that developer, the developer shows decades of prior art,” former chief legal officer at The Pokémon Company Don McGowan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">told <em>Eurogamer</em></a>. “This isn’t <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-now-allowed-auxiliary-mini-games-during-loading-screens">Bandai Namco with the loading screen patent</a>.”</p> <h2>A 2023 shooter finally gets a kill-cam, but not on Xbox Series S</h2> <p>Free-to-play multiplayer FPS <em>The Finals</em> has received a familiar feature nearly two years after launch, but only for the most powerful consoles (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-finals-finally-gets-a-killcam-but-not-on-xbox-series-s-ps4-and-certain-pc-builds">via <em>IGN</em></a>). “We had to calculate everything that matters: player movement, environmental destruction, object interactions in a level of data fidelity that’s hard to pull off in a Dynamism Shooter,” Embark Studios writes in <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/800">a new season 8 blog post</a>. “Then take all that info and quickly reconstruct the moment.” Microsoft usually requires feature parity between current-gen console versions, but has been bending the rules more and more. <em>The Finals</em>‘ kill-cam won’t be on PS4 either.</p>

 <h2>A tiny new update just sneaked out for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></h2> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1091500/view/503961862016073928">Patch 2.31</a> has fixed AutoDrive so that cars will now drive more smoothly when taking players to their destinations. No more getting stuck behind other cars or jerking to a stop at lights. Johnny also no longer always spawns in the passenger seat when using the Delamain Cab service. Plus, the Photo Mode is gender neutral when it comes to poses now. My favorite bug fix? The Yaiba Semimaru no longer flips over during the Motorbreath chase, which was breaking the quest.</p> <h2><em>Far Cry</em> will push multiplayer more in the future</h2> <p>That’s according to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot who recently spoke at Saudi Arabia’s New Global Sport Conference. “On<em> Far Cry</em>, it’s really to bring the multiplayer aspects more predominantly pushed so that it can also be played for a long time by players,” he said, according to <em>Game File</em>. Alongside the unannounced <em>Far Cry 7</em>, Ubisoft has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/">also reportedly been</a> working on a <em>Far Cry</em> extraction shooter spin-off. Unlike <em>Far Cry 5</em>, which had an entire map editor for multiplayer, <em>Far Cry 6</em> backed away from online PVP gameplay.</p> <p>But wait, what was Guillemot doing in Saudi Arabia to begin with? He was there to publicly reveal a Saudi-based DLC for <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em>, among other things. Is it funded by Saudi Arabia’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367">controversial Public Investment Fund</a>? Ubisoft won’t say one way or the other. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia"><em>Game File</em> notes</a> that the person on stage interviewing Guillemot said, “Well, congratulations on the deal. It sounds very exciting.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/school-shooting-gun-violence-video-games-rfk-jr-2000624665">RFK partly blames video games for school shootings just days before new ones hit the headlines</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/its-the-perfect-time-to-play-assassins-creed-shadows-2000624758">Here’s why it’s a good time to go finish <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-reviews-team-cherry-2000624674">Steam reviewers can’t believe how stingy <em>Silksong</em> is</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The sword of the Faithful. <a href="https://t.co/dL9erhNJdC">pic.twitter.com/dL9erhNJdC</a></p> <p>— The Lord of the Rings (@TheRingsofPower) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRingsofPower/status/1965822642016997550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

That's because Borderlands 4 features the most seamless open-world environments in the series' history. At launch, there are four major regions: Fadefields, Terminus Range, Carcadia Burn, and Dominion. Each one is filled with countless collectibles and optional objectives.</p><h2 id="Borderlands_4_campaign_mission_list">Borderlands 4 campaign mission list</h2><p>Below, you can see a list of the main missions in Borderlands 4's campaign:</p><p>Intro and Fadefields arc:</p><ul><li>Guns Blazing</li><li>Recruitment Drive</li><li>Down and Outbound</li><li>A Lot to Process</li><li>One Fell Swoop</li><li>Rush the Gate</li></ul><p>Terminus Range arc:</p><ul><li>Shadow of the Mountain</li><li>Crystal Brawl</li><li>Dark Subject</li><li>His Vile Sanctum</li></ul><p>Carcadia Burn arc:</p><ul><li>Wrath of the Ripper Queen</li><li>Siege and Destroy</li><li>Unpaid Tab</li><li>Her Flaming Vision</li></ul><p>Finale and Dominion arc:</p><ul><li>Rising Action</li><li>Another Day, Another Universe</li><li>The Falling Wall</li><li>Means of Ascent</li><li>Plan Z</li><li>The Timekeeper's Order</li><li>Secrets of the Vault</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> Initially, the Terminus Range and Carcadia Burn regions won't be accessible to you. However, you'll be able to venture into these areas upon completing "A Lot to Process."

If you're up for it, you could look for 200 Marcus Bobbleheads that are so well-hidden that they don't have tracking icons on the world map.</li><li>World Events - From time to time, you might stumble upon a World Event that's happening in a particular zone. It's easier to tackle these if you have buddies with you, but they still occur even if you're offline.</li><li>Side quests - Numerous NPCs have side quests that you can complete.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4565756-borderlands-4-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-mission-list-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4565756" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="1152" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4565756-borderlands-4-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-mission-list-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4565756"></a><figcaption>Safehouses, Order Silos, Bunkers, Crawlers, and various points-of-interest dot the lands of Kairos.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4565756-borderlands-4-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-mission-list-3.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Extending_your_playtime__Multiplayer_shenanigans__new_characters__the_looter_shooter_grind__and_Ultimate_Vault_Hunter_mode">Extending your playtime: Multiplayer shenanigans, new characters, the looter-shooter grind, and Ultimate Vault Hunter mode</h3><p>As with other games in the series, the campaign in Borderlands 4 is just a prelude to the biggest facet that would keep you preoccupied: The endgame. Once you've finished the story, you get to try all sorts of new functions, such as weekly Big Encore and Wildcard Missions. These allow you to replay activities at a higher difficulty and with additional modifiers.</p><p>Given that this is a looter-shooter game, you can expect a non-stop grind as you amass top-tier weapons and gear pieces. You might even find <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-best-firmware-mods-set-bonuses-guide/2900-7017/" data-ref-id="2900-7017"><strong>Firmware mods</strong></a> that offer amazing set bonuses.</p><p>And, of course, it's more fun to play with friends, especially once you unlock Ultimate Vault Hunter mode. The higher the difficulty, the greater the challenge. Naturally, that means you'll earn better rewards, too. Oh, and compared to previous titles in the series, you can finally make new characters/classes at level 30, all while skipping the entirety of the campaign.</p><p>That does it for our guide on how long it takes to beat Borderlands 4. We hope you're ready for what lies ahead, because things are about to go bonkers as you blitz and blast your way through the world of Kairos.</p><p>From exploring vast frontiers to watching legendary loot rain down on you, there's a lot to keep you engaged as you continue your adventures as a Vault Hunter.

                <p>Valve's popular The International tournament for Dota 2 kicked off today in Germany, and company co-founder Gabe Newell addressed the crowd with some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URUli8Pv1Vc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opening remarks</a> in which he said he has grown to love the game and still plays it every day despite facing some online harassment.</p><p>"Before that first International [in 2011], I really enjoyed the game, but after The International, I loved the game. It's not just the game I love, but the community. Sure, people talk shit at me in chat and about once a week, people say, 'Hey, noob, uninstall the game and [bleeped out],' but that's really about their enthusiasm for the game and the energy that they bring. And that's why after all these years, I still play Dota every day," Newell said.</p><p>The first The International took place 14 years ago in Cologne, Germany, the same city where Gamescom is held annually.

            <p>
CD Projekt Red is still updating its sci-fi RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, now releasing Patch 2.31 across PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Mac, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
The patch updates AutoDrive so vehicles drive smoothly, overtake blocking vehicles, and won't stop at traffic lights. There's also an adjustment to Photo Mode so that poses work with any gender and NPC collision has been disabled.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere there are a number of fixes and tweaks, including some specific to PC and Mac. You can see the full patch notes below.
</p>
<blockquote><strong>Vehicles</strong>
<ul>
<li>Updated AutoDrive. When driving to a selected point, the vehicle now drives smoothly, overtakes blocking vehicles, and no longer stops at traffic lights. Free Roam mode has also been upgraded to follow traffic rules and navigate the city more reliably.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Johnny always spawned in the passenger seat when using the Delamain Cab service.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where applying CrystalCoat to the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru caused its wheels to flash in different colors.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Photo Mode</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most of the new poses introduced in Update 2.3 now work with any gender.</li>
<li>Disabled NPC collision, which will make it easier to position NPCs on top of other objects with collision (e.g. on car hoods).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where some of the poses didn't work for Royce.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Quests &amp; Open World</strong>
<ul>
<li>Freedom - Fixed the journal entry that appears when the player chooses not to steal the Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred."</li>
<li>Motorbreath - Fixed an issue where, after V fails to pursue and stop Semimaru and receives a text from River saying he'll contact V soon, the follow-up message never arrives.</li>
<li>Motorbreath - Fixed an issue where the Yaiba Semimaru could flip over during the chase, preventing the player from entering it.</li>
<li>Motorbreath - It's no longer possible to trigger the quest if River died during The Hunt.</li>
<li>Motorbreath - Players can now acquire the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru through AUTOFIXER even if they failed The Hunt, which normally unlocks the side quest where the vehicle is obtained.</li>
<li>Nitro (Youth Energy) - Fixed a game crash that could occur in certain circumstances after leaving the Yaiba showroom event.</li>
<li>Nitro (Youth Energy) - Fixed an issue where the proxy interface UI in the Yaiba showroom is cut off when the "Larger HUD Elements" setting is enabled.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed several localization and lipsync issues in various languages.</li>
<li>Added a toggle to disable vignette. It can be found in Settings → Graphics → Basic.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on PC and Mac where Ray-Traced Reflections might not display correctly when enabled under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Fixed several issues with displaying text messages from Delamain.</li>
<li>Various fixes for fluff vendors.</li>
</ul>
<strong>PC-specific</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where NVIDIA Reflex could be disabled while DLSS Frame Generation was enabled, causing the screen to turn pink.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Path Tracing didn't activate properly in certain scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Mac-specific</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where changing graphics presets on Mac set Screen Space Reflections to a higher setting compared to the equivalent presets on PC.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing a permanent white screen when Frame Generation is enabled while entering the braindance in The Information.</li>
<li>Selecting "Defaults" in Video Settings no longer turns HDR Mode off.</li>
<li>Fixed the inverted behavior of the "Mute Game in Background" toggle in Settings.</li>
<li>Removed the outdated "(Requires Game Restart)" disclaimer from the mouseover description of the "Disable Spatial Audio" setting.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on the App Store version that caused the game to become stuck on the “Press Space to continue” breaching screen.</li>
<li>Various stability and performance optimizations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Really it's remarkable CDPR is still so committed to updating the game years after release - it's better now than it's ever been.

Three years after Netflix announced it was turning Irrational Games' acclaimed underwater shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> into a live-action film, its producer has suggested its still some way off, confirming that work continues on its script.
</p>
<p>
The streaming service <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-is-turning-bioshock-into-a-live-action-film">first publicly discussed a BioShock movie back in February 2022</a>, when it was accompanied by grandiose talk of developing a whole cinematic universe around the BioShock games. After a lengthy silence, producer Roy Lee last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-bioshock-adaptation-will-be-a-more-personal-film-as-opposed-to-a-grander-big-project">confirmed plans had changed</a> and that budget cuts at Netflix meant it would now be a "much smaller" film told from a "more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project."
</p>
<p>
Another year on, and Lee is chattering again, this time offering an update on the project's progress in conversation with <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/bioshock-movie-story-game">The Direct</a>. As to why it's taking so long, he explained in part that's down to the BioShock movie having been delayed a "little bit" so the team could do "some more script work". Amid all this, director Francis Lawrence has been busy with the movie adaptation of Stephen King's The Long Walk, and he'll remain occupied helming the upcoming The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping. "So it's just waiting for him whenever the Hunger Games is completed," Lee added.

Additionally, Lee confirmed the BioShock movie's script is still "being worked on right now". But the hope seems to be it'll be ready by the time Sunrise on the Reaping is done. As to what the movie will focus on, Lee remains cagey, saying, "Netflix wants us to keep everything under wraps". He did, however, reveal it'll definitely be based on Irrational's first BioShock game.
</p><p>
Netflix isn't the first company to attempt a BioShock movie. Back in 2008, Universal announced its own adaptation with Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski onboard - but it never came to fruition. Explaining the project's demise in 2013, BioShock creator Ken Levine <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levine-personally-killed-off-the-bioshock-film-heres-why">revealed publisher 2K had given him the option to cancel it</a> after Verbinski's departure - and so he did.
</p>
<p>A fourth BioSchock game, originally announced in 2019, is currently in the works at developer Cloud Chamber, but 2K recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-studio-reportedly-facing-layoffs-as-former-diablo-boss-takes-over-amid-development-turmoil">confirmed</a> it was "reducing the size of the development team" as it looks to "rework certain aspects" of the purportedly troubled project.
