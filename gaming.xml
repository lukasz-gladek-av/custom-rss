Even like 2014, it was already an idea floating around the studio that she's next. In Witcher 3, Geralt is just helping out… he is there for her. So it was pretty clear we want her as the next... main character."</p>

"[Ciri]'s a cool character from The Witcher, and they're gonna focus on that character, and that's awesome... If you read the books, then you understand why CD Projekt went down this avenue. There's a whole rich world of stuff to explore with Ciri, that they didn't do when they put her into Witcher 3, because the story was about Geralt. But she hints at it."</p><p>Sebastian Kalemba, the director of The Witcher 4, has said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-on-ciri-gwent-and-in-game-romance/1100-6528580/" data-ref-id="1100-6528580">there will be romance in the game</a>, and indicated a desire for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-wants-players-to-feel-the-rewards-for-their-choices/1100-6531667/" data-ref-id="1100-6531667">players to feel rewarded</a> for their choices as Ciri.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/f1-25-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>With the Monaco Grand Prix now in the tiny little wing mirrors of this year’s F1 season, it feels like the perfect time to drop into the latest F1 game from Codemasters and EA. Interest in the premier motorsport category has never been higher, and this yearly game series has sought to make steady improvement, adding much-requested gameplay features while pushing ever closer to visual realism in the cars and tracks year-on-year. While F1 25 is undoubtedly a further refinement, rather than a revolution, this is, incrementally, the best F1 game to date.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 25 Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5rWBgBjDsc?list=PLdeld3cKzBQ_WW7TUUJIQCGVu6DgEzdhB" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>F1 25 gives you a full digital representation of the sport of F1. That means you can play through full seasons of multiple grand prix events, with real-life stars like Lando Norris and Max Verstappen, fresh-faced rookies such as Gabriel Bortoleto or Isack Hadjar, or your own created character aiming for greatness on track. It’s as compelling as it ever has been.</p>


<p>Alongside that, this year sees the return of Braking Point, the extensive story-led mode that focuses on the fictional Konnersport team. The hateful Davidoff Butler is now owner of Konnersport, and he looms like a grim figure over the opening chapters of this year’s tale. There’s a huge change to come though, throwing the team into disarray, and though the emotional beats don’t consistently hit home, I really enjoyed playing through the team’s dramatic rollercoaster season.</p>
<p>Alongside the on-track action, where you take control of both Callie Mayer and Aiden Jackson, you have to take some light control of the team’s leadership, deciding on the right time for press and marketing, or focusing more on elements that will improve your car’s performance.</p>

<p>Besides that, you have to court the press, getting to choose Callie or Aiden’s responses in their post-race interviews, again aiming to boost various stats. While those incremental gains feel less essential, getting to embody and take part in a fuller spectrum of your team and driver’s activities helps to put you at the centre of the action.</p>

<p>Once you’re done with Konnersport’s dramas, you can carry the team through into the main career mode, taking up an 11th spot in the pits. It’ll be interesting to see if they’re there again next year, as Cadillac will fill that slot, but for now, Konnersport feel like a legitimate addition, if not for fans of ultra-realism.</p>
<p>Of course, Braking Point doesn’t have the sole place on the drama grid this year, with the F1 Movie also coming along for the ride. The film, due out in June and starring Brad Pitt, appears here as a series of playable chapters alongside clips from the film. The first is in place at launch, with the rest due to arrive on the 30th of June. It’s a pleasing inclusion, but it’s very much a small taster of what is to come. The most important aspect? Being able to take that 11th spot in Career mode away from Konnersport and putting APXGP there instead. Honestly, Brad Pitt’s character model is worth it alone.</p>
<p>I assume that the majority of players are here to play multiple seasons of the Career mode, taking their favourite team, whether a proven winner like Mclaren, a fan-favourite like Haas, or a fictional creation (which can be of your own making) to the Constructors’ Championship. Various improvements have been made to the behind the scenes action here, from research and development being unique to each of the cars in your garage, to more in-depth facility expansions. They’re solid improvements, and the overall process is now more satisfying rather than perfunctory.</p>
<p>Adapting from the previous year’s outing to the altered handling in F1 25 proved to be surprisingly tricky at first. For all that F1 24’s handling model came under fire from the community, we’ve continued to play the game throughout the past 12 months, and though it had various foibles, we never felt at a disadvantage. The new model is fundamentally more realistic, with less grip and increased differences between the different tyre types, including clearer and more incremental tyre degradation.</p>

<p>That said, playing on controller is now much tougher, requiring even more precise and granular trigger inputs, while there’s seemingly far more chance of locking up. The wheel handling, meanwhile, has been significantly improved, feeling far more settled and precise, making it the better choice for F1 25 right now. For those members of the community looking for a more realistic and enjoyable experience, I think that Codemasters have nailed it.</p>
<p>The computer AI for other racers helps to cement that. While last year’s opponents tended to be more timid, here the AI has been made far more aggressive, pushing harder and racing as though they actually want to win.</p>
<p>There’s also more humanity to them, with genuine variation and variability to their performances. While you can rely on the best racers continuing to perform as you’d expect, the game offers more chances of an unusual result, or a racer having a spectacular race, than we probably get in the real world. It doesn’t undo the push for realism, instead injecting some excitement, but some players may dislike it.</p>
<p>Visually, this is the best-looking F1 game we’ve ever had. Everything here looks more detailed, and five tracks – Melbourne, Bahrain, Miami, Imola and Suzuka – have received the laser-scanning LIDAR treatment, making them even more precise to the actual circuit. These are now so close to the real-life track as to be nearly indistinguishable; it’s only disappointing that it’s limited to a small percentage of the overall whole. We reviewed on PS5, where the game looks great, but PC players can push for more ray tracing features, right up to a full path-traced option.</p>

<p>For those who’ve been racing around the same tracks for years, F1 25 also adds in the option to race some of them in reverse. Silverstone, Austria and Zandvoort can now be experienced backwards, making those well-known corners and racing lines completely null and void. It’s another interesting inclusion, and probably best for those most invested in the series, but it does open up some possibilities if the real-world sport ever needs a shake-up.</p>
<p>The improved visuals extend off track, particularly in Braking Point, and Codemasters have clearly worked on the character and facial animations to make the whole experience feel closer to watching an F1 production, or a TV show like Drive to Survive. Each of the racers also look closer than ever before to their real-life counterparts, and it just brings F1 25 closer to the real-life sport, which is exactly what every fan wants.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-credits-soundtrack<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm woefully behind on checking out <em>Skin Deep</em>, an immersive sim by Blendo Games that came out at the end of April, despite the fact that it is an immersive sim and thus the ideal Riley game. I finally started playing last night; while I'm still coming to grips with what feels like its intentionally clunky controls, I absolutely love its opening credits.</p><p><strong>(Light spoilers for the narrative setup of <em>Skin Deep</em>.)</strong></p><p>Playing the early hours last night, I forgot that we hadn't seen a title sequence until the game smash-cut into an intro. Like a reward for having to suffer through a <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">camera quest</a>, the game suddenly launches into a jazzy, Bond movie-style opening. It has some clever rhymes, some great riffs, and you even get to walk around a bit in an arena of giant props and furniture.    </p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Skin Deep (2025) — Opening/Intro Scene" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z4DdKOf6f9s?start=97&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The song tells a little narrative of facing off against a powerful enemy (who is... also you?) and shifts the vibes of the game from a slapstick comedy into something classy and intriguing. It ends, satisfyingly, on the game's title, something I'm always a sucker for. I love how the style of the song paints a contrast to my experience so far of getting myself stuck in dusty vents and running around spaceships desperately looking for a place to dump angry heads before someone else finds me. </p><p>In a <a href="https://www.startmenu.co.uk/home/skin-deep-music-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conversation with Start Menu</a>, composer Priscilla Snow said the current opening was their second take, with the first being a "slinky lounge song." Snow brought on collaborators and added the song's excellent brass arrangement, and said that while the song was “definitely the most difficult track to get through...

"There will be another video game, for sure," Meurisse said. The executive wasn't ready to announce specifics necessarily, which makes sense considering Clair Obscur launched only just over a month ago. But he did say the team's experience from making the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-rpgs/2900-5272/" data-ref-id="2900-5272">RPG</a> will be beneficial going forward.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Plus the team has grown up, has acquired new skills throughout production," said Meurisse. "Many of them were junior when we started. We learned to work together. So I can't wait to get to the next project, because we'll start from a more efficient position than when we started the company five years ago.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer Build a Rocket Boy has debuted a new trailer for its upcoming game, MindsEye, ahead of its release in just a couple of weeks, at the time of writing on<a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-gets-june-10-release-date-pre-orders-and-new-story-trailer/"> June 10, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>The new trailer is a six-and-a-half-minute 'introduction' to MindsEye, showcasing plenty of details about the game's story, some new looks at gameplay, and digging a bit into the post-launch content and the level-creation tools that are featured in the PC version of the game.</p>
<p>MindsEye's creation tool gives PC players access to the game's assets, and according to the trailer, allows players to create "<em>anything</em>" they can think of, and touts that Build a Rocket Boy is "<em>passionate about democratizing video game development</em>."</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Regarding MindsEye's roadmap, the game will launch with its single-player campaign and several different additional gameplay scenarios, with more to be added later in the year during the summer, fall, and winter. There's also a 'premium pass' that players can purchase that'll provide what Build a Rocket Boy classifies as 'extra' missions, along with each of the planned free updates and cosmetic packs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing MindsEye - Explainer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s3jVJaFrbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em>We're beyond excited to bring MindsEye to players worldwide,</em>" said Leslie Benzies, former Rockstar producer who worked on the Grand Theft Auto series since GTA III, now founder of Build a Rocket Boy and director of MindsEye, in a press release.</p>
<p>"<em>Our team has poured their passion and dedication into creating MindsEye and the Game Creation System for almost a decade, to deliver players an unforgettable story campaign and empower them to craft their own world-class experiences. Continuous updates and fresh new content from our studio ensure MindsEye is an endless adventure.</em>"</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how players react to MindsEye when it launches. There's pedigree behind the game due to Benzies' history, and everything we've seen in gameplay trailers so far looks incredibly flashy.</p>
<p>But recent previews haven't been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aob_eBUBwNU">too high on what was shown</a>, and as recently as this past weekend, <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Build-a-Rocket-Boy-Reviews-E2397452.htm?filter.iso3Language=eng">Glassdoor</a> reviews from former and current employees are making the rounds on <a href="https://x.com/GameRoll_/status/1926754035144536233">social media</a> describing Build a Rocket Boy as bad place to work, with some reviews telling developers to "<em>avoid</em>" the studio "<em>at all costs</em>," others call out Benzies directly for his poor management of the studio, and many describe Build a Rocket Boy to be a toxic place to work.</p>
<p>Realistically, Build a Rocket Boy wouldn't be the first, nor would it be the last game studio to have poor internal working conditions and is still able to release an amazing game. So all this concern about the poor previews and bad internal conditions at the studio could be quickly forgotten by players as they're enamored with the next-best-game of 2025. We'll see what happens on June 10.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-reach-3-3m-in-33-days.1199496/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sandfall Interactive has announced that its turn-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has reached a fun sales milestone in a very appropriate number of days.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:kazma5qkd2r37qfwftqh3lct/post/3lq5u7no5522n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Sandfall says that&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has reached 3.3 million sales in 33 days. As the studio says, it "couldn't make that up"; Sandfall describes the milestone as "another entry on the long list of surreal moments that [fans'] support has made real".</p>

<p>The new sales milestone means that&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur&nbsp;</em>has picked up another 1.3 million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">in the last three weeks</a>, so while sales have perhaps slowed down a tad since launch, the game is still performing admirably.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3.3m-maelle.jpg?itok=t3W0Lz5f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3.3m-maelle.jpg?itok=J2Xr7oRW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is still selling pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>Right out of the gate,&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>proved popular with players, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">managing to sell 500,000 copies</a> within its first 24 hours on sale.</p>

<p>These sales milestones are particularly impressive considering that Sandfall's game is available via Game Pass, which means that 3.3 million players have picked the game up outside of Microsoft's subscription service.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it's a turn-based RPG in which you play as the titular Expedition 33, a group who must set out from the Paris-inspired city of Lumiere to seek out and defeat a figure known as the Paintress.</p>

<p>In the world of the game, the Paintress paints a number each year, and everyone of that age dies. The number decreases by one each year, and so it's up to Expedition 33 to figure out what's going on and put a stop to it if possible.</p>




<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>mixes traditional JRPG-style overworld and dungeon exploration with a turn-based combat system that also includes a real-time parry mechanic, so if you like your turn-based battling with a bit more spice, this one's for you.</p>

Described as a “reimagined interactive music experience,” Dance with Sabrina will challenge players within the Festival Jam Stage to fill up their heart meters by matching the beat of some of Carpenter’s songs like “Espresso” and “Bed Chem” as her avatar performs them on stage. </p><p>By racking up the most hearts, <em>Festival</em> players will be able to “contribute to the show” during the next song in one of three roles: Dance Leader, Special Effects Pro, or Video Artist. Players who match the most beats throughout the entire event will be pictured along with Carpenter’s avatar in the Dance With Sabrina finale snapshot.</p><p>Some <em>Just Dance</em>-style dancing would have been very cool to see in <em>Fortnite</em>, but Dance with Sabrina sounds a bit more like timed button mashing with some emoting thrown in for pizazz. That doesn’t exactly seem like the most entertaining prospect, but this is part of how Epic figures out what works, and what doesn’t.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>You may remember that in January of 2022, A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-pooh stories entered the public domain, inspiring deeply crap ideas like "what if children's character but knives?" in the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh:_Blood_and_Honey">Blood And Honey</a> , and "what if children's character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Screwed">but mildly naughty word?</a>", in the case of smirking billboardian human doppelganger Ryan Reynolds. Videogames were not immune. "What if children's character but Cronenbergian body horror?" asked the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/winnies-hole">Winnie's Hole</a> when they announced a roguelike dungeon crawler based on the bear in 2023, and there's now a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2319730/Winnies_Hole/">Steam demo </a>available, should you wish to scoop up honey with arms-where-no-arms-should-rightly-be.</p>

<p>Unlike Ryan Reynolds, developer Twice Different have at least made things worth the Mint Mobile receipts they're printed on before, reckons Nate (RPS in peace), who enjoyed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-ring-of-pain">despicable owl-em-up Ring Of Pain</a>. That was also a card-shuffling dungeon crawler. This time around you'll be playing as a Winnie-borne virus, mutating through the bear's yellow innards to "refine his primitive form" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> sections, then commandeering your freakish host in roguelike battles. After a trailer? Eeyore then…</p>

<li>Evolve with each run - Unlock new Perks, Mutations and Virus Strains.</li>
<li>Mutate your host as a symbiotic virus.</li>
<li>Bodybuilding in the worst way.</li>
<li>A storybook narrative which reimagines Winnie in a world of dark science.</li>
<li>A fresh take on exploration, replacing the typical roguelite node map with strategic, turn-based building using a set of tetromino-like virus blocks which you can evolve and reshape.</li>
<li>Dynamic battle system where each turn is an action combo for fast-paced gameplay.</li>
<li>Holesome horror comedy with gritty art inspired by old school Nickelodeon and Brothers' Grimm fairytales.</li>

<p>Winnie's Hole is out later this year. If you're a developer that fancies parodying Mickey Mouse for whatever commercial use you'd like please reach out to me, Nic Reuben, the sole rights holder. Mario too. Maybe you could...make them kiss? It's up to you!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-final-update-absolution-is-out-on-june-3/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-final-update-%E2%80%98absolution%E2%80%99-is-out-on-june-3.1199463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-final-update-absolution-is-out-on-june-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, ArenaNet announced that the final update for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-finally-launched-bringing-in-housing-mechanism-new-raids-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds expansion</a> will be released on June 3.</p>
<p>Titled 'Absolution', the update follows '<a href="https://wccftech.com/arenanet-to-release-godspawn-update-for-guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-on-november-19-featuring-new-50-player-titan-battle-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godspawn</a>' and '<a href="https://wccftech.com/repentance-guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-second-update-is-out-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Repentance</a>' to conclude the trio of free updates that the developer had planned for Janthir Wilds. In this patch, players will find additions to game modes, new rewards, and a new map and story. Story-wise, they'll get to experience the robust and action-packed finale for themselves as they discover the ancient secrets at the heart of the Primordial Egress on Tyria’s frontiers.</p>
<p>The crumbling city of Bava Nisos, once a monument to Mursaat glory, lies twisted beneath three centuries of magic. The final descent to the heart of this new explorable zone involves a map-wide meta event that will lead players to the Mists Gate — the focal point of the titan invasion in Janthir. Alongside this new content, a new boss — the titan Ura — will be added to the Convergence game mode, which is designed for groups of up to 50 players.</p>
<p><iframe title="Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds – &quot;Absolution&quot;" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0boXkTbLZ8o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Absolution also adds a new Fractal dungeon (Kinfall) to Guild Wars 2 in which players take on the role of a lowland Kodan and experience events from their cultural past. They will uncover the whispers of the elder dragon Jormag for the first time — an event which preceded their migration from northern Tyria to the Janthir Wilds.</p>
<p>The Homesteads housing feature will also be enhanced: the decoration limit will double from 1,000 to 2,000 objects, enabling players to create denser living spaces, and the Homestead Mastery level will increase to 500, granting access to new crafted decorations. A host of new rewards, including a legendary backpack and glider, new weapon sets, new relics, and updated offerings in the Wizards' Vault, will bring the 2024 expansion cycle to a close.</p>
<p>Given the <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-qa-arenanet-on-switch-to-yearly-expansions-secrets-of-the-obscure-learnings-and-2024-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switch to yearly expansions</a>, ArenaNet should announce the next one in the coming weeks.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/with-the-switch-technology-finally-caught-up-to-nintendo.1199460/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/671323/nintendo-switch-2-wii-u-technology-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nintendo Switch is on the cusp of becoming Nintendo’s bestselling hardware ever. In retrospect, it’s easy to see why: it’s a device that seamlessly transitions from a home console to a handheld, erasing the distinction between the two. It’s been so successful that Nintendo isn’t changing all that much with the Switch 2. But both consoles are well-executed versions of ideas Nintendo has been working on since the failed Wii U — and maybe even earlier.</p><p>Purely by sales numbers, the Wii U was a flop. The Switch has sold more than 150 million units in its eight-year lifetime. The Wii U, by comparison, sold 13.56 million units — less than a 10th of what the Switch did — making it Nintendo’s worst-selling home console.</p><p>As a result, it had a much shorter lifespan, launching in late 2012 before being superseded by the Switch about four and a half years later. But many of its ideas and its games were not only excellent, they were also well ahead of their time, and, in some ways, predicted several modern trends in gaming.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The Wii U, with its tablet controller, <em>also</em> worked as a device that could play games on a TV or in handheld mode. The ability to see a game on a big screen or curl up with it on the couch is an enduring one, as the existence of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">PlayStation Portal</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a> now show. The concept has become a whole category of video game hardware, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295461/dont-expect-an-xbox-handheld-any-time-soon">even Xbox wants to make a handheld now</a>. Nintendo’s interest in the idea long preceded the Wii U, as it toyed with handheld-to-TV connections with things like the Game Boy Advance’s ability to connect to the GameCube or the Super Game Boy add-on for the SNES.</p><p>The Wii U had the major limitation that you couldn’t play the games if you were too far away from the console, so they weren’t truly portable. The tablet’s battery life wasn’t great, either, so you could only play for so long before having to charge it.</p><p>The Switch improved on all of these ideas. Instead of a TV-connected console that could beam a game to the tablet, the Switch was a tablet that could easily display on a TV. The Switch’s dock made that connection seamless, as it was nearly impossible to mess up just dropping the Switch into the dock so that it could show up on your TV. (And easily recharge the console’s battery.)</p><p>Many of the Switch’s defining games started out on the Wii U. <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, the Switch’s bestselling title by far, is a port of <em>Mario Kart 8</em> for the Wii U. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> was originally going to be a Wii U exclusive before Nintendo decided to release it for the Switch as well. The first <em>Splatoon</em> title launched on Wii U before getting a pair of Switch sequels, and so did the original <em>Super Mario Maker</em>. <em>Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</em>, <em>Super Mario 3D World</em>, <em>Pikmin 3</em>, and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> are all great Wii U games that got new life on the Switch.</p><p>The Switch 2 looks to build off that legacy by being backward compatible with the vast majority of Switch games, including the Switch versions of those Wii U classics. <em>Breath of the Wild</em> will even be getting a third version for the new console <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641365/nintendo-zelda-botw-totk-switch-2-edition-announced">with technical improvements</a>. Features like <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ffeatures%2Fgameshare%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooxJmrZ9_LELPmfqNiku1Sqt5QJ9PgrBzcoRhyVg18GcqRqb4gB" rel="sponsored">GameShare</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">GameChat</a> could also help people more easily play games with their friends.</p><p>Before the first Switch came out in March 2017, Nintendo was aggressively moving on from the Wii U. Production of the console ended in Japan <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wii-u-production-is-dead-in-japan-long-live-the-wii-u/">in January of that year</a>, and the company was also dipping its toes into mobile as another avenue to reach players. Even at the time, the company seemed to realize that it was on to something with the concept. It was just too early. This is something <em>Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em> creator Shigeru Miyamoto seemed keenly aware of in a 2016 interview with my colleague Andrew Webster around the release of the mobile game <em>Super Mario Run</em>.</p><p>“I hope people will continue to recognize the areas where Nintendo has taken that first step,” Miyamoto <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/8/13878378/super-mario-run-iphone-nintendo-shigeru-miyamoto-interview">told <em>The Verge</em></a>. “And hopefully someday people will look back on the Wii U and think ‘Oh wow, I remember when Nintendo did that, and now look at what’s come of that.’”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This culminates on the third day, where if players were successful in surviving the night must take on one of the Nightlords—new bosses for this version. Nightfarers must learn to cooperate to take down these challenges, combining their unique abilities together for an unparalleled experience in the <em><a title="Games > Elden Ring [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a></em> universe. All is not lost for those who fall in defeat.

While individually powerful, their skills grow even more formidable when united as a team.</li><li><strong>Take on the Night</strong> – Overcome a relentless environmental threat that sweeps through a land that changes between each game session and defeat the magnificent boss of that night!</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

			<p>In January 2024, legendary game designer Hideo Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new partnership with Sony to create Physint, a new tactical espionage game in the vein of Metal Gear. While Kojima's focus is currently on Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which launches next month on PlayStation 5, the veteran developer also discussed what drove him to go back to this kind of project.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://pocketmags.com/eu/edge-magazine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EDGE</a> (issue 411, July 2025), he said that the people's wishes for a new Metal Gear game were important in the decision:</p>
<p><em>Of course, I have lots of new ideas that I want to create. But when I became sick during the pandemic, I realised that a lot of people wanted me to make something like Metal Gear. That’s when I had the idea for a new espionage game. I reflected and thought the idea was good. I took it to Sony and they were incredibly supportive. We explored many options, and we agreed on doing Physint. This made me think that these multiplatform projects will help the studio live on – not just through games but in other media too. We’re exploring other forms of entertainment as well, so we are a game company, but not only a game company. This is phase two for Kojima Productions.</em></p>
<p>Kojima had recently talked about Physint in another interview, revealing that fans will have to wait a long time - five to six years - before playing the game. That's likely because after Death Stranding 2: On the Beach the studio will focus on <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OD</a>, the supposedly revolutionary game he's making for Xbox and with the collaboration of Jordan Peele. The game will feature a cast with actors like Sophia Lillis (Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and German actor Udo Kier.</p>
<p>Following the release of Physint, Kojima said that he could finally make a movie, which was his lifelong dream.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preview-pax-east-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-preview-brilliant-updates-to-classic-jrpgs.1199403/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preview-pax-east-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At PAX East 2025, we had the opportunity to sit down and go hands-on with <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>, a continuation of the Erdrick Trilogy, which chronologically begins with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review-all-that-glitters-are-pixels" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em></a>, released last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though released decades ago on aged hardware, the <em>Dragon Quest </em>legacy is one that JRPG fans have followed very closely, with a huge amount of excitement for these remakes to come to modern consoles. From my hands-on <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> preview experience, there's plenty to look forward to.</p>



<h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> Is a Streamlined JRPG&nbsp;</h2>

<p>When people think of JRPGs and turn-based combat systems, it's easy to picture a slower-paced and methodical battle system. What I found great about <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> is that you can speed up the battle animations to your preference, with Ultra-Fast allowing you to speed through combat encounters extremely quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is perfect for those looking to grind out experience in the overworld or who want to spend more time exploring the lush and beautiful open world. These two games were built from the ground-up for the modern era, and playing a sample of both games on a PS5 proved how optimized these builds are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not only does the HD-2D art style bring the world into brilliantly sharp focus with vivid and colorful landscapes, but it also runs extremely smoothly – no frame drops noticed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> is an excellent follow-up to <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake </em>for those who might want to dive into <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/history-dragon-quest" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest</em></a> for the first time. And if you're a fan of the original classics, quality-of-life adjustments and modern mechanics make these stories a joy to experience all over again.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>:<em> </em>Two Amazing Games in One&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Though there are some who wish the Erdrick trilogy had been bundled together from the start, getting&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>is a huge win for JRPG fans. Each story provides a huge amount of lore, gameplay, and fun for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>fans. This dual pack is an excellent option for anyone itching to sink into a beautiful JRPG.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remakes are already slated for the Nintendo Switch and Steam, and for avid Nintendo fans, they'll be pleased to know that they'll also be able to play&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>on the Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a stunning reimaging of a classic RPG that is counting its age in decades, these remakes bring&nbsp;a fresh perspective to both titles, making this a phenomenal experience for fans to look forward to.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>&nbsp;Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Whether you want to take your time exploring the world and the towns and caves within or jump right into combat to test your skills against stronger and stronger enemies, <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> delivers on all fronts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I loved wandering the world with my team, trying out new attacks, and marveling at just how quickly battles can take place with the ultra-fast options turned on. It optimizes&nbsp;a genre that, in the past, may have been challenging for newcomers to get familiar with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By bringing these games into the modern era and rebuilding them from the ground up, Square Enix succeeds at revitalizing a beloved series and giving players an excellent reason to revisit Erdrick's story.</p>

<hr><p><em>The <strong>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake</strong> release date is October 30, 2025, and it was previewed on a PlayStation 5 at PAX East 2025.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-edition-confirmed-as-sales-pass-500k.1199400/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Level-5 has announced that the hit "slow life" RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>will be getting a Switch 2 Edition version complete with enhancements specific to Nintendo's new machine.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250527/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official website, the developer says the Switch 2 Edition version of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>will be launching on June 5th, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">alongside the console itself</a>. It'll cost you just $2.59 to upgrade, which isn't bad at all.</p>

<p>According to Level-5, the Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life&nbsp;</em><em>i&nbsp;</em>will take "full advantage of the hardware's capabilities" to offer "significant improvements", just like other Switch 2 Edition releases.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-horse.jpg?itok=pgSObRnz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-horse.jpg?itok=uKyXMj2- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>will be available on the Switch 2 at launch.</figcaption></figure><p>Improvements include faster load times and scene transitions, as well as "more beautiful" visuals and "more fluid" animations on the Switch 2. In short, it's exactly the kind of enhancement you'd expect from a jump to a new console.</p>

<p>Obviously, if you have the Switch 2 Edition version of the game but you play it on a regular Switch, you can expect "features and performance" to be "in line with the Nintendo Switch version", as Level-5 says.</p>

<h2><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>has also passed a pretty big sales milestone</h2>

<p>In addition to announcing the Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, Level-5 also revealed over the weekend that its latest game has already passed a pretty big sales milestone.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1926223393059172648" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>has sold 500,000 copies since launching last week (although players who pre-ordered the game enjoyed a three-day advanced access period, so that ought to be factored in as well).</p>




<p>To celebrate the achievement, Level-5 is <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1926889367961784354" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">giving away</a> a number of free gifts to all players, so make sure to hop into the game and claim those if you're playing through it right now.</p>

<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/product/JP0720-PPSA27625_00-FANTASYLIFEIGAME" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/9pp7tdrdzghd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-switch/" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>.

There’s nothing wrong with that—plenty of people want to get new Nintendo information—and the app is a fun, if cumbersome, way of hearing the latest about what Nintendo is hoping you’ll buy. But, whichever way you slice it, it’s a commercial tool for plugging games and devices. Today on Today, underneath a cute animation from <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, you can watch a 21-second video about Donkey Kong’s hand slap in forthcoming Switch 2 title <em>Donkey Kong Bananza.</em></p><p>“Cool!” you might think. “James’ll love that! I’ll grab a screenshot of the video and send it to him.” Or, if you don’t know James, you might think, “Ooh, I’m so excited for <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>! I’m going to post a video clip of this on my BlueSky account!” Except, no, you won’t do any of this. Now all you’ll get is a black screen. Here’s a screenshot I took today:</p><figure id="" data-id="2e571c65cb5083c8ae65b8890127d9d1" data-recommend-id="image://2e571c65cb5083c8ae65b8890127d9d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="388" data-height="863" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A black screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A black screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2e571c65cb5083c8ae65b8890127d9d1" data-recommend-id="image://2e571c65cb5083c8ae65b8890127d9d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="388" data-height="863" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A black screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I can right now, on an Android phone, still screenshot the text-based stories, such as the one plugging the new Switch 2 “All-in-One” carrying case, and I can capture the screenshots recently uploaded from <em>Mario Kart World</em>. (Except, with the latter,  the shots are included in landscape, in an app that only runs in portrait, with no way to zoom in or rotate them. Just <em>stellar</em> work.) It’s just videos that are being blocked. </p><figure id="" data-id="e91145f0ddedb95b9ca3fe1792d8860c" data-recommend-id="image://e91145f0ddedb95b9ca3fe1792d8860c" data-format="jpg" data-width="388" data-height="863" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a landscape screenshot on a portrait phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a landscape screenshot on a portrait phone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e91145f0ddedb95b9ca3fe1792d8860c" data-recommend-id="image://e91145f0ddedb95b9ca3fe1792d8860c" data-format="jpg" data-width="388" data-height="863" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a landscape screenshot on a portrait phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Let’s be unambiguously clear: Publisher-provided screenshots and videos of a game are advertising. They have only ever been advertising. The games media is  guilty of having allowed such things to be commoditized, fighting one another for the “exclusive” to publish such commercials on their own website, then becoming furious when another site reprints the adverts they wanted to be the only one to show. But ads they remain.</p><p>They exist to promote a game, with the intention of building interest and excitement in a product, and the goal of increasing sales. That’s it. That’s what they’re for. And here’s Nintendo, very cleverly encouraging millions of people to install an app on their phones that only serves to show its users these ads, and then going out of its way to stop their being shared? That’s <em>bonkers</em>.</p><p>But, it feels very par for Nintendo’s course. Sharing is such an anathema to this company that it even applies it to its own game footage and trailers—clips you’d imagine were created with the express purpose of being seen by as many people as possible. But no! Shut that shit down! People might get <em>ideas</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
