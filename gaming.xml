			<p>What do you get when intelligent toys turn on their creators? Humanity’s extinction. That’s the scenario you’re thrust into when Gori: Cuddly Carnage starts off. It’s been a little while since all the humans were killed by AI-powered intelligent toys, but not all the toys became bad. Gori, a bipedal cat, along with allies FRANK the potty mouth hoverboard, and CHIP, a rather depressed AI, set out to destroy the evil toys in as efficiently chaotic way as possible.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gori: Cuddly Carnage - Meow Release Date Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YA61jRAZlK0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Gori: Cuddly Carnage’s narrative is decently written but a pretty by-the-numbers plot. However, the comedy is on point. Yes, it’s juvenile and reliant on lots of swears, but the delivery is great, with the factory mission and the manager standing out as a fun comedy highlight. The delivery of lines just sounds like the team is having a fun time with the script. It is silly but it will make you laugh. It’s worth mentioning that finishing all the levels will get you one ending, but to get the proper ending you do need to find all the key pieces and rescue every single unicorn.</p>


<p>Gori: Cuddly Carnage is an action game which is split into eight main levels plus 14 challenge missions. Each main mission gives you a star ranking based on how long it takes to beat it, the top combo you can put together, the total score, and the difficulty level. Challenge missions also have a three-star rating, though the measuring stick for these varies from combo scores to time remaining on the clock. Gori: Cuddly Carnage’s difficulty ranges from Indoor Cat, aka easy, all the way up to Cuddly Carnage, the ultimate difficulty.</p>
<p>I played through the levels twice, first on House Cat (Normal) and then Cuddly Carnage to gauge the difficulty jump. Aside from enemies dealing more damage and bosses having a couple more attacks, I didn’t really notice a huge step up in challenge. However, that’s more than likely down to the fact I had unlocked the majority of upgrades giving Gori more health, stronger attacks, and more fuel to move faster and perform special attacks for my second run.</p>


<p>FRANK is more than just a hoverboard. FRANK is Gori’s weapon, equipped with blades and a whacking attack, with both used in motion as the pair speed around environments. Gori also gets a grenade launcher to hit big groups from range. In each mission you’ll move between arenas filled with enemies before coming up against mini bosses and final bosses. The enemies start off as basic unicorns but evolutions of the mythical horned horse are gradually introduced as you move through the game. There’s a decent variety of enemy types from blade-wielding melee attackers to flying bomb-droppers, and larger ones that can perform high powered attacks. Yet, even with this range&nbsp;of enemy, combat boils down to a handful of attacks.</p>
<p>That said, combat itself is enjoyable and rewarding as you pull off combos using the different attacks, and while there’s an extensive move list there is generally enough fuel to use the special slash and whacking attacks near-constantly. While it is satisfying to wipe out masses of enemies using these moves, it can get a bit repetitive and going back to normal moves feel slow in comparison. Enemies can be relentless, swarming towards Gori with lethal intent so the thankfully-slick movement is paramount to survival. There are occasionally issues with judging distances between jumps in platforming sections, and some combat areas can work against the power moves due to there being so many places to fall off the edges.</p>
<p>Gori: Cuddly Carnage is full of bold and bright colours, and some of the level designs are packed with excellent ideas. The arcade level in particular, as you jump into different machines, is a great imaginative experiment. Enemy designs are fun too and you can tell the designers have thought of lots of different ways to turn childhood toys into nightmarish creatures. The bosses are also well-designed, but suffer from having very obvious weak points highlighted.</p>

<p>While Gori: Cuddly Carnage is a fun game there are a couple of downsides. The camera can be finicky at times which isn’t helpful when the action is so fast-paced. There’s also a lock on for enemies so the camera follows them, but it is hit and miss with the angles it chooses to use. During my playthrough the game did also crash a couple of times back to the PS5 homescreen, though this can hopefully be ironed out in an early patch.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Gori Cuddly Carnage is a really fun game that offers a decent mix in its levels and challenges. I did play through levels a couple of times because I enjoyed the gameplay and the humour of it. While there are some issues, namely the camera and a couple of platforming bits, overall Gori Cuddly Carnage is a fun, gory, time.	</p></div>

			<p>While The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria has been out on the Epic Games Store for a while, those who prefer to use Steam or play on Xbox Series X|S will finally be able to have their own dwarven adventure. This is the only survival crafting game that is set in the Fourth Age of Middle-earth, a rich expansive universe full of different stories to be told. If you want to get your hands on The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria on either <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933130/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Return_to_Moria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> or Xbox Series X|S, it is currently available for a discounted price of $19.99.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria™ Steam and Xbox Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cnt7N3H49IE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Previously, the developers of this game were working on an update for the Beta and Epic Games Store version which would allow crossplay. As the game has just released on new platforms, that update will automatically be available to those who are just getting stuck in now. All platforms will be able to take part in crossplay, meaning you can play with friends who are on PlayStation 5 even if you're on PC or Xbox.</p>
<p>This update is named "<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-is-out-october-24-for-pc-ps5-features-john-rhys-davies-as-gimli/">The Golden Update</a>" and includes a myriad of new features as well as crossplay. This includes a Sandbox mode, for those who prefer to play without a challenge present. For those on Steam, there is also the option to purchase an exclusive bundle, which will include the game, the official soundtrack comprised of 34 unique tracks, as well as an art exhibition, which is also discounted for a limited time.</p>
<p>The Golden Update was previously only available on the Epic Games Store but is now widely available across all platforms. It allows Steam and Epic Games users to host 8-player gaming sessions in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, regardless of what platform the other players are joining from.</p>
<p>In addition to crossplay, there are now over 100 new decorations for players to choose from to customize their base how they like, to make it look as earthy or cozy as they like. One of the main features added that will benefit people who play the game solo is now the option to pause the game. To be able to pause the game, you just need to hit Escape or open the settings menu, and you'll be able to return to the game without fear of consequences.</p>
<p>New difficulty settings also allow players to fine-tune the experience to their liking, such as changing the aggressiveness of enemies, combat, and the frequency of drops.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-palace-of-drow-queen-and-lair-of-drider-review-new-shade-of<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Drow have a tumultuous history in fantasy TTRPGs. They are a staple of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, a group of subterranean elves characterized by ruthless ambition, cruelty, and sharp cunning. They have been the source of controversy given their potentially problematic design and coding, as well as the source of iconic heroes like Drizzt Do'urden. Now, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/steamforged-games-local-legends-ttrpgs-and-adaptation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steamforged Games</a> has their own take on these long-lived warriors in <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em> and <em>Lair of the Drider</em>.</p>

<p>In <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em>, your adventuring party attempts infiltrate the underground city of the drow. This is done by the group sneaking into the city by boat. As for whether or not the party fights or talks their way through customs is for the dice to decide. From there, it escalates into storming the titular palace.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-palace-of-the-drow-queen-miniatures-screenshot.jpg?itok=DyS7OhYq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-palace-of-the-drow-queen-miniatures-screenshot.jpg?itok=F99aWpAL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It ain't Menzoberranzan, but it's still lethal.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, the drow or more than prepared for any opposition. The enemies contained within the box are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>4x Drow Warriors</li>
<li>4x Drow Crossbowmen</li>
<li>2x Lizard Cavalry</li>
<li>2x Drow Whirlwind</li>
<li>3x Oneiromancer</li>
<li>1x Drow Queen</li>
</ul><p>In broad strokes, <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em> is an enclosed, uphill battle. The party starts the first map on a boat surrounded by guards, are bottlenecked by a gate, and are overwhelmed by lizard-riding cavalry at the docks. The second map, continues this push into the palace with traps and strategically placed units. Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-camp-of-bandit-twins-and-cave-of-manticore-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bandit Camp</a> encounter, the Drow intelligently leverages a homefield advantage against the players at every turn; making every inch of progress feel earned.</p>
<p>This is also the first <em>Epic Encounters</em> box I have used where the different Drow statblocks have scaling rules. Every <em>Epic Encounters</em> box has different difficulty numbers and damage dice based on your group's play tier. Level 1-4 characters have environmental hazards that deal damage in D4s, and Level 10+ characters get hit with d10s from their surroundings. The enemy scaling does something similar, adjusting ACs, attacks per turn, available spells, and health.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounter-palace-of-the-drow-queen-palace-battlemap.jpg?itok=z_7iBUr8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounter-palace-of-the-drow-queen-palace-battlemap.jpg?itok=VbMgZVUu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Oneiromancer doesn't attack, it just makes it hard for you to hit anything else.</figcaption></figure><p>This is great since the enemy placement in <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em> is very deliberate. The module as written is light on monster closets or incoming waves of enemies. This is good because each Drow enemy poses a challenge in their own right.</p>
<p>Steamforged Games manages to put their spin on the Drow in this box. In addition to the more familiar trappings: matriarchal society, gothic architecture, lizard mounts, etc., they have traits connecting them to spiders and drider monsters. It isn't completely gratuitous body horror, but it does give the Drow more distinct physical characteristics. There's even a unique bit of culture with mind and memory magic with their oneiromancers. It all blends into this wonderfully macabre take on the underground elves.</p>
<h2>What is in Epic Encounters: Lair of the Drider?</h2>
<p>Rounding out <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em> is the boss box, <em>Epic Encounters: Lair of the Drider</em>. Like other box boxes in this line, you get one gigantic drider miniature, a double-sided battlemap, and some minion tokens.</p>
<p>As an extension of the mental magic and low-key body horror elements in the first box, <em>Lair of the Drider</em> is a daunting boss encounter. Its different lair abilities and spells are a potent combination of area control and debuff. Faerie Fire, Dancing Lights, Cone of Cold, Web, all and more are present.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-palace-of-the-drow-queen-drider-screenshot.jpg?itok=ZqldNORR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-palace-of-the-drow-queen-drider-screenshot.jpg?itok=3OvGlZl7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Arachnophobes beware. Also adventurers that want to live.</figcaption></figure><p>The arena itself is even more brutal, There are known hazards such as getting caught in webbing, as well as dangerous tactical hazards like crystals that gush poisonous gas and geographically confusing tunnel passages. For especially sadistic DMs, there are even cracks in reality that form during the fight. If a character fails their save against that, it is an instakill.</p>
<p>What keeps <em>Epic Encounters: Lair of the Drider</em> from turning into a tedious slog of overlapping inconvenience is the nature of the drider boss. The booklet expressly states, as a result of its creation involving mental magic and body grafing, the Drider can't commit to a single idea or plan. This scatterbrained mentality is not just a great worldbuilding detail, it is something the players can use to their advantage.</p>
<p>My one critique of the encounter plagues all official <em>D&amp;D Fifth Edition</em> adventures. While the Drider can cover the area in darkness, webbing, teleport, and mess with the environment, it is only on one axis of terrain. If you're a DM that allows aarokocra or owlin PCs in an adventure, they may trivialize this boss encounter through air superiority.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-palace-of-the-drow-queen-drider-battlemap.jpg?itok=uNVbejrJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-palace-of-the-drow-queen-drider-battlemap.jpg?itok=pDR0wdL0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Watch your steps, heroes....</figcaption></figure><h2>Should I Pick Up Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen and Lair of the Drider?</h2>
<p>Overall, I love Steamforged Games' grotesque and esoteric take on drow in <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em> and <em>Lair of the Drider</em>. The encounters in the former are brilliantly crafted with solidly scaled threats and the latter is a nail-biting exercise in resource and mobility management. If you want to spice up an underground encounter, you can't go wrong with either of these boxes.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>
<p>
Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen and Lair of the Drider is a great, grotesque, and mesmerizing interpretation of the drow. Well worth a look for fans of underground fighters. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

The dwarven engineers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria">The Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria</a> have formally entered the Golden Age of Steam. The game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933130/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Return_to_Moria/">now available on Valve's digital storefront</a>, after a year in the comparatively barren underdark of the Epic Games Store, and developers Free Range Games have also released a Golden Update, which adds offline single player pausing, around 100 building objects, and a sandbox mode allowing for non-story-led excavation and settlement of the game's procedurally generated mountains. Plus, new hats and axes! Try not to get dragon sickness.

I haven't played Return To Moria since October last year. Back then, it was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-review">comfortingly vast survival game</a> with crunchy torch-lit aesthetics, many gorgeous biomes to uncover, and a fair amount of jank. (For the purposes of Immersion, please find on the right an image with a translation of "jank" into Khuzdûl, the ancient runic language of the Dwarves, care of <a href="https://tengwartranscriber.github.io/">Tengwar Transcriber</a>.)</p>
<p>I'm definitely up for another crack at this particular seam of lore-digging, as long as they've fixed that thing where all your interior decorations end up at tortuous 45 degree angles to the layout. Here's an 11-minute talkthrough video from game director, detailing both what's in the Golden Update and what they've added since launching on EGS.

<p>
If you don't have time for a video, here's my own breakdown of the Golden Update. Let's start with the sandbox mode, which has already been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-morias-next-major-update-adds-a-sandbox-mode-and-single-player-pause">available in beta on EGS</a>. This lets you generate worlds from "a wide variety of random seeds, meaning each playthrough can vary significantly in layout and difficulty". There are "minimal tutorials" in sandbox, and as such, the devs recommend that you only play if you're familiar with the game's campaign or with other survival sims. Sandbox brings with it crafting recipes for 14 new kinds of weapon and armour. These include the Wolf Skin Hat and the Barôkamlut, or mithril battleaxe. You will probably find the Barôkamlut useful when seeking to acquire the materials for Wolf Skin Hats.
</p>
<p>
The update also adds crossplay functionality, allowing the proud longbeards of PC to mingle with the upstart stonelords of PS5 and Xbox in sessions of up to eight players. If you'd rather excavate Khazad-dûm on your lonesome, you can now pause the game by hitting escape while playing offline. 
</p>
<p>
As for the new building objects, these range from rugs and banners to light fixtures, tavern signs and chairs. The improvements to the building system itself are probably of greater interest to players re-Returning to Moria. "Restoring Moria is now easier than ever with the changes made to the stability system as well as improved object snapping," explains the press release. "The pre-placed buildings throughout Moria are now stronger than ever, expanding players' ability to build expansive bases wherever they choose."
</p>

They've also expanded the game's difficulty settings, with options for enemy aggression, the frequency of hordes, sieges or patrols, and the abundance of mining drops. Add in the promise of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2933130/view/4241914673865774571?l=english">Steam Deck compatibility</a>, together with new ambient music, and you have a game I'll try to carve out some fresh hours for this weekend. It's no <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dwarf-fortress-steam-review">Dwarf Fortress</a>, but it's got charm.

The team remarks that he’s the most powerful foe they’ve ever faced, and we see him absolutely pulverize the trio. It’s unclear at this point if Shadow will team up with Robotnik (even temporarily) as he does in the games, or if the movie will start with him already at odds with the doctor. </p><p>One of the big reveals is that Gerald Robotnik, the ol’ Egghead’s grandfather and the creator of Shadow, makes an appearance at the very end, also played by Robotnik actor Jim Carrey. </p><p>Check out the trailer below:</p><p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>is set to debut in theaters on December 20. It jumps off the second film’s post-credits cliffhanger, which shows Shadow waking up in a secret facility, having been kept in cryostasis for over 50 years. That’s par for the course for the character and matches his backstory from his debut in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. <em>Sonic 3 </em>isn’t a 1:1 adaptation of the Dreamcast game, but is clearly borrowing some elements from it. Alyla Browne (who played the young Furiosa in the early stretch of this year’s <em>Fury Road </em>prequel) plays Maria Robotnik, a key figure in Shadow’s origin and a major character in the events of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, so it’s clear the movie is drawing heavy inspiration from the 2001 platformer.</p><p>Reeves and Browne are making their series debuts with <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>, but returning cast members include Ben Schwartz as the titular speedy hedgehog, Colleen O’Shaughnessey reprising her role as Tails both from the previous two movies and the video games, and Idris Elba as Knuckles.

            <title><![CDATA[Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition Gets ESRB Rating]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-gets-esrb-rating/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-gets-esrb-rating.964491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-gets-esrb-rating/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On the official <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39971/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB site</a>, Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition now has a Teen rating for PlayStation 5 and the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>The ratings summary does mostly break down gameplay basics. But it also mentions “behind-the-scenes content” and a “handful of art-gallery images, since they include some “suggestive” material. This hints that the anniversary edition could include quite a few special features.</p>



<p>This week, Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition also got fresh ratings in Taiwan for current and last-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as the Switch.</p>



<p>So, although there’s no concrete release date just yet, there may be an official announcement coming sometime soon. Earlier this week, original developer Team17 also shared a Gamescom 2024 video, acknowledging that Worms Armageddon is “still thriving 25 years later.” </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The original Worms Armageddon first launched in the 90’s, eventually releasing on platforms like the Dreamcast, Game Boy Color, and Nintendo 64. </p>



<p>Worms Armageddon remains a beloved staple of the series, as well as the industry itself, praised for its creative and cartoonish turn-based action. </p>



<p>The most recent games in the series include Worms W.M.D from 2016 and Worms Rumble in 2020. </p>



<p>The former launched to decent reviews, and still has a 7.5 from critics and users alike on Metacritic. However, Worms Rumble received very mixed reviews. </p>



<p>So, fans may be pleased to revisit Worms Armageddon soon after its ESRB rating. Since its rating applies to the Switch, an official announcement might arrive during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-indie-world-direct-partner-showcase-coming-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo’s upcoming showcases</a> today.</p>

<p>The first full trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog 3 has been released ahead of its release later this year.</p>



<p>The new trailer, which you can watch below, gives everyone an overview of the movie’s premise. It also shows the first look at the debuting Shadow the Hedgehog, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/keanu-reeves-to-voice-shadow-in-sonic-3-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voiced by Keanu Reeves</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As you can see in the trailer, Shadow is the main nemesis in the upcoming movie. It even gets to the point where Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles go to Dr. Robotnik, played once again by Jim Carrey, for help. We also see the debut of Carrey as Gerald Robotnik, Eggman’s grandfather.</p>



<p>What we don’t see in the trailer is whether or not Dr. Robotnik and Shadow ultimately team up at any point in the film. In the various games, they have worked side by side.</p>



<p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 releases in theaters on December 20.</p>

            <p>Alien: Romulus and The Last of Us Part 2 have a bit of an unexpected connection.</p>
<p>Alien: Romulus - the latest film in the Alien franchise - recently released, and stars Isabela Merced in a leading role. While Merced has acted in many films and series, those on this site may recognise her name as that of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/isabela-merced-cast-as-dina-in-hbos-the-last-of-us-adaptation">Dina in the upcoming second season of The Last of Us</a>. But, that's not where the connection ends.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Alien: Romulus director Fede Álvarez revealed the film's character of Kay (played by Merced) was actually inspired in part by Dina from The Last of Us Part 2. This was before Merced was cast in either role. What are the chances - Dina see that coming, and all that. <strong>Please be aware of a small The Last of Us Part 2 spoiler below. </strong></p>

<p>"Fun fact: I was playing [The Last of Us Part 2] while writing [Alien: Romulus]," Álvarez shared on social media platform X over the weekend. "The story of a pregnant Dina made me think of having the character of Kay be pregnant too. Then I cast Isabela Merced to play Kay."</p>
<p>The director went on to state that a year later, he found out that Merced had also been cast as Dina in HBO's adaptation of the game, completing an unexpected and rather serendipitous circle.</p>
<p>"True story," Álvarez closed (I am assuming a pregnant pause followed).</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-10-update-patch-notes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Pugstorm and publisher Fireshine Games have released the&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>1.0 update, as well as bringing the game to consoles for the first time. Naturally, the update's full patch notes are now also available.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1621690/view/4335363098084315163" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a> celebrating the update's release, Pugstorm and Fireshine say&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s "main story arc is now complete", and that anyone who's had the game on their wishlist while waiting for it to exit Early Access should "start [their] adventure" now.</p>
<p>The two studios also run down <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-10-new-biome-more">some of the new content</a> that's arrived as part of&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s full release, including changes to the Core, a "new and improved world-generation system", and new PvP play, plus lots more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/core-keeper-1.0-update-patch-notes-cave.jpeg?itok=TaeXv7oq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/core-keeper-1.0-update-patch-notes-cave.jpeg?itok=ku2pv7Oa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>has plenty of new treats to enjoy in its 1.0 update.</figcaption></figure><p>Fireshine and Pugstorm also say that if you have old worlds from before the 1.0 launch, you'll still be able to play them; they're now marked as "Classic" worlds. However, the studios "strongly recommend" starting new worlds, since only by starting afresh can you experience a lot of new 1.0 content.</p>
<p>Of course, the full patch notes for the&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>1.0 release have also been revealed, and just as you'd expect, they get deep into the nitty-gritty of exactly what's new. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1621690/view/4247544173389770568" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check those patch notes out here</a> if you want to see all of the new content.</p>
<p>The patch notes include details of how the new world generation system works, as well as info about new bosses, combat styles, and areas. It's well worth reading them if you're planning to delve into&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>1.0, but be aware the full notes are fairly long.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>is, it's an indie sandbox survival game in which you (and, optionally, your friends) must build a life for yourself while exploring a series of underground biomes.</p>
<p>As you unravel the mystery of the titular Core, you'll gather resources, build a base, and upgrade your tools until you're ready to take down every monster that looks at you funny.</p>
<p><em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009534" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/core-keeper-xbox-series-xs/9pkw4gmx4j8k" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. A version for PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch is also in the works, although it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-delayed-last-gen">not coming until September</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Visions of Mana Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/visions-of-mana-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/visions-of-mana-review.964446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/visions-of-mana-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It would be an understatement to say that Visions of Mana has high expectations to live up to. There hasn’t been a main entry in the Mana series in nearly 20 years, with only spin-offs and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/trials-of-mana-review">3D remakes</a> of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/legend-of-mana-review">older games</a> tiding fans over in the meantime. But thankfully, the wait was worth it. Although there are a few glaring flaws, Visions of Mana successfully brings the series into the modern age with excellent combat and class systems, as well as a new cast of likable characters. It's not only a great Mana game, but it’s become one of my personal favorite JRPGs in years.</p><p>If I could sum up my impressions of Visions of Mana’s storytelling in its opening acts with one word, it would be “simple” – and I mean that as a compliment. I’m a big fan of games tackling complex subjects or having dense lore to comb through, but not everything needs to be complicated just for the sake of it. Visions of Mana keeps its plot straightforward instead of bogging it down with needless exposition — at first, at least.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Visions of Mana Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>You play as Val, a skilled swordsman who must escort a group of people chosen to sacrifice their souls to sustain the Tree of Mana. This includes Hinna, Val’s childhood friend and hinted sweetheart, and I found the duo endearing right from the start. You’d normally expect a character in Val’s role as a guardian to be someone who takes things too seriously, but instead he’s cheerful, charming, and brimming with optimism. And rather than dwell on being compelled to sacrifice herself, Hinna is honored to be selected and excited to make her pilgrimage with Val by her side.</p><p>The party members they gain along the way have their own distinctive personalities that add variety. Careena, for example, is plucky yet irritable, and — for some baffling reason I’m still trying to wrap my head around — speaks with a heavy Texan accent. Morely, meanwhile, is easily the most serious of the group, but it's his blunt attitude that leads to some of the funniest moments. It soon becomes apparent what shaped your new friends into the people they are, and each has a proper arc that gives them a chance to grow as individuals by directly confronting their own flaws. Rather than feeling like side stories, their tales are woven into the central plot in a way that feels organic. Gaining more insight into these characters helped change my entire perspective of them — for instance, Careena begins the journey as a brat and I had initially dismissed her as rude, but by the end, I found her to be one of the most endearing party members.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The main story had me intrigued from the very beginning.</p></div><p>Visions of Mana’s main story itself had me intrigued from the very beginning, but while I loved the brisk pace of the first half, it slows to an absolute crawl later on. To avoid spoilers, I’m not able to go into detail about what my biggest gripes are, but there’s a large chunk of the final 15 to 20 hours (I rolled credits on the campaign in just under 40) that I strongly felt was unnecessary padding. There ends up being a lot of retreading, and it feels like an unwelcome detour from where the story had been heading. </p><p>This turning point is also when the simplicity I initially liked was thrown out of the window and the dreaded exposition dumps started to pile up on top of each other. As a whole, I still found the overall story to be enjoyable and the ending to be emotionally satisfying, but these pacing issues later on frustratingly squander much of the early momentum that had been built up.</p><p>But the real star of Visions of Mana, one that shines even when the story falters, is its combat. Fights are fast and frantic, with a number of systems to keep track of. You have your standard and special attacks alongside moves and spells, such as fireballs or shurikens, to mix things up and exploit enemy vulnerabilities. It’s also strategic because attacking, taking damage, and using moves slowly fills up the Class Strike gauge that then lets you perform a devastating attack you’ll want to unleash as often as you can (preferably at the exact right moments). During all this, you’ll also incorporate equipable items called Elemental Vessels, each of which provides its own special ability. For example, the Luna Globe will briefly create a small bubble on the battlefield that slows down enemies while speeding up attacks and spell casting times of the party.</p><p>However, when a character equips any given Elemental Vessel, they will also automatically be swapped to its associated class, which leads me to my absolute favorite mechanic in Visions of Mana: the class system. While the function of the Luna Globe itself will never change, the role, moves, and abilities of the character equipped with it will, and every character has a class entirely unique to them for every element available. </p><p>The Luna Globe will transform Val into an Aegis, changing him from his default melee role into a tank that lets him wield a lance and shield rather than his usual sword, but Careena will instead become a Moon Charterer and takes on a buff-support role through fan dancing. As an Aegis, Val can use a move to aggro enemies and gains an ability that allows him to survive what would otherwise have been a fatal blow with 1HP once per battle, and it’s the way these options come into play as you swap around that really highlights the fun of each class</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The real star of Visions of Mana is its combat and class system.</p></div><p>You’ll unlock even more moves and abilities for each Vessel thanks to the Elemental Plot, which acts as an upgrade system. The key difference between those two types of actions is that any moves you learn are permanent and can be equipped regardless of a character’s class, whereas abilities are tied to the class itself. So Val won’t get that protection from a fatal blow unless he’s an Aegis, but he’ll always have the option to add the aggro move to his repertoire, and that provides an exciting reason not to invest solely in one class.</p><p>But the coolest part? When equipping an Elemental Vessel to a character for the first time, you get treated to a wonderfully cheesy costume transformation cutscene straight out of a Super Sentai show as they don their new thematic outfits and weapons. Even if I didn’t really want to equip a character with a particular Vessel, I’d always do so at least once because the cinematic never failed to put a huge grin on my face. And don’t worry — once you’ve done the initial transformation sequence, you can just swap between classes at the press of a button in the menu screen between encounters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Even more depth is added to combat by Ability Seeds, which are obtained through quests, chests, and battles. Some Seeds grant you passive bonuses like upping your stats while others grant you an entirely new move to use. Later on you’ll even be able to transfer the Corestones of defeated enemies and bosses into more powerful Seeds. A particular favorite of mine let me summon a late-game boss at my leisure to unleash some serious damage.</p><p>All of these systems tie together in a way that encourages strategy over button mashing. I had my preferred classes for certain characters, but some situations called for me to invest upgrade points into a Vessel I’d never use on them just to unlock certain moves, or even reclass them entirely. That might sound restrictive, but I actually liked that it encouraged me to branch out and try classes for characters I initially wouldn't have wanted to, and prevents you from putting all your eggs in one basket. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Bosses can be tough if you’re not taking advantage of all your options.</p></div><p>For instance, normally I liked to have Morley use the class associated with the water Elemental Vessel, which transforms him into a hybrid of a stage magician and Gambit from X-Men who can stun enemies. But to defeat one particularly challenging boss, I had to switch him to a class that could maximize damage output thanks to its focus on critical hits. This also meant swapping some Ability Seeds that focused on boosting his critical damage and hit rate for complete synergy.</p><p>You’ll want to make sure you understand how to make the most of each class like this, because bosses in Visions of Mana can be tough even on the normal difficulty level if you’re not taking advantage of all your options. There are some really inventive boss designs, both visually and mechanically. Some might heavily focus on area-of-effect attacks while others will snatch your Elemental Vessel from you, temporarily preventing you from using it. Every boss kept me on the edge of my seat, and slaying them always felt rewarding.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Nick's Favorite RPGs</h3><p>Need an RPG recommendation? In no particular order, here are a few of my personal picks from my favorite genre.</p></div><p>Exploration also makes up a huge bulk of Visions of Mana. From lush jungles to snowy tundras to seaside villages, every single location feels unique and lets the gorgeous art style shine — it's vibrant and looks like something out of a storybook, which fits the fantastical tone. Hidden chests and collectables had me exploring every inch of the map and pulled me to optional areas I otherwise would have breezed right by. There are side quests, collectables, and more still left for me to tackle, too, and I can’t wait to dive right back in to complete everything Visions of Mana has to offer.</p><p>That said, while the art style itself is great, I did notice a fair share of visual bugs. There are a lot of moments where the lipsyncing didn’t match up, and at one point a character was speaking without their mouth moving at all. I also ran into a few huge framerate drops despite playing in performance mode on PlayStation 5, though these were extremely rare.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>During Gamescom recently, Microsoft announced that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933"> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will come to PlayStation 5 in 2025</a> following its debut on Xbox Series X|S and PC this December. Creative director Axel Torvenius from MachineGames said in an interview that the studio is "super thrilled and excited" by the opportunity to bring the game to PS5 and reach a wider audience.</p><p>"The more people that can play the game--who can see all the passion and love we have put into this project and all the hard work--the merrier," the developer told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer.</a></p><p>Design director Jens Andersson, meanwhile, said bringing The Great Circle to PS5 is "something we wanted to do." The developer added that the game's engine, id Tech, was made as a multiplatform engine, which will help the team bring the game to PS5. Andersson also mentioned how MachineGames will "absolutely" be able to have more time to polish the PS5 edition for launch.</p><p>The Great Circle comes to Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9, with a launch set for PS5 in Spring 2025; according to a report, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-platforms-release-date-and-everything-we-know/1100-6520456/" data-ref-id="1100-6520456">the game could launch on PS5 in April 2025.</a> Troy Baker, a veteran voice actor known for playing Joel in The Last of Us, is voicing Indy in The Great Circle.

            <p>A new report on Toys for Bob has claimed Crash Bandicoot 5 was cancelled in favour of live-service online games.</p>
<p>The report comes from gaming historian Liam Robertson, who revealed this Crash Bandicoot game would have been a single-player 3D platformer, which would serve as a direct sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a>.</p>
<p>While that is all much to be expected, Robertson's video also featured concept art and potential story ideas for the Crash sequel, including a Spyro team up. "Crash and Spyro were intended to be the two playable characters," Robertson said.</p>

<p>However, when Crash 5 was still in the very early days of development, it was cancelled by publisher Activision in favour of live-service multiplayer games.</p>
<p>Allegedly, Activision considered Crash Bandicoot 4's sales to be underwhelming. After that, team members were then moved on to work on other titles, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-team-rumble">Crash Team Rumble</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crash-team-rumble-gets-june-release-date-closed-beta-available-with-pre-orders">which was released last year</a>. This particular game failed to ignite much interest, however, and in March it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crash-team-rumble-support-ends-after-nine-months-as-developer-splits-with-activision">no further content would be released</a>.</p>

<p>As for Toys for Bob - which along with Crash Bandicoot and Spyro is also known for Skylanders - the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activisions-skylanders-crash-bandicoot-studio-toys-for-bob-going-independent">announced it was parting ways with Activision to become an independent company again</a> back in January. Then in March of this year, it was claimed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spyro-4-reportedly-in-early-development-at-toys-for-bob">new entry in the Spyro series was in development with Toys for Bob</a>.</p>
<p>The studio once again got tongues wagging in May, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toys-for-bob-website-update-leads-to-new-crash-bandicoot-or-spyro-speculation">Toys for Bob updated its website with a new logo</a>, leading to further fan speculation of a new Crash Bandicoot or Spyro game.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can currently get your hands on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-august-line-up-announced">Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy via Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<p><span>Barring a successful remake of the third Mana title in the series, it’s been seventeen years since Square-Enix brought a new title to the console masses (the last entry was a mobile and PlayStation Vita exclusive in Japan). As Square-Enix continues to revive franchises from the vault, it’s refreshing to see them pay homage to a series that has persisted since the original Nintendo GameBoy. <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-demo-out-now-on-pc-playstation-and-xbox/">Visions of Mana</a> is the first of the series to make its way onto PlayStation 5, but does it feel like a proper next-gen adventure?</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Visions-of-Mana_20240809225025.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>Players assume the role of Val, a Soul Guard tasked with guiding Alms of each element on a pilgrimage to the Mana Tree, where they’re sacrificed for the continued prosperity of the land. Failure to make the journey or shirk off the duties typically results in the decimation of an entire town, as the opening prologue makes clear. Nevertheless, it’s a sacred duty that Val and his childhood friend are all too keen on embarking on.</span></p>
<p><span>Along the journey to the Mana Tree, Val and his childhood friend Hinna meet four other Alms each willing to sacrifice their lives all the same. Visions of Mana presents a world where sacrifice is all but expected of those chosen by the faeries and spirits, with few to question the futility of it all. However, as Val ventures from region to region, solving everyday problems or befriending the locals, players will see firsthand what happens when that cycle is broken.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/p14_2-EN.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>Visions of Mana brings the action RPG combat to new heights for the series, empowering Val and his entourage with mobility and finesse. Combos interweave quick and heavy attacks, with many inputs being held for an additional attack. Blocking and dodging are a key component of survivability in ways that the Mana series never truly utilized before. There is still an element of pausing combat with the series’ signature Ring Menus to cast magics or use healing items in a pinch. Players can also pause the combat and issue commands to their fellow party members, such as telling one party member to revive the other while you focus on damage dealing or playing the role of a tank and drawing the enemy’s focus away.</span></p>
<p><span>The Class system in Visions of Mana is something that I found to be somewhat lacking in execution. As players gain the blessing of each element, characters are bestowed with the ability to unlock a new class of that specific element. While earlier Mana games would have locked players into their class choices, players can freely swap between elemental classes at any time, with the main caveat being that no two characters can share the same element at a time. </span></p>
<p><span>With a base class and one for each of the eight elements, players can freely swap around archetypes across nine total classes. These classes each come with one of three different weapon types for each character, so just because you might want to leave the fire element on one character doesn’t mean Val would be locked out of using his favorite weapon. As for Val’s arsenal, players can pick between a simple one-handed sword, a combination of lance and shield, or a massive two-handed sword. The other four characters have more versatility to their weapon types which all have a distinctively different feel to one another.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Visions-of-Mana_20240813233337.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>Class growth is one of the weaker elements of Visions of Mana. Each class has a single horizontal track that unlocks new spells and passive abilities at a predictable rate. While players can freely bring the spells from one class to another, the passive abilities are locked per class with some of the more interesting skills available to the same elemental class as another party member, so there were several party class combinations that I would have loved to try but couldn’t as they shared the same element across multiple classes. Some classes are simply far better for each character than any other. As the Archmage class is unlocked for Palamena, for example, no other class of hers comes anywhere close to matching the magical attack stat or damage output; similarly, Careena is an unstoppable force with her Dark element class.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Multiple difficulty modes are available to the player from the onset of Visions of Mana and I stuck with Hard Mode almost exclusively through my playthrough. This held a nice balance between taking massively increased damage while limiting the number of healing items that players can bring into combat at a time; players will have the usual stash of up to 99 of a given item but may only be able to take in a fraction of those candies or cups of wishes per encounter. With enemies routinely dealing upwards of a hundred damage per attack as early as the middle of the adventure, Visions of Mana’s Hard Mode is geared towards those who want to take full advantage of the defensive capabilities in combat to survive. </span></p>
<p><span>Val’s role as a Soul Guard felt best suited to using the lance and shield combo, as he would naturally gain abilities to draw the enemies' attention and even absorb damage by empowering his shield. Players shouldn’t consider themselves locked into any particular difficulty as they can freely switch outside combat. For those on a masochistic streak, an advanced difficulty level is unlockable upon completing the main campaign which comes with higher growth caps for each character to compensate.</span></p>

<p><span>Visions of Mana features a lot of retreading familiar ground as players will routinely return to earlier cities to solve less-pressing issues than saving the world regularly to the point where I felt like so much of the adventure felt like padding to stretch an already lengthy runtime. By the time I saw Val’s journey to its end, I had easily clocked in somewhere between sixty and seventy hours along the way. In that time, I routinely went back to each and every town at the start of each chapter to see what new side quests were available to undertake; managing this feat before the likes of fast travel were unlocked made this a far more obnoxious chore while I soon learned that it’s possible to fast travel from any save point on the same island to another (you’ll still need to make use of a certain aquatic mode of transportation or flight to go between the various continents). Many of the side quests were basic fetch quests that could largely be overlooked for the common rewards, while others granted equipable accessories with passive boons.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Visions of Mana | Final Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SubnfqC-vxk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><span>Overall, Visions of Mana is a solid entry in the storied tales of the Mana Tree that action RPG fans will appreciate. While there are some pacing issues and overall padding to the game’s length, players will have little complaint about the title’s length for a series that traditionally wraps up by the 15-20 hour mark. It may not be the most memorable tale of the Mana Tree, but it certainly offers the most enjoyable combat to date.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/visions-of-mana-review-exceptional-venture<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2024, where there’s been chaos and negativity around every corner for several years now, <em>Visions of Mana</em> offers a charming respite that feels like a cool glass of water in the sun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For over 30 years, <em>Mana </em>games have been making their mark on the RPG genre. I had a chance to review <em>Visions of Mana</em> ahead of its launch, and it was my first experience with the series. It was more than I hoped for.</p>
<p>With an absolutely stellar story, lovable characters, fun combat, and a beautiful world, <em>Visions of Mana</em> is an adventure I’d recommend to anyone, RPG fan or not.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Alm Adventure in <em>Visions of Mana</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-meeting-palamena.jpg?itok=2u_6N8Gz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-meeting-palamena.jpg?itok=ZphAq3vJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The first four characters have a special bond in&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Visions of Mana</em> follows the story of Val and Hinna, the Soul Guard and Alm of Fire. Every four years, each element chooses an Alm. That Alm travels to the Mana Tree to sacrifice their soul to the Mana Goddess, ensuring that Mana continues through the land.</p>
<p>The Soul Guard meets with all the Alms to make a journey to the Mana Tree, protecting them along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The premise of the story is simple, but the story itself is anything but. Without spoiling it, the crew encounters problems along the way. Everything builds up beautifully, and the conclusion left me in tears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Originally, I was worried about it feeling a bit cliche. However, parts of the story are executed and written so well that cliche was the last adjective in my mind. Both the journey and the end result exceeded my expectations, and it created such a great stage for everything else in <em>Visions of Mana</em> to shine.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Visions of Mana’s Lovable Alms</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-early-crew-in-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=gJT1RGZD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-early-crew-in-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=cGzpD0ML 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Visions of Mana</em>'s cast are so fun, and their growth is well done.</figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest reasons the story worked so well was because of its character. Hinna and Val, the original two party members, are so wonderful. They’re sweet and wholesome, and their relationship is precious.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/visions-of-mana-preview-cute-relaxing-and-fun">preview</a>, I had high hopes for Hinna’s character. As it turns out, those hopes weren't just met, but things worked better than I could’ve imagined.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest of the main crew – Morley, Careena, Palamena, and Julei – are just as lovely. The characters I wasn’t immediately fond of grew on me quickly, and by the end, I loved them all. The game wouldn’t have been the same without this group.</p>
<p>The group’s dynamics were done well, as they grew closer together and developed relationships with each other as they journeyed. It felt very natural and like every friend group I’ve been a part of in my own life. I loved seeing them talk and banter with each other in the story and just through exploration in general.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/careena-and-ramcoh-in-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=DQQzm68m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/careena-and-ramcoh-in-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=x_Ysu4_C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Careena was my least favorite character at the start, but she ended up being one of my favorites by the end.</figcaption></figure><p>The characters didn’t just grow together, they also developed in their own ways. Each and every character is challenged in some way, and they all grow past it by the end. This was touching to see, and it’s where a lot of the hopeful messages in the game are shown.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Character-based Combat in Visions of Mana</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bridge-view-in-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=N1GGv_2f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bridge-view-in-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=HgIVgMYY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fighting in environments like this was beautiful.</figcaption></figure><p>There’s a lot to love about the combat system in <em>Visions of Mana</em>, and it all centers around the characters. Each character has a unique play style, and players can form teams of three to take on ARPG fights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, each character can be given an Elemental Vessel. These can change their stats, weapons, and even their appearance (including in cutscenes, a little touch that went far). Each Elemental Vessel has its own skill tree of sorts to upgrade, giving characters special and more powerful moves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was fun to tinker with – I loved seeing how each character changed with each vessel, and it gives players incentives to explore the world and have fun with combat. Combat itself is fairly simple, but the strategy going into it is where the fun really happens. Plus, simple combat isn’t a bad thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The boss designs in <em>Visions of Mana</em> are so unique. The entire game is flooded with bright colors that give the game a light feel compared to the main storyline where characters are literally sacrificing themselves to a goddess.</p>
<p>The bosses continue this light feel, mixing poppy colors with fun designs that are never too terrifying. I actually looked forward to seeing what each boss would look like and what the fights would be like.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Minor Exploration Problems in Visions of Mana</h2>

Exploration is incredibly rewarding, and it’s genuinely just fun. The small groups of enemies scattered around are the perfect size, making them quick but satisfying to take down.</p>
<p>Running around the incredibly varied biomes and gorgeous scenery was more fun than I ever thought it’d be.</p>
<p>However, there were a few minor problems. Occasionally, my inputs would overshoot or undershoot where I was trying to go. It made interacting with some things, like save points or chests, difficult at times.</p>
<p>Additionally, there were problems with the auto-tracking system at times. For example, if I needed to use a special item, the auto-tracking system didn’t have a way to show me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These problems were very minor, and they were the only real problems I encountered during my time with <em>Visions of Mana</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Visions of Mana</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

The story, characters, combat, and world are so well done that it’s a treat to experience, and one I think anyone can enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, it’s perfect for newcomers to the series. The marketing has said that there are friendly faces from other games, so it’s fun for veterans as well. This was my first experience with a <em>Mana </em>game, but it won’t be my last by any means – <em>Collections of Mana</em> is now on my wishlist.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/visions-of-mana-review-square-enix-1851632322<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s no outfit in gaming with a stronger history of telling tales about picking fights with God than Square Enix. Literally or metaphorically, from <em>Final Fantasy Legend</em>/<em>SaGa</em> and <em>Star Ocean</em> to <em>Xenogears </em>and even some <em>Final Fantasies</em>, a foundational narrative in which our heroes push back against a cruel, manipulative creator is like a spinal cord holding up many a juggernaut of Japanese RPG canon. But another enduring Square Enix series, quietly running just as long as the others, takes the opposite approach, embracing the positive side of religion and mythology. These are games about unity, the healing powers of nature, and the virtuous pride brought from trusting in a benevolent higher power. No, not <em>Dragon Quest</em>; yes, you visit churches to save in those games, but then you go and hang out in pubs and gamble like an exhausted salaryman. No, I’m talking about <em>Mana</em>.</p><p>Not unlike most games in the <em>Final Fantasy </em>series, each <em>Mana</em> game exists in its own timeline, yet they are tied together by recurring themes, characters, and constructs. The Tree of Mana is the most prominent symbol, the center of these games’ worlds, ecosystems, and cultures. The Tree gives life to everything, but is always vulnerable; a finite resource that must be protected and maintained across generations. The Goddess of Mana is a sort of representative of the Tree, managing the flow of life energy and communicating with people based on needs or traditions. Finally there’s the Sword of Mana, which is there to…help the heroes do their Hero Stuff. In each <em>Mana</em> game there’s typically some threat to the Tree or the Goddess, and the adventure is all about fighting the good fight in a way that’s never really been complicated or challenged. Until now.</p><h2 id="h17796"><a id=""></a>A once-vibrant series, grown sickly</h2><p><em>Visions of Mana</em> is the fifth “mainline” entry in the series, the first since <em>Dawn of Mana</em> for the PlayStation 2 back in 2006. Square Enix has struggled with the series since, often dipping into the IP for experiments and remakes alongside a series of ill-fated mobile games. <em>Visions</em> is a big swing that couldn’t come at a tougher time for big swings with any IP, much less the smaller fries. But it’s here anyway, seeking to roll out the red carpet for a series that hasn’t had this kind of treatment since before video games ran in wide resolutions. There’s a lot to lose in terms of sales and money, but for a series with so many bumps in the road and fans desperate for one more chance, perhaps there’s nothing to lose for <em>Mana</em> itself.</p><figure id="" data-id="2a576a99159c4c90f1a948eecf8986d3" data-recommend-id="image://2a576a99159c4c90f1a948eecf8986d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young dark-haired man waves." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A young dark-haired man waves." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a576a99159c4c90f1a948eecf8986d3" data-recommend-id="image://2a576a99159c4c90f1a948eecf8986d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young dark-haired man waves." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As the game begins, everything seems normal. The world is full of vibrant life, its landscapes covered in trees and goofy-looking creatures that you almost feel bad fighting. <em>Visions</em>’ natural beauty and open spaces are punctuated by a swelling soundtrack that oozes happiness and joy, bringing to life what kids playing Super Famicom RPGs probably pictured in their minds when scrolling similarly colorful tiles in <em>Secret of Mana</em>. Your characters, a ragtag group of would-be heroes from around the world, are all smiles as they run across the environment or gallop upon one of many fantastic beasts, collecting flowers and Grizzly Syrup to trade for rare items with bears that speak like human infants. The vibes are simply majestic. But something is wrong, something only you, the player, can feel. Longtime <em>Mana</em> fans will feel it in their bones.<br></p><p>This is, as before, a world held up by the Tree of Mana, a gorgeous natural landmark towering above anything and everything else you can see, from volcanoes to man-made wonders. The flow of Mana spreads to every living thing, keeping the people sheltered and healthy. Every four years, the people in each parish come together to celebrate, throwing a festival in their distinct cultural traditions to invite their local Elemental deity to send a Fairy over and declare one resident an “Alm.” The chosen Alms band together with a chosen Soul Guard (a ceremonial bodyguard, basically), and the group makes a pilgrimage to the Tree of Mana so it can…consume their souls and keep the Mana going until the next round of heroes is chosen. Yeah, I don’t remember human sacrifice being part of the equation before, either!<br></p><h2 id="h17797"><a id=""></a><strong>A cheery surface with horrors underneath</strong></h2><p>And these aren’t the actions of a confused or misinformed populace. In <em>Visions of Mana</em>, the prophecies are legit. Human sacrifices are necessary to keep things normal and comfy. This isn’t just legend or culture warping into something foul over time, or human dedication being misguided. The Elementals aren’t intangible; they come hang out and party with their region’s locals and support the Alms on their quests. Everyone is friends with everyone else, because everyone is on the same page. They’ve seen what happens when an Alm doesn’t make it to the Tree. Disaster strikes and everything falls apart. The world just functions this way, and the people are happy to adhere to the rules. Alms are treated with great respect, and it’s an honor to be chosen as one. But the cracks are starting to show. Not everyone is happy with sending their loved ones off forever, and the Alms aren’t all smiles the whole way. But these sentiments of doubt or resistance are kept on the fringes, fleeting moments of sadness or fear from the Alms solved by pep talks and hugs.<br></p><p><em>Visions</em> is not<em> Final Fantasy X</em>. This isn’t a journey in which the heroes are uncomfortable with the fine print of their task. And if they are, that discomfort is pushed aside or comforted away. There are rare moments of pushback, two of them key beats in the story. But they have dire, and immediate, consequences. The pain comes not from dread, but from veering off the path. Val, the game’s protagonist and Soul Guard of the current Alm convoy, learns this the hard way, in one of <em>Visions</em>’ rare instances of pushback from the heroes themselves. But even after a devastating loss, the rest of the crew cheers Val on, helping him refocus on the original purpose: leading his friends to give themselves to the world, so everyone else can maintain their happiness for another few years.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="855ef5b9d2f63c0f5f65a51befe28dee" data-recommend-id="image://855ef5b9d2f63c0f5f65a51befe28dee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young redheaded woman in a rocky environment with a sun visible behind her looks sad or determined, or both." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A young redheaded woman in a rocky environment with a sun visible behind her looks sad or determined, or both." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="855ef5b9d2f63c0f5f65a51befe28dee" data-recommend-id="image://855ef5b9d2f63c0f5f65a51befe28dee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young redheaded woman in a rocky environment with a sun visible behind her looks sad or determined, or both." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At first, I wasn’t sure what to do with all this. I expected conflict between the heroes and the systems demanding their sacrifice to be the central force driving the story, like in <em>Final Fantasy X</em> or <em>I Am Setsuna</em>. But it isn’t, and I was stunned at how the characters and story were so cooperative. I struggled to decide how I felt until I realized, after the credits rolled, what was actually happening. Maybe I’m crazy, but it felt like there was an additional layer to <em>Visions’</em> story, something cooking on a meta level that didn’t hit me until I was almost done.<br></p><p>This world is sick, and so, too, is <em>Mana</em> itself. The series has been struggling for years to find its footing and its true identity in a swamp of failed experiments and misguided attempts at gacha mining. <em>Visions of Mana</em> is supposed to be its grand return, and yet, this whole premise feels wrong. Since when does the Tree of Mana eat people’s souls, and why are we so happy about it? <em>Mana</em> games are known for their brightness and hope, an almost sing-songy vibe that fuels what feels to us longtime series fans like nostalgia for the old school. <em>Visions of Mana</em> is full of that, from its romantic, adventurous energy to a voice cast full of wacky accents and over-the-top performances. Some of these performances go out of their way to pay tribute to cartoon classics, such as Claude Pertwee’s body of work at Hanna-Barbera or Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter from <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>.<br></p><p>All this sweetness is pelted with horrible events, turns that would be shocking and momentum-crushing in other contemporary RPGs like <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>. Here, however, the heroes press on weirdly quickly, finding ways to celebrate a fallen friend on the road. The story snaps back into place like a rubber band, wiggling but not breaking. Something would happen and my jaw would drop, only for Val to gleefully yell out “grrrrrizzly!” at the next floating dollop of syrup. Boy, did my wife hate the syrup by the end!<br></p><h2 id="h17798"><a id=""></a>Clunkiness gives way to satisfaction</h2><p>It’s confusing at first, like the tone can’t decide what it wants to be, or the voice direction was a misfire well off the Battleship grid. Everything is so normal, but a dark undercurrent that feels out of place in <em>Mana</em> keeps bumping into the surface from below. And the game doesn’t seem to acknowledge it! My confusion was compounded for a while, as I was simultaneously trying to make sense of this thematic strangeness and grappling with the other parts of this game, such as its action-RPG combat and its extensive class system.</p><p> In the midst of it all, I sometimes had a hard time deciding how much of a good time I was having. <em>Visions of Mana</em> has a distinct cadence to its action that likely won’t feel good to players as they suss out their initial impressions. I’ve seen it described as “clunky” a few times, and I understand the sentiment. It’s a slower game, and the game presents its combat in such a way that it can be hard to determine at first if it actually clicks or not in a satisfying way, if it has any sauce.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="d62084f42aee6ec82f0e3346ae731fe1" data-recommend-id="image://d62084f42aee6ec82f0e3346ae731fe1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A creature in green holds a hefty tome up toward two young people.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At PAX East earlier this year I was in a room with colleagues playing a <em>Visions of Mana</em> demo. While most players were following the demo’s given path, I found myself making camp in an open space and playing with the controls, testing the limits of what I could do. After all, the early trailers showed a lot of vertical action, an immediate signal to fans of character action games like <em>Devil May Cry </em>and <em>Bayonetta</em>. And <em>Visions</em> literally uses some of that genre’s language, such as encouraging you to “stagger” a button press to make a different move come out as opposed to just mashing. There’s more going on under the hood than meets the eye, but it’s difficult to actually make that stuff work in a normal fight.<br></p><p>I’m a big swords guy, and <em>Visions</em>’ class system gives Val a big sword. It gives each character three weapons to choose from (some classes are variants that share weapons but offer different abilities and stats), but look, if I see a big sword that’s too hard to swing in a satisfying, video game kind of way, I pick that sword. Turns out that was also my key to figuring out the sauce, as being careful with buttons to make my slow, heavy swings hit was the key to doing any meaningful damage at all!<br></p><p>Working against the game’s specific rules and limits (how many jumps or air dashes I can use before having to touch back down, for example) to extend my combos was something I found myself focusing on through the entire adventure. Part of that is because the class system is intriguingly cumulative, giving you new options that apply universally (like additional combat logic) alongside class-specific abilities. It took nearly the whole game before I got full access to the greatsword’s buttons! But figuring out my reach, how to effectively aim, working with the mostly independent CPU team, and so on and so forth was all part of unlocking how a “clunky” start could lead to something more rewarding over time.<br></p><h2 id="h17799"><a id=""></a>Saving the world, saving the series</h2><p>I eventually found the story rewarding as well, as that story ends up being, at heart, about a partnership between you and nature itself to help cleanse what’s causing all this avoidable pain. This is a classical, old-school, nostalgic RPG with all the silly voices and cute faces you can stomach. But it’s not well, and there’s something enveloping the game with a darkness that’s preventing it from being itself. The Tree of Mana isn’t just being a jerk for no reason, and even though the Alms are doing their learned duties with heart, <em>you</em> know that it doesn’t, shouldn’t have to be this way. By the end it almost feels like the conflict I was aching for was cast aside entirely, in favor of something far more mundane and trope-friendly. Any concerns about the Alms’ situation practically vanish when a big, evil dude shows up to destroy the world. “Welp, I guess we’re just doing this now,” is what the vibe seemed to be.<br></p><p>But then things I can’t spoil happened (I may have already said too much!), and in that moment of post-credits clarity, the pieces fell into place and I realized what I had accomplished. I helped heal <em>Visions of Mana</em> itself from its illness. Things were wrong, the world was not functioning properly. And the poor people doing their best to keep life worth living couldn’t see it. Even in the moments when they could feel it, even when Val at one point begged to be “the villain” under the weight of grief, the world was sticking to its guns and refusing to acknowledge the problem. But in those final moments, when my confusion almost turned to tears as the world was right again, I realized I had helped put <em>Mana</em> back on track. Just like so many folks out there hope <em>Visions of Mana</em> itself is doing. How do you put a score on that? I’m grateful I don’t have to this time.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Specifically fine-tuned for the PS5’s Tempest 3D Audio, this headset delivers an immersive sound experience that makes you feel like you’re right in the middle of the action. Whether you’re creeping through a dark corridor in a survival horror game or engaged in an intense firefight, the 3D audio creates a sense of space with sound that feels like it’s coming from all directions, making every gaming moment more intense and realistic.</p><p>Comfort is also a big plus with the Pulse 3D Headset. This is something that’s often overlooked when purchasing a headset, but if you’re planning long gaming sessions, you won’t be disappointed. </p><p>If you enjoy playing games online with friends, the built-in noise-canceling microphones ensure that your voice comes through clearly, even if there’s a bit of background noise.

While the microphone might pick up some ambient noise and the battery life is something to keep an eye on, the overall performance and comfort of this headset make it a fantastic choice for gamers. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/09/13/vlcsnap-2022-09-13-16h13m56s428-1663111134489.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The incredible PSVR2</figcaption></figure></output><h2 id="psvr2">3.

While it might not be for everyone, the PSVR2 is undeniably immersive and has improved upon so many things that the original PSVR didn’t get right.</p><p>The PSVR2 features 3D audio, eye tracking, haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, finger touch detection, and more. For example, in games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-walking-dead-saints-sinners-chapter-2-retribution-ps-vr2-review">The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners – Chapter 2: Retribution</a>, you have to physically put your hand down by your side to reach for your gun, and move the controllers in the direction you want to aim in.</p><p>Offering two 2000x2040 OLED displays, the 4K HDR visuals are unparalleled. Intelligent eye tracking turns the PSVR2 into a true VR experience, and the subtle feedback you get from the headset only adds to this. The VR2 Sense controllers also deserve a special mention, perfectly designed which further adds to the entire package.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/01/21/img-0369-1674263161326.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>All the components of the DualSense Edge</figcaption></figure></output><h2 id="dualsense">4.

It’s designed to be customizable so that you can switch up your gaming style on the fly.</p><p>If you’re playing an FPS that requires fast-paced movements, you may prefer to set the travel distance on your controller’s triggers to be shorter, for example. No matter how you like to play, this controller will definitely give you the edge in any game. It is, however, really expensive, and since the original PS5 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-dualsense-controller-review">DualSense</a> controller is so popular, it might not sway enough users to invest.</p><p>Still, if remappable buttons and easily accessible profiles you can switch to at any time is a priority for you, then the DualSense Edge controller might be the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-controller">best PS5 controller</a> for you.</p><h2 id="poweracharger">5.

And it’s easy to get involved because the PowerA Twin Charging Station is really affordable. It might not look like much, but this charging station can house two DualSense controllers and charge them up without taking up much room.</p><p>The compact charger displays colored LEDs to show the charging status of your controllers, ensuring you can always stay in the game. Simply place the controllers on the charging station overnight, and when you’re ready to get back in the action, your controllers will be ready for you.</p><h2 id="faceplate">6. innoAura PS5 Faceplates</h2><h3>Best Faceplate Alternatives for PS5</h3><div id="196695" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>innoAura PS5 Faceplates</h3></p><div><p>Stand out from the crowd with easy-to-install faceplates for your PS5 console built with sturdy materials and ample ventilation. </p></div></div><div><div><p>Range of styles and colors</p></div><div><p>Not Sony’s official faceplates</p></div></div><p>Bored of the PS5’s standard white design?

The hard ABS material can withstand impacts and is shockproof, though I wouldn’t recommend testing this too much! </p><p>Just like Sony’s official faceplates, these are designed to fit the PS5 and will continue to offer you access to the console’s USB, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-hdmi-cables-for-ps5">HDMI</a>, and power ports.</p><h2 id="logig29">7.

But it's not just about turning left and right. The pressure-sensitive pedals are customizable, providing a braking feel so accurate you might start reaching for a seatbelt that isn't there. </p><p>With an immersive 900-degree turn, you can channel your inner F1 racer and feel like a pro in your own home. That’s if you don’t mind splurging on a PS5 accessory that’s not too far off the cost of the PS5 itself.</p><h2 id="kontrolfreek">8.

The PS5 Media Remote might not be everyone’s cup of coffee, but it’s certainly useful and isn’t expensive.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/09/03/psportalthumb-1693749826238.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Vivid screen and easy to use controls of the PlayStation Portal</figcaption></figure></output><h2 id="psportal">10. PlayStation Portal </h2><h3>Best PS5 Remote Play Device</h3><div id="197202" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>PlayStation Portal</h3></p><div><p>Play your favorite PS5 games remotely via Wi-Fi on a vivid 8-inch screen with attached controls. </p></div></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/3vLZV?object_uuid=2b623eb5-236a-4be5-90b6-250078fab511&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>See it on PlayStation</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/x32Jj?object_uuid=2b623eb5-236a-4be5-90b6-250078fab511&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>See it on Amazon</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/OGByY?object_uuid=2b623eb5-236a-4be5-90b6-250078fab511&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>See it on Walmart</strong></a></li></ul><div><p>Haptic feedback and adaptive triggers on the controller</p></div><p>Want to play your PlayStation 5 anywhere in your home and even beyond? The best solution for Remote Play is the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-portal-review"><u>PlayStation Portal</u></a>, a nifty gaming device with a vivid 8-inch tiltable screen and built-in controls that lets you access your PS5 games over Wi-Fi. The experience on the Portal will blow your <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-phone"><u>gaming phone </u></a>and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-phone-controller"><u>phone controller</u></a> out of the water. </p><p>This device is essentially a DualSense controller split in half and stretched to fit a screen. So, you’ll still enjoy haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for a more immersive gaming experience. However, it’s missing Bluetooth support. That means you’ll need to use a wired headset or Sony's PlayStation Link-compatible options, like the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-pulse-explore-wireless-earbuds-review"><u>PlayStation Pulse Explore Earbuds</u></a>, to avoid annoying your family by listening out loud. </p><p>Don’t expect to do anything other than play PS5 games on this device, as you can’t browse the web or stream. It’s also only as good as your Wi-Fi, so having a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-router"><u>great gaming router</u></a> and ISP can be helpful. If you want to play the Portal outside of your home, it’s possible, but the Wi-Fi you’re connecting to can't require a web browser to log in, and be sure you've got the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-playstation-portal-cases">best PlayStation Portal case</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-playstation-portal-accessories">Portal accessories</a> to keep it safe. </p><h2>How To Choose a PS5 Accessory</h2><p>There isn’t really a one-size-fits-all answer that can tell you how to choose the best PS5 accessory as every gamer is individual. One person’s treasure is another's rage-inducing nightmare.</p><p>But the one thing you always want to check when buying an accessory for your PS5 is compatibility. Is that hard drive fast enough for your PS5 games to work, rather than just store them? Do those headphones take full advantage of Tempest 3D Audio? And more importantly, how is this accessory going to help me enjoy games more?</p><p>As with all things, make sure to check the reviews before investing in a new PS5 accessory. There are plenty of cheaper alternatives out there when it comes to accessories, but they’re often cheap for a reason. If gaming is a hobby you take seriously, you want to make sure you’re purchasing the best PS5 accessories possible, not only to maximize your enjoyment, but also to ensure high build quality and long-lasting products.</p><h2>PS5 Accessories FAQ</h2><p><strong>Does the PS5 need additional cooling?</strong></p><p>The PS5 does a perfectly good job of cooling without the need for any additional third-party PS5 accessories to help it. While there are plenty of PS5 cooling fans and stands out there, in honesty, they’re more likely to be a hindrance to the console's natural cooling ability, rather than assist it.</p><p><strong>Can I buy a USB hard drive for my PS5?</strong></p><p>If you want to keep things simple and install a USB hard drive, rather than a NVMe SSD, you can, but it does come at a cost. Due to the loading requirements of next-gen games, PS5 games require much faster write speeds of 5Gbps or higher to run. Sadly, USB drives cannot reach these speeds yet, meaning a USB hard drive could only store PS5 games, however, it can be used to play PS4 games without needing to move them to the console.</p><p><strong>Which brand makes the best PS5 accessories?</strong></p><p>Most of the best PS5 accessories come from Sony themselves. In fact, Sony is well known for creating tons of PS5 accessories, all designed to take full advantage of the console’s latest capabilities in order to improve your gaming experience.
<strong>When do PS5 accessories go on sale?</strong></p><p>Although the PS5 itself doesn't go on sale very often, PlayStation accessories will often see discounts throughout the year. The general rule of thumb is that the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-a-playstation-5">best times to buy a PS5</a> are also the best times to buy accessories for the console. Some of the more popular events where you're guaranteed to find discounts  on gaming accessories are <a href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-prime-day">Amazon Prime Day</a> in July and <a href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday</a> in November There's also PlayStation's Days of Play sale which usually takes place at the end of May and into early June.</p><p><em>Kegan is an avid gamer who has been playing games since his Atari days.

Hardware Unboxed has tested the Zen 4-based Ryzen 7 7700X and the new Ryzen 7 9700X (Zen 5) on both Windows 11 version 23H2 and 24H2 and found a significant performance increase thanks to Microsoft’s OS update.</p><p>On average, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrlfTHCzBnnQ">Hardware Unboxed found</a> an improvement of 10 percent across multiple games running at 1080p resolution on the older Ryzen 7700X running Windows 11 version 24H2. On the latest Ryzen 9700X, Windows 11 24H2 provides an 11 percent performance improvement on average in the same game tests. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DyDzVWqncMFA">KitGuru has also tested</a> AMD’s best gaming CPU, the 7800X3D, and found similar increases in some games, alongside improvements to the older Ryzen 9 7950X thanks to Windows 11 version 24H2. </p><p>The new benchmark results come just weeks after AMD launched its Zen 5 desktop CPUs, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220250/amd-zen-5-cpu-reviews-ryzen-9-9950x">failed to impress during early reviews</a>. Reviewers found that in gaming the previous generation Ryzen 9 7950X looked like better value than AMD’s new flagship Ryzen 9 9950X.</p><p>Windows 11 24H2 will certainly improve the performance of these new Zen 5 CPUs, but since it’s also improving older Zen 4 processors, the performance gap still seems to be a little disappointing between the two architectures. Microsoft’s 24H2 update is anything but disappointing for Ryzen owners though, as it literally allows them to download better performance for their CPUs.</p><p>We’re expecting Microsoft to release its 24H2 update for Windows 11 in late September, but if you want to grab it early you can opt into the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/05/22/releasing-windows-11-version-24h2-to-the-release-preview-channel/">Windows Insider program</a> and enable the Release Preview builds on your PC. If you’d prefer to clean install or perform the upgrade manually, ISO files for 24H2 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso">are available here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong players can now play Game Science’s latest action RPG as Dragon Ball Z’s Goku, courtesy of mods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the moment, there are two Goku mods available over at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NexusMods</a>. Both mods replace the initial outfit of Black Myth Wukong and do not add any gameplay features or other elements to the title. The first is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/84?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Son Goku</a>, which adds an anime-accurate character to the game. The second one is called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/99?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jump Force Goku</a>, and this adds Goku’s damaged character model from Jump Force to the game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-you-install-goku-mods-for-black-myth-wukong-nbsp">How do you install Goku Mods for Black Myth Wukong?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>You must follow these steps to install Goku mods for Black Myth: Wukong.&nbsp;However, this is an experimental mod that only works with the first outfit of the game and could be bugged with other outfits. So remember to change to Tiger Hide Loincloth, Cotton Wristwraps and Cotton Legwraps. &nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>First, open Steam, right-click on Black Myth: Wukong and then head to ‘Properties’.</li>



<li>Here, you must type “-fileopenlog” in the Launch Options field. This will now allow you to install mods for the game.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Then head to Nexus Mods, decide which Goku mod you wish to use, and download it.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Once downloaded, head to Steam again, right-click on Black Myth: Wukong, click the ‘Manage’ button, and select ‘Browse Local Files’. &nbsp;</li>



<li>After that, use an unarchiving tool to unzip the mod files, then drag and drop the B1 folder into the game files.&nbsp;</li>



<li>That’s all. Now you can play Goku in Black Myth: Wukong.</li>
</ul>

<p>For those who don’t know, Black Myth: Wukong’s story is based on one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, Journey to the West. Interestingly, the late Akira Toriyama, creator of Dragon Ball Z, was also inspired by this novel during the inception of the manga, which is why Goku shares so many similarities with Sun Wukong.</p>



<p>In other news, Black Myth: Wukong’s Xbox release is seemingly ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukongs-xbox-release-is-indefinitely-delayed-due-to-memory-leak-bug-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indefinitely delayed</a>‘ due to a ‘memory leak’ bug. Also, the game is reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-is-reportedly-boosting-ps5-sales-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boosting PlayStation 5 sales in China</a>.

            <p>Having been officially revealed in a very un-fanfare-y way this weekend, a Valve developer has given us all an extra peek at a prototype of the studio's hero-shooter Deadlock.</p>
<p>The video itself was spotted by social media account <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower">Gabe Follower</a>, which regularly keeps us up to date with titbits of Valve-related news (clue is in the name, really).</p>

<p>As you can see in the embedded post below, the prototype footage for Deadlock features a very rudimentary urban area, complete with placeholder assets such as those of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a>'s alien insectoid creatures, Antlions.</p>
<p>As this is of course just a prototype for Deadlock, the footage itself is very basic, but having played Deadlock myself (I can actually say that now) you can certainly see the bones of the game as it is today.</p>
<p>In Deadlock, players make their way through its urban map accompanied by a gaggle of AI minions known as Troopers. These chaps "periodically spawn in the base and then run down a lane, fighting any enemies they encounter". This is much like the prototype's Antlions did for the player.</p>
<p>You can check out the prototype footage via the post below, followed by a screenshot I just took showing Deadlock's Troopers as they appear in the game's overview section.</p> <div>

<p>Deadlock reached a new peak concurrent player count this weekend, of 89,203. There is still no actual release date for Deadlock, however, and it can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">only be played via invite at the time of writing</a>.</p>
<p>"Deadlock is in early development with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay," the Steam page explains.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The slugcat of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rain-world">Rain World</a> is a distinct little character. He flops around, squeezing through narrow tunnels with a movement that's both cute and mildly gross. When he is eaten by a passing disco lizard or ravenous skull-faced vulture, it is because he is basically a delicious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirmles">Squirmle</a> existing in a horrifying cryptozoological ecosystem. He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals. Yet that basically seems to be the elevator pitch for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/uruc">Uruc</a>, a sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> set in a distant future where strange life battles mechanical monstrosities. </p>

<p>Solo developer Stefan Haasbroek has been working on the game for over a year so far, recently launching a <a href="https://www.backabuddy.co.za/campaign/uruc-a-locally-developed-pc-video-game">crowdfunding campaign</a> (as spotted by enthusiastic RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/i-let-out-a-hell-yes-when-i-saw-this-game-stars-a-worm-fox-trapped-on-a-dying-world-and-an-even-louder-yes-dude-yes-when-the-trailer-got-to-the-metal-gear-mechs/">PC Gamer</a>). It seems a lot more focused on action and conflict, in contrast to Rain World's exploratory survivalism. At one point, your creature clambers into a minigun. Another moment seems to have the player piloting a mech with powerful weapons. Later, the player appears to be controlling a little ship with turrets. </p>
<p>Other features look very familiar. Your character rolls and tumbles in a similar way to the slugcat, it clambers up and down poles placed in the levels, it plops into water and swims with the same sense of weight. The few examples of dialogue in the trailer also lend a similarly cryptic atmosphere when set against Videocult's strange land, and even the symbol painted on a panel in the background of one shot brings to mind the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owErvl-vKJuKbr5Bz7pnGwZbONjD7_8hkTSFvqWwxQg/edit#heading=h.lj49b77guhv8">meaningful glyphs</a> scattered around Rain World, such as those used on its "karma gates".  </p>
<p>All that said, it shouldn't be surprising that a developer has taken such thorough inspiration from the catslug. Rain World, for all its quirks and idiosyncrasies, displays a courage unlike many other games. It simulates a world that is unforgiving and beautiful, in which the player often merely feels like a visitor. If someone wants to pump more of that heady toxin into the game-o-sphere, who can blame them? I get the feeling Rain World's influence is going to be felt in more games to come, albeit perhaps more quietly than this. You can sense the shadow of its design philosophy in the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forever-winter">Forever Winter</a>, for example, another mech-fuelled megawar in which you are merely a passing roach. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's been a while since I last played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World Of Warcraft</a>, but that doesn't stop me from listening to the Elwynn Forest theme whenever I need to decompress. And as I understand it, WoW's latest expansion The War Within adds to a game that's largely unrecognisable from those vanilla days. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and with TWW out this very second it does make me think, "Hmmm, what if I do make a return". This happens <em>every</em> time. I'd quite like to see the new continent, the new class features, and the expanded Skyriding.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First on the agenda is the new continent: Khaz Algar, which lies off the western shores of Pandaria (a good time, that DLC) and fits with the theme of a subsurface, well, war within. Here you've got the surface level city of Dornogal that acts as the city centre, so to speak, with three other zones all under the surface: The Ringing Deeps, Hallowfall, and Azj-Kahet. The max level has been ramped up to 80, so each of those zones, starting with the Isle Of Dorn, will feature a gradual level climb with the aid of new dungeons.</p>

<p>New instances called Delves can be tackled with up to four pals, along with an NPC companion Brann Bronzebeard (who's customisable through a skill tree). These act a bit like bitesize dungeons, taking around "10-15 minutes on average" and offer puzzles, platforming challenges, boss fights, and rewards that'll help you in future Delves. Tick these off and you'll earn "endgame rewards", similar to those offered by dungeons, raids, PVP, and the like.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Hero Talents are unlocked for players at level 71 and let you specialise classes even further. Essentially, there are talent trees to pick from depending on classes and specialisations, you select a single talent tree to activate, then each time you level up you bang a point into it. They grant you buffs up the wazoo - the technical term. Here's Blizzard's <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24125213/take-your-character-to-the-next-level-with-hero-talents">article on it</a>, which breaks it down into more detail.</p>
<p>More mounts are available for skyriding and now you can switch between dynamic flight (the zippy flippy type introduced in the last expansion) or steady flight (kinda normal flying introduced all the way back in The Burning Crusade).</p>
<p>There is, of course, a whole lot more that would take aeons to cover here. Blizzard's <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/24116738/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-now-live">War Within page</a> has you covered on that front.</p>
<p>And hey, if you want to know what it was like starting WoW as a newbie a little while back, why not give our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL05WItuMOI">Inventory Space vid a watch</a>? A relic from a bygone era of Edders and Liam (RPS in peace) doing fun vids together. I miss it dearly.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
