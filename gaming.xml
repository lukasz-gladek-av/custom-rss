<p>Vroom for four, and 120fps mode to boot!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>3Goo, which has previously published the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gear_club_unlimited_2_-_definitive_edition">Gear.Club</a> series and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wrc_generations">WRC Generations</a> on Nintendo consoles, has announced a brand new multiplayer grand-prix racer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/4pgp-four-player-grand-prix">4PGP: Four-Player Grand Prix</a>, which releases on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>, has a phenomenally straight-forward moniker, and we reckon that suits its aims as a no-nonsense 90s-style racer just fine, as the keyword here is "simplicity" in being able to pick up and play, with easy to grasp controls.</p>
<p>That extends to the visuals too, in the clean and simplistic graphical style adopted to bring this arcade speeding to life with 4K and 120fps on Switch 2.</p>
<p>The game also features track "design contributions" from Kenji Sasaki, who of course designed the tracks for little known racers such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> and <strong>Sega Rally</strong>. Hold on, what? Excuse us? Oh, and you've also got a soundtrack by Tomoyuki Kawamura, who did the music for <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/sega_rally_championship">Sega Rally</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/virtua_racing">Virtua Racing</a>. Wow.</p>
<p>Here's some more deets from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Arcade Racing for Every Skill Level:</strong></p>
<p>Four difficulty settings, Rookie, Novice, Veteran, and Expert, as well as an Assist Mode for younger racers, making it easy for newcomers to jump in while giving experienced racers a real challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplayer Mayhem with Game Share:</strong></p>
<p>Race solo or with up to four players in split-screen, and join friends with GameShare locally on both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, or play online with others on Nintendo Switch 2 via GameChat.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Game Modes:</strong></p>
<p>Hop into Quick Races for instant fun, tackle a full set of courses in Championship Mode, or chase perfect laps in Time Attack Mode.</p>
<p><strong>Unlockable Tracks and Vehicles:</strong></p>
<p>Race and unlock an expanding lineup of 14 circuits and build out your collection of 19 cars.</p>
<p><strong>90s Vibe, Modern Tech:</strong></p>
<p>Enjoy a 90s-inspired arcade racing feel paired with modern visuals and performance, powered by a custom engine. For Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, the game supports 4K resolution and 120fps.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>We like the look of this one, and if 3goo can nail the driving, get the arcade feel just right and give online that works well, this one could fill a proper hole in our Switch libraries when it comes to F1-style racing with pals. We're also totally down for that price point of <strong>$24.99</strong> on Switch 2 and <strong>$19.99</strong> on Switch 1.</p>

            <guid>1374367</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is your Christmas tree missing a little bling? It’s time to add some smart lighting to brighten it up. Govee makes some of our favorite solutions out there, and we just spotted its smart RGBIC Christmas tree lights going for less at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/">On a regular day, these lights would run you around $140, but the retailer just slashed the price by 36%, offering them for just $90 right now</a>. It’s the lowest we have seen them drop to in a long while. It was also originally a Black Friday discount, which managed to survive the main event. You’ll enjoy free delivery on your purchase, which ultimately brings the total down even further. Snap it up quickly, though. Christmas is just around the corner, and we’re expecting these lights to be a popular pick, so both the discount and the stock could run out soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>16 Million Colors to Choose From</h2>
<p>The box includes 24 string lights, with a total of 480 LED beads. Each line is 6.6ft long and features 20 LEDs, making it great for most trees from 6.5ft to 8ft. There’s an 11.5ft power line attached, which allows you to place the lights anywhere without feeling limited. Installation couldn’t be simpler. The lights come with everything you need to put these up, including mounting rings, bar support, cable ties, and U-shaped straps.</p>
<p>Once up, the upgraded LED design, paired with the densely arranged beads, makes for a much smoother, uniform lighting effect. You can choose from 16 million color options (you read that right), plus over 60 versatile preset modes that have something appropriate for every occasion. If you already have a vision in mind, go DIY using the dedicated app, picking your own colors and styles. You can overlap layers, draw a sketch on the app to get specific patterns on the lights, edit patterns, or share your ideas with the AI bot to create unique effects. Don’t have the time for all of that? The preset modes make it easy to choose one within seconds. The Christmas lighting show, for instance, is bright and offers a nice mix of holiday-appropriate colors. Similarly, the “New Year’s” mode is a bit more vibrant, while the “Winter Warm” option brings cozy energy into your space.</p>



<p>The timer section in the app lets you create specific schedules for your lights. There’s a Sleep option to dim them, and a Wake Up to turn them on gradually. What’s more, the lights can also turn on when you clap your hands. Turn it into a game and see who can light them all up in the shortest time!</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about these smart lights that can be used for multiple events. You can pick from a range of colors and preset modes, which means you’re no longer stuck with the basic yellow lighting. Maybe go for something bright during the day, and switch to warmer tones at night; the possibilities are endless.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/"> Amazon is now letting you grab them for just $90, after taking a whopping 36% off their retail price.</a> Make sure you act fast to grab them, because we’re not expecting the discount or the stock to last long. That said, there are plenty of other lighting solutions by Govee going for less, as well. Now is a great time to stock up on everything you’ve had your eyes on, before the prices shoot back up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fans Think Mario Kart World Might Get A Big Donkey Kong DLC Any Day Now]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-dlc-donkey-kong-bananza-game-awards-2000650892</link>
            <guid>1374361</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been six months since <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-update-1-4-0-patch-notes-track-volume-2000650066"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> launched alongside the Switch 2. There have been some notable patches during that time but no big content updates. Could the game’s first paid DLC be right around the corner? Here’s why some fans think so and why it will feature tie-ins to <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>.</p> <p>Before we go on, here’s a spoiler warning for those who haven’t finished <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> yet.</p>  <p>So, Nintendo Today news app <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Nintendo_Today!#Donkey_Kong">dataminers</a> recently discovered an interesting entry for December 15 (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/im-convinced-nintendo-might-be-gearing-up-for-a-mario-kart-world-dlc-announcement-as-it-prepares-to-spotlight-a-donkey-kong-bananza-character-its-been-refusing-to-publicly-acknowledge-since-launch/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a>). It’s an animation featuring <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/File:NT_Day_15_DK.mp4">King K. Rool</a>. He’s a familiar enough Nintendo character at this point, even making it into <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, but the post is also clearly a nod to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza,</em> in which the reptile serves as <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-ending-final-boss-odyssey-1851787178">the surprise final boss</a>. While King K. Rool has been in <em>Smash Bros.</em>, he’s never been in a <em>Mario Kart</em> before.</p>

 <p>What makes this theory extra convincing is that <em>Mario Kart World</em> and<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em> already share <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mario/comments/1m336wn/dk_bananza_spoiler_is_dk_bananzas_credits/">credits for two voice actors</a>: Yuu Hayashi (Void Kong) and Tsuguo Mogami (King K. Rool). Those two characters are obviously in<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. They are not in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Yet. Hmmm.</p>

 <p>Adding fuel to the speculation is a lot of other circumstantial stuff, like the fact that <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">The Game Awards</a>, where Nintendo has often announced big DLCs in the past, is right around the corner, and the base version of<em> Mario Kart World</em> is surprisingly light on costumes and music for <em>Donkey Kong</em>. With Nintendo making such a big push behind the big ape—a big launch year exclusive for the Switch 2, <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-movie-nintendo-bananza-super-mario-bros-1851786191">a rumored movie spin-off</a>, and a remaster of an old Wii game—it wouldn’t be shocking to see the first big Mario Kart World expansion be DK-themed.</p>

 <p>Diddy Kong, for example, has been in and out of the series <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-mario-kart-games-worst-to-best-1842892038">since <em>Double Das</em>h</a>. He didn’t launch with <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> but was later added in the Booster Pass Course DLCs. Funky Kong, too. I would expect them and more to get added <em>eventually</em>. Now, whether that’s this month or farther down the road is a different question. December totally makes sense for <em>Mario Kart World</em> DLC, but Nintendo doesn’t always do something just because it makes sense.</p> <p>And if we read into every little Nintendo Today news app drop like this, well, fans would be expecting all sorts of wild announcements.</p>

            <p>After receiving pushback for its flagrant use of generative AI, Postal: Bullet Paradise has been cancelled… just two days after being revealed.</p>
<p>In a statement from publisher Running With Scissors, the company said the reception to Postal: Bullet Paradise - a co-op "bullet-heaven" first-person shooter from developer Goonswarm Games - had "caused extreme damage" to its brand and reputation.</p>

<p>"We've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned Postal Community," Running with Scissors founder Vince Desi stated today.</p>
<p>The "strong" feedback the publisher recieved said much of the game appeared to have been made using generative AI. "We've always been, and will always be, transparent with our community," Desi continued, adding the publisher's trust in the development team had been "broken".</p>
<p>As such, Running with Scissors has "killed the project", which would have seen players taking on the mantle of one of the Dudes from across the Postal multiverse.</p>
<p>"Since forming Running With Scissors in 1996, we've always said that our fans are part of the team. Our priority is to always do right by the millions who support the Postal franchise. We are grateful for the opportunity to make the games we want to play, and will continue to focus on our new projects and updates coming in 2026 and beyond," the founder closed.</p>
<p>"We can't wait to share more!"</p>
<p>Postal: Bullet Paradise was announced on 3rd December, with a PC release planned for 2026, before an arrival on PlayStation and Switch consoles.</p>

<p>Running with Scissors' decision to cancel Postal: Bullet Paradise comes as more and more companies are using AI technology. Recent examples include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meets-side-quests-can-be-skipped-by-tricking-the-ai-npcs-with-infamous-solid-snake-method">NPC conversations like those in the newly-released Where Winds Meet</a>. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, just yesterday, Supertrick Games - the developer of Let it Die sequel Inferno - released a statement, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-inferno-developer-responds-to-generative-ai-controversy">after its own use of AI caused a bit of a stir earlier in the week</a>.</p>

<p>The media company doesn't mention WB's gaming division at all in its press release. However, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-games">Game Developer</a> has confirmed with a WB spokesperson that "the recently-restructured video game division... will be joining Netflix."</p>
<p>Currently, Warner Bros. Games includes a number of studios such as Rocksteady (<strong>Batman: Arkham</strong> series), NetherRealm Studios (<strong>Mortal Kombat</strong>), TT Games (<strong>LEGO</strong>), Portkey Games, and Avalanche Studios (Harry Potter), along with WB's studios in Boston, Montréal, New York, and San Francisco.</p>
<p>It's a huge deal that Netflix expect to take around 12-18 months, but that's if it goes through. We know how long <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/10/its-over-microsoft-has-officially-acquired-activision-blizzard">other huge acquisitions have taken</a>. Plus regulators are more than likely to get involved. Paramount had previously attempted to purchase the studio in October, which was rejected.</p>

<p>If successful, Warner Bros. shareholders will receive $27.75 a share along with stock in Netflix and the company expects to make savings of around $2-$3 billion by the third year.</p>
<p>The deal could have a huge impact on these studios, and is yet another example of consolidation in the video game industry at a time when layoffs, game studio sales, and closures are rampant.</p>
<p>In fact, earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox">reports emerged</a> that Netflix was selling Spry Fox, developer of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cozy_grove">Cozy Grove</a>, back to the owners.</p>

		<p>It’s pretty much time to wrap up the year and put a bow on it, in terms of big game releases. There’s still a whole host of ports and remasters to come, and the odd indie delight, like Skate Story or Terminator 2D: No Fate, but I think we can all shift focus to awards season and gearing up for Christmas.</p>
<p>But this week did see that one last big first party game, and I got all ‘roided up for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/02/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">its review</a>. Metroided up on Prime, that is. With the game, not the fad energy drink, to be clear. I rather enjoyed Samus’ return, and I’m already contemplating doing a second run through!</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> been playing Death Howl for a review that you can expect next week, and also got to share <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/02/outward-2-preview/">his thoughts about Outward 2</a> – “I learned very quickly the world is an unforgiving place. I died so many times!”</p>
<p>While he meant to continue playing Ghost of Yotei, <strong>Ade</strong> just couldn’t keep himself away from Darktide. “It’s just such a fun game, and the fact that you can easily find time to fit a twenty minute mission into a day makes it ideal for when there’s not a lot of free time for gaming.”</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> did manage to spend some time in Yotei, though only to cross off a few bounties, before playing something much more chilled with Wingspan, the charming card game about collecting birds that he’d heard good things about.</p>

<p>It’s mainly been Halls of Torment, Lego Horizon, and Where Winds Meet for <strong>Gamoc</strong> this week, while <strong>Steve</strong> has (as usual) distracted himself from the horrors of the real world with the horrors of digital world, “with the retro-futuristic terrors of Routine and the insomniac delights of Sleep Awake.”</p>
<p>When he hasn’t been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/netgear-nighthawk-rs700s-wi-fi-7-tri-band-router-review/">fiddling around with Wi-Fi 7 routers</a>, <strong>Dom</strong> has played the chaotic physics-based co-op adventure of Cloudheim, and sunk back into Assassin’s Creed Shadows with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/03/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-review/">the impressive Nintendo Switch 2 port</a>.</p>
<p>And whaddya know? Bungie managed to lure <strong>Tuffcub</strong> back to Destiny 2 with their Star Wars crossover event. Look out for some thoughts on this a little later today!</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

		<p>Cellar Door Games, the studio behind Rogue Legacy and Rogue Legacy 2, has announced its next project, and it is a roguelite tactical RPG called Neath. It is set in a world where the Gods must be obeyed even as they change the rules, while players must lead a group of adventurers through an inverted tower while dealing with monsters and the whims of Fate.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neath - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GQppoeUo8-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Central to Neath is the lesson that teams need to work together. A main example is the locking system where party members freeze in fear when targeted by an enemy, and the only way to break this is for other members to draw the attention of the foe. As Neath is a roguelike, no run will be exactly the same but you can use resources to build up the town of Shale. Doing so will allow access to different skills that will make runs more manageable and ascendance through the tower more likely. Runs will also have special event encounters that can change up the way things work, as the gods look to keep changing the rules.</p>
<p>No release date has been given for Neath yet, but a demo is expected in 2026. Neath has been confirmed for PC only.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-arena-shooter-beta-1047-games-2000650903</link>
            <guid>1374316</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Splitgate 2</i>, the “what-if-<i>Halo</i>-but-also-<i>Portal</i>” shooter, had <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-maga-refunds-reboot-beta-season-3-servers-1851786742">a rocky launch</a> this year following a controversial Summer Game Fest appearance and aggressive monetization practices. But the game is hoping to open a new chapter with players after it went <i>back</i> into beta status in July 2025, after launching just a month prior. It’s marking that new chapter with a name change. The game will now be known as <i>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</i>. A promotional video describes it as being rebuilt “from the ground up.”</p> <p>He’s changed, babe. For real this time.</p> <p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/hrcUZ_F7vX8">a video posted</a> to the official <i>Splitgate</i> YouTube channel (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-returning-to-beta-splitgate-2-is-coming-back-with-a-new-name">h/t <i>Eurogamer</i></a>), 1047 Games’ design director Josh Watson describes the game as a tribute to classic arena shooters such as <i>Unreal</i>, <i>Quake</i>, and of course, <i>Halo</i>. To that end, <i>Splitgate </i>has ejected factions and unique abilities to hopefully lock into that old-school arena style gameplay, just with fancy portals. The full experience is expected to launch for free on December 17, 2025. Check out the gameplay <a href="https://youtu.be/hrcUZ_F7vX8">here</a>:</p>

   <p><i>Splitgate</i> managed to really step in it this summer after director Ian Proulx took to the Summer Game Fest stage in 2025 to deliver <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-apology-video-maga-hat-ranked-battle-royale-1851784272">an obtuse rant about the state of modern shooters</a>, all while sporting a “Make FPS Great Again” hat. As if that wasn’t enough, <i>Splitgate 2</i> featured many uncomfortable trappings of modern shooters: aggressive microtransactions and costly cosmetic bundles. And for a game that promised to return to a classic style of shooter gameplay, the inclusion of a battle royale mode was odd.</p>

 <p>As such, the release of the sequel <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-preview-impressions-1851624294">didn’t go over well with fans</a>. In response, 1047 Games pulled its shooter back into an indefinite beta status to rework the experience five months ago. Whether it will be enough to smooth things over with folks remains to be seen.</p> <p><i>Splitgate</i> impressed early on in 2019 with its fusion of classic arena shooter gameplay with portal shenanigans. They could be prone to gimmicky plays, but tossing portals into the mess of traditional arena-shooter action often proved to be a nice change of pace. Let’s see if its second emergence from beta and the new name will be enough for the sequel to make waves again.</p>

              <p data-start="138" data-end="634">Still got a “dumb” TV lacking all the smart features we’ve seen become a standard over the last decade? No need to upgrade just yet if it’s still working fine. Maybe just need to bring it into the modern age with the help of a Roku. They’re budget-friendly and simple to set up. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6241/">And conveniently enough, Amazon is currently offering the Roku 4K HDR Streambar SE and Wireless Bass Bundle at a 35% discount.</a> It’s usually listed at $230, but for a short period you can grab it for only $150—meaning you keep an extra $80 in your pocket.</p>
<p data-start="636" data-end="1261">Whether you’re trying to start streaming on a non-smart TV or you’re just not a fan of your smart TV’s clunky interface (looking at you, LG), plugging a Roku into one of your free HDMI ports is can make for a better experience. You’ll be able to access all the apps you rely on to stay caught up with new releases. Every Roku streaming device includes Bluetooth support and works with both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, letting it smoothly integrate into your broader smart home setup. Its remote also features a built-in voice assistant, making it simple to search for whatever content you’re looking for.</p>

<p data-start="1263" data-end="1704">And speaking of the remote, it’s rechargeable, so you no longer need to stock AAAs. The backlit buttons make it easy to navigate in dim lighting without the usual fumbling around. Of course, you can also just say “Hey Roku” and control everything via voice commands instead. If the remote ever goes missing, Roku even provides a lost-remote finder. Though, it’s probably slipped somewhere between your couch cushions. Maybe just check there.</p>
<p data-start="1706" data-end="2210">The home screen is completely customizable, allowing you to keep your preferred streaming apps front and center. An interesting bonus—Roku actually has its own original programming. Alongside the apps you already subscribe to like Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, and Max, you can switch over to enjoy Roku’s free original series such as <em>Dinner Budget Showdown</em>, <em>Celebrity Family Food Battle</em>, <em>Martha Cooks</em>, and <em>Emeril Cooks</em>. I promise, there’s more than only cooking shows. I just have food on the mind.</p>


<h2>Better Sound</h2>
<p>This holiday season bundle isn’t the standard Roku streamer. This is a multimedia player and speaker in one. This Roku soundbar sits under your TV so you can enjoy upgraded sound with all your shows and movies. The soundbar—or Streambar, rather—is both your sound output and the source of the Roku interface itself. It just needs to plug into your TV over HDMI and you’re set.</p>
<p>The bundle is also throwing in the Roku Wireless Bass. This can kick your already great sound up a notch by bringing a subwoofer into the mix.</p>
<p>Go grab some snacks and let everyone know that the next movie night will be happening in your living room—<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6241/">thanks to the Roku Streambar SE and Wireless Bass bundle, now available for just $150</a>. I’d recommend putting that $70 you’re saving toward a popcorn machine.</p>

              <p>Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa was an actor that everyone would immediately recognize, but perhaps many would struggle to name. Known best for his portrayal of Shang Tsung in 1995’s ridiculous <em>Mortal Kombat</em> movie, and then for voicing the character in the games since 2013, Tagawa had multiple other defining roles across an extraordinary career. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/cary-hiroyuki-tagawa-dead-mortal-kombat-actor-1236636368/"><em>Deadline</em> reports</a> he died on December 4, following complications from a stroke.</p> <p>It’s hard to think of a more iconic role than Shang Tsung, the evil sorcerer in Paul W.S. Anderson’s hokey and adored 1995 adaptation of the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> video game series, as well as 2013’s web series <em>Mortal Kombat: Legacy</em>&nbsp;(then once more in 2015’s <a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Mortal_Kombat_X:_Generations_(lost_production_material_for_unreleased_web_series_based_on_game_franchise;_2015)">abandoned promotional web series, <em>Mortal Kombat X: Generations</em></a>). But Tagawa had broad range, known more recently for his leading role as the noble and conflicted Nobusuke Tagomi in Amazon’s <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, as well as roles as diverse as Krull in Tim Burton’s <em>Planet of the Apes</em>, Hiroki Watanabe in&nbsp;<em>Lost in Space</em>, and multiple guest roles on a number of popular TV series. He also displayed a splendid lack of brand loyalty when he appeared in 2010’s atrocious movie version of <em>Tekken</em>! (As well as its straight-to-video sequel.)</p>

 <p>Tagawa was also a voice actor, portraying Valco in <em>Star Wars: Visions</em>, The Swordmaker in Netflix’s animation <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em>, and Alrich Wren in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Rebels</em>, among many others. He was a contributor to video game voice roles, too, again most notably reprising his role as Shang Tsung in various <em>Mortal Kombat</em> games, including&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 11</em> and its various DLCs. The actor is also heard in <em>World of Warcraft: Legion</em>, and 2003’s <em>Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu</em> as the eponymous criminal. Oh, and rather brilliantly, he appeared in the extraordinary mess of 1997’s FMV game <em>Soldier Boyz</em>, a game that claimed to be co-directed by Darren Aronofsky, given the footage was lifted from an HBO TV show.</p> <p>The Toyko-born actor trained in martial arts as a child, before studying karate at university. His first movie appearance was Bernardo Bertolucci’s Oscar-winning <em>The Last Emperor </em>in 1987, before going on to appear in 150 other roles. Tagawa died on Thursday morning, surrounded by his family, aged 75. RIP.</p>

            <guid>1374307</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Running With Scissors has canceled its upcoming game Postal: Bullet Paradise roughly 24 hours after it was revealed. </p>



<p>On December 3, the publisher announced the new “bullet-heaven shooter” from developer Goonswarm Games. After the reveal trailer went live, fan feedback was negative, with claims that it used a number of AI-generated assets. </p>



<p>That quickly led to a decision to pull the plug on the game just over a day after it was announced.</p>



<p>In a statement provided to press and shared online, Running With Scissors founder Vince Desi says that the decisions comes after being <strong>“overwhelmed with negative responses”</strong> from fans of the series.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After revealing&nbsp;POSTAL: Bullet Paradise, a title Running With Scissors was planning on publishing but not developing, we’ve been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned&nbsp;POSTAL&nbsp;Community. The strong feedback from them is that elements of the game are very likely AI-generated and thus has caused extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation.</p>



<p>We’ve always been, and will always be, transparent with our community. Our trust in the development team is broken; therefore, we’ve killed the project. We have a lot of good things coming (some you know and some you don’t).</p>



<p>Since forming Running With Scissors in 1996, we’ve always said that our fans are part of the team. Our priority is to always do right by the millions who support the&nbsp;POSTAL&nbsp;franchise. We are grateful for the opportunity to make the games we want to play, and will continue to focus on our new projects and updates coming in 2026 and beyond.  We can’t wait to share more! </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Currently, Running With Scissors is working on a remake of 2003’s Postal 2, called Postal 2 Redux. The studio ran a Kickstarter for the game, which raised $638,574 against a target goal of just $250,000. It’s the second remake in the franchise after Postal Redux was released back in 2016. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has attempted to contact Goonswarm Games, but no response has been received. Should that happen, it will be added to this story and shared on Insider Gaming’s social media channels.</p>

                <p>Fallout creator Tim Cain has returned to Obsidian, but what is he working on? He's not allowed to say, and says you shouldn't even try to guess. Cain also shared an update about his personal life and a new friendship with a squirrel.</p><p>In a YouTube video, Cain said he recently relocated from Seattle to southern California, and one of the first things that happened was a squirrel ran up to him with no fear. "She just sat there and looked at me, and I shrugged and I'm like, 'What do you want from me? I don't know you.'" Cain fed the critter some walnuts and continues to feed the creature every day when he leaves and comes back home.</p><p>This is how Cain started the video, before getting into his return to Obsidian. He said he's now back at the studio, in-person and full-time. While he has returned to Obsidian, you'll also see his name appear in the credits of an upcoming unspecified game that he did contract work for before coming back to Obsidian, he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCVWRZqyroA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kCVWRZqyroA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Cain also mentioned that he did contract work for multiple other games, but they are unlikely to be released. He said the years 2020-2025 were a "weird time in the industry" when lots of games began production and then got canceled, for a variety of reasons. "I really don't know the status of all the games I contracted on," he said.</p><p>As for his current project at Obsidian, Cain said he cannot talk about because "that's covered under NDA." He added, "Don't bother guessing--you're not going to guess right."</p><p>Cain was one of the core designers of the 1997 original Fallout at Interplay Productions. He also worked on the sequel, along with games like South Park: The Stick of Truth and Pillars of Eternity. He was the game director on The Outer Worlds and a creative consultant for The Outer Worlds 2.</p><p>Obsidian has had a busy 2025, releasing Avowed in February 2025, Grounded 2 in July, and The Outer Worlds 2 in October. The studio has no confirmed and announced upcoming games, but we do know that Cain is working on whatever Obsidian may be cooking up next.</p><p>Cain said he's coming out of "semi-retirement" to return to Obsidian. Before this, he was doing the previously mentioned contract work, and making videos for his "Cain on Games" YouTube channel. This channel will continue going forward, he said, adding that no one at Obsidian told him to stop.</p>

      <p>Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Shang Tsung in Mortal Kombat (1995)</p>
  
</article>

<p>For video game fans, Tagawa was best known for portraying Shang Tsung in the first live-action Mortal Kombat film. His performance as the villainous sorcerer, which featured now-famous lines like "Your soul is mine!" and "It has begun!", became so beloved that he would reprise the role in various adaptations, such as the 2013 web series <em>Mortal Kombat: Legacy.</em> Tagawa also appeared as Shang Tsung, voice and likeness, in Mortal Kombat 11’s Aftermath story expansion and the mobile action RPG Mortal Kombat: Onslaught.</p><p>Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1996807767474995239">shared his condolences on X</a>, writing,</p><p>We lost a legend today.&nbsp;</p><p>Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa&nbsp;played Shang Tsung in the 1995 Mortal Kombat film and sadly passed away at age 75. We had the privilege of his portrayal on the first MK film but also as an amazing voice actor in the Mortal Kombat 11 game.</p><p>Cary was one of a kind. He combined danger, swagger and athleticism to his roles and will always be remembered as the man who first brought Shang Tsung to life on film.</p><p>Rest in Peace. Your soul is eternal.</p><p>While closely tied to Shang Tsung, Tagawa had also portrayed another iconic fighting game villain. He played Heihachi Mishima in the live-action movie <em>Tekken</em>, which was released in the US in 2011, and its 2014 sequel, <em>Tekken 2: Kazuya’s Revenge</em>. Tagawa had voice credits in other video games: World of Warcraft: Legion, Batman: Rise of Sun Tzu, and Soldier Boyz.&nbsp;</p><p>As reported by<em> Deadline</em>, Tagawa's family confirmed he died Thursday, surrounded by his children.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/obituary/2025/12/05/mortal-kombat-actor-cary-hiroyuki-tagawa-passes-away-at-75]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rage Against The Machine guitarist Tom Morello has written a new song for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, making composer Masayoshi Soken's dreams come true.</p>
<p>The MMORPG has long had a heavy influence of rock music in its score. Jason Charles Miller, lead vocalist and guitarist of the band Godhead, lent his vocals to the game, singing Endwalker's iconic song Close in the Distance (a personal favourite), while the game's developers themselves have formed a rock band called The Primals.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-would-uematsu-do-final-fantasy-14-composer-masayoshi-soken-on-following-series-legend">asked the game's composer why he leans on rock music for inspiration</a>. "Battle content really matches well with rock music," he said. "Musically, rock is something that is easy to hype up to, and it's also easy to understand, even though rock is not necessarily the only thing that would get you excited. I just think, as a genre, it's very easy to get involved in."</p>

<p>What's more, Soken told me Rage Against The Machine is his favourite band, so this collaboration is very much a full circle moment.</p>
<p>"It all started when Jason Charles Miller told me that Soken-san, the composer of Final Fantasy 14, was a huge Rage Against The Machine fan and wanted to collaborate," said Morello in a video message shared on social media.</p>
<p>"So I got down to work and wrote this track…with Beartooth, a great band. We wanted to make something super heavy and super powerful for Final Fantasy 14. I wanted to make an absolute rocking banger of a track that would mirror the energy and the potency of this game."</p>

<p>Soken shared the post himself, calling it "nonsensical" - he's clearly very excited.</p>
<p>"To write it in an easy-to-understand way? Suddenly, a song gets sent from my top fave, and it gets implemented in the game - that's the flow, and even as I'm writing this now, it's totally nonsensical!" he said (via machine translation).</p>

<p>The track, called Everything Burns, will feature in the Arcadion battle arena. It'll also be available on streaming services from 17th December. Before then, you can hear a snippet in both the social posts and trailer above.</p>
<p>The next update for Final Fantasy 14, Patch 7.4, will be added on 16th December. Called Into The Mist, it will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-yoshi-p-glamour-restrictions-into-the-mist">lift restrictions on glamouring outfits</a> in addition to extending the game's story.</p>

		<p>Overnight, Grasshopper Manufacture had its own mini showcase in which it announced that its action game Romeo Is A Dead Man will be released on February 11th. To mark the announcement, a brand new trailer for the game was released, and it is as strange as you would expect from the mind of Suda51 and the team at Grasshopper Manufacture.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN - Release Date Trailer / 『ロミオ・イズ・ア・デッドマン』発売日発表トレーラー" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ceog9nU0ucs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Romeo Is A Dead Man’s story set up is a bit wild too. Space-time has been shattered and just as Romeo is about to die he is saved by the Dead Gear Life Support System, which turns him into cyborg. He is then recruited to the FBI’s Space-Time Police to hunt down criminals taking advantage of the chaos, while also on a mission to find his girlfriend Juliet. Romeo and Juliet. Get it?</p>
<p>Suda51’s last game was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/27/no-more-heroes-3-review/">No More Heroes 3</a>, of which Nick said, “No More Heroes 3 shines with its fourth-wall-breaking self-awareness, zany characters and stunningly slick combat. It’s not afraid to be what it is, Suda 51 and his team delivering a great instalment to the franchise that welcomes us to the Garden of Insanity.”</p>

<p>Romeo Is&nbsp; A Dead Man will launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/men-in-black-most-wanted-review-once-you-go-worm</link>
            <guid>1374271</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black</em> was an absolute highlight of the 90s and early 2000s entertainment. Threading the needle perfectly between pop culture, conspiracy, and digital and practical effects, it was a world that felt believable because it was just close enough to our own with a bit of fantasy. Coatsink has sought to bring back that magic with <em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em>, an <em>MIB </em>VR adventure set in the 90s as you take on the role of Agent I, working to stop a new alien threat coming to earth.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Agent 'I Don't Remember'</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> opens as you come to consciousness, having accidentally neuralyzed yourself. Being quickly surrounded by aliens, you have to quickly make your way back to your car, and the MIB headquarters to be debriefed.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-shooting-range.jpg?itok=lfS0GJeF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1069" height="1079">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-shooting-range.jpg?itok=4QJj6stu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1069" height="1079">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Here, you learn of a plot for Aliens to slowly invade the Earth, while you know that there's a grander conspiracy. At this time, the only activity you've heard of is some small-time smugglers. The plot thickens further as you're told that the only way you could have been ambushed in the way you were… would be if there was a mole in the MIB.</p><p dir="ltr">Armed with the knowledge of an alien to track down at a Motel, and the common sense to keep your mission a secret, you head out to begin your mission to topple this alien invasion.</p><p dir="ltr">From here, your adventure takes you to a variety of interesting locations, such as a dockyard or office building, where you enter under the guise of an inspector or someone with a meeting before uncovering the aliens hiding in plain sight.</p><p dir="ltr">I was a huge fan of the mission formula. Each mission takes you through investigation segments, where you explore the environment, stay away from suspicious eyes, and make your way deeper into any of the facilities. You'll normally be searching for clues related to alien activity, access cards, or solutions to other smaller puzzles to make your way deeper in.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-environmental-puzzle.jpg?itok=KuY3U1Uv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1070" height="1079">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-environmental-puzzle.jpg?itok=LIfx4EAx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1070" height="1079">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The exploration sections weren't difficult; they reminded me of action-adventure games from the PS2 era, but getting to complete them in VR added a new sense of fun. Something that would feel basic in a 2D video game, like opening a few drawers without being spotted for a keycard, added a new sense of tension when you had to physically spin around to check and make sure the coast was clear.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you've completed some puzzles, you'll ultimately end up in an alien base where you'll be ducking energy blasts and taking out aliens before they take you out. There are all of the classic hallmarks of an arcadey shooter, with ways to take out enemies from stealth and giant red barrels to shoot, all culminating in some kind of boss encounter.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Walk Like An MIB Agent</h2><p dir="ltr">The controls for <em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> are nice and intuitive. Moving with the left stick and pivoting with the right, your health bar is on your wristwatch, and at any time, you can pull up your mission status by bringing your left hand to your temple.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-bug-view.jpg?itok=LccTuDbQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1076" height="1079">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-bug-view.jpg?itok=Ve8nUxxE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1076" height="1079">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Your wristwatch is also where you can pull out and store your equipment. The stowing of items is partially to help keep everything in a single place to pull from, but it also adds to the gameplay, as MIB tech will be investigated by onlookers. Keeping it stowed means more effort to get out, but you fly under the radar.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> really lets you go through the whole experience of a MIB agent, showing up to a location with some made up name and agency, lets you investigate for clues, and if an onlooker gets too suspicious, you get to neuralize them.</p><p dir="ltr">Quite nicely, each level is also only ~40-50 minutes, depending on how stumped you get by the puzzles. I found that this was the perfect length for me for a single session before I started feeling any kind of adverse effects from so much running, ducking, and shooting in VR.</p><h2 dir="ltr">An Agent Is Only As Good As His Tools</h2><p dir="ltr">As you progress through each level, you earn more and more tools that become relevant to the next mission. Early on, I was unsurprised by the abilities I got, like a glove that let me move metal objects around regardless of their weight. This leans heavily into VR-friendly object movement as you just raise a hand and grip to move a metal box or vent grate off the wall.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-gun-combat.jpg?itok=4hXDGhAA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1072" height="1079">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-gun-combat.jpg?itok=7itPTuyS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1072" height="1079">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The tool that I loved the most was the spider-like robot that can walk on walls and short-circuit electricity. You can pluck it from your inventory and lob it in any direction or through an appropriately sized gap. Once the robot sets itself up, you raise your right hand to your head to swap control to the robot. Another fantastic way to make what could be a complicated button combination incredibly easy to perform in VR.</p><p dir="ltr">As the robot, you can also leap on walls, twisting your perspective of the world and opening up new avenues for puzzle solving.</p><p dir="ltr">As you progress through the game, you can also upgrade the weapons you get by spending collectible points on them. You can modify weapons to have charged blasts or fire ricochet bullets to change up how you're playing the game.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-office.jpg?itok=HPwKIeVg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1065" height="1079">

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">A Cartoon Look, But Not THE Cartoon Look</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> has a fun art style that's a mix of what you'd expect from a comic or a '90s cartoon. That being said, it's not as stylized as the old cartoon, which is a bit of a shame.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Most Wanted</em> falls into that really good level of graphics for mobile VR that's showing you something that you can accept and be a part of the world as, without trying to push too hard for a level of realism that would leave the user stuck in an uncanny universe.</p><p dir="ltr">This cartoonish style also lends itself fantastically to the big pops of color that separate the mundane and boring world of the city with alien artifacts and blood.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-magnetic-glove.jpg?itok=SwCHTOOq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1077" height="1079">

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">Invasion Mode Is VR Horde Mode</h2><p dir="ltr">When you're done playing the 8-10 hour campaign, you can take on the Invasion mode on your own or with others online. Invasion Mode is as you'd expect, you take on waves of enemies with a variety of different objectives and try to make it as far as you can on a single life.</p><p dir="ltr">After each round, you can purchase an upgrade for yourself or your weapons or consumable items. The points you spend are earned by defeating enemies. Each enemy I killed rewarded me with a different amount of points; I couldn't quite tell what was determining that amount or if it was mostly random.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of killing aliens, you might also be searching the arena for objectives like power sources to place in receptacles around the arena.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-worms.jpg?itok=FjkFrX0Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1071" height="1077">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-worms.jpg?itok=h1AN9VKo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1071" height="1077">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The purchases expand even further past upgrades, as you can also buy arena obstacles and turrets. These items let you reshape the terrain and add a bit of random/uniqueness, but in your favor.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> from start to finish felt like discovering a classic Action Adventure title from the ~PS2 era of gaming. The gameplay is a fun mix between some engaging problem-solving and sleuthing before it moves into frantic shootouts against colorful aliens.</p><p dir="ltr">Coatsink has done a fantastic job crafting a mission-based story to lead you through the alien underground, pulling the threads of a conspiracy for a fun and engaging payoff.</p><p dir="ltr">Coupled with easy to learn and dynamic VR controls, an art style that fits the subject well and welcomes you to the world, and a reasonable play session time matched to the story beats of a mission whether you're a massive fan of <em>MIB</em>, or are just looking for a great action adventure title to play on your Quest next I'd definitely recommend this.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Men In Black: Most Wanted </strong>was reviewed on Meta Quest 3 with a copy provided by the Developer over the course of 9 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>Fandom is, itself, illogical. </em></p><p><em>You do not control the team. You do not control the outcome. And yet, the vast majority of the population willingly subjects themselves to stop to regular emotional torture rooting for some kind of team.</em></p><p><em>Given how little control we have over other parts of our lives, maybe it makes sense. If the seeming randomness of sports can make us happy, maybe there will be a roll of the dice in another direction, too? </em></p><p><em>Well, if you're a Chicago Bears fan, that's probably not something to count on. But this year has been different. Special? Maybe not. Different? Yes. Patrick is ready to ride the bronco and see where it takes him, while Rob remains...you know, let's call it skeptical.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob:</strong> If you had told me back in August that I would spend part of Thanksgiving Weekend watching the Chicago Bears pulverize Philadelphia Eagles and that they would be the number one team in the NFC, I would have assumed that there was some kind of freakish midair collision that involved multiple teams' charter planes. That the Bears would be winning these games wearing blacked-out logos for the Packers and Eagles on their uniforms. And yet here we are: the Bears are 9-3 and likely headed for the playoffs.</p><p>The thing is, Patrick, I can't shake the feeling that this is 2018 all over again. An offensive-minded culture guy has sparked a formerly moribund franchise. The quarterback frequently looks mediocre but with flashes of excellence, and the defense is getting turnovers even as they give up lots of yards. The Bears could easily be 3-9 if one thing goes differently in each of those six one-score wins. If we're being honest, a lot of those games have been pretty uninspiring. "Another fraudulent Bears win!" is what you yelled as we celebrated at the Bills game, and you could have said that about quite a few of those victories.</p><p>It's hard for me to enjoy the ride this time around because 2018 was a false dawn that heralded years of deepening dysfunction, winning too much trust for a front office and coaching staff that didn't deserve it. By the end of 2019 it was abundantly clear why Matt Nagy's and Mitch Trubisky's Bears needed so many fluke wins and when the luck ran out, so did any joy in watching our football team.</p><p>So I find myself dreading the next month of football, and in particular this weekend. Because the Bears are playing the Packers, and the schedule looks brutal from here, with rematches with the Lions and Packers both upcoming plus a game against the 49ers. In previous years, the Bears were so hopeless that you weren't really publicly shamed for being a fan because nobody was seeing their games outside of ritual sacrifices on Sunday and Monday night football. Now? Patrick, everybody is paying attention to our Bears! There's a good chance four of those next five games are going to be nationally featured. And dude, I just don't want this team to be an embarrassment anymore. I am sick of the texts from friends at halftime of a Sunday night disaster: "Yo is it always like this?" Yeah, historically, it is. This is my team. This is what shaped me.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@libraryofcongress?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Library of Congress</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Dude, I’m sorry, but you have to stop this. Line in the sand. This team is fun. No, they’re not a Super Bowl team. Yes, they’ve won a bunch of coin flip games. But trust your eyes: this is a foundation.</p><p>Every basic and advanced statistic about the Chicago Bears tells you what they’re doing is real. The “maybe not 100% real” part is <em>wins</em>, but I’m sorry, this entire NFL season is about mid teams fighting one another. There is no dominant force in either conference. How else do you explain that if the Bears lose to the Packers, they move from the one to the seven seed? It’s a wholly unique year in a sport where weird shit happens and this is just a year where weird shit is happening to the Bears and they also happen to be putting things together at the right time of the year. </p><p>I’m done caveating all of that! The Bears are <em>fun</em>, man.</p>

              <p>Upgrading your work or everyday laptop doesn’t have to break the bank; especially if you know where to look for one. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are over, but there’s still one last chance left to save big on a premium laptop, and bag some freebies with your purchase while you’re at it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6240/">The 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop, which usually sits well over $2,600, is currently going for just $770 at Amazon, after a whopping 70% off its usual price.</a> It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to in a month, and the retailer is also throwing in a bunch of useful accessories for absolutely nothing. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/windows-11-pro">Windows 11 Pro</a> also comes pre-installed, so you’re saving a good chunk on that front, too. Be sure to grab yours fast, as we don’t expect the discount to stay around for long. In fact, it might not even make it into the weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6240/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Display, Fast Performance</h2>
<p>You’re getting a massive 17.3-inch Brightview HD+ touch display that brings content to life in stunning 1600 x 900 resolution. 1.4M pixels come together to deliver every detail with incredible accuracy, while the slim bezel and 16:9 aspect ratio offer quite a lot of room to work and play. You can stream your favorite shows, create presentations, and even play some of your favorite titles; all without feeling cramped. There’s an HP TrueVision 720p HD, paired with temporal noise reduction and an integrated dual array digital microphone for better video calls. Additionally, audio quality is just as great, thanks to the built-in Dual-stereo speakers.</p>
<p>For power, HP has packed the laptop with a 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 7530U Processor that is capable of hitting speeds up to 4.5 GHz. It’s more than enough to speed through a bunch of work and creative tasks without a hint of lag. The 16GB RAM isn’t massive, but still modest enough to keep things running smoothly, especially when you’re trying to multitask. You will be able to work with different applications at the same time – think catching up on Slack, hopping on a meeting with Zoom, working on a PowerPoint project – without slowing down. Storing all your important data in a single place is made easy with the built-in 512GB SSD. It should be enough for most users out there, unless you’re trying to store an entire gaming library on it. And since the storage is expandable, you always pair it with an SD card or an external hard drive to get the space you need. SSDs are also much faster than traditional drives, so you’re going to enjoy faster boot and load times as well.</p>



<p>The battery is solid, and HP Fast Charge gets it back up and running in no time when you’re running low. As for the freebies, you’ll get Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, a CD/DVD drive, a cleaning cloth, a wireless mouse, and a 256GB Micro SD. That’s everything you need to get started right away.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6240/">If you’ve been looking to grab a solid laptop without blowing your budget, this 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop is an excellent option to consider, especially at its current price</a>. You’re paying $770 for features that are usually reserved for high-end models. We recommend the machine to work professionals, students, creatives, and even casual users. Make sure you get your orders in quick, because the deal could expire at any moment now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>December 4th is Dragon Age Day, the unofficial day fans of BioWare’s fantasy RPG anthology celebrate the series. Last year, the studio earnestly participated. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954"><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i></a> <span>was only about a month old at the time, so BioWare </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-character-creator-free-download-1851713224"><span>released the game’s incredible character creator for free</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-popular-choice-stats-romance-1851713958"><span>broke down early player choices</span></a><span> on social media. This year? There wasn’t a peep from the studio on the matter. Not even a single mention of the franchise that once won “Best Game” at the Game Awards.</span></p> <p><span>If you look at BioWare’s </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>social accounts, the last time the studio used the game’s </span><a href="https://x.com/dragonage"><span>X account</span></a><span> was to repost an ad for </span><i><span>The Veilguard</span></i><span> on the EA Play subscription service on August 28. The developer’s </span><a href="https://blog.bioware.com/"><span>official blog’s</span></a><span> last post was on November 7, celebrating </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>’s equivalent “holiday,” N7 Day, which </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-n7-day-bioware-blog-teaser-url-krogan-2000642122"><span>had a small update on the upcoming fifth game</span></a><span> and the Amazon television series. You’ll find no such post about </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>. BioWare has admitted it’s become a one-game studio after massive layoffs </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767"><span>back in January</span></a><span>, so there is no fifth </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>game in the works, but the silence also casts a shadow on the RPG series’ past.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>If you’re only passively paying attention, it might make sense for the studio to not make a big deal about a series without a sequel it’s actively promoting. But for fans and the developers who spent decades working on </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>, it’s another insult to beloved games that seemed to sometimes get the short end of the stick over their troubled development.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the months since BioWare was gutted of veteran talent and </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard was </span></i><span>thrown under the bus by parent company Electronic Arts, developers have been candid about how the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>team felt like it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569"><span>wasn’t treated fairly by the broader company</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>The Veilguard</span></i><span>’s messy production saw the game rebooted from a live service no one wanted into a single-player RPG that, miraculously, came out feeling like the character-driven epics BioWare is associated with despite being a decade in the works.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>After the game didn’t reach internal projections out of the gate, EA downsized BioWare and has focused the company exclusively on </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>, and implied that </span><i><span>The Veilguard </span></i><span>may have reached a broader audience if it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-live-service-1851756169"><span>had stayed a live service game no one asked for</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>So perhaps it’s for the best that BioWare didn’t acknowledge</span><i><span> Dragon Age </span></i><span>this year. If the company had even made a tweet or blog post expressing its love for the world of Thedas and pride in having brought it to life, the messaging would have come across as tone-deaf after the hell its team reportedly went through.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>At least this way, the fans and creatives who made these games get the day to themselves, without it being co-opted by a studio and publisher that treated them like second-class citizens. Now, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>team gets the final word</span></a><span>.</span></p>

        <p><strong>The World’s Gone Quiet</strong></p><p>Everyone has vanished except 12 people, leaving behind empty towns and unanswered questions. As Rhell, a sharp-tongued mage, you explore forgotten ruins filled with ancient secrets, decode mysterious fragments left behind by those who came before, and slowly piece together what really caused this catastrophe. The few remaining inhabitants have their theories, but you might find a truth far stranger than anyone suspected. What started as a simple mystery becomes something that challenges everything you thought you knew.</p><p><strong>Discover Your Own Path</strong></p><p>Wander through nine distinct areas at your own pace – from flooded libraries and underwater cities to volcanic factories and crystal caves. Each location tells its own story through environmental details and hidden lore, along with characters that have their own mysteries to unravel. Some areas connect in unexpected ways, rewarding those who explore thoroughly. The world doesn’t just contain puzzles, it is a puzzle—one that reveals more of itself the deeper you dig. Whether you’re following the main plot or getting side-tracked by a curious detail, there’s always another secret waiting just around the corner.</p><p><strong>Shape Your Story</strong></p><p>If you choose to help the people you meet along your journey, you might see Rhell’s character develop.

Of course, that isn't to say the odd bug didn't slip through the net, but don't worry, Nintendo knows about 'em.</p>
<p>A new post on <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1996836863332831330">X</a> from <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs" tabindex="-1">@nintendo_cs</a> (translated by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social">@Oatmealdome</a> on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3m77x5mfgzd2g">Bluesky</a>), Nintendo stated that it is aware of two bugs in particular, and it's working on a fix. First, there's the City Trial 'Dyna Blade' event, which Nintendo has noticed isn't showing up as often as it should. There's also a glitch in the Free Run timer, where it stops counting if the mode is used for too long.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adjqiyon&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>It seems that the latter of these two bugs only applies if Free Run is played for a <em>really</em> long time, mind you. X user <a href="https://x.com/maziari1105" tabindex="-1">@maziari1105</a> <a href="https://x.com/maziari1105/status/1995844351768101180">shared a clip</a> of their timer maxing out after running the mode for a whopping 116 hours — so don't worry about leaving it on for an hour or two!</p>
<p>Nintendo has given no indication of when a patch will be released to remedy these issues, though we'd be surprised if we don't see it soon enough.</p>
<p>We had a blast with Kirby Air Riders when it launched on Switch 2 last month, calling it "a cracking sequel" in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">8/10 review</a>.</p>

            <guid>1374235</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are so many great games out there to play but so little space on the Nintendo Switch to download them all. The system’s built-in capacity fills up quickly, especially if you prefer digital purchases. Fortunately, expanding your available space is not only possible, but simple, affordable, and officially supported. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6239/">Samsung’s microSDXC memory card, designed specifically for the Nintendo Switch family of systems, is currently part of a limited-time sale at Amazon.</a> The 1TB model, normally priced at $122, has dropped to just $85, giving players a substantial 30% discount on one of the best storage upgrades available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6239/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="772" data-end="824">Support a Massive Library of Nintendo Switch Games</h2>
<p data-start="826" data-end="1187">If you’ve owned a Switch for a decent length of time, you’ve likely hit your storage limit. Even the Nintendo Switch OLED model, released in 2021, includes only 64GB of internal storage. The original 2017 Switch offers just 32GB, and with a portion of that dedicated to essential system files, you really have only about 25GB free for games.</p>
<p data-start="1189" data-end="1601">To put that into perspective, <em data-start="1219" data-end="1262">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> comes in just over 16GB. That’s a reasonable file size compared to blockbuster games on other platforms, but on a Switch, it takes up a significant chunk of your available storage all by itself. Two or three larger games can easily fill an entire console, forcing you to constantly delete and redownload titles as you want to revisit.</p>
<p data-start="1603" data-end="2132">This is why a large-capacity microSD card is almost mandatory. By adding the Samsung microSDXC card, you expand your Switch’s storage by up to 1TB. That’s more more than 30 times the internal space of the base model system. With that much room, you can download huge first-party adventures, tons of indie favorites, and even bulky third-party releases without worrying about shuffling files around. For most players, it’s enough space to last for years.</p>


<p data-start="2134" data-end="2704">The Samsung 1TB microSDXC card delivers read and write speeds of up to 180 MB/s, which is more than sufficient for the Nintendo Switch. It’s reliable, fast, and optimized for smooth performance while launching games or transferring data.</p>
<p data-start="2134" data-end="2704">And we haven’t even talked about the best part yet. This SD card has Shadow the Hedgehod on it. This whole lineup of Samsung microSDs features a Sonic character. The 128GB model is marked red with Knuckles, the 256GB one marked orange for Tails, and the 512GB card is accented blue with Sonic. And then at the full 1TB, we have the ultimate lifeform himself in black—Shadow the Hedgehog.</p>
<p data-start="2134" data-end="2704">It’s inherently very silly to me to put anything remarkable on the outside of a microSD card designed for the Nintendo Switch. That’s mainly because you’ll look at it once, pop it into your console, then never look at it again. I guess you can rest easy knowing Shadow is looking after your digital copies of <em>Super Mario RPG</em> and <em>Snipperclips</em>.</p>
<p data-start="2706" data-end="3132">Do note that this microSD card is&nbsp;<strong>not compatible</strong> with the newly released Nintendo Switch 2. The new console requires faster read and write speeds that you can find on an express microSD. This particular lineup of microSD cards are, however, still compatible on any of the first generation of Nintendo Switch consoles. This includes the Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch Lite, and the Nintendo Switch OLED.</p>

<p>The Game Awards 2025 has an absolutely stacked lineup of nominees and awards. There are so many categories where it could go either way, and Insider Gaming has boldly put its reputation on the line to pick the winner for every TGA 2025 category.</p>



<p>From Best Debut Indie Game to Best Narrative to the coveted Game of the Year award, you already know we are in for three hours of drama come The Game Awards 2025 night. Insider Gaming has already told you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-vote-game-awards-2025-all-categories-nominees-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to vote for The Game Awards 2025</a>; now it’s time to tell you what we think.</p>

<p><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is Insider Gaming’s pick for Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>It seems only fitting to give the biggest award more of a breakdown. Spoiler alert: This is not the first time Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is going to reign supreme in a category. New-studio Sandfall Interactive—comprised of former Ubisoft devs—set out to create something different and unique with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>







<p>The gamble paid off and continues to pay off late into 2025. Here are a handful of accolades the game has achieved this year:</p>



<ul>

<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It breaks a staggering The Game Awards record</a>.</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-announces-new-content-after-crossing-5-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s shipped 5 million units</a>.</li>

</ul>



<p>Let’s make this clear: This is who Insider Gaming thinks will win, but necessarily who the team <em>wants </em>to win. However, it’s hard to ignore the buzz and brilliance of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and IG predicts it will scoop the big one, along with many other awards.</p>

    <p><span>Return to the "Planet of Festivities" and discover the unseen side of the Penacony journey with The Dahlia.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.8 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [43 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “Memories are the Prelude to Dreams,” is coming soon, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [216 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1011805"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>As the epic journey of Amphoreus comes to an end, the Astral Express will focus on Penacony before embarking on its next space fantasy destination. This time the “Planet of Festivities” emanates a completely different aura from before, and players will have the opportunity to explore the untold mysteries alongside the new limited five-star character Constance “The Dahlia.” Meanwhile, challenging enemies and distinctive limited-time events will be introduced, weaving together an adventurous journey through the galaxy filled with danger, opportunities, and rewards.</p><p>Penacony, Land of Dreams, is a vacation spot where interstellar visitors gather to celebrate and have fun. In the previous chapter during the Charmony Festival, the members of the Astral Express successfully awakened those who had fallen into beautiful dreams, empowering them to take control of their own reality. However, beneath the seemingly perfect journey lie many unresolved mysteries. After the final battle of Amphoreus, Constance “The Dahlia” appears unexpectedly, revealing that the Trailblazer’s memories are incomplete and that some key parts have been stolen. With her assistance and guidance, the Trailblazer will work to piece together a complete and true storyline of Penacony.</p><p>In version 3.8, the Trailblazer will experience the story through Firefly’s perspective: how she initially entered the dreamscape, how she met us, and the battlefields she must face. All these questions will be answered one by one. As we follow her journey, The Family’s seat of power and the Dream of Gnawing Oak will also emerge from the depths of memories. Additionally, Firefly will encounter an old friend, closely connected to her past as a Glamoth Iron Cavalry Knight.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1011843"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>As a key part of Penacony’s memory-hunting adventure, The Dahlia will also join the roster as a playable character. She arrives in Penacony despite her father Duke Inferno’s grand plans being ultimately abandoned. The Dahlia’s target is the Remembrance, and her power is also related to that path, with the ability to enkindle and fabricate memories. She has a long history with the Garden of Recollection and Black Swan, and it is said that she has grown accustomed to betrayal. Nevertheless, The Dahlia will assist us in reclaiming the lost memories and completing the entire Penaconian trailblazing expedition. These memories hold special significance not only for the Trailblazer, but for her as well.</p><p>The Dahlia, a five-star character following the Path of Nihility, excels when teamed up with characters who specialize in Break DMG. On the battlefield, she can actively unleash a gloomy Zone. While this Zone lasts, Toughness Reduction inflicted by allies can trigger Super Break DMG, even before the enemies have their Weakness Broken. Additionally, as a graceful and elegant dancer, The Dahlia invites a teammate to become “Dance Partners.” After either of the two Dance Partners attacks an enemy target, they will deal an additional instance of Super Break DMG. On that foundation, her Ultimate applies every Dance Partner’s Type Weakness to all enemies, enhancing Toughness Reduction effectiveness.</p><p>Besides, in the upcoming version, a brand-new event titled “The Chrysos Awoo Championship” is set to begin. The Trailblazer, as a special guest, will take on the role of a chimera trainer, leading their own little chimeras to form a powerful team in pursuit of championship glory. Additionally, the event “Remnants of Twilight” will also be available, featuring a variety of battle challenges that will require players to think strategically and act decisively.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,973 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,974 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer and special program below.

                <p>Path of Exile 2 is playable now in early access, but the game's 1.0 release isn't ready yet--and it won't be here soon, it seems. Grinding Gear game director Jonathan Rogers said in an interview that the Tencent-owned studio will likely not hit the previously hinted March 2026 window.</p><p>"I'm fairly confident that we won't be out of 2026," Rogers told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-release-date-slips-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "But as I said, I never want to really completely promise anything. But I don't think it'll end up being March; we'll have to see."</p><p>There is no "specific timeline" for when Path of Exile 2's 1.0 release will arrive, but Rogers said he "certainly" hopes it won't be any later than the end of 2026.</p><p>"Obviously we're trying to get there as fast as we can, but I certainly wouldn't want to slip into 2027," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nH1hHyzUSk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7nH1hHyzUSk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In other news, Grinding Gear has announced a new update for Path of Exile 2, The Last of the Druids, which is coming on December 12. This update allows players to become a wolf, bear, or wyvern, while the update also includes a balance overhaul, in-game performance optimization, and an expanded passive tree with more than 250 skills.</p><p>Finally, Grinding Gear announced a free weekend for Path of Exile 2, coming up December 12-15.</p><p>Path of Exile 2 was released in early access back in December 2024. You can buy the game now for $30, while it will transition to free-to-play for its 1.0 launch, whenever that comes. The game is available across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
