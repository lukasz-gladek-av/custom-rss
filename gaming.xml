			<p>For years now, Tencent has been placing investments across the video game industry, acquiring stakes in a variety of companies and, in some cases, acquiring them entirely. It's been a slow-burning strategy that has undoubtedly paid off, as exemplified in a new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-09/tencent-goes-hands-on-to-reshape-10-billion-global-games-empire?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTM3MzA1NywiZXhwIjoxNzY1OTc3ODU3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNjdZOFdLR0NURlEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2RjZBMkE0Njg3MjI0Q0I1ODNBQkMwQTNDRDI0RDM5OCJ9.uRCAYv2eub16WLwH8iuw-3CIHjLxG2B4hP4gOF4G9AU">Bloomberg</a> report where chief executive officer Michelle Liu discusses her methodology that helped Tencent generate <strong>$10 billion in revenue</strong> over the past year.</p>



<p>Not only did the report include the gargantuan sales record, but it also included a few notable bits of information on how Tencent treats its relationships with the studios it acquires. Dune: Awakening developer Funcom and Dying Light: The Beast developer Techland are mentioned specifically as having benefitted from Liu and Tencent's guidance.</p>



<p>"<em>If they could already achieve everything on their own, what would they need me for?</em>" Liu said. "Tencent has a lot of experience with data analysis, benchmarks, and criteria." Experience that has clearly benefitted its partners and the studios it acquired.</p>



<p>The chart below shows just how much bigger Tencent is than other major game publishers and platforms like Roblox, <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sets-record-concurrent-users-gaming-platform/">even as Roblox smashes concurrent player count records</a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Tencent-Global-Gaming-Business-Chart-Bloomberg.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Bloomberg</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>We can always count on an extra point of view that helps us to improve the game</em>," said Techland founder Pawel Marchewka regarding Tencent's guidance in an interview at Gamescom 2025. Funcom chief executive officer Rui Casais added, at a separate Gamescom interview, "<em>When Tencent came in, they said, 'Look, you're spreading your attention.' You have a great IP that you've secured, you should really focus on that and drop the other things</em>."</p>



<p>While Funcom has not been able to avoid layoffs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-announces-layoffs-despite-dune-awakening-being-biggest-release-in-32-year-history/">Dune: Awakening was the studio's biggest launch in its entire history</a>. Techland was able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-sells-over-1-million-steam/">sell over a million copies of Dying Light: The Beast at launch on Steam alone,</a> not including those players who got it for free as part of the Dying Light 2: Stay Human bundle they had purchased.</p>



<p>Of course, it's the teams that worked on those games that deserve the credit for their successes, but Liu's earlier point still stands, and it's becoming clear that Tencent is capable of directing teams to success. We'll see if that continues to be the case <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">with its new venture with Ubisoft and Vantage Studios</a>, but $10 billion in revenue is nothing to shake your stick at.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that another retro game has made its way to the Nintendo Switch Online service, and this time, it's beloved GameCube platformer <em>Wario World</em>.</p><p>Yesterday, the gaming giant revealed that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-december-2025-rayman" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c545bd7-8940-4a33-a061-5c9542586bb3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">two N64 platformers</a> would make their way to the service, but now, if you're <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="241c07c4-1dc7-413f-8a41-5b112e805b97" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a Switch 2 player</a> (and a Switch Online Expansion Pack member, of course), you can enjoy a third at no extra cost.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Wario World</em>, it's a 3D platformer released for the GameCube back in 2003. Unlike its sister <em>Mario </em>series, <em>Wario World </em>is largely a linear affair that mixes in elements of beat-'em-ups and other genres as well.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Although the game is, of course, published by Nintendo, <em>Wario World </em>was developed by Treasure, best known for run-and-gun games and shooters like <em>Radiant Silvergun </em>and <em>Gunstar Heroes</em>.</p><p>At time of writing, <em>Wario World </em>is still the last mainline 3D platformer in which the character appeared; he's starred in <em>WarioWare </em>minigame compilations and 2D sidescrollers since, but <em>Wario World </em>is still the place to go if you want to see him strutting his stuff in 3D.</p><p><em>Wario World </em>joins a number of other GameCube games that have made their way to Nintendo Switch Online; others include the likes of "survival horror" classic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/luigis-mansion-nintendo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="559128f7-0f60-43f5-a4e0-64e6a9d1d5b0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Luigi's Mansion</em></a> and platformer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chibi-robo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5eda1a19-710c-4126-8f24-86dd16fbc1ae" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Chibi-Robo!</em></a>.</p><p>They've joined an initial lineup that includes games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, <em>F-Zero GX</em>, and <em>SoulCalibur II</em>, and with more being drip-fed to subscribers on a regular basis, it's a good time to be nostalgic for the GameCube.</p>
<p><em>Wario World </em>is available right now via Nintendo Switch Online, but you will need an Expansion Pack addon to play it. Thankfully, you'll also get access to Genesis, N64, and Game Boy Advance games if you pick it up, so it's not just GameCube titles waiting for you.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Around this time last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-update-adds-the-dreaded-illuminate-faction-plus-city-maps-and-bouncy-jeeps">filled with squishy squids</a>. These squishy squids have since come close to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">squishing Super Earth</a>.</p>
<p>Also being squished in late 2024 were some players' positive perceptions of Arrowhead's gear pricing, as a Killzone crossover arrived and was <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-suitably-festive-solution-killzone-collab-price-backlash">so throughly panned for being expensive</a> that the studio ended up giving the last bit of it away for free as a make-good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As of December 18th, though, the Killzone gear'll be making a long-awaited return to the shooter's store with some extra additions to help it feel fresh. This time in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/the-helldivers-2-x-killzone-items-return-as-a-legendary-warbond-dec-18/">warbond form</a> for the collective price of 1500 super credits, rather than as individually-sold bits which add up to cost a pretty penny.</p>
<p>If you paid for all or even one bit of this Killzone gear when it was on offer last December, this new warbond'll land in your inventory for free, with no need to re-spend any medals either. Meanwhile, if you only got the bits given away for free in 2024 or are a player who's hopped into the game since then, you'll have to fork over those 1.5k super credits.</p><p>As for what's in the warbond, the answer starts with three primary guns. There's the drum-magged StA-52 Assault rifle, the up-close killer StA-11 SMG, and the precise, charge-based PLAS-39 Accelerator rifle. Two armour sets, the heavy AC-1 Dutiful gear and light AC-2 Obedient getup, go with those and come with the Acclimated passive ability, offering 50% resistance to fire, gas, acid, and electrical damage. Finally, there are the usual capes and paints.</p>
<p>While there's no evidence it's due to arrive anywhere near as soon as this Killzone warbond, assuming it does at all, Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-little-fanfare-helldivers-2s-creative-director-shares-that-arrowhead-are-prototyping-a-roguelite-mode">let slip the other day</a> that Arrowhead have been prototyping a roguelite mode for the buggy shooter.</p>

            <p>
You know that weird chime that plays when you find a secret in the classic Tomb Raider games? Play it now in your head. You weren’t alive when those games were published? I hate you. I hate you. Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22VhPV3ml7U">here you go</a>.  Great, now we’re ready to talk about the leaked images of Tomb Raider: Legacy Of Atlantis, which appears to be the new Tomb Raider game due to be announced at G-Star K-Dog’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-livestream">Game Awards show tonight</a>. Or at least, one of them.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The leaked images come via Resetera, with posters <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-leak-spoilers-potential-box-art-and-some-info-of-tr1-remake-%E2%80%9Cretelling%E2%80%9D-has-leaked.1379143/">noting</a> that Lara Croft’s pose in the supposed boxart matches her pose in the teaser for a <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1998093291594883300">“future of Tomb Raider” presentation</a> at tonight’s festive Keighley-hauling. Hello Resetera users! I read your mean comments about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pc-games-of-all-time">our best PC games feature</a>. Spare me your kneejerk Blizzard fandom, you casuals. Still, all is forgiven as long as you keep filching alleged videogame titbits from Geoff Keighley's undies.</p>
<p>The screens appear to be trailer grabs, and show a freshly-revarnished Lara sporting her legendary blue top and twin pistols. There is minimal evidence so far of the screechy Croft mutilation we saw in the more recent borderline horror survivalism-themed games.
</p>



<p>
There is minimal evidence of much personality at all, to be honest. I confess, I’ve been sitting on this leak because, frankly, the images seem rather bland and recycled, to the point that I worried they’d been AI-generated for kicks using a combination of Lara Croft character models from various generations of Tomb Raiding. Mind you, that could be because this is a remake of the very first Lara Croft outing on PS1, spliced with the look and feel of the more recent Tomb Raider reboots under Crystal Dynamics. Lara’s gear in the image certainly gives that impression.
</p><p>
There have already been two Tomb Raider reboot trilogies, plus remasters of the first six games under Core Design. Tomb Raider has pillaged itself so often I’m not sure new varieties of Lara are conceivable. Still, please accept my totally original, never before expressed suggestion: why not, like, let Lara Croft age? Instead of resetting her every 10 years because entertainment culture at large has an institutional terror of older women in action roles?
</p>
<p>
Here is my other, definitely not original suggestion, inasmuch as I think I’ve written it on these pages before: pretty please Crystal, can you do a Tomb Raider franchise soap opera in which all the various incarnations of Lara hang out in their mansion and solve mysteries? I've got personalities worked out for each of them based on my expertise in 90s television. OG Lara Croft is the Phoebe, Angel of Darkness Croft is the Joey. Legends and 2013 Croft are Monica and Chandler. Ross gets to be Lara Croft Go and Rachel can be that Game Boy one I've forgotten the name of. Look, roll with it for fuck's sake. This is still more convincing than a Croft who can't seem to grow out of her twenties.
</p>
<p>Terrible jokes aside, I hope Crystal Dynamics make this work. They've been through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-developers-crystal-dynamics-lay-off-more-staff-say-the-series-future-is-unaffected">three</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-developers-crystal-dynamics-make-yet-more-layoffs-withjust-under-30-workers-losing-their-jobs">rounds</a> of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-employees">layoffs</a> in the past year. Best of luck with tonight's announcements, all.

            <guid>1379854</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="98" data-end="638">Many laptop users rely solely on the hardware built into their machines, and while modern laptops are impressively capable, doing everything on the laptop alone can actually hold you back. Even a 17-inch notebook—considered fairly large by portable-PC standards—still feels small compared to the displays most people use today. External monitors commonly start around 27 inches, offering significantly more screen real estate, and some setups go far beyond that with ultra-wide or even 4K panels that dramatically expand your field of view.</p>
<p data-start="640" data-end="1240">If you spend a lot of time typing at your desk, you might prefer the feel and responsiveness of a mechanical keyboard over your laptop’s built-in keys. Maybe your laptop’s speakers don’t produce the volume or clarity you want, leading you to plug in external ones. Add in a separate microphone for calls, a pair of headphones for focus, or even a drawing tablet if you’re an artist, and suddenly you have an entire desk ecosystem of peripherals that your laptop needs to connect to. The problem? Many modern laptops come with only one or two USB ports—nowhere near enough for all these accessories.</p>
<p data-start="1242" data-end="1579">That’s where a reliable USB hub becomes essential. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/">The Anker USB-C docking station fits this role perfectly, and even better, it’s currently available at a significant discount. Right now you can save 38%,</a> which knocks $27 off the original price. Instead of paying $70, you’ll only spend $43—a great deal for the functionality it offers.</p>
<p data-start="1242" data-end="1579">In need of more than one? The two-pack is also on sale for… exactly the same price as buying two individually… How about that?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1242" data-end="1579">Extended View with Triple Display</h2>
<p data-start="1581" data-end="2206">This docking station serves as a simple, single-cable solution that helps eliminate desk clutter and keep your workspace tidy. Plug one USB-C cable into your laptop, and suddenly all your accessories—monitors, storage devices, audio gear, and more—are connected at once. The dock supports 4K video output at up to 60Hz through its HDMI port, making it ideal for watching high-resolution content or expanding your desktop across multiple screens. While the USB-C data port doesn’t support video output, the hub includes two HDMI ports plus a VGA port, allowing you to connect as many as three external displays simultaneously.</p>


<p data-start="2208" data-end="2532">Charging is handled impressively well too. The same USB-C connection used for data and displays can also power your laptop. The dock supports up to 80W of passthrough charging, meaning you can leave your original power adapter in your bag. With the hub powering your device, you free up ports and simplify your entire setup.</p>
<p data-start="2534" data-end="2712">File transfers are fast and efficient, thanks to both USB-C and USB-A ports capable of speeds up to 5Gbps. Moving large documents, photos, or videos becomes quick and convenient.</p>
<p data-start="2714" data-end="2937" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With its current 38% price drop, the Anker USB-C hub is an excellent value. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/">For just $43, you get powerful connectivity, cleaner desk organization, and a smoother overall workflow—all while saving $27 off the regular price.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Wilds Faces Fresh Criticism Over PC Roadmap And Paid Weapon Skins]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-tu4-title-update-4-pc-fixed-2000652579</link>
            <guid>1379848</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been a rough year for <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a>, a fun, very streamlined action-RPG bogged down by bad performance on PC and a lackluster cadence of post-launch content. Now Capcom has revealed Title Update 4, the latest free patch aimed at getting the multiplayer grind back on its feet. While it includes the game’s first Elder Dragon, it’s also getting flack for a PC optimization roadmap that drip-feeds fixes and new paid weapon skins that monetize part of the end-game loot chase. Nine months after launch, the latest <em>Monster Hunter</em> sequel still can’t seem to catch a break.</p> <p>Arriving December 16, the <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/update/ver_01_4/">latest free content drop</a> is headlined by the Elder Dragon Gogmazios, which fans are already preparing to get demolished by. A trailer for Title Update 4 shows the ability for four players to team up with support NPCs to fight Gogma as a party of eight. In addition to new Gogma Artian Weapons, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ end-game grind will also expand with Armor Transcendence upgrades, Arch-Tempered Jin Dahaad strikes, additional support hunters Nadia and Griifin, and new optional quests.</p>

  <p>So far so good! But Capcom’s recent <em>Monster Hunter</em> showcase also revealed the game’s next set of microtransactions, the Cosmetic DLC Pack 4. This one, which isn’t part of the existing $50 Cosmetic DLC Pass, includes, among other things, new Layered Weapon designs for each weapon type. These don’t impact gameplay per se, but they do look, depending on your preference, cooler than what you earn in the game without paying. Fans aren’t stoked. “DLC like this should not exist,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1pjsfwl/cosmetic_dlc_pack_4_layered_armor_and_weapons/">wrote</a> on the subreddit.</p>

 <p>These kinds of ornaments, now increasingly common in other live-service games, are still relatively new to the <em>Monster Hunter</em> series. There was already a big stink in the community when Layered Weapon skins arrived in <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>. Capcom <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/yxq2t4/capcom_have_removed_english_plushie_weapons_video/">even removed a trailer</a> for a paid DLC pack that made weapons look like plushies because it got downvoted so much. As one fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1pjt0dt/its_just_stickers_its_just_poses_its_just_stuff/">recently laid</a> out, the microtransaction creep has been unrelenting. “”It’s just stickers…it’s just poses…it’s just stuff for the camp…”</p>

 <h2>Don’t expect <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> on PC to get fixed all at once</h2> <p>There’s also the new PC optimization roadmap that Capcom revealed during the showcase. The fixes are good, but long overdue and will be spread across multiple months rather than coming in one fell swoop. The latest performance boost begins with CPU/GPU optimization in December as part of Title Update 4. Then January will add more “PC-specific” improvements to high-resolution texture packs and VRAM usage, as well as new graphics and CPU settings. Further optimization will follow in February with a patch targeting graphical detail to reduce GPU processing loads.</p>

 <p>Does that mean the PC version will finally be in tip-top shape by the one-year anniversary? Some players are skeptical that the December update will make a huge difference and are wondering why Capcom <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1pjshc0/tu4_optimization_roadmap/">seems to have prioritized</a> other things up to this point. “One whole entire year to get optimizations, this is why all of my hunting buddies have already quit the game,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1pjs6o5/details_and_timeline_regarding_the_promised/">wrote</a> one player on the subreddit.</p> <p>In the meantime, Steam ratings for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> have improved from a <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-2-patch-notes-steam-reviews-1851785248">true low point over the summer</a>, but only just barely. It still hasn’t broken 70 percent positive. “I waited a long time before putting out a review of this game,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash">reads</a> one recent Steam review from a player with nearly 300 hours logged. “Please understand that I’ve been with this series since 2007, so I have an attachment to it unlike any other game series I’ve immersed myself in. To get to the point; Capcom is ridiculous for putting this game out the way they did.”</p> <p>The long road to redemption for the PC release continues.</p>

<p>The latest Escape from Tarkov patch has brought snow back for the first time in almost a year. The next time you load Escape from Tarkov, you’ll be prompted to install an update, and this is the winter update that brings crunchy, crispy snow back to Norvinsk.</p>



<p>In addition, multiple fixes were issued for some critical bugs plaguing Escape from Tarkov players. Get the full list below.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-most-wonderful-time-of-the-year">The Most Wonderful Time of the Year</h2>



<p>As the festive window approaches, snow has started falling in Escape from Tarkov, blanketing the game in a layer of crisp white that makes almost all outfits useless, strips foliage from every map, and deafens players using loud headsets.</p>



<p>The team at Battlestate Games rolled out the latest patch earlier today, which includes snow, along with a bunch of bug fixes and changes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed the loading wheel icon showing throughout the starting mission;</li>



<li>Fixed the camera lock and character movement lock that occurred when using consumable items before the second cutscene on Terminal</li>



<li>Fixed the inability to complete a specific task in the Batya story chapter in PvE mode</li>



<li>Fixed the lock for weapon operations and looting that occurred after looting a character that got killed while using a stationary weapon</li>



<li>Fixed the abrupt interruption of consumable item animations in certain cases</li>



<li>Fixed the incorrect spawn points for Zryachiy and his guards on Lighthouse</li>



<li>Fixed the audio artifacts when quickly skipping trader dialogue lines</li>



<li>Fixed the item icon display issues when trading while using active filters</li>



<li>Smoothed out the BTR movement</li>



<li>Fixed the incorrect message layout in the Messages tab</li>



<li>Fixed several localization errors</li>



<li>Fixed several visual geometry bugs across all locations</li>



<li>Fixed several interface issues</li>
</ul>



<p>Battlestate Games has been firefighting a little since Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update was released on November 15. The supersized overhaul introduced a string of issues that are slowly being addressed, but it’s often like fighting a hydra. As soon as they patch another bug, two more pop up.</p>



<p>Such is life.</p>

                <p>Bigfoot isn't a myth. It's real, and it's really wandering around the forests ... in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>, as a new update added the mythical sasquatch to the battle royale shooter.</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1999102778430374329" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent 39.10 update</a> that landed on December 11, players noticed something strange in Fortnite's woods. Apparently, Epic Games introduced Bigfoot to the game's sprawling world, but it isn't easy to find. Bigfoot roams the entire map, meaning it could appear by the Fore Fields, near the Humble Hills, and anywhere in between. It's also immune to damage, so shooting it means nothing. And if you get within 35 meters, it vanishes, leaving you on yet another wild sasquatch hunt before getting blasted to death.</p><p>Contrary to its name, however, Bigfoot isn't that big. As players found it, <a href="https://x.com/Dashybear/status/1999117362537037986" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">it actually appears rather little</a>. The perspective could be off, but <a href="https://x.com/NexusFNx/status/1999114419301650916" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">based on screenshots circulating on X</a>, Bigfoot looks no bigger than a budding flower. Maybe it should be known as "Littlefoot," then.</p><p>This isn't the first time Bigfoot made an appearance in Fortnite. The mythical creature was a purchasable outfit in 2019, but this is its first addition as a random NPC.</p><p>While Bigfoot ducks and dodges Fortnite's gunfights, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kim-kardashian-is-coming-to-fortnite-this-week/1100-6536858/" data-ref-id="1100-6536858">Kim Kardashian is gearing up to serve looks</a> and bullets. The social media star will join the battle royale shooter on December 13, with all the glitz and glam you'd expect.</p>

                <p>A new report detailed how much it costs for developers to have their games shown off at The Game Awards. <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku reported</a> that a 60-second trailer can cost up to $450,000, with the price scaling to $1 million for a three-minute trailer.</p><p>The ad sales team for The Game Awards can charge that much due in part to the show's massive scale. The Game Awards 2024 drew an audience of 154 million livestreams, which was up from 118 million for The Game Awards 2023. This counts streams on YouTube, Twitch, Steam, TikTok, X, Instagram, Facebook, and international platforms like Bilibili and WeChat in China, among other sources.</p><p>The viewership number for The Game Awards 2024 was <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/super-bowl-lix-averages-record-audience-of-127-7-million-viewers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many millions higher than the latest Super Bowl (127.7 million)</a>, but the comparison is not apples to apples. Super Bowl ads for Super Bowl LIX this past February <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43610365/some-commercials-super-bowl-lix-sold-8m-per-reports" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reportedly cost as much as $8 million for 30 seconds.</a></p><p>GameSpot has contacted the organizers of The Game Awards for comment on ad pricing.</p><p>People have criticized The Game Awards for appearing to be more of a marketing event for upcoming games as opposed to a celebration of developers and their achievements. Each year, people regularly criticize the event for zipping through the awards themselves and giving developers a limited time to speak while time and attention is paid to trailers and advertisements from sponsors.</p><p>Host and organizer Geoff Keighley <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-creator-hears-your-feedback-do-we-always-get-it-right-no/1100-6536808/" data-ref-id="1100-6536808">recently responded to these concerns</a>, saying "it is a balancing act."</p><p>"There's the awards aspect of the show, there's the announcement aspect, and yes, there are some people that would like to see the show be all awards. Some would like to see all announcements," he said.</p><p>Keighley went on to say that the promise of new and exciting game reveals helps raise the profile of The Game Awards and inspires more people to tune in. At the same time, if more people watch, The Game Awards can in theory charge more for ad placement.</p><p>"My view always is that the announcements create a very wide audience that tunes into the show. And because of that, when we do give out these awards, they're seen by a lot of people," he said. "Lots of games get sold out of The Game Awards. Balatro had a huge boost. So hopefully it's a good thing for developers. But that careful balance is a hard thing to strike and we don't always get it right."</p><p>The Kotaku report also mentioned that The Game Awards gives developers who are nominated for awards at least two tickets to attend the ceremony. Tickets to The Game Awards are available to the general public, and Expedition 33 developer Sandfall was reported to have "bought a swath of tickets" at around $300 each to help more staffers attend the show. Expedition 33 picked up 12 total nominations, the most ever for a game, including Game of the Year.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-how-to-watch-start-times-and-what-to-expect/1100-6536768/" data-ref-id="1100-6536768">how to watch and what to expect from The Game Awards.</a></p>

              <p><span>It was a good thing that the internet bullied Paramount into fixing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-looks-uh-1834411263"><span>Sonic’s horrifying human-like form</span></a><span> in the first live-action </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog</span></i><span> movie. If that hadn’t happened, we likely wouldn’t have gotten the great follow-ups and Keanu Reeves playing Shadow in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i></a><span>. But even five years later, who wouldn’t be morbidly curious to know what the movie would have looked like if Paramount hadn’t gone back to the drawing board? That’s what a fan group is giving us the chance to find out with </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog: The 2019 Cut</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The fan remake of the 2020 film aims to recreate every shot of the movie, but with the ugly-ass hedgehog that Paramount nearly unleashed into theaters. Originally, the team of fans was going to release a trailer this week, but it has been delayed until December 24 because they weren’t “completely happy” with the final result.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We wanted Sonic’s animation to feel as fluid as possible, and to be honest, it would have gotten some negative reviews if we’d released it today,” the announcement reads.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/vYuGKoGXDr">pic.twitter.com/vYuGKoGXDr</a></p> <p>— A26 (@A26Pics) <a href="https://twitter.com/A26Pics/status/1998924804326621228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>To make up for the delay, the </span><i><span>2019 Cut </span></i><span>team released a brief first look showing ugly Sonic running on the inside of a washing machine, and yep, that really does look like that monstrosity in a scene from the final movie. Gross!</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new trailer for a Tomb Raider Remake has seemingly leaked online, possibly for The Game Awards later tonight. </p>



<p>Geoff Keighley <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> earlier this week that Tomb Raider will be part of The Game Awards show. With many players patiently waiting to hear about the franchise’s future, they might not have expected the developers to announce a remake at the event; however, it seems like that might be the situation. </p>







<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-remake-trailer-seemingly-surfaces-online">Tomb Raider Remake Trailer Seemingly Surfaces Online</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tomb-raider-new-game-trailer-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, a user called Play4Index has posted a new video on <a href="https://x.com/Play4Index/status/1999132304979955718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that appears to be a new trailer for a Tomb Raider remake. In the 30-second video, we see Lara Croft wearing the same blue and beige outfit, exploring a jungle. It is a cinematic trailer, where we know the character swinging around, climbing surfaces, cartwheeling through flaming booby traps, and firing her pistols. Towards the end, we see her facing a dinosaur, and the video ends abruptly. </p>



<p>What’s more, earlier today, a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-leak-spoilers-potential-box-art-and-some-info-of-tr1-remake-%E2%80%9Cretelling%E2%80%9D-has-leaked.1379143/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ResetEra leak</a> also hinted at a Tomb Raider Remake. This leak consisted of the box art for the title, along with some screens from the leaked trailer. On the box art, the supposed Tomb Raider Remake is titled Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. However, there is no official confirmation from the developers, and players will have to wait for the official announcement later today to know for sure whether this game is coming. </p>







<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-prime-video-amazon-sigourney-weaver-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alien star</a> is in talks to feature in Prime Video’s Tomb Raider series. Additionally, the series is set to “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazons-tomb-raider-set-to-reinvent-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reinvent the franchise</a>“.

<p>It’s time to put on nostalgia glasses as Fortnite OG Season 7 brings back classic content from years ago. As usual, the official update’s patch notes outline all changes in Fortnite OG Season 7, and Insider Gaming has the full list.</p>



<p>Epic Games rarely misses with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kim-kardashian-fortnite-guess-what-players-saying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, and the company smashes it with the concept of bringing back entire seasons of older content. While new seasons continue to be littered with new memories and favorite moments, older seasons throughout the years have brought joy.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-og-season-7-release-date-all-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite OG Season 7</a> turns back the clock to 2018, so check out the patch notes in the new update.</p>

<p><strong>It’s not a surprise to learn that the biggest switch-ups for Fortnite’s Season 7 content include a reworked map, unvaulted and vaulted weapons, returning skins, and much more.</strong></p>



<p>You can play the Season 7 content either in normal or Zero Build modes, and it’s mostly just new, returning content. The biggest visual and performance improvements fix some terrain issues and missing foliage. Outside of that, it’s mostly a welcome back for X-4 Stormwings, Stink Bombs, and other fun content.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-fortnite-og-season-7-patch-notes">All Fortnite OG Season 7 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>Here is the entire collection of Fortnite OG Season 7 Patch Notes that arrived with the December 11 update.</p>



<h3>Unvaults and Vaults</h3>



<p>“<strong>IN: </strong><em>Dual Pistols, Balloon, Stink Bomb, Scoped Assault Rifle</em></p>

<p><strong>Available with Season launch: </strong><em>Suppressed Sniper Rifle, Scoped Revolver, Boom Box, Glider (consumable item)</em></p>



<p>In addition to returning items, the Season 7 map has returned with the Ice King’s glacier colliding with the Island once more! <strong>Polar Peak, Frosty Flights, and Happy Hamlet</strong> POIs and locations have all returned in all their frigid, OG majesty.</p>



<h3 id="h-x-4-stormwings-fly-once-more">X-4 Stormwings Fly Once More!</h3>



<p>Air superiority returns. Whether you’re flying solo or bringing your whole wing squad along for the ride, step into the pilot’s seat and fly combat-ready.</p>



<p>The<strong> X-4 Stormwing</strong> comes equipped with a mounted machine gun, built for intense dogfights but also for pressuring ground targets from above. Stay frosty though – firing for too long will overheat the weapon!</p>



<h3 id="h-improvements-changes-bug-fixes">Improvements, Changes, Bug Fixes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Ascenders and Ziplines have been added and updated in both OG Build and Zero Build, letting you zip, climb and rotate wherever the fight takes you!</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="h-looking-ahead-infinity-blade-shing-shings-onto-the-og-island-later-in-the-season">Looking Ahead: Infinity Blade shing-shings onto the OG Island later in the Season!</h3>

            <title><![CDATA[The ‘World’s First Game Created 100% Through AI’ Has a Playable Demo]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ai-game-playable-demo-codex-mortis/</link>
            <guid>1379800</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Earlier today, a team developing a game called Codex Mortis circulated PR materials for the first playable demo of this ‘necromantic survival bullet hell’. Those PR materials proudly declared the game ‘the world’s first fully playable game created 100% through AI’, which is an interesting way to promote a title to journalists, but here we go.</p>



<p>In the documentation provided, you can learn how Codex Mortis has been created ‘entirely through AI algorithms and tools’.</p>



<p>This will be a fun one.</p>







<h2 id="h-unapologetically-100-ai">Unapologetically, 100% AI</h2>



<p>The PR materials circulated by one ‘Darek Crunchfest’, confirmed that a playable demo for Codex Mortis can be explored <strong>now </strong>on Steam. The game, assembled by a developer called GROLAF, doesn’t try to paint a pretty picture – this is a 100% AI-driven title, and it’s proud of that fact.</p>



<p>The game’s bio on Steam reflects that:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Death is your weapon. Mix five schools of dark magic, unleash devastating spell synergies, and raise undead armies in this necromantic bullet hell. Infinite builds, solo or co-op – embrace the forbidden and dominate. 100% AI-driven development.<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4095390/CODEX_MORTIS_Demo/#app_reviews_hash"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Crunchfest noted in the PR email: ‘Oh, and one more thing: it’s probably the&nbsp;<strong>world’s first fully playable game created 100% through AI</strong>.’</p>



<p>It’s easy to see that the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4095390/CODEX_MORTIS_Demo/">trailer on Steam is AI</a>. It’s by no means disguised and is probably the most blatant representation of AI imaginable. It even boasts plenty of classic AI tells and artefacts.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Codex Mortis | Official Demo Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E5Oxs8lPT8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In Codex Mortis, players must assemble a ‘death squad’ and go toe-to-toe with all kinds of demonic enemies while wielding powerful magical abilities and weapons. The goal is to collect ‘ancient pages’ before an immortal boss hunts the player down and eliminates them, which is a similar concept to Vampire Survivors, with which this game has been aligned.</p>



<p>The email even mentioned that:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Vampire Survivors meets Guild Wars-style builds.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you’re a fan of Vampire Survivors, you might even say that Codex Mortis doesn’t look that bad, but it depends on how troubled you are about the use of AI to fully create a game. For some, it’s not an argument, as artificial intelligence is enabling small developers to make their games much more efficiently, so that’s another side of the argument.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you think about Codex Mortis.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sandfall-interactive-made-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-under-10-million-to-prove-it-could/</link>
            <guid>1379782</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Sandfall Interactive's debut game, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, is undoubtedly one of the defining games for 2025. Not only is it one of the most beloved titles of the year and the heavy favourite to win Game of the Year at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards 2025</a> this evening (<a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">especially after it swept the Golden Joysticks</a>), it's one of the greatest success stories this year of an independent team made up of former Ubisoft developers coming together to prove, at least to themselves, that they could make the game they wanted to make, and that it would resonate with players.</p>



<p>Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/arts/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall.html?searchResultPosition=1">The New York Times</a> (spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3m7ps6x4vgk2h">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>) reveals that's not all the studio wanted to prove. According to the report, not only did Sandfall Interactive keep the cost of Clair Obscur's development under $10 million, but it did so to prove that it didn't need to spend a crazy amount of money on a game to make something incredible.</p>



<p>"<em>Sandfall wanted to prove that indie studios were capable of making prestige games at a fraction of the budget and personnel of larger studios</em>," the report reads.</p>







<p>Now, you're probably thinking that there have been countless indies before Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 that proved you could make a top-tier game at a fraction of the budget that major publishers like Activision pour into Call of Duty every year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">and still they can't seem to get it right</a>.</p>



<p>Several games in the last two years alone proved you don't need to spend a ton of money to make something that captivates the entire industry, see Hollow Knight Silksong, Animal Well, Blue Prince, Hades 2, etc. But those games, and many like them, don't include big-name voice actors behind their characters, let alone big-name Hollywood actors. They don't include the kind of cinematic triumphs included in Clair Obscur, and they don't reach the level of triple-A polish that we're more accustomed to seeing from the likes of Rockstar, Sucker Punch, Naughty Dog, Activision, Obsidian, and more.</p>



<p>It is incredibly impressive that Sandfall was able to accomplish what it did with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and it feels more than deserving of the accolades it has been given since it launched earlier this year. Tonight, it has the chance to add to its list of accolades, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">with its record-setting 12 nominations at The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p>



<p>When Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 launched in April this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo gave it a 9.5/10 in his review, writing</a>, "<em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em>"</p>

            <p>"This game makes an expression that is impossible in reality," reads the blurb which pops up when you go to play DriveCrazy's demo. "Because it is dangerous to drive like this in real life, never imitate." "Ah," I yell as I race a kei truck down the side of a building while missiles and lava lurk in my vicinity, "I see what you mean."</p>
<p>Prompting me to give TubezGames' small lorry game a go was the fact it's just emerged from early access, having been in the oven since July 2023. Now, though, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1556010/view/565894691447373826?l=english">hit 1.0</a>, and I'm seriously considering seeing what the rest of its now-complete story has to offer.</p>

<p>The demo begins in normal enough fashion. There's a kei truck rally on, so you've got to blast your little lorry down a bunch of narrow lanes and trails in a fashion that'd make Colin McRae proud. You're rewarded technique points for clean driving, but the game also doesn't seem to mind too much if you bulldoze a few hedges or barriers without taking damage.</p><p>Then, the stage ends. As the camera fades, you see a mysterious saucer float across the sky. The next thing you  know, you're fleeing for your life through the streets of a city collapsing as aliens invade. No matter. Your truck has so much grip that it feels glued to the road, which helps in evading the missiles which menacingly float after you, the orbital strikes which attempt to get you in their sights, and the falling skyscrapers which lurch forwards across the streets.</p>
<p>Then, you turn a corner and the road's full of lava. Pants. Time to wall-ride, the game says. While your truck can take a bit of convincing to hop onto the vertical axis if you're not running at top speed, once you're racing along the windows you can nimbly jump from one side of the street to the other, skipping any gaps in the façade. It's a Fast and Furious-worthy stunt chase, but with a ride that wouldn't look out of place delivering sushi or pizza through Tokyo's backstreets.</p>
<p>In truth, I'm not sure if the level of stuntage can be taken high enough to sustain a whole game's worth of the adrenaline rush which powers the two demo levels. Then again, the Steam page mentions a battle with a giant bear and the spoiler tag in the 1.0 release notes mention, er, a large fish. So, maybe I'm fussing about nothing.</p>
<p>If you fancy finding out for yourself, you can check out DriveCrazy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1556010/DriveCrazy/">Steam</a>. At only £6, it's slightly cheaper now then it will be once its 20% launch discount expires on Christmas day.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-adds-another-mini-drone-deal-to-amazons-year-end-clearance-as-the-flip-rc-n3-crashes-to-its-lowest-price-2000652303</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you like sharing your adventures with the world and are ready to go beyond what your smartphone or a traditional camera can shoot, you need a high-quality drone camera in your setup. These don’t come cheap, but Amazon is making it easier than ever to pick one right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6348/">The DJI Flip (RC-N3) drone with a 4K camera, which usually sits at $439, is currently going for just $349 at the retailer.</a> That’s after a nice, and quite rare, 21% drop. This is also the lowest we have seen this drone drop to in a long while. The deal is open to all shoppers, but it wraps up soon. We recommend getting your orders in sooner, before that happens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6348/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dynamic Angles, Six Shooting Modes</h2>
<p>Don’t let the look overwhelm you. At just under 249 g, it’s a lightweight drone that doesn’t need FAA registration or Remote ID in America. It’s convenient to travel with, and much easier than most models on the market to use. You can choose between multiple shooting modes for different types of adventures. Getting started couldn’t be simpler; just unfold the arms of the drone, select your desired shooting mode, and send it off.</p>
<p>The foldable propeller guard offers ultra-reliable close-up coverage for when you want to take a detailed look at something, while subject tracking keeps you the center of attention, always. Flip offers MasterShots and six Quickshot modes that deliver simplified cinematic footage for dynamic angles. The modes include Drone, Circle, Rocket, Spotlight, Helix, and Boomerang. Maybe go for the circle mode when you’re trying to capture your furry friend, and the Helix mode during some early morning outdoor walks! Stabilization comes from the 3-axis mechanical gimbal, plus up to level-5 wind resistance. These come together to provide smooth footage, even in chaotic, windy environments.</p>



<p>Picture quality is stunning, thanks to the large 1/1.3-inch CMOS sensor that’s capable of capturing more light for clearer images with vivid detail. Similarly, 4K/60fps HDR gets you breathtaking videos where every little detail is taken care of. The drone also supports vertical crops at 2.7k resolution; great for sharing your adventures on social media instantly. Even better, the dedicated app comes with beautification features that edit the shots on its own when exporting the footage. What’s more, the camera records audio with noise reduction via your phone. It does a good job of focusing on your audio while cutting out background distractions, but for an even better experience, it’s best to pair the drone with a DJI mic (sold separately).</p>
<p>You’ll also enjoy up to 44000 feet/13 km of 1080/60fps video transmission. Pair that with a battery that lasts up to 31 minutes on a single charge, and explore far-off areas without a worry. The DJI Fly app makes managing the drone easy, and also supports voice control for when you’re not in the mood to tweak settings manually. Just say something like “Hey Fly, follow me” or “Hey Fly, start recording”, to begin. The box includes the DJI Flip, DJI RC-N3 remote controller, one Intelligent Flight Battery, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6348/">This deal brings the price of this top-rated drone camera down to $349, making the upgrade quite affordable.</a> You might also be able to enjoy free delivery with your purchase if you order today.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/disney-open-ai-sora-deal-star-wars-frozen-2000652583</link>
            <guid>1379758</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The Walt Disney Company and tech bro Sam Altman’s OpenAI have signed a massive deal that will allow users to create AI slop videos centered around their favorite Disney characters starting early next year.</span></p> <p><span>News of the $1 billion deal (h/t </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/disney-openai-deal-200-characters-to-sora-video-invests-1-billion-1236606401/"><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span>) comes just days after Altman was on Jimmy Fallon’s </span><i><span>The Tonight Show</span></i><span>, claiming that AI could help people raise their kids. According to the rather fluffy </span><i><span>Variety</span></i><span> report, the deal makes Disney the “first major licensing partner on Sora,” which is OpenAI’s generative AI video platform. Users will be able to make videos featuring more than 200 characters across Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and </span><i><span>Star Wars, </span></i><span>and a variety of “costumes, props, vehicles, and iconic environments” that they can then share on social media.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Importantly, the deal </span><span>does not</span><span> include “talent likenesses or voices,” so you won’t be seeing a mostly accurate Harrison Ford building a snowman with </span><i><span>Frozen</span></i><span>’s Elsa, or whatever weird digital amalgamation Disney adults decide to type into the slop machine. </span></p>

 <p><span>Characters people </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> use in their <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-energy-demands-water-impact-internet-hyper-consumption-era/">quest to rob the planet of water</a> include:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ariel from </span><i><span>The Little Mermaid</span></i></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Belle from </span><i><span>Beauty and the Beast</span></i></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Cinderella</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Mickey Mouse</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Minnie Mouse</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Baymax from </span><i><span>Big Hero 6</span></i></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Simba and Mufasa from </span><i><span>The Lion King</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Black Panther</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Captain America</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Deadpool</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Groot</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Iron Man</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Thor</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Thanos</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Importantly, the deal allows for “iconic animated or illustrated versions of Marvel and Lucasfilm characters,” so a cartoon version of Harrison Ford building a snowman with Elsa appears to be in the cards. </span></p>

 <p><span>It’s unclear what kinds of guardrails Disney (<a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-epic-fortnite-project-mickey-mouse-1851666530">notoriously protective over how its characters are used in media</a></span><span>) will put on Sora, which had to readjust back in October after users created videos of&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Altman grilling </a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089"><span>and eating Pikachu</span></a><span>. Considering that the depravity and stupidity of AI knows no bounds, I expect Disney will be regretting this deal sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The corporate conjunction also means Disney will be folding OpenAI into its daily operations, including “deploying ChatGPT for its employees.” It’s unclear if that means AI-generated content will be in the next </span><i><span>Moana</span></i><span> film. Disney is investing $1 billion into Altman’s AI company, so it clearly wants to get its money’s worth.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Disney CEO Bob Iger rang the “AI is good” bell in an official statement, saying, “Technological innovation has continually shaped the evolution of entertainment, bringing with it new ways to create and share great stories with the world. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.”</span></p> <p><span>Today, </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/disney-google-ai-copyright-infringement-cease-and-desist-letter-1236606429/"><span>Disney sent Google a cease-and-desist letter,</span></a><span> accusing the company of using AI to engage in copyright infringement on a “massive scale.” LOL. LMAO, even. </span></p>

    <div>
        
<p>Sandfall Interactive has revealed how much it cost to develop and release Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In a new profile piece for the New York Times, the developer of one of 2025’s biggest hits talked about the game’s development, the approach to creating the game, and more.</p>



<p>As part of that talk, Sandfall claims that Clair Obscur was built for less than $10 million.</p>







<p>In order to achieve that goal, the studio chose to not have the game be a true open-world title. They say that they decided to use other classic role-playing game (RPG) design choices such as having battles take place in specific “arenas” rather than out in the overworld and having the map be a “miniature version of the explorable realm”. </p>



<p>Since its launch in April, Clair Obscur has sold over 5 million copies worldwide. It’s also been up for numerous awards, including Game of the Year from shows like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/golden-joystick-awards-2025-all-award-winners/">Golden Joystick Awards</a>—which it won—and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>. </p>







<p>What do you think of the budget for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 being less than $10 million? &nbsp;Leave your thoughts down below and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Rockstar Games is busy readying everyone for the arrival of GTA 6, but continues to work on GTA Online in the background, going as far as dropping a new gameplay feature to enrich the raucous online game further.</p>



<p>Each day feels longer than the last in the wait for Grand Theft Auto 6. Rockstar Games is busy developing and polishing one of the most anticipated games of all time. This doesn’t mean <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-players-can-get-free-500000-through-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online</a> is kicked to the curb, though, and if you look carefully enough, you might see the game has WORKED OUT something new for you.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-online-adds-gyms-amp-working-out">GTA Online Adds Gyms &amp; Working Out</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Strong move. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The ability to work out and visit gyms in GTA Online has been discovered ahead of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-reveal-trailer-is-already-two-years-old/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>‘s full launch.</p>







<p>GTA Online has continued to receive updates and improvements over the years, but this feels like quite a meaningful update so far into the game’s lifecycle.</p>



<p>As shown by <a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown"></a><a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GTA 6 Countdown</a>, you can work on your Bench Press, stretch out on some yoga mats, do some curls, and other gym-related curricular activities. Always remember: Swole is the goal!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>YouTube creator NikTek has gone as far as speculating that this could be Rockstar Games testing out the incorporation of gym features for GTA 6. It’s not like this would be the first time we’ve ever seen these mechanics in a GTA game, as San Andreas famously used life-sim features such as hunger, weight gain, strength, and other biological attributes to influence your gameplay.<a href="https://x.com/NikTek"></a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What do you think Rockstar’s intentions with this addition are? Is it simply a fun new feature for GTA Online, or is it obvious foreshadowing for GTA 6?

                <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been one of 2025's breakout success stories in gaming, and it was developed on a relatively small budget, apparently.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/arts/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall.html?searchResultPosition=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times reports</a> that the budget was "less than $10 million," crediting the information to developer Sandfall. The report added that the team "conserved resources" by purposefully avoiding an open-world setup in favor of making Expedition 33 a turn-based game.</p><p>Sandfall's Guillaume Broche said Sandfall now has the right technology to "make those games with a relatively small team," and he hopes to see more like it from other studios.</p><p>"Games like this are coming. We are lucky to be early," he said.</p><p>Broche did not elaborate as to what technology specifically he was referring to as it relates to being able to embrace new systems to build games on a smaller budget. GameSpot has contacted Sandfall for further details on Expedition 33's budget.</p><p>Independent developer Billy Basso, who made Animal Well, said he hopes to see "more straightforward games" in the future. "You don't need to fill your game with hundreds of hours of checklist content," Basso said.</p><p>Expedition 33 was also notable for its relatively lower price point, as the game sells for $50 instead of the $70 or more that many other games ask. Some industry-watchers have theorized that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">AAA games are becoming unsustainable</a> due in part to their larger budgets, and in turn, the requirement that they sell lots of copies to make their money back.</p><p>Expedition 33 was developed by a "core team" of about 30 people, the report said, with battle animations outsourced to a studio in Korea. Sandfall also worked with other external teams on things like marketing and localization. The game's credits list <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/241065/clair-obscur-expedition-33/credits/windows/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hundreds of people</a> who worked on the game, and this has led some to question if the game should have received a nomination for "Best Independent Game" game at The Game Awards. <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Previous estimates</a> suggested the game's budget was as much as $25 million.</p><p>The game has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-getting-a-free-update-with-new-boss-battles/1100-6535296/" data-ref-id="1100-6535296">sold more than 5 million copies</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-breaks-game-pass-records/1100-6536666/" data-ref-id="1100-6536666">broke Xbox Game Pass records.</a> It's nominated for 12 awards at The Game Awards, including overall Game of the Year, and that's the most nominations for any game in the show's history.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-how-to-watch-start-times-and-what-to-expect/1100-6536768/" data-ref-id="1100-6536768">how to watch and what to expect from The Game Awards.</a></p>
