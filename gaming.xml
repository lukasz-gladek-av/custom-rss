And while Sony continues to fight on with its PlayStation despite the war being over, Xbox CEO Phil Spencer recently confirmed that, yeah, it’s all over, and the company is no longer trying to steal users away with exclusives. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197298" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over the weekend, Spencer sat down for a lengthy interview with <em>XboxEra</em></a></span><em> </em>in which he discussed his favorite games, talked about what various Xbox studios are working on, and dished on the industry at large. And he was also honest about Xbox no longer being part of any console war, as it shifts to selling Xbox games on other consoles, like PlayStation. </p><p>“I would love to make all of the money for all of the games that we ship, right? Like, obviously we make more on our own platform,” said Spencer. “It’s one of the reasons that investing in our own platform is important. But there are people, whether it’s their libraries on a PlayStation or Nintendo, whether it’s they like the controller better, they just like the games that are there.”</p><p>“I’m not trying to move them all over to Xbox anymore,” added Spencer. </p><p>That last quote, about not trying to bring everyone over to Xbox anymore, is a very telling one. And for sure, Xbox hasn’t <em>really </em>been competing with Sony or Nintendo for a few years now—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-boss-spencer-halo-ps5-switch-exclusive-no-red-line-1851697549?_gl=1*1n51jqf*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTg4NjcwMy40ODYuMS4xNzM5OTEwODE3LjUwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-boss-spencer-halo-ps5-switch-exclusive-no-red-line-1851697549?_gl=1*1n51jqf*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTg4NjcwMy40ODYuMS4xNzM5OTEwODE3LjUwLjAuMA..">that kinda stops when you start selling your games on their platforms</a></span>—but this is confirmation from Spencer that Xbox was once fighting in the console wars  and that it no longer is part of that battle, as the entire point of the console wars was to sell more boxes and steal away other players with exclusives. </p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Spencer further explained that Asia is one of Xbox’s “fastest-growing regions,” and it’s thanks in large part to Cloud Gaming via Game Pass and PC. And according to Spencer, the users driving this are players who were never going to buy an Xbox. </p><p>“We were never going to catch that person with our console,” said Spencer. <br>So let’s find them in a way that works, and it’s better for <em>Indiana Jones</em>. It’s better for Xbox.”</p><p>If it wasn’t obvious before, this is the ultimate confirmation that the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">console wars have indeed ended.</a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo doesn’t care anymore and just releases consoles whenever it works best for itself rather than trying to directly compete with the other big players in the space via powerful hardware. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-playstation-xbox-fans-react-angry-1851752763&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-playstation-xbox-fans-react-angry-1851752763">Xbox is happy to sell you a game on PS5 or Switch</a></span> or even just let you stream it via the cloud.

So I guess they won, but I’m not sure it really matters in 2025. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It also sees the return of loot boxes, updates to Overwatch 2's competitive mode, and more. You can see the full patch notes below.</p><p dir="ltr">The addition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-more-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/" data-ref-id="1100-6529410">Perks is by far the biggest feature of Season 15</a>. There are basically no balance changes, aside from the game-altering addition of four perks for each hero. Over the course of a match, players will earn XP from dealing damage, earning eliminations, and healing allies. As players level up, they'll get to choose between one of two minor Perks at level two and one of two Major Perks at level three.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZR6lbjMFnk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mZR6lbjMFnk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Minor Perks augment existing abilities in smaller ways, while Major Perks are designed to be a game-changing moment that can massively change how an ability works or even grant a hero an entirely new one. Blizzard says the feature will add more player choice and strategy to matches. For a full breakdown of all the new Perk abilities for each hero, check out the patch notes at the bottom of this article.</p><p dir="ltr">As for other changes, Season 15 also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-loot-boxes-very-soon-with-some-changes/1100-6529450/" data-ref-id="1100-6529450">brings back loot boxes</a>, which can be earned through weekly challenges and the game's free and premium battle pass. They are not available for purchase separately. Players can earn three free loot boxes each week, with players getting a guaranteed Legendary item after opening 20 boxes and a guaranteed Epic item after opening five. At least one Rare item is guaranteed to drop in every loot box.</p><p dir="ltr">On the competitive side of the update is a rank reset, as well as the removal of two maps, Hanaoka and Throne of Anubis, from the rotation. Players can also earn new Galactic weapon skins with their competitive points.</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 Season 15's addition of Perks may be a big change, but an even bigger ones will be coming as part of Season 16 with the introduction of the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-round-based-stadium-mode-looks-to-reinvent-blizzards-shooter-in-a-big-way/1100-6529416/" data-ref-id="1100-6529416">third-person Stadium mode</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-latest-hero-is-the-crossbow-wielding-bounty-hunter-freya/1100-6529451/" data-ref-id="1100-6529451">new hero, Freya</a>.

Are you ready to rise? Show the world your skill and climb the ladder like never before—victory awaits.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Skill Rank Reset</strong></p><ul><li>The highest Ranks (Master, Grandmaster, and Champion) have been tuned to include a higher percentage of the player population once players are well calibrated.</li><li>Given the addition of Perks and the tuning of higher Tiers, this reset is designed to put players on an even playing field and give them a chance to climb even higher than ever before.</li><li>All ranks in Role Queue and Open Queue in Competitive Play have been reset to Unranked and all players will need to complete their respective 10 placement matches for each role.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Competitive Rewards</strong></p><ul><li>Galactic Weapon Variants can now be unlocked with Competitive Points, allowing you to reach for the stars while you rank up.</li><li>Jade Weapon Variants join Gold Weapon Variants as Legacy Rewards.</li><li>Legacy Rewards can be purchased with Legacy Competitive Points.</li><li>Competitive Weapon Charms will be awarded to players in Platinum and above in Season 16 based on your performance in Season 15.</li><li>End-of-season titles for Competitive Role Queue now include the role the rank was achieved in.

Warlock Ashe, Greek Gods skins, etc).</li><li>Custom ultimate lines are now enabled for several Mythic skins, with more to come in future patches.</li><li>Previously unused custom ultimate lines are now available for several other skins.</li></ul><p>Developer Comment: Going into Overwatch 2, we took into account player feedback that skin-specific ultimate lines from enemy heroes created gameplay difficulties for many players. As such, we restricted any custom hostile ultimate VO to special game modes, but we were not able to implement them into the broader game.</p><p>By changing the way we trigger ultimate voice lines, we can now play a player-specific custom line without affecting the line heard by enemy players. This means that we'll have much more flexibility for changing ultimate voice lines in the future.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Emotes</strong></p><ul><li>Emotes can now be cancelled mid-animation shortly after they are activated.</li></ul><h4>Introducing Perks</h4><p>Take your gameplay to the next level with Perks—Overwatch 2’s dynamic new mid-match upgrade system for Quickplay and Competitive. As the action heats up, unlock and choose game-changing abilities to amplify your hero’s power and evolve your strategy in real time. Adapt to every challenge, counter your enemies, and turn the tide of battle in your favor.</p><ul><li>Perks are now enabled in Quick Play and Competitive modes.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to gain Perk progress</strong></p><p>• Perk progress is gained by dealing damage, securing eliminations, and healing your allies. • Throughout the match, the rate at which you gain Perks will gradually increase. • When you eliminate an enemy who is at a higher perk level than you (full level), that elimination is also worth more Perk progress.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Swapping Heroes</strong></p><ul><li>When you swap heroes, your new hero will be set to level 1 with zero perk progress.</li><li>Your progress will be saved on any heroes that you play throughout the round though. So, if you played Tracer to Level 3 and got her Major Perk, when you switch back to Tracer you will be at Level 3 with your perks equipped.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Selecting Perks</strong></p><p>There are multiple options available to select your perks into fit your personal play style.</p><ul><li>Standard Selection: Hold down Left Alt on keyboard or up on the directional pad for controller, then aim at the left or right perk or press your shoulder buttons on controller to select.</li><li>Quick Selection: You can also set your own bindings to select your perks without bringing up the Perk selection user interface, which is great for once you've really gotten your perks down and don't need the menu.</li><li>You can also bind your perk selection to be a toggle instead of holding by default.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Celebrate In Our Perked-Up Event</strong></p><p>Celebrate the debut of Overwatch 2’s game-changing Perks system with the Perked Up Event, available all season long. Take on challenges to snag weekly rewards, including up to 10 Loot Boxes per week and Rainy Day Mercy! Plus, team up with the community via Twitch Drops and Support a Streamer to unlock Rainy Day Mei and Tracer. This limited time event runs from February 18 to April 22.</p><ul><li>For season 15 only, players can earn up to an additional 10 loot boxes each week by completing up to 15 games with wins counting as double.</li><li>Challenges for Loot Boxes reset every week, so any loot boxes not earned in that week are missed out.</li></ul><h4>Hero Perks</h4><p>Instead of hero balance updates, we're opening up Season 15 with adding Hero Perks to all 41 heroes. Our intention is to give you some time to adapt to such a large shift for the game, but we'll be monitoring to see if any perks need immediate tuning. So, check out each new perk and plan out new strategies and playstyles that can benefit your playstyle.</p><h4>Tanks</h4><h5>D.Va</h5><p dir="ltr">Bunny Stomp</p><ul><li>Call Mech's damage radius is increased by 50%.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Ejection Suit</p><ul><li>Eject grants 75 temporary overhealth.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Shield System</p><ul><li>Convert 150 health to shields.

                <p>Silksong, the highly anticipated sequel to Hollow Knight that has the player take control of the mysterious Hornet, has been removed from Nintendo's eShop. While the game is still listed on the PlayStation Store, Xbox, Steam, and the Nintendo eShop in the EU, the circumstances of why it was removed from Nintendo's North American eShop is a mystery.</p><p>A strong theory is that it's being moved to a Switch 2 launch and not outright canceled. Just last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-gives-hopeful-update-says-game-is-real/1100-6528905/" data-ref-id="1100-6528905">developer Team Cherry assured fans</a> that development was going smoothly and that the game would indeed be released at some point.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Yes the game is real, progressing and will release. &lt;3</p>  — Matthew Griffin (@griffinmatta) <a href="https://twitter.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>"Yes the game is real, progressing and will release," said Team Cherry marketing and publishing lead Matthew Griffin, in response to a fan asking about Hollow Knight: Silksong's development. Unfortunately, no other details were given. Since being announced six years ago, updates have been sparse and sporadic at best.</p><p>In fact, in 2022, Hollow Knight: Silksong won a "Most Anticipated Game" award from Unity. Team Cherry thanked the community for their support and said "It can't be too much longer, surely!" It won again last year but without any word from the developers.</p><p>Nintendo will be hosting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Direct presentation on April 2</a> focusing on the Switch 2, so the game may make an appearance there.</p>

			<p>Relic Entertainment, the Vancouver-based developer behind games like the first two Homeworld, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War, Company of Heroes, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-iv-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires IV</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned</a> to independence last year after SEGA decided to sell it. Earlier this month, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/relic-entertainment-announces-ambitious-plans-for-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a roadmap for its future, including support of existing titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/company-of-heroes-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Company of Heroes 3</a> and the development of smaller titles.</p>
<p>Today, Relic unveiled Earth vs Mars, one of this new indie-style breed of games. These 'Relic Labs' games will allow the studio to explore new sub-genres, experiment, and release games more frequently. Earth vs Mars is a single player turn-based strategy game where a group of commanders must lead Earth's military as they face an overwhelming Martian invasion of high-tech saucers, grav tanks, and elite alien warriors in a battle for the survival of the planet.</p>
<p>Players have the opportunity to combine human "volunteers" with Earth creatures to create powerful hybrid super soldiers to fight alongside Earth's regular military. As they go through the campaign, new creatures, powerful unit upgrades, and game-changing commander abilities can be unlocked. But the enemy will evolve as well, deploying everything from the sentient organic weapon known only as The Creep to the Martians' own mutant creations.</p>
<p>Many of the units featured in Earth vs. Mars will have their own unique abilities, adding new strategies and gameplay depth to this style of play. There will also be multiple commanders in the game, each bringing passive and active abilities to enhance the way you play.</p>

<p>Earth vs Mars will feature an expansive, narrative-driven campaign consisting of over thirty hand-crafted missions. There's also a VS mode where players can fight against the AI on custom maps.</p>
<p>In online multiplayer, the game pits you against other commanders as either the armies of Earth or the forces of the Martian invaders. Moreover, a full-featured map editor allows players to create custom maps and scenarios. There's no release date yet, but you can wishlist the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3269230/Earth_vs_Mars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> right now.</p>

Today, employees of NetEase Games working on <em>Marvel Rivals</em> have shared that they have been laid off, and the Seattle studio is being shut down.</p>

<p>The news broke on LinkedIn as employees began sharing their stories about being laid off. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thadsasser_this-is-such-a-weird-industry-my-stellar-activity-7297672154060361729-xYIX?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAWFcNgBTnKdYM4ShDjI2C0H2DackkNIFLU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Thaddeus Sasser LinkedIn">Game Director Thaddeus Sasser wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This is such a weird industry...</p>

<p>My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games...</p>

<p>...and were just laid off!</p>

<p>Oh well! Times are tough all over - Let's find these incredible people new jobs, because we all need to eat, right? :D"</p>

<p>He went on to share a profile of Garry McGee, a level designer who is one of the many people now looking for a job. Another level designer, Jack Burrows <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-burrows-b7896399/recent-activity/all/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jack Burrows LinkedIn">wrote on LinkedIn</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Hey folks!<br>
Welp, just got laid off from my job working on Marvel Rivals with NetEase.</p>

<p>Was an enormous pleasure to work with my American coworkers who join me in this sad culling.<br>
Just couldn't dodge that big boot I guess, no matter how big the success of the gig.</p>

<p>So now I’m seeking a new role and would appreciate your support. If you hear of any opportunities or just want to catch up, please send me a message or comment below. I’d love to reconnect. hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#YaCantWinThemAll"</p>

<p>Released last year, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> has been a huge success as a hot hero shooter that has taken on the behemoth of Blizzard and the <em>Overwatch</em> franchise. It picked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Marvel Rivals Player Count Reaches 10 Million in &quot;Just 72 Hours&quot;">10m players in its first 72 hours</a>, and it has been going strong since with players flocking to the hero shooter featuring some of their favorite super heroes.</p>



<p>The move comes as Netease has been downsizing a lot of its operations outside of China, and studios it has backed. It has impacted a number of other studios that they previously backed such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Just Cause Creator's Studio Liquid Swords Announces Layoffs">Liquid Swords </a>(from the creator of <em>Just Cause</em> ), <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-layoffs-netease-report" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Visions of Mana Studio Hit by Huge Layoffs on Release Day Per Report">Ouka Studios</a> (released <em>Visions of Mana</em>), and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" BioWare Veteran's NetEase Studio Worlds Untold to &quot;Pause Operations&quot;">Untold Worlds </a>(from Bioware alumni Mac Walters)</p>

<p>This continues a trend over the last few years where we've been seeing massive layoffs. In this case, it seems that even a commercially, massively successful hit isn't enough to stop a company from deciding that they might be able to get people working on it cheaper somewhere else.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals, one of the more success games of the last year, has seen its development staff it with layoffs. According to multiple posts on social media, publisher NetEase has laid off an entire Marvel Rivals development team.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals’ game director Thaddeus Sasser <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297672154060361729/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">took to LinkedIn</a> to reveal the news on Tuesday afternoon. </p>



<p>“This is such a weird industry…” Sasser wrote. “My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games…and were just laid off!”</p>



<p>Based on his wording, it’s unclear if Sasser was included in the layoffs or if it was just his team. Insider Gaming reached out for comment, but Sasser declined.</p>



<p>According to Sasser’s profile, his team—which is based in Seattle, Washington—focused on game and level design.</p>



<p>One member of his team, a level designer from the game, Jack Burrows, confirmed he was part of the layoffs. No reason was shared by either party for the cuts.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has also reached out to NetEase for comment on the layoffs and how many people are being let go. Should a response to any outstanding questions be received, they will be added to this story.</p>



<p>Since its release, Marvel Rivals has been at the top of the player count charts on Steam. The game peaked at 644,269 on the platform while it continues to average over 255,000 people per day on Steam alone.</p>

                <p>Activision has announced Call of Duty: Recon Squad--but it's not the next entry in the series. Recon Squad is a new community feedback program that Activision is launching to gather thoughts and opinions from fans about the state of the game. Activision is debuting this as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarfareIII/comments/1icjzkt/is_black_ops_6_really_that_bad_and_people_are/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">online sentiment around the state of Call of Duty is wavering</a>, with many saying Activision is not doing enough to support the game.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/02/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-two-reloaded-announcement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Activision said Black Ops 6 and Warzone players may receive an invitation to join Recon Squad via an invitation from the market research company Fuel Cycle.</p><p>"You'll have opportunities to provide feedback through surveys, online community discussion boards, and potentially even invited to focus groups," Activision said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4445883-screenshot2025-02-18at2.52.38pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445883" data-ratio="0.55540166204986" data-width="722" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4445883-screenshot2025-02-18at2.52.38pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445883"></a><figcaption>Introducing Call of Duty: Recon Squad</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4445883-screenshot2025-02-18at2.52.38pm.png"></figure><p>Players in the Recon Squad program can earn points by submitting feedback that can then be redeemed for in-game content for Black Ops 6 and/or Warzone. To begin with, Fuel Cycle surveys will focus on recently released content for Black Ops 6 and Warzone, along with "many other topics related to Call of Duty."</p><p>The feedback program is available by invitation only. Activision said it's looking for feedback from "all types of players," including those who play Call of Duty a lot and those who do not. Players will be informed of an invitation to the program by way of the email they have connected to their Activision ID.</p><p>In recent weeks and months, some Call of Duty players have complained about the state of the game in Black Ops 6 and Warzone, especially in the area of cheating. Players have also expressed opinions about Activision simply not giving players enough compelling reasons to come back to Call of Duty.</p><p>In other news, Activision just announced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-reloaded-adds-tmnt-event-plus-splinter-included-in-paid-pass/2900-6270/" data-ref-id="2900-6270">lot of new maps, modes, features, and more coming to Black Ops 6 and Warzone in the Season 2 Reloaded update</a>, including the long-awaited TMNT crossover.

                <p>One of the original Xbox's designers, Seamus Blackley, said that computing power isn't a helpful selling point anymore when it comes to consoles.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/xbox-creator-seamus-blackley-narrative-around-being-more-powerful-not-helpful-today/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, Blackley said that the power-first approach worked for the original Xbox back in 2001 since graphics weren't as polished as they are now. Focusing the narrative on computing power helped the Xbox stand out among Japanese hardware companies.</p><p>"We were a Western company and we were saying 'Okay, we’re going to lose money on these to make them super powerful' and take a bet on the games being awesome," Blackley explained. Back then, the original Xbox was the only console with a built-in hard drive that could handle games like Halo: Combat Evolved, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, Fable, and Shenmue 2.</p><p>It was a way for Xbox to get its foot in the door in the video game-console space, but Blackley said had he still been at Microsoft, he wouldn't have continued the power-focused branding for Xbox.</p><p>He also noted reminisced on seeing Gran Turismo for the first time on the original PlayStation, and how he absolutely had to buy it because its graphics were ahead of its time. However, he acknowledged that graphical power hit a plateau and that he doesn't get excited about power anymore.</p><p>Blackley explained that the battle for content has pivoted to where platform-holders need to create compelling experiences. He pointed to the Nintendo Switch, where he said he played through The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild three or four times. The portability factor also granted him long Skyrim sessions on airplane flights.</p><p>Sony and Microsoft have taken note of the Switch's immense success and are reportedly both producing native portable <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-reportedly-developing-a-ps5-portable-system/1100-6528023/" data-ref-id="1100-6528023">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-rumored-to-launch-in-2026-with-new-call-of-duty/1100-6528636/" data-ref-id="1100-6528636">Xbox systems</a>, respectively.</p><p>Currently, the most powerful console on the market is the PS5 Pro. Despite its hefty $600 price tag, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pros-huge-price-didnt-negatively-impact-sales-sony-says/1100-6527685/" data-ref-id="1100-6527685">Sony said that it did not negatively impact sales</a>. It seems like Xbox boss Phil Spencer echoes Blackley's sentiments, as he said Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-playstation-and-nintendo-console-market-isnt-growing-phil-spencer-says/1100-6527787/" data-ref-id="1100-6527787">isn't planning on releasing a mid-gen</a> refresh like Sony did with the PS5 Pro because an incremental increase in graphical power doesn't provide a unique experience.</p>

The press material for the special, which first aired on Dec. 17, 1996, called him an “illusionist.” That feels closer, but still not quite sufficient. The special, which was directed by Jay’s regular collaborator David Mamet, combined a number of astonishing card tricks with a breezily thorough recounting of the history of magic.&nbsp;That was more or less Ricky Jay's act; no one else has ever really done anything like it.</p><p>Ricky Jay, who died in 2018 at the age of 72, combined mastery of his craft with a thorough knowledge of its culture and lore. His&nbsp;<em>52 Assistants</em>&nbsp;special was notable for his ability to throw playing cards into a watermelon and also his skill at explaining the long history of the cups-and-balls trick. You probably don’t need to be told not to get tricked into playing that by a hustler on the subway; Jay walks his audience through the long history of that hustle.</p><p>The special&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7InE1zXAY4" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">exists online</a>&nbsp;in smudgy/greasy form, but it has never been released in a proper format. It deserves one—it deserves a remaster, a real streaming option, a version that is not in 480p, sourced from someone’s old VHS copy. Fortunately there are people who are obsessive about archiving media in the same way that Ricky Jay was about keeping alive the work of old-timey conjurers. One of those people is&nbsp;<a href="https://aftermath.site/author/chris-person" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Chris Person</a>, a contributor at&nbsp;<a href="http://aftermath.site/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Aftermath</a>. He recently acquired and digitized the highest-quality copy of Jay’s special we have. It now also&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/ricky_jay_and_his_52_assisstants_rf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">exists online</a>.</p><p>I am not the only one who was giddy to watch this special. David Roth and I decided this was all cool enough to ask Person about how this all came about, and about the work of digitizing work that's otherwise on the verge of disappearing.</p><figure><figcaption>HBO</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Dan:&nbsp;</strong>Chris, your work archiving media that might otherwise be lost is so admirable. How did you get involved in this kind of work?</p><p><strong>Chris:&nbsp;</strong>It started by being a Chris Elliott fan and a guy who encodes video for a living. In the ’80s he did two specials:&nbsp;<em>Action Family</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>FDR: A One Man Show</em>. The idea of the former is that the exteriors are a shot-on-film police procedural like&nbsp;<em>Columbo</em>&nbsp;and all the interiors are a three-camera sitcom like&nbsp;<em>The Brady Bunch</em>. The latter is an extended parody of one-man shows. Both are online in absolute dogwater quality, so I dug deep and found the most advanced VHS archiving project around: VHS-Decode. You can read&nbsp;<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-person-saving-the-media-you-love-is-you-vhs-decode-domesday-duplicator-ld-decode-laserdisc" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">my entire writeup of it here</a>&nbsp;because it’s complicated, but the short version is you solder wires into a VCR to extract as close to the raw tape signal as possible. From there, you are doing the decoding of the image in software. If you wanna see what a freakishly clean encode upscaled to 4K looks like on a tape from 1987 of The Cure on the BBC, check this shit out:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Cure - Catch, Why Can't I Be You? &amp; Hot Hot Hot!!! (Live) - The Tube (1987)" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ks1wE_NXWv8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>From there, I would just compulsively buy stuff that had no good encode. VHS and Laserdisc tends to be a pretty big blind spot for a lot of people who archive media. If you do this enough, eventually people will come to you. Eventually, I was approached by John Hand of&nbsp;<em>Pulsing Cinema</em>, who found a production dub of Ricky Jay in an eBay auction of a bunch of random HBO tapes. I got to work, and now we have a copy on Archive.org that doesn’t suck.</p><p><strong>Dan:&nbsp;</strong>I have a tangential reasoning. When I was eight, we went to my uncle’s house to watch the WWF Royal Rumble. Just before the end of the match, Sid Vicious eliminates Hulk Hogan, and the crowd kind of cheered. I was eight and even I was kind of sick of Hogan’s shtick by then, too, and I may have cheered along as bad guy Ric Flair won the match. The next week on TV, they’d dubbed the crowd booing, and had the announcers re-record their commentary to make it sufficiently pro-Hogan. I’d turn nine the next day, and I think that was the day I began caring about saving media so the past can’t be altered, even if it’s something as stupid as the end of the 1992 Royal Rumble. I mean, to be fair, that is possibly the greatest wrestling match of all time.</p><p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;It’s all scripted, you know.</p><p><strong>Dan:&nbsp;</strong>Fortunately for me, wrestling fans did not mind its scripted nature. Also, they were and are obsessive. They recorded shows, they traded tapes, and nowadays there are incredible databases of things that WWF would really like you to have forgotten. There are episodes of ECW with the original music, back before anyone seemed to care about getting the rights to anything. There are recorded segments from Backstage Blast, a disaster of a segment during&nbsp;<em>WCW Nitro&nbsp;</em>commercial breaks. When the WWE Network came out, suddenly there were pristine copies of tons of shows. But not all of them were what really aired. The interview where Gabriel Byrne cuts a promo in character as Satan from&nbsp;<em>End of Days</em>&nbsp;is missing, for one thing. These kinds of clips—the weird, the offensive, the actually edgy—have been saved for all time by fans. This is true for sports, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Much of my library of Philadelphia sports games has simply come from YouTube downloads over the years. And now I am at the point where I have so much, I simply need higher-quality versions of old stuff. I&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;Super Bowl 52 in basically every format imaginable. I now&nbsp;<em>need</em>&nbsp;a high-quality version of the Fog Bowl so I can see how it really was.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Probably the only real journalistic achievement of my career came back when I was freelancing for&nbsp;<em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, and a guy emailed me to tell me that his father had a recording of Super Bowl I, which was for many years thought to be lost—not just because no one was sure anyone actually cared about the NFL back then, but because networks would just tape over stuff as a matter of course. This guy’s dad worked at a TV station and recorded it manually on a reel-to-reel, first with the commercials included and then as the game went on by pausing before the breaks and unpausing after—I have to assume he was the first person ever to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>That recording is at the Paley Museum of TV in Manhattan, and I watched it and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704709304576124373773290508" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">wrote about it for the paper</a>; I split the byline with a staffer because my editor at the time, who was “familiar with my shit,” wasn’t sure I could land it on my own, which at the time was probably correct. This was in 2011, so long enough ago that there was still this sense that the internet&nbsp;<a href="https://flaminghydra.com/the-big-internet/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">might someday contain everything that had ever existed</a>—maybe with ads making it viable, maybe just through The Magic Of Free Speech or whatever. Obviously the internet has shrunk a great deal since then, and feels like it’s shrinking more by the day. This makes me more curious about the community of people doing this archiving. Who are these people? And Chris, I know you’re a movie head from when we used to talk about stuff back in our coworker days, but what is it that made you want to start doing this?</p><p><strong>Chris:&nbsp;</strong>Aside from the aforementioned love of Chris Elliott specials, it’s a combination of my background as a video editor (I have had to deal with a lot of very badly handled footage in my life) and the sheer joy I feel every time I see that someone has uploaded an entire home recorded tape from 1986 with all the commercials. When I grew up, I experienced a lot of anime through fansubbed tapes and so I have a real love of those communities, because it’s overwhelmingly just volunteers. The motto “Keep Circulating the Tapes” that appears at the end of early episodes of MST3K was burned into me forever, and I think it’s something that needs to be taught to every subsequent generation.&nbsp;</p><p>Once people know you have a setup for this stuff, the tapes tend to find you. That’s how the Ricky Jay tape came to me, how someone spotted a rare tape from Yukio Ninagawa's&nbsp;<em>Medea</em>, how someone sent me a laserdisc of the Daicon IV intro. It’s something I can do in my spare time while I work. A24 sent me David Byrne’s copy of&nbsp;<em>Stop Making Sense&nbsp;</em>to capture, and that appears in the&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.a24films.com/products/stop-making-sense-collectors-edition" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">collector’s edition</a>. I have an analog capture station on my desk and my laptop hums along doing the encoding in the background. It’s soothing.&nbsp;</p><p>You’d also be surprised how low the monetary barrier is to saving something sometimes. It requires skill to do it, but there are some tapes you’d assume were totally lost, and when you look them up they cost $30 to $100. It takes a while to learn how to encode and capture things properly, but once you do it’s not that difficult.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, after seeing your work on Ricky Jay, I now have about 20 VHS tapes I want to acquire and digitize in high quality. I even sent you a VHS copy of the Philadelphia Eagles rap “Buddy’s Watchin’ You”&nbsp;<a href="https://defector.com/in-1988-buddy-ryan-was-watchin-the-eagles-rap" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">for my story</a>, and now a perfect copy of it&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/buddys.-watchin.-you.-1988.480p.-vhsrip.-flac.-2.0.x-264-boys-rback-in-town" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">exists online</a>. I am at a point where I am going to have to&nbsp;<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-person-saving-the-media-you-love-is-you-vhs-decode-domesday-duplicator-ld-decode-laserdiscvhs" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">follow along with the things you’ve written about it</a>&nbsp;and make a little setup myself. I have recorded media from my cable setup! I have even previously used the program you use, VHS Decode! I can do this! My brain, not to mention my wife, will surely be happy that I am thinking about a new project when several others are not finished! The basement can wait, I swear! Maybe I can put the whole setup down there!</p><p>More seriously and less exclamation-pointy, there’s something here that really seems important in the age of projects simply being shelved and thrown into a vault. It’s not that I needed to see&nbsp;<a href="https://screenrant.com/coyote-vs-acme-release-status-funeral-screening-lana-condor-response/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>Coyote vs. Acme</em></a>, but the idea that a project might never see the light of day for financial reasons just makes me want to have amateurs digitize&nbsp;<em>everything</em>. Obviously that movie was never out there, but there’s a huge amount of media that is—and, due to various real or fake reasons, is never going to get a proper release. Is it important that there are&nbsp;<em>Muppet Babies</em>&nbsp;episodes online that have the original movie parodies and footage? It’s not the&nbsp;<em>most</em>&nbsp;important thing, but it’s good people can see how things originally aired.</p><p><strong>David:&nbsp;</strong>I am broadly in favor of Saving Everything, with commercials if possible, partially on the principle that people put some portion of their lives into making all this stuff and it seems rude and reckless to just leave it on the curb, but also because I feel like there’s a lot about the texture and tone of a moment that can be read from even your bummier and more boring cultural products, or just from the jarringly horny ads for Big Red gum that aired during them. But that’s not quite what we’re talking about here.</p><p>I guess, looking back at it, that&nbsp;<em>Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants</em>&nbsp;is a very ’90s cultural product. Jay looked the same pretty much for the entire time he was famous—the lapels widened and shrunk, but he was mostly this bearish, masterful, patter-intensive presence even during his late-night appearances&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKuHiY397U&amp;list=PLmWRe-kU82UMsmA9V6BTGfwVvT5VlJElV" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">in the ‘80s</a>, and in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0419633/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">every movie he was in</a>, and presumably in the time he spent in the actual gambler/hustler demimonde&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/04/05/ricky-jay-magician-secrets-profile" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">that he apparently inhabited</a>&nbsp;even as he became of America’s better-known doers of magic. But for all the ways the aesthetics of the audience and the staging mark the special as all that, it is also, to me, totally delightful and amazing. I have watched the deep-fried versions of this on YouTube as a stoned wind-down or just for pleasure for many years now. It was cool to see it looking crisp and contiguous and possibly even better than it did when it aired nearly 30 years ago. Chris, what led you to take this particular one on? Are you a member of the Ricky Jay Brotherhood as well?</p><figure><figcaption>HBO</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris:&nbsp;</strong>I knew Ricky Jay, but I actually came to him fairly late. As with most of these things, you would be surprised how often to posting “<a href="https://x.com/Papapishu/status/1762723420213543259" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Man, I sure would love to see a nice rip of this</a>” which frequently bears fruit. Someone just sent me a LaserDisc I was looking for because I posted about it! I try to make a mental note of which things have decent transfers and which don’t, and this is one of them. Like, for example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdYto9Ehrj0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>Learned Pigs and Fireproof Women</em></a>, an earlier TV special he did based on his book of the same name; it was directed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0512327" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Michael Lindsay-Hogg</a>, who you may know if you’re a huge Beatles fan. I also really enjoy the documentary about him,&nbsp;<em>Deceptive Practice: The Mysteries and Mentors of Ricky Jay.&nbsp;</em>It has very high-quality clips from&nbsp;<em>52 Assistants&nbsp;</em>in there and clips that don’t appear on TV (I believe those are shot on film), but it also gives you stunning insight into his upbringing and his tough relationship with his family. He knew magic guys since he was a child, it’s in his blood.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>David:&nbsp;</strong>Watching videos of Jay and sometimes my late namesake, the startlingly elfin&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxd7U7KkPXs" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">coin magic legend David Roth</a>, has long been a don’t-want-to-go-to-bed-yet pastime of mine. I’m not sure I can explain it, and given the radical honesty about nerdwad pursuits in here already I don’t imagine I have to, but part of the appeal for me is the sense that these are people with a craft, doing a thing they’ve done so many times that it looks and feels and sounds perfect. Obviously it’s fun to be tricked and wowed and all that, but I like that you can see all that work; part of the fun for me, where Jay is concerned, is in him kind of happily running up the score on the audience because he knows so much and can do so much that he can afford to have fun with it and mess with everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>But obviously that performance comes from someplace beyond repetition, that sort of weird milieu and Magic Guys and all that. The idea that it’s going to be on the people who care about this stuff to preserve it—to learn how to do that as you have, and to put each other onto stuff, and then to put it where people can enjoy it—really resonates with me right now. Obviously the interests that produced all this stuff are fine letting a lot of it die once it stops making them money. It seems important that they not get the last word on that.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong>&nbsp;Preservation is an act of collective willpower and effort. It cannot just be one person. I don’t want to live in a world where the things I love&nbsp;<em>actually</em>&nbsp;disappear.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong>&nbsp;Even things I hate… sometimes I’ll save ’em too. I do have all of the Eagles’ Super Bowl losses.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/viktor-antonov-art-director-rip"><h3>RIP Viktor Antonov</h3></a><p>Antonov was one of the driving forces behind the art style of Half-Life 2 and Dishonored</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/614336/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-update-patches<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl </em>was released in November<em>, </em>it was clearly not yet the game its developers, GSC Game World, wanted it to be. Sure, this imagining of the Zone was fabulously moody, a desolate and bleak expanse of bog, scrubland, abandoned warehouses, and pallid vistas. For all the ways it was transportive and evocative, it did not yet feel truly alive. The Zone was, dare I say, a little too quiet, lacking the kind of brilliant emergent moments (like three-way skirmishes between stalkers, more stalkers, and roving packs of mutant dogs) that have previously defined the franchise. I ended my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300652/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">review</a> wondering whether the game would, and indeed could, become the very best “shining” version of itself. </p><p>Three months on, with two major and five smaller patches under its belt, I’m thrilled to report that the game is close to becoming exactly that. To cut a long story short, the enemy AI in combat situations is vastly improved, A-Life 2.0 (the more expansive AI system that gives the game its thrillingly unpredictable sense of life) is practically purring, and I’m now encountering far fewer of the immersion-breaking bugs (like floating and disembodied heads)<em>. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em> was admittedly no <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> disaster at launch. That said, the work done by its Kyiv and Prague-based developers, who have labored throughout the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/arts/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-ukraine-war.html">Russia-Ukraine war</a>, is nothing short of remarkable.</p><p>Last night, while traipsing through the overgrowth to complete a mission in the Malachite region, I was spotted by stalkers from a rival faction. I retreated back into the vehicle station that I’d just passed through, taking cover behind a steel gate. I poked my rifle around the metal panel, leaning to my left as bullets whizzed past my head, catching a glimpse of the masked stalkers attempting to flank me. They threw grenades, pinning me back. I downed one of them, and the other went to heal him. As he crouched down to administer a med kit, I headshotted him, a fearsome crack whipping through the air. Of course, I unceremoniously looted both bodies moments later.</p><p>Improved enemy AI clearly has a massive impact on gameplay. It also changes how the Zone feels. Where, previously, the architecture felt ghostly — blown-out, post-Soviet wreckage that was slowly being reclaimed by nature — now, it is the perfect site for cat-and-mouse shootouts. Fear not, the Zone is still haunting, but the adrenaline-pumping, hardcore firefights that were such a standout feature of <a href="https://youtu.be/0ZqMt74hO6U">prerelease trailers</a> are now very much a reality in the game. It adds up to a 64-kilometer-squared open-world playspace that feels even more dangerous; you’re locked into a battle with the landscape itself and the much smarter humans that stalk it. </p><p>In the latest patch released last Thursday, there are a whopping <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1643320%2Fview%2F579378232238800945" rel="sponsored">1,700 improvements</a>, ranging from small balancing tweaks like radiation levels to what seem like pretty substantial changes, including “level design, and terrain improvements for multiple locations and regions.” Your flashlight now casts shadows on objects, and stealth has been improved (although, truth be told, it’s still pretty wonky). Maybe my favorite detail is that NPCs don’t just heal their fallen allies; they now loot the corpses of downed enemies. Turns out, these NPCs have just as little shame as me. Another small detail that subtly enhances the game’s already wonderful atmosphere: thanks, I think, to the improved A-Life 2.0, NPC stalkers now more regularly gather at campfires, even those in the wilderness outside of major hub areas. </p><p>I don’t want to tacitly endorse developers releasing games in borderline unfinished states. The examples, unfortunately, have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-2042s-disastrous-launch-what-next-for-battlefield">piling</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/26/23738863/gollum-developers-apology-negative-reviews-lotr">up</a> in recent years. But you can’t deny the achievements of GSC Game World. In early December, creative director Mariia Grygorovych reflected on the game’s rocky launch. “It’s not perfect, we need to fix everything,” she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development">said</a>. “But it’s a game! It’s a game with soul, with feelings there, with love there!”</p><p>Grygorovych is right, and now it’s easier than ever to appreciate all that love and soul. For sure, it’s an odd and uncompromising love, the kind that’s content to let the player cower in a shed while a blood-red radiation storm whirs above them; the kind that also takes pride in first-person animations of protagonist Skif wolfing down delicious cured sausage. These types of moments feed into a wider tapestry of action that does not go easy on the player — indeed, it goes out of its way to make life miserable for them. </p><p>This type of friction has always been the major selling point of the <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> franchise. It’s what makes the series appeal to such a specific type of video game fetishist. Now, that friction manifests in many more of the ways the developers intended. <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2.</em> is no tribute act to past glories: three months on from launch, it finally feels as if it was worth the wait. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But that hasn’t stopped Nike from creating a new pair of sneakers that seem to be directly inspired by Donkey Kong and his popular platformers.</p><p>On February 17, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sneakernews.com/2025/02/15/nike-air-max-1-low-poly-donkey-kong-hv5776-200/?amp&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sneakernews.com/2025/02/15/nike-air-max-1-low-poly-donkey-kong-hv5776-200/?amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sneaker News reported on recently released promotional photos</a></span> that reveal a new version of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://footwearnews.com/shoes/sneaker-news/nike-air-max-1-dotswoosh-donkey-kong-hv5776-200-1234769846/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://footwearnews.com/shoes/sneaker-news/nike-air-max-1-dotswoosh-donkey-kong-hv5776-200-1234769846/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nike Air Max 1 Low Poly that is seemingly a reference to Donkey Kong</a></span>. The images show a brown, white, red, and yellow sneaker. These are the colors of Donkey Kong. Further cementing the connection is the fact that the brown parts of the shoe are furry and similar in hue to what you might find on an ape or monkey. </p><p>However, the big giveaway that these shoes are connected to Donkey Kong and his games can be found on the inside. The insoles of the new sneakers feature pixelated mud and dirt, DK-styled gold coins, and even a smooshed low-res banana. Oh, and a big gold coin can be spotted on the back of the shoes, too. Yeah, these are Donkey Kong-themed shoes all right! And they look pretty snazzy to me, but I’m not a sneaker expert. </p><p>It makes sense that Nike’s latest Air Max 1 Low Poly would be inspired by a retro video game character as the shoe was revealed with the help of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sneakernews.com/2024/09/26/kai-cenat-nike-air-max-1-low-poly-dotswoosh/?amp&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sneakernews.com/2024/09/26/kai-cenat-nike-air-max-1-low-poly-dotswoosh/?amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Twitch streamer</a></span> and features a low-res version of the Nike swoosh logo.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fellowship-takes-the-mm-out-of-mmorpg-in-a-super-fun-way<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's always cool when a game designer takes one neat thing out of a complex genre and turns it into an entire game. That's how we got the MOBA, after all — breaking just the heroes out of an RTS. Enter Fellowship, a so-called Multiplayer Online Dungeon Adventure that's going to pluck out team-based dungeon raids that are the beating heart of modern MMOs and turn them into a streamlined game – without the hundred hours of leveling up before you get to the best stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After some time with a development version of Fellowship I have to say that the concept turned out just as cool as it sounds: It's no-nonsense, endlessly scaling dungeon runs in a four player team of a tank, a healer, and two damage heroes from among a selection of unique classes. In a group you make yourself, or with a team from a handy group finder, you jump in with your chosen role in either short-and-sweet one boss Adventures or longer multi-boss dungeons—letting you tune your gameplay time depending on whether you've got ten minutes or an hour to kill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end you pick up your loot, tweak your talents, kick up the difficulty, and go again.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I was a bit skeptical that you can have a real authentic, MMO-style dungeon experience without, you know, the MMO, but Fellowship really effectively delivered. You move through the environment clearing out packs of enemy minions in order to get at the bosses, and all the classic stuff you'd expect is there: You've got to watch your tank's threat and manage aggro, try to make life easy for the healer, keep track of enemy abilities to interrupt the nasty ones, and know how to best use your class' attacks in a good rotation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Behind the wheel of an elemental mage-type character, I had plenty of abilities to manage even at the starting level. My character built up charges that could be used to call down big freezing meteors or channel icy blasts. Our healer, meanwhile, could summon plants that either damaged or healed. It was clear in my short time that each class has a nice, clear vision for what it can and can't do. The thing my squishy mage couldn't do, by the way, was survive if I took boss aggro. Sorry, tank.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was a bit skeptical that you can have a real authentic, MMO-style dungeon experience without, you know, the MMO, but Fellowship really effectively delivered. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of bosses, I saw four interesting setpiece fights that ran the gamut of stuff I expect from modern dungeon runs. In a ghost pirate dungeon we battled a skeletal shipmaster that required quick reflexes as it tossed our ghosts in and out of our bodies. There was a giant treasure construct that couldn't be tanked—instead, our tank had to roll around a ball to collect the bits of treasure we were knocking off of it. There was also a giant zombie that summoned the tides, requiring us to shackle ourselves to an anchor and dodge sharks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn't all gimmicks, though, and the developers were clear they wanted to strike a balance between fights that require reflexes and understanding clever mechanics with those that really push your ability to play your class' skills to the limit. They gave me a good example of the second with a nasty warlock boss, whose up-tempo barrage of skills and summons needed constant interruption even as he created zones that either forced us to group up… or to run away at top speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What I especially liked is how Fellowship will be structured. Dungeon difficulty scales from one up to six levels, gradually adding new enemy abilities to learn, mechanics to understand, and taking off the training wheels one by one until you hit the intended difficulty. From there, though, it ramps up for dozens of levels, each with their own unique combination of two or more curses that have their own downsides and upsides. One of those, for example, could sprinkle nasty Empowered minions among the normal enemy packs—but when you beat them you'd get a short-time buff that let you clear trash even faster or take a handy boost into a boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The concept of a game focusing on infinitely scaling dungeons, familiar yet dangerous in new ways, is a really cool one. Combine that with the developers' big plans for competitive seasons, where players can start fresh to race up the leaderboards for world first kills on each boss, and I think I'm pretty excited to gear up, spec out, and take on the challenges in Fellowship when it launches this year.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Marvel Rivals has been a big success on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, but the game hasn't come to Nintendo Switch. With the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on the horizon for 2025, some are wondering if the superhero shooter could come to the new Nintendo system, and it doesn't sound too far fetched.</p><p>Producer Weicong Wu told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-developer-is-open-to-potential-future-release-on-nintendo-switch-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that NetEase is already speaking with Nintendo and "working on some development kits" for the Switch 2.</p><p>"Whenever we find that we could provide great performance for our game on Switch 2, we're open to that," Wu said. "The reason why we didn't launch it onto the Switch, it was the first generation of that device they cannot provide a great experience for our gameplay. So if it could achieve that goal, we're open to that."</p><p>It's quite surprising to hear a developer from such a big company working on a major title like Marvel Rivals speak so openly about the Switch 2. Companies are better known to be much more guarded with information about Nintendo's next console.</p><p>The Switch 2 is coming out this year, with Nintendo expected to share lots more information about the console in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">April during a special Nintendo Direct event.</a> The system, along with the launch of GTA 6, is expected to have an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-ref-id="1100-6526016">outsized impact on the overall video game industry in 2025.</a> The Switch 2 was formally confirmed in January 2025, but many remarked that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-was-surprising-due-to-lack-of-surprises-says-former-playstation-boss/1100-6529203/" data-ref-id="1100-6529203">the reveal didn't pack a punch. </a></p><p>As for Marvel Rivals, the game's developers recently announced it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-adding-human-torch-and-the-thing-very-soon-alongside-a-rank-reset/1100-6529366/" data-ref-id="1100-6529366">restructure its season rankings</a>, but then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-reworks-its-ranking-system-again-due-to-fan-complaints/1100-6529388/" data-ref-id="1100-6529388">quickly reversed that decision</a>. Players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1imd0h8/marvel_rivals_dev_talk_vol10_seasonal_rank/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">immediately responded</a> with how much they hated it, causing NetEase to backpedal within hours.</p>

The Human Torch will be added as part of the Season 1 mid-season update on February 21, alongside The Thing.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ORBFXYlQ3U">new trailer</a> shows that Johnny Storm will be primarily a flying character, similar to Iron Man or Storm. His primary fire is a fireball he throws that leaves a small burning area on the ground where it hits. He has six charges, which appear to recharge over time instead of being reloaded. Human Torch can also use a dive attack, which propels him into the ground, dealing damage and knocking enemies back.</p>
