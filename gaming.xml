<p>Following the release of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Maiden of Black Water</em> in 2015, the<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame</em> series returned in 2021 with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/project-zero-maiden-of-black-water-2021-review/">a remake of the Wii U exclusive</a></strong> followed by a remake of <strong><em>Mask of the Lunar Eclipse</em> in 2023</strong>, which made it possible for many to get acquainted with this unique survival-horror series for the first time. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">With no new entry in the series on the horizon</strong>, it will be up to another <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remake</strong>,<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em>, to bring the series again to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">modern hardware </strong>this March.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Fatal-Frame-2-Crimson-Buttefly-Remake-story-screenshot-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>With a great horror story, Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake remains a very engaging experience</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For those not in the know, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em> is<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> not the first remake of the second entry in the series</strong>, which originally launched on PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2003/2004. In 2012, the game made the jump to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo Wii</strong>, blossoming from its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">fixed-camera</strong> state reminiscent of the first few Resident Evil and Silent Hill games into an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">over-the-shoulder third-person</strong> game blended with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">motion controls</strong> via the Wii Remote that suited the Camera Obscura mechanics well. The<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"> enhanced visuals</strong> also served the experience quite well, making it way more eerie and immersive.</p>



<p><em>Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em> is another enhancement of the experience, with <strong>modern visuals</strong> powered by the Katana engine for an even more immersive experience, and <strong>plenty of quality-of-life improvements</strong> to enhance gameplay to the highest possible degree. <strong>Having only played the original PlayStation 2 release</strong> once back in the day, it is impossible for me to judge <strong>how an early build of the remake I had the chance to try compares to the Wii Edition</strong>. <span>What I can say, however, </span>is that this remake, which sits between innovation and tradition, is set to deliver&nbsp;a <strong>very engaging experience</strong>, if one can look past a combat system that does feel more frustrating than fun, at least in the beginning of the game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Fatal-Frame-2-Crimson-Butterfly-Remake-gameplay-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Fatal Frame 2 Crimson Buttefly Remake features some very traditional survival-horror gameplay mechanics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Much like the original</strong>,&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em>&nbsp;stars the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">twin sisters Mio and Mayu Amakura</strong>, whose relationship has been <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">strained</strong> by a childhood accident, as they are led to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Minakami Village</strong>, a mysterious place where people are said to</span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> disappear without a trac</span>e</strong>, by a crimson butterfly. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">As they explore the village, the two siblings will discover the mysterious<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;Camera Obscu</strong>ra, which lets them see and fight ghosts, and learn the truth behind the disappearances, which seem&nbsp;</span>tied to an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ancient and dark ritual</strong>. Like in the original, the player's choices will shape the siblings' destiny among different possibilities, offering <strong>great replayability</strong></p>



<p>While I only <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">experienced the recreation of the first four chapters in the game</strong>, I couldn't help but remember how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">gripping</strong> Fatal Frame 2 can be from the start. The combination of<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> cutscenes and environmental storytelling</strong>, which relies heavily on finding documents scattered throughout the village, has only become more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">powerfu</strong>l in the remake thanks to enhanced visuals that bring Minakami Village to life like never before. Some of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">pre-rendered cutscenes</strong> focusing on past events do seem to be a simple upscale of those of the Wii Edition cutscenes as they feature some rather simple character models that starkly contrast with the high-quality new models, but they do not detract much from immersion, being often very filtered.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260203180008_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The visual improvements of Fatal Frame 2 Crimson Buttefly Remake over the previous versions of the game are considerable</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Focused on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">offering players a chance to experience <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly</em> for the first time</strong>, it's not surprising to see how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">traditional gameplay feels</strong>. Besides featuring the aforementioned <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">documents and journals</strong> scattered around providing additional details on the world and lore, the remake of the second entry in the series features <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">every staple of the survival horror genre</strong> since its establishment: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">moderately intricate level design</strong> with multiple paths, locked doors requiring keys, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">limited resources</strong> upon which the survival aspect is based, and <strong>a stalker enemy</strong> that cannot be defeated. The first few chapters of the game are not <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">very challenging</strong> at Normal difficulty, so those who have never played an entry in the series before will have <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">enough time</strong> to adjust to some of the quirks of the experience</p>



<p>The one element that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">distinguishes</strong> the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame</em> series from every other survival-horror series is the aforementioned <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Camera Obscura</strong> camera, which remains a core element in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em>. With this mysterious camera, Mio can fight hostile ghosts and be guided to the next story objective by more friendly ones.</p>



<p>The game's entire <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">combat system</strong> is centered on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Camera Obscura</strong>, requiring players to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">take the best pictures of ghosts</strong> to defeat them. <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">With&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">different film types</strong>&nbsp;coming with different attack power and reload speed,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">special shots</strong>&nbsp;are possible with any of the four available filters (which must often be used to progress in the story as well) that can blind or slow ghosts, and mechanics that the game's combat system can get rather&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">tactical</strong>.</span> However, t<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">he in-game tutorials don't offer anything beyond a rough explanation of the combat mechanics</strong>, which can lead to frustration. </p>



<p>Thankfully, the remake features a proper <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">dodge maneuver</strong> whose addition is quite welcome, as the game wants the player to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">take pictures of ghosts as they are about to attack</strong> for maximum efficacy, thus alleviating some of the combat frustrations. An <strong>upgrade system</strong> for the Camera Obscura and its filters can also make a huge difference, so, at the very least,<strong> the remake offers tools</strong> to make combat slightly faster and less frustrating. Those looking to enjoy the game's story with minimal challenge can play it on<strong> Easy mode</strong>, which I expect will be popular among newcomers to the series.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260203183318_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Camera Obscura is a core element of the experience, and is used for both combat and story progression</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although I am not too fond of the game's combat, <em>Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em> delivers an <strong>immediately engaging survival-horror experience</strong>. As such, I am really looking forward to continuing the game and <strong>deciding the fate of Mio and Mayu</strong> when the game launches on <strong>March 12</strong> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

That means you’re paying $6.11 per pack for the 9 Play Boosters inside, but that doesn’t take into account the promo card inside and 30 Lands you can use to build a deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those lands are split between standard, full-art, and foil ones, and you get a spindown life counter, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, splitting it between 9 packs without the discount means you’re paying $7.77. The math doesn’t quite match up exactly because of those additive pieces, like a storage box and promo cord, but it’s something to consider if you wanted a series of packs without wanting to splash out on a box of 30 of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Do the preorder discounts suggest we should be worried about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set? We’re not so sure yet (we are awaiting card previews at the time of writing), but we’re pleased to see discounts across multiple 2026 sets already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more deals on Magic’s TMNT set, be sure to check out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-next-precon-deck-is-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-themed-and-its-already-discounted-just-a-few-weeks-from-launch"><u>Turtle Power Commander Deck, also discounted at Amazon</u></a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-marvel-set-doesnt-launch-until-june-but-its-discounted-already"><u>June’s Marvel Super Heroes set</u></a> is also seeing discounts nice and early.

What a terrible day to be a God of War-like! You put on your fanciest bird suit for your big reveal, then a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">whole bunch of actual God of Wars come along</a> and steal your thunder. But that's not to say Krafton's new open-world PlayStation 5 game Project Windless isn't intriguing.
</p>
<p>
Project Windless is, for starters, based on an acclaimed series of South Korean high fantasy novels known as Bird That Drinks Tears. Four books have been released so far, all set in a world inhabited by four main races: the boring old humans, the reptilian Nhaga, the Tokkebi, and the bird-like Rekon. That's how we get Project Windless' perhaps somewhat unlikely looking protagonist.

<p>
As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/announcing-open-world-action-rpg-project-windless-for-ps5/">per the PlayStation Blog</a>, Project Windless (which is being led by Patrik Méthé, veteran director on Ubisoft's Far Cry series) takes place over a thousand years before the events of the books, and focuses its attention on the Rekon. We haven't been given the name of its musclebound bird protagonist yet, but Krafton says the Rekon's "speed, reach, and physical presence" were the perfect fit for the "one-versus-many combat fantasy" at the Windless' core.
</p><p>
Elsewhere, its open world is designed with "as little hand-holding as possible" in order to stoke curiosity, and to encourage players "to take risks, to forge alliances, to wage war, and ultimately to decide what kind of legend [they] want to become." As for combat, there are echoes of Dynasty Warriors, as players are battle "dozens (sometimes hundreds) of enemies at once."
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much all we know so far. Project Windless is currently in development for PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> (no other platforms are confirmed) and doesn't have even a whiff of a release date.

            <guid>1434763</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I saw one of the wildest things I've ever seen on Linkedin earlier today--and that's saying something--when I saw people posting in earnest about a story called "<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/jynxzi-slams-supercell-after-clash-royale-historic-year-recap-omits-his-impact-3317074/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jynxzi slams Supercell over 'spit in the face' Clash Royale statement</u></a>".</p><p>"This can't be a real news item", I thought, before checking all those words were actually in order and meant something. But hey, it turns out this was definitely a thing, and it was a thing so degrading to the medium of video games and the people who cover it that it caused me spiritual damage, to the extent that if I had to see it, now you <em>all </em>have to see it.</p><p>The basic summary of events is: Supercell, the developers of mobile juggernaut <em>Clash Royale</em>,<a href="https://supercell.com/en/news/the-best-games-havent-been-made-yet/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>released their annual roundup of how the game's been going the other day</u></a>, and in doing so thanked, you know, the people who made and are working on the game.</p><p>This led to<a href="https://x.com/jynxzi/status/2021283304649970153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2021283304649970153%7Ctwgr%5E5a9dca7924b2f83ec5e4ad756131d4465ab082f6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fgaming%2Fjynxzi-slams-supercell-after-clash-royale-historic-year-recap-omits-his-impact-3317074%2F&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>a tweet by streamer and YouTuber Jynxi</u></a>, in which he quoted a section of the roundup with the words "Probably the biggest spit in the face i've ever seen", suggesting that he, a content creator streaming video games for money, should have also been thanked by Supercell for contributing to that success, because by streaming the game he had led to an increase in the playerbase.</p><p>He later went on Twitch and said “Don’t you dare take credit for 2025 being the best year that that game’s had since 2016, let’s not do that, because now you’re fucking rage-baiting.”</p><p>As <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/jynxzi-slams-supercell-after-clash-royale-historic-year-recap-omits-his-impact-3317074/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Dexerto</u></a> report, this was not an isolated sentiment! Mr. Beast himself replied to Jynxi’s tweet, saying many people had "only started playing again because of you",<a href="https://x.com/thesketchreal/status/2021304917747470678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2021304917747470678%7Ctwgr%5E5a9dca7924b2f83ec5e4ad756131d4465ab082f6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fgaming%2Fjynxzi-slams-supercell-after-clash-royale-historic-year-recap-omits-his-impact-3317074%2F&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>while other big streamers and content creators agreed</u></a>.</p><p>The fact these creators, who exist in an economy of their own, where they're paid via ads and deals and subs in their own space, feel so entitled to official thanks from the makers of the actual video games they're playing seemed absolutely absurd to me, a strain of entitlement so virulent it crosses over into delusion. Like yeah, content creators can affect sales, we’ve known that since the dawn of streaming, but streamers have their own rewards and spaces for achievement, just like we do as media. Your audience is your business; nobody should be expecting pats on the head from developers just because you happened to play their game and not someone else’s.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine my horror, then, when not long after reading that news I saw the headline "<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/supercell-ceo-sorry-for-failure-to-acknowledge-role-of-content-creators-in-clash-royales-success/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Supercell CEO sorry for failure to acknowledge role of content creators in Clash Royale's success</u></a>", in which <em>the CEO of Supercell </em>Ilkka Paananen<em> </em>says:</p><blockquote>I failed to acknowledge the role that creators, pro players, and the broader community played in Clash Royale's resurgence. That was my mistake — no one else's — and it runs counter to everything I believe about the impact creators have on our games and our business. I am sorry.</blockquote><blockquote>The intent was never to diminish anyone's contribution, but intent doesn't matter when the impact is real. I understand why it hurts, and that's on me.</blockquote><p>I don't know Paananen, but man, if I had woken up one day and felt compelled to write a grovelling apology to a streamer because I didn't show them enough deference in my company's reports to thank them for helping boost income from my cash-grab mobile game that's<a href="https://www.gameswirtschaft.de/politik/verbraucherzentrale-klage-roblox-fortnite-060625/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>built on a succession of 'dark pattern' design elements</u></a>, I would maybe look in the mirror and wonder what it was, exactly, I was doing with my life.</p>

		<p>Housemarque’s bullet hell roguelite successor <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saros">Saros</a> is set to launch on 30th April, and with such little time before release, they’ve shared a look at the overarching progression and structure of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Saros - Gameplay Overview Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OcLGdMG0L8Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The core of the game will be familiar to anyone that played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/returnal">Returnal</a>, and there’s common ground to a lot of other roguelites in structure. You’ll play, you’ll die, you’ll upgrade and you’ll try again.</p>
<p>Between runs, Arjun Devraj (Rahul Kohli) is returned to the Passage, a Carcosan temple that is a hub to the game. Here you can talk to other crewmembers of the ship, as well as make use of the upgrade portal. Here you can increase armour, generate a material more quickly, upgrade power capacity for the shield and even the Second Chance system.</p>
<p>There’s also the Carcosan Modifiers, letting you tweak parts of the games difficulty, but for every boon, you’ll have to forego something in return to keep th world in balance. Protection Modifiers can make weapon reloads faster, boost the shield and more, but they’re balanced out by Trial Modifiers making enemies more aggressive, adding weapon power degradation and more. You choose the balance.</p>

<p>A great feature for day one is the inclusion of fast travel, so that you can immediately start a run at the last biome you reached. On death your main and power weapon are kept, so you can return right to the fight and try again, effectively. It’s great to see this will be there on day one, and not arrive in a patch months later.</p>
<p>Finally there’ the eclipse. You can trigger this by reaching a gnarly hand thing, causing the sun to be blocked out, but this sets the world ablaze, introducing corrupted enemies, changing the environments and more. The sound of the world is also twisted, with Sam Slater’s soundtrack gaining more distortion and layering.</p>

		<p>The platforming icon Rayman is marking his thirtieth birthday (last year) with Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition, launching… well, today, at the time of writing. 13th February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition – Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6si6GIKIg24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Developed by Digital Eclipse, this is a love letter to the arm-less helicoptering wonder and his debut game. There’s actually five versions of this game included in the bundle – PlayStation, Atari Jaguar, MS-DOS, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance – &nbsp;all of which have been reformatted for modern consoles and screens. There’s also 120 additional levels from the Rayman’s New Levels pack, Rayman 60 Levels and Rayman by His Fans, and you can step back even further with early prototypes of the game that have been spruced up to be playable.</p>
<p>Throughout, the originals have been enhanced in the way many remakes and remasters are with a reimagined soundtrack by composer&nbsp;Christophe Héral alongside optional gameplay features, like a 60 second rewind, instant level unlocks and infinite lives.</p>
<p>And then there’s the documentary features that include 50 minutes of interviews with the original Ubisoft Montpellier team, concept art, sketches, design documents and more.</p>

<p>Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition is out 13th February digitally, across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, NIntendo Switch and PC, with a physical edition coming to certain regions in June.</p>

In addition to dogpiling on the trailer, I personally came under fire due to my naïveté on Twitter, which almost all of my now-former coworkers had learned to avoid during their previous game launches. After setting my Twitter account to private to protect my sanity, many content creators made videos and posts about me and my cowardice, amassing millions of views and inadvertently sending hundreds of angry gamers into my replies. They laughed at me for being proud of the game, told me to get out the McDonald’s applications, and mocked me for listing having autism in my bio, which they seemed to think was evidence the game would be ‘woke trash.’ All of this was very emotionally taxing.”</span></p> <p data-offset-key="ehlt0-0-0">Sobel admits that there is plenty of “constructive criticism” about how the game was marketed, but said he didn’t feel like it was his place to comment on that and stated that there is no way to know if the launch would have been better or worse without the Game Awards reveal. Regardless, after the trailer landed, Sobel says the game “turned into a joke from minute one” and blames “false assumptions” about how much the trailer’s spot cost the studio. It was later revealed that Wildlight didn’t pay anything; Game Awards founder Geoff Keighley just liked the game enough to include it.</p> <p data-offset-key="ehlt0-0-0">“Within minutes, it was decided: this game was dead on arrival, and creators now had free ragebait content for a month. Every one of our videos on social media got downvoted to hell. Comments sections were flooded with copy/paste meme phrases such as ‘<a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">Concord 2</a>‘ and ‘Titanfall 3 died for this.’ At launch, we received over 14k review bombs from users with less than an hour of playtime. Many didn’t even finish the required tutorial.”</p> <p data-offset-key="ehlt0-0-0">The former <em>Highguard</em> dev didn’t entirely blame gamers for the shooter’s failure, but did suggest that <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">gamers have a “lot” of power over what games succeed and fail.</a></p> <p data-offset-key="ehlt0-0-0">“<span>I’m not saying our failure is purely the fault of gamer culture and that the game would have thrived without the negative discourse, but it absolutely played a role. All products are at the whims of the consumers, and the consumers put absurd amounts of effort into slandering <em>Highguard</em>. And it worked.” <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-studio-developer-layoffs-wildlight-entertainment-2000667841">Wildlight recently announced massive layoffs</a>.</span></p> </div> <p data-offset-key="8dhmm-0-0"><span data-offset-key="8dhmm-0-0">“Many of Wildlight’s former devs will now be forced to assimilate back into the actual corporate industry many gamers accused Wildlight of being a part of. Now, every time someone thinks about leaving the golden handcuffs behind in favor of making a new multiplayer game the indie way, they’ll say, ‘But remember how gamers didn’t even give Wildlight a chance.’ Soon, if this pattern continues, all that will be left are corporations, at least in the multiplayer space. Innovation is on life support.”</span></p> <p data-offset-key="8dhmm-0-0">Sobel wrapped up his post by wishing the remaining devs at the <span>studio</span> good luck on <em>Highguard</em>, and saying he believes it can still succeed. He also made it clear that he doesn’t believe the game deserved what it got.</p> <p data-offset-key="9e81n-0-0"><span data-offset-key="9e81n-0-0">“Even if <em>Highguard</em> had a rocky launch, our independent, self-published, dev-led studio full of passionate people just trying to make a fun game, with zero AI, and zero corporate oversight, deserved better than this,” said Sobel. “We deserved the bare minimum of not having our downfall be gleefully manifested.”</span></p>

              <p><em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>&nbsp;finally has a release date, two <em>uncanny</em> new characters, and so much more. Coming August 6th to PlayStation and PC, <em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> is the next Marvel fighting game in the grand tradition of the <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> series, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-vs-capcom-state-of-play-ps5-1851783734">just without the Capcom this time</a>. Developed by <em>Guilty Gear</em> studio Arc Systems Works, <em>Fighting Souls</em> is also the latest in a firehose of Marvel games that’s been spraying almost non-stop since Insomniac released its first <em>Spider-Man</em> game back in 2018.</p>  <p>During tonight’s big State of Play, we got a brief introduction to the game’s story and the new characters joining the roster. Joining Marvel’s usual fighting game suspects such as Spider-Man and Captain America are the “Unbreakable X-Men<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->a new team of X-Men that debuted in Marvel Comics last year. Led by Storm, the team features Storm’s fellow Marvel fighting game staple Wolverine, Magick the sword-wielding metal-head viking, and Danger, the physical manifestation of the program the X-Men use to run their deadly training facility. Comics are silly, y’all. In addition to these four new characters, <em>Fighting Souls</em> will feature a story mode that features motion comics that blend Japanese and American comic styles.</p>

 <p>Over the last decade, the House of Marvel has been on a tear with great games. There’s of course Insomniac’s<em> Spider-Man</em> series, the criminally underrated <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, the other criminally underrated Marvel game,<em> Midnight Suns</em>, and <em>Marvel Snap</em>. Lately the focus has been on multiplayer games and that, too, has gone well with the massive success of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.<em> Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> looks it’ll be another addition to this renaissance of Marvel-flavored video games when it launches August 6th.</p>

<p>Calling all PlayStation Spartans in training, there’s a hydra-sized God of War Sons of Sparta Trophy List for you to climb, making the arduous trek to Olympus seem like child’s play.</p>



<p>A Metroidvania <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war/" id="106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> title was a constant discussion in the rumor pipeline for a long time. The speculation suggested a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumoured God of War Metroidvania game would feature Kratos’ Brother</a>, and it does. </p>



<p>Now that Sons of Sparta is here, there’s no mystery left, other than its Trophy List. A mystery solved in this guide right now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>God of War Sons of Sparta takes fans back further than they’ve ever been in the franchise’s long history. A true origin story, Sons of Sparta is a unique adventure, so let’s check if it’s available on platforms not named PS5, such as Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>The ‘uncs’ of this generation might shudder to hear that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war/" id="106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> is over 20 years old now. There’s a lot of history, which means there’s plenty for the newer generation to revisit—hence the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Remake Trilogy</a> being a great learning lesson for many.</p>



<p>However, God of War Sons of Sparta is a new chapter telling the oldest tale.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-on-pc">Can You Play God of War Sons of Sparta on PC?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a time to be alive. Credit to Santa Monica Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Despite Sony’s good relationship with PC, God of War Sons of Sparta is not available to buy on any PC storefront.</strong></p>



<p>It seemed unthinkable that God of War could ever be playable anywhere other than on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation/" id="81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation </a>console. This changed when the 2018 reboot received a PC port. This was eventually followed up by Kratos and Atreus’s Ragnarok rumble slamming its way down on PC, too.</p>



<p>But for now, God of War Sons of Sparta remains on PC, with no PC port in sight. As history has taught us, never rule out the possibility of a Spartan journeying across foreign lands.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-on-xbox">Can You Play God of War Sons of Sparta on Xbox?</h2>



<p><strong>Never has a God of War game been on Xbox, and this doesn’t change with Sons of Sparta.</strong></p>



<p>Xbox has started to dig into its catalog of classics as of late and hand iconic titles over to Sony. As yet, the PlayStation brand hasn’t been quite as generous. Xbox’s GOW (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gears-of-war/" id="55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War</a>) has made its first roadie run to PlayStation, but you’ll have to wait and see if Sony’s GOW will Spartan Change over to Xbox.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play God of War Sons of Sparta on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>You also can’t play God of War Sons of Sparta on Nintendo Switch or the Switch 2.</strong></p>



<p>This was probably the least likely of the three, but it needed clarity. Sorry to disappoint overall. You asked, and IG answered. In this day and age of games going multi-platform and crossing to different sides, though unimaginable, never say never when it comes to God of War Sons of Sparta getting a PC, Xbox, or Switch port.</p>



<p>You’ll hear it here first if they do!</p>



<p>Are you disappointed by the news? Are the Sons of Sparta and Remake Trilogy announcements enough to want to make you finally upgrade to a PS5?

            <p>Ready your swords, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>'s online co-op multiplayer - known as Legends - is set to arrive in a little under a month.</p>
<p>As announced at this evening's PlayStation State of Play, Legends will be available from 10th March, thanks to a free update for all Ghost of Yōtei owners. You can check out its release date trailer below:</p>

<p>As for the specifics, developer Sucker Punch has said Legends will arrive with three mission types.</p>
<p>"In Survival, you can team up with up to three other players to take down waves of increasingly difficult enemies on one of four maps," it explained, adding players will have to "fight to control territory" on each map.</p>
<p>"While you control a location, you can activate a Blessing, offering you an advantage in battle. But if you lose control, you’ll unleash a Curse, putting your team at a disadvantage." The Legends team noted that each map "will have its own unique Curses and Blessings" for players to experience.</p><p>In Story, meanwhile, players will be able to join forces with another and then tackle a series of 12 missions. "After completing each set of three Story missions, you'll unlock an Incursion, which is a large-scale four-player assault on a stronghold belonging to a member of the Yōtei Six," Sucker Punch said. "Each Incursion will culminate in a boss fight versus a giant, supernatural version of the Spider, the Oni, the Kitsune, or the Snake.</p>
<p>"As for the other members of the Yōtei Six, in April we'll release a Raid putting your team to the ultimate test, where you can expect to take on the Dragon and Lord Saito himself."</p>

</figure>
<p>Then we have the classes players can play as in Ghost of Yōtei Legends. These are Samurai, Archer, Mercenary, or Shinobi. Any class can use a ranged weapon in addition to a katana, but of course each will have their own unique strengths.</p><p>If you play as a Samurai, for example, you will be able to wield the ōdachi. The Samirai also has access to the widest range of weapon types. If you opt to play as an Archer, then you will be able to use the yari (that's a spear), as well as carry an additional ranged weapon. Mercenaries, meanwhile, get the dual katana "with a variety of utility-focused abilities". Last but not least, we have the Shinobi who can use the kusarigama, "as well as a suite of stealth-focused skills".</p>
<p>Closing out its reveal, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/ghost-of-yotei-legends-comes-to-ps5-on-march-10/">Sucker Punch's senior communications manager Andrew Goldfarb said</a>: "The fan response to Legends was one of the most rewarding parts of launching <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, and we're so excited to see the mode return for Ghost of Yōtei; we can't for you all to dive in!"</p>

		<p>Remedy Entertainment has shared a gameplay reveal trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-resonant">Control Resonant</a>, their highly anticipated sequel to the 2019 hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a>. The video runs for a few minutes, showcasing some of Dylan’s growing abilities, the game’s combat style and the twisted world you’ll be battling through.</p>
<p><iframe title="Control Resonant - Gameplay Reveal | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IA71hdzim0M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer picks up with Dylan on the trail of a Resonant, heading through an Inception-like folded rendition of Manhattan. He revcently acquired Shift as an ability, which allows him to defy the already broken gravity. His weapon is another transforming tool, but compared to the multi-tool gun of Control, this is all about melee. He also has more supernatural abilities for range, and the game looks to encourage you to switch between range and melee</p>
<p>The trailer builds up to snippets of a crazy battle against a giant laser-spewing whale or something, but that’s not the Resonant. No, that seems to be a kind of hammer-wielding ballet dancer?</p>
<p>Clearly there’s plenty more that Remedy don’t want to show just yet, but we’re excited for this one – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/15/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-control-resonant/">Control Resonant was right up there on our Most Wanted Games of 2026.</a></p>

<p>Control Resonant is expected to release for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC sometime in 2026.</p>

		<p>The co-op Legends mode for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei/">Ghost of Yōtei</a> will launch on March 10th as a free update for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei Legends - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VYyhow-EU8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you need a refresher, Legends was first introduced in Ghost of Tsushima, and it added co-op missions where players took on fantastical enemies, participated in Raids, and played as new characters other than Jin Sakai. It is likely Ghost of Yotei will follow a similar format.</p>
<p><em>“Legends will launch with three mission types. In Survival, you can team up with up to three other players to take down waves of increasingly difficult enemies on one of four maps. You’ll fight to control territory on each map. While you control a location, you can activate a Blessing, offering you an advantage in battle. But if you lose control, you’ll unleash a Curse, putting your team at a disadvantage. Each map will have its own unique Curses and Blessings.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>In Story, you’ll team up with another player to tackle a series of 12 missions. After completing each set of three Story missions, you’ll unlock an Incursion, which is a large-scale four-player assault on a stronghold belonging to a member of the Yōtei Six. Each Incursion will culminate in a boss fight versus a giant, supernatural version of the Spider, the Oni, the Kitsune, or the Snake.</em></p>

<p><em>As for the other members of the Yōtei Six, in April we’ll release a Raid putting your team to the ultimate test, where you can expect to take on the Dragon and Lord Saito himself”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Sony</strong> hosted its hour-long <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">February 2026 State of Play</a></strong> today, and while plenty of the announcements were surprises, some of them, like the new <strong>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</strong> reveal, we had a heads up on. After its Steam page was accidentally updated to include additional information, like how the game will feature <strong>20 characters at launch</strong>, it seemed like a safe bet that it would be featured during today's event.</p>



<p>Not only was it shown off, but we got another look at more gameplay with this trailer, specifically featuring the <strong>Unbreakable X-Men,</strong> with <strong>Storm, Magik, Wolverine,</strong> and <strong>Danger</strong> all joining the roster of playable fighters in Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. We also got the introduction of <strong>Episode Mode</strong>, a story-driven mode that combines Japanese manga and American-style comics to create a unique blend of storytelling.</p>



<p>And, perhaps most significantly for fighting game fans, we now have an <strong>August 6, 2026</strong>, PC and PS5 release date to look forward to.</p>



<p>It's the first team reveal for the game, and a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-arrives-on-ps5-pc-august-6/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that went live alongside the trailer digs a bit into the game's narrative, with Storm, Magik, Wolverine, and Danger being the only X-Men capable of continuing the fight as a new threat looms over Earth, after a recent battle left the rest of the squad with limited strength. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Viewed with suspicion and persecuted as “others,” mutants face hostility from humanity. Despite this, the reborn X-Men press on, driven by inner conflict as they strive to protect even the humans who persecute them from the looming threat.</em> <em>What decisions the team will make, and how their story will conclude, is something we hope you look forward to discovering</em>," writes producer <strong>Takeshi Yamanaka</strong>.</p>



<p>Regarding the Episode Mode, we won't be getting traditional cutscenes in different animation styles. Instead, the game's narrative will be shown "<em>as motion comics, centred around manga illustrated by celebrated artists</em>."</p>



<p>Interestingly, while we got to see a lot of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls here, what we didn't get any hint of is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-flexstrike-project-defiant-fight-stick/"><strong>FlexStrike</strong> fight stick</a> <strong>PlayStation</strong> has previously showcased alongside Marvel Tokon. It was theorized that the fight stick will arrive alongside Marvel Tokon, and its absence from today's showcase may be an indication that it won't make the August launch.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll have more information on both the FlexStrike and the rest of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls' full roster soon.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/housemarque-shows-off-more-saros-gameplay-at-the-state-of-play-ahead-of-april-2026-launch/</link>
            <guid>1434694</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>With <strong>Saros</strong> getting an <strong>April 30, 2026, </strong>release date confirmation during <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-saros-trailer-shows-provides-new-look-at-story/">The Game Awards 2025</a>,</strong> it seemed like a lock to be included during today's <strong>February 2026 State of Play</strong>, and it was. <strong>Housemarque</strong> did not disappoint, making a major show of more gameplay from Saros as we get closer to its release.</p>



<p>Today's trailer dug deeper into the game's systems and focused more on what Housemarque means by its "<em>come back stronger</em>" mantra for Saros' gameplay style. We got a look at how you'll upgrade your armor via the Armor Matrix with resources you gather on your runs, and how you'll choose your upgrades to suit your playstyle. </p>



<p>We also got a look at the fast travel system, which lets you travel to any biome you've already unlocked. You can try and complete everything in one go, but thankfully, you're no longer forced to, as you can head directly to the biome you left off at. Of course, <strong>Returnal</strong> players will remember that you didn't have to play through the entirety of a biome once you have defeated the boss, but this is now a more direct solution, so you can pick up where you left off.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>We also got a look at how the Eclipse corrupts weapons and artifacts in the game, and how, on top of the onslaught of enemies you'll face, you'll have to push through the effects of the Eclipse to survive. It even changes certain biome properties, like making marsh water in one of the biomes come alive and burn you when it's active. Hostiles will also fire projectiles that have been corrupted by the Eclipse at you when it's active, doing even more damage than they would without it.</p>



<p>Housemarque promised to have more coming between now and launch, so if you don't feel like you've had <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-saros-gameplay-release-date-state-of-play/">your fill of Saros showcases</a>, stay tuned.</p>

            <p>
You knew it was coming, I knew it was coming, and now one Mr. Hideo Kojima himself (disclaimer: technically it was Sony during tonight's State of Play, though I'm sure he's Fweeted about it on Fwitter) has confirmed that yes, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> is making its way to PC. It's also doing so pretty soon, and with a small suite of additional features not present in its original PS5 release.
</p>
<p>
For starters, that release date: it's March 19th! That's a little over a month away, and less than a year after it first launched, so, not a horrendously long wait all things considered. Those features unique to PC are pretty much exactly what you'd expect with things like ultrawide monitor support, in both 21:9 UltraWidescreen, and 32:9 Super UltraWidescreen, and 4K resolution.

<p>
There's also the option for uncapped framerates, obviously depending on your PC specs, or upscaling and frame generation if that's more your speed. And if you've got a DualSense controller, there's full support for that too, or you can use your mouse and keyboard if you're that committed to that kind of life. Over on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-pc-march-19/">PlayStation Blog</a> it was also confirmed that some new modes will be coming "that will offer players new challenges and rewards." Your guess is as good as mine as to what those could be, but they'll be coming at launch in any case, with details coming next month.
</p><p>
If you've not already played this one on PS5 yet, it honestly is just more of the same of the first game, but this time in Australia, with a few bells, whistles, gadgets, and gizmos thrown on top. I'm not one to heap praise upon Kojima needlessly, guy's got a cushy enough life, but from what I've played of it, just walking around beautiful, endless deserts, mountainscapes, and all sorts does have a certain something to it. Though, there is a touch too much shooting compared to the first game for my liking.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, you can already wishlist Death Stranding 2: On the Beach on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3280350/DEATH_STRANDING_2_ON_THE_BEACH/">Steam</a> ahead of its release next month.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em> showed off the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-runner-shells-trailer-abilities-bungie-2000660170">grim trauma lurking beneath the surface of the extraction shooter’s colorful Tau Ceti IV planetary environments</a>, but it teased more than just sci-fi horror worldbuilding. Bungie also revealed the dates for the game’s pre-launch beta, giving players one last chance to go hands-on before deciding whether to fork over $40 for Sony’s latest live-service multiplayer game.</p> <p><em>Marathon</em>‘s pre-launch “server slam” goes live on February 26 and will run through March 2, just a few days before the game’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-trailer-leak-bungie-2000660975">full release date on March 5</a>. Players will be able to dive into the game for free on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC with the limited demo coinciding with the upcoming Steam Next Fest. While you don’t need to pre-order the game to get in, you’ll need a PS Plus or Game Pass Core subscription to access the server slam on consoles.</p>

  <p>The open beta will feature a “limited selection of maps, Runner shells, and contracts” for players to test out, with more maps, factions, contracts, gear, and other content coming at launch and during Season 1. While progress won’t carry over to the full game, players can earn tiered gear packages that will then come in handy when they get started in the loot extraction shooter once it’s out.</p> <p>PS Plus subscribers will also get the chance to unlock a handful of exclusive rewards to show they participated in the server slam: special emblems and banners linked to other PlayStation franchises. Those include weapon charms from <em>Helldivers 2</em>,<em> Death Stranding 2</em>, and <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. Xbox and PC players will be able to earn them too at some point, though it’s not clear how yet. <em>Marathon</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-director-budget-development-2000661252">went through a rough patch last year</a> but recent leaks of a playtest in China suggested things have improved quite a bit since the original alpha test.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>God of War Sons of Sparta is one of 2026’s biggest and best shocks without question. A new GOW game is a shock, but if you want to know how much it is first, or if it’s on disc, this guide has all the answers.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2026 Sony</a> State of Play had no right to drop bombshell after bombshell. If you thought the news that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Remake Trilogy</a> is coming was big, a shadow-dropped <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Sons of Sparta</a> was a Cronos-sized surprise</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-buy-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-on-disc-physical-edition-explained">Can You Buy God of War Sons of Sparta On Disc? Physical Edition, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Like a fever dream. Credit to Santa Monica Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>God of War Sons of Sparta is currently a digital-only game, meaning you can buy it from the PlayStation Store on PS5 and nowhere else.</strong></p>



<p>This is likely a case of shocking everyone with an impromptu shadow drop first, accumulating millions in sales and copies sold, then giving the game a second lease of life later down the line with a physical copy.</p>

</ul>



<p>It’s hard to shadow drop a game on disc, making digital the only logical and viable solution. You can buy either God of War Sons of Sparta Standard Edition or Digital Deluxe Edition to complement your virtual game collection.</p>



<p>The latter comes with several benefits, including in-game items, a digital artbook, soundtrack, and PlayStation Avatar: A fine gift from the Gods of Olympus.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta">How Much is God of War Sons of Sparta?</h2>



<p><strong>God of War Sons of Sparta is $29.99 through the US PlayStation Store or £24.99 in the UK.</strong></p>



<p>For a brand-new God of War game with premium polish, this is a pretty decent price tag. Attaching the God of War brand to anything in 2026 could warrant a hefty price tag, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/santa-monica-studio/" id="87635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Santa Monica</a> and Sony have been quite generous here.</p>

</ul>



<p>Furthermore, if you want to stump up a bit more Gold, the Digital Deluxe Edition is $39.99 USD or £32.99.</p>
