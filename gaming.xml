            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-february-2025-monster-hunter-wilds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US analyst group Circana has released its sales data for February, and you'll never be able to guess which phenomenally popular action RPG managed to top the all-format charts.</p>

<p>That's right: according to Circana's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqai3ibbc2p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mat Piscatella</a>,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>was February's best-selling game, despite launching on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">very last day of the month</a>. Of course, given that it took&nbsp;<em>Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">just three days to break eight million sales</a>, we probably shouldn't be surprised about that.</p>

<p>In second place, according to Piscatella's data, is Warhorse Studios'&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, which hit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks" rel="nofollow">two million sales in less than two weeks</a>. Not bad for what is effectively a fairly niche medieval RPG.</p>

<p>In fourth place is golf sim&nbsp;<em>PGA Tour 2K25</em>, with basketball game&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>in fifth and perennially popular shooter&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>in sixth (appropriately enough).</p>

<p>Seventh place for the month is a new entry in Obsidian's&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>, but Microsoft probably isn't too worried about a low placement like that given that the game is also available on Game Pass.</p>

<p>Bringing up the last three places in the top ten for February are&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25</em>, the latter demonstrating the sheer staying power of EA's sporting franchises (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">well, sometimes, anyway</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/madden-nfl-25-circana-us-sales-data-february-2025.jpg?itok=MyGKAb9r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/madden-nfl-25-circana-us-sales-data-february-2025.jpg?itok=vfkBbUGv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Madden NFL 25&nbsp;</em>is still hanging on in there, according to Circana's data.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to specific platforms, <i>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</i>was the best-selling game on Playstation and Xbox, with&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8&nbsp;</em>topping the Switch charts (because&nbsp;<em>Wilds&nbsp;</em>isn't available on Switch, of course).</p>

<p>In hardware terms, it probably won't shock you to learn that the PS5, which recently passed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-75m-best-quarter-ever" rel="nofollow">75 million lifetime sales</a>, was February's best-selling console in both unit and dollar terms, with Xbox bringing up second place.</p>

While there have been some attempts at shrinking console gaming down into something that will fit in your hands, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21441254/nintendo-ds-3ds-discontinued-eulogy">many of the best handheld experiences have been downright weird</a>. Think of the Nintendo DS with its dual screens that helped inspire memorable games about walking dogs, doing surgery, and, well, whatever is going on in <em>Electroplankton</em>. There’s something about the smaller scale of these games that often invites creativity from developers.</p><p>The Playdate, from first-time hardware maker Panic — best known for its Mac software and publishing games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/8/10922560/firewatch-review-ps4-pc"><em>Firewatch</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20868532/untitled-goose-game-review-nintendo-switch-pc-house-panic"><em>Untitled Goose Game</em></a> — takes this idea to the extreme. It’s a tiny yellow square, not much bigger than a credit card, with a black-and-white screen and a crank that juts out of its side. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview">It looks like a Game Boy from a parallel world</a>. And, much like with the DS and its contemporaries, those limitations and distinct features have inspired a library of games unlike anything I’ve ever played: everything from a strategy game about cryptid photography and a turn-based samurai adventure to a role-playing game where all you do is manage inventory.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjMyNDE4" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/632418/playdate-price-increase-panic-malaysia">The Playdate is about to get a price increase</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Don’t Panic, the Playdate now has a matching power adapter.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaydateConsole/comments/1h7z76e/new_accessory_us_standard_ac_adapter/">Reddit user discovered</a> that Panic has <a href="https://play.date/shop/ac-adapter/">quietly introduced a 10W AC adapter</a> that matches the Playdate handheld’s bright yellow aesthetic.

Panic says that “about 32,000 of those users who have not bought a game are still working through the games included in Playdate Season One.” Some more numbers: there are currently 181 titles in the store, and so far, sales have grossed just over $544,000 (“after taxes, processing fees, and Panic’s 25% revenue share for distribution on Catalog,” the company says).</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133103/playdate-catalog-game-sales">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><div><p>The case of the missing $400,000 worth of cute hand-cranked game consoles.</p><p>Did they “fall off a truck”?

As those lead-times shorten and Playdate delivery becomes more immediate, we’re looking forward to an even better year two.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23687836/playdate-handheld-sales">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Playdate is adding five new games to its Catalog.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>You can now play Celeste on Playdate.</p></div></li></ul><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23733264/panic-playdate-handheld-gameboy-season-one-two/archives/2"><span>More Stories</span></a></section></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was the best-selling game of February 2025 in the United States (US), knocking Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 from the top spot after four months.</p>



<p>In the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqahyb5hk2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, four of the top five games from February were brand new releases. Coming in second was Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 while Civilization 7 and PGA Tour 2K25 were third and fourth, respectively. Rounding out the top five was NBA 2K25, which fell from second.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 finished sixth.</p>



<p>Regarding new game releases, six releases found their way into the top 10 for February after just one <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-was-january-2025s-best-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the top 20</a> in January. Aside from what was mentioned above, the other new games that made February’s list of best sellers were Avowed at seven and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii at eight.</p>



<p>Lastly, a number of games that found themselves near the top of the sales charts for months have continued to fall. In addition to the aforementioned Call of Duty and NBA 2K25, EA Sports College Football 25 has fallen out of the top 10 for the first time, coming in at 16th compared to seventh. The only game to stay in its same spot from month to month is Elden Ring at 18.</p>

<p>A game called Plants vs Zombies Reloaded has been rated by the Brazil rating board, sparking discussion that a remaster of the original could be in development.</p>



<p>The rating, which simply says “Plants vs Zombies Reloaded” was rated for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X, PC, Nintendo Switch, and mobile with an ‘L’ rating.</p>



<p>Plants vs Zombies was first developed and published by PopCap Games in May 2009 and later was acquired by EA in July 2011. Despite the initial game being a success and multiple spin-offs and a few sequels, the Plants vs Zombies community has criticized the developers for not replicating the success of the original game.</p>



<p>“I hope it means ea (or popcap idk if they can make decisions by themselves) will get his shit together to deliver a proper sequel in the future but at this point the mere thought of it falls into hopium territory, they fumbled the franchise so hard that it hurts,” said Reddit user kdk_2002.</p>



<p>“Thankfully you don’t have to even look to EA, I sure as hell don’t, since the fans have taken it upon themselves to continue PvZ and have made a plethora of great mods expanding upon PvZ1 and PvZ2. We’re eating good and not giving EA a dime, as it should be until they deliver something actually worth paying for,” said another user.</p>

In the U.S., Capcom’s action game is the best-selling game of 2025 so far, and it’s PC in particular that’s dominating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Circana, not only was Monster Hunter Wilds the best-selling game of February, but launch month dollar sales more than doubled the total Monster Hunter: Rise achieved during its March 2021 debut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, Monster Hunter Wilds was the best-selling game of February across PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam. But here’s the interesting stat: Steam accounted for more than half of Monster Hunter Wilds’ total dollar sales. That's despite some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-mixed-steam-user-review-rating-capcom-issues-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-troubleshooting-guide">high-profile performance issues on PC that have led to a 'mixed' user review rating for Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps Monster Hunter Wilds’ PC success shouldn’t come as a surprise, given PC has become increasingly important for multiplatform releases. Speaking to IGN in a recent interview, Strauss Zelnick, boss of Rockstar parent company Take-Two, said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">the PC version of a multiplatform game can generate 40% of overall sales, or even more with certain games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That stat came as part of a discussion about the current console generation. In the U.S., February video game hardware spending fell by 25% when compared to a year ago, to $256 million. That’s the lowest February total for video game hardware spending since the $184 million reached in February 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick pointed to the PC platform as growing in importance while publishers wait for Sony and Microsoft’s next moves and with the Nintendo Switch 2 waiting in the wings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue,” he said. “Of course, there will be a new console generation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds is evidence of the trend, then. But it wasn’t the only new release in February to do well. In fact, according to Circana’s data, the top four best-selling games of February 2025 were new releases, with Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Sid Meier’s Civilization VII, and PGA Tour 2K25 joining Monster Hunter Wilds. Other new releases appearing among the month’s top 10 best-sellers included Obsidian’s Avowed, which also launched day-one into Game Pass, and Sega’s Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Circana said the launch month dollar sales total Kingdom Come: Deliverance II reached in February 2025 was more than five times higher than the original Kingdom Come: Deliverance achieved during its February 2018 debut. Embracer Group, parent company of Kingdom Come: Deliverance developer Warhorse Studios, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-shows-no-sign-of-slowing-down-sells-2-million-copies-in-less-than-2-weeks">has already hailed the sequel’s sales success</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">February 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>NEW Monster Hunter: Wilds - Capcom USA</li><li>NEW Kingdom Come: Deliverance II - Plaion</li><li>NEW Civilization VII - Take-Two Interactive</li><li>NEW PGA Tour 2K25 - Take-Two Interactive</li><li>NBA 2K25 - Take-Two Interactive</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Microsoft (Corp)</li><li>NEW Avowed - Microsoft (Corp)</li><li>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - Sega</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V - Take-Two Interactive</li><li>Madden NFL 25 - Electronic Arts</li><li>Minecraft - Multiple Video Game Manufacturers</li><li>EA Sports FC 25 - Electronic Arts</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 - Sony (Corp)</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II - Take-Two Interactive</li><li>Hogwarts Legacy - Warner Bros.

Continued backwards compatibility is a given.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-console"><u>Xbox president Sarah Bond said</u></a> Microsoft was "moving full speed ahead on our next generation hardware, focused on delivering the biggest technological leap ever in a generation."</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is much speculation around the future of consoles generally.

While Nintendo is set to launch Switch 2 later this year, there is growing concern that the traditional video game console business could be under threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer has said in interviews that the console business has failed to grow meaningfully in recent years, offering a sizable but static customer base that is increasingly playing a handful of enormous games and leaving little room for everything else. Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore"><u>former Xbox executive Peter Moore told IGN</u></a> that Microsoft would have been discussing whether consoles have a future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Circana’s data, console sales are in a slump right now. February video game hardware spending fell by 25% when compared to a year ago, to $256 million. That’s the lowest February total for video game hardware spending since the $184 million reached in February 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5 was once again the best-selling hardware platform of the month across both units and dollars. Xbox Series ranked second in both measures. Accessories spending in February declined by 8% when compared to a year ago, to $220 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The industry overall is having a particularly tough time. February 2025 projected U.S. consumer spending across video game hardware, content, and accessories declined 6% when compared to a year ago, to $4.5 billion. Spending so far this year is 11% lower than at the same point in 2024, at $9.0 billion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Video game content spending, specifically, fell 4% compared to a year ago, to $4 billion. Non-mobile subscription spending growth of 9% was offset by declines in mobile (-4%), as well as full game and add-on content spending across both console (-11%), and the PC, cloud and non-console VR (-4%) segments.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there is hope things will improve this year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-will-sell-loads-of-switch-2-consoles-at-launch-regardless-of-price-analysts-predict-june-release-date-once-again-mentioned">Some analysts have said the Nintendo Switch 2 could be the biggest console launch of all time irrespective of its price</a>. And then there’s the looming behemoth that is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which is still set for release in fall 2025 on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S only, and could end up as the biggest entertainment launch of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Strauss Zelnick, boss of Rockstar parent company Take-Two, has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">he expects GTA 6 to spark a surge in console sales</a>. “When you have a big title in the market and we have many of them coming, historically that has sold consoles,” Zelnick told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I think that will happen this year. I don't think tariffs are going to be our friend, but I think there will be a meaningful uptick in console sales in calendar 25 because of the release schedule, not just coming from us, but coming from others. So I'm not concerned about that [console sales falling]. I think the trend that you'd want to focus on is this increasing share of the market that is reflected in PC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> has deployed another rather chunky patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>.</p>
<p>On the game's initial launch last year, Stalker 2 was criticised for its performance issues. However, in an interview with Eurogamer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development">GSC Game World's CEO Ievgen Grygorovych said delaying the game was not an option</a>. "You're so tired that you would just die if you say let's run an additional marathon," Grygorovych said at the time. </p>

<p>The team has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyls-second-major-patch-adds-1700-improvements-and-fixes">remained committed to sorting the game's various niggles</a> and what not since then, with two already sizeable patches already out there, and this most recent update is a continuation of that. </p>
<p>Patch 1.3, as it is known, comes with "over 1200 changes and improvements" to all aspects of the game, including performance, combat and more.</p>
<p>With this patch in play, Stalker 2 players will notice multiple new death screens which "vary based on the cause of the death", as well as improved facial animations, a new night music theme for Slag Heap and a new type of a visual anomaly.</p>
<p>On the combat side of things, GSC has made mutant movements during combat smoother and improved the reaction of NPCs to the sound of footsteps.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cwa-and-video-game-workers-launch-new-industry-wide-union-anyone-can-join-even-if-they%E2%80%99ve-been-laid-off.1138821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/uvw-cwa-video-game-union-microsoft-trump-musk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, Communications Workers of America (CWA) – the union that represents over 2,000 workers across companies like Microsoft, Activision, Bethesda, and Zenimax – is announcing a new industry-wide union called United Videogame Workers-CWA. Unlike unions that have been studio- or discipline-specific, this one is open to <em>all </em>video game workers in the United States and Canada, regardless of employment status.</p><p>UVW-CWA is rooted in the tradition of direct-join unionism, which means the union itself isn’t certified by any particular government or company, allowing anyone to join. As a result, this type of union doesn’t have the same type of legal leverage that something organized in accordance with modern laws and strictures might. But, as Emma Kinema, one of the original game devs behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Workers_Unite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 2018 Game Workers Unite campaign</a> and current CODE-CWA senior campaign lead, wrote in a zine explaining the rationale behind UVW-CWA, the law isn’t exactly on workers’ side these days.</p><p>"With the tumultuous start of the second Trump Administration, two of the agencies that workers rely on to protect their rights and hold corporations accountable – the Department of Labor (DOL) and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) – are under attack,” she wrote. “Between Trump’s illegal firing of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox, Elon Musk challenging the National Labor Relations Act as unconstitutional, and huge tech giants like Amazon already using the vacant NLRB as grounds to reject union wins, it’s clear that Trump and the billionaire class he represents are working day and night to dismantle labor laws and put even more power back in the hands of corporations. We can no longer expect to rely on traditional legal frameworks to build worker power and to improve workplace conditions.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>If the right-wing, reactionary government that we increasingly have wants to start stripping away that process, they're going to quickly remember that, actually, the NLRB and NLRA are a peace treaty between workers and bosses.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In an interview with Aftermath, Kinema added that many of history’s most notable labor victories were won outside of a standard legal framework.</p><p>"For two-thirds of modern industrial history, there were no legal forms of unions,” she said. “They were just humans coming together to organize as best as they could in leverage against their employers for better conditions. Only once you arrive at the 1935 National Labor Relations Act do you get private section union frameworks where you can get certified, have majority collective bargaining rights, etc. And if the right-wing, reactionary government that we increasingly have wants to start stripping away that process, they're going to quickly remember that, actually, the NLRB and NLRA are a peace treaty between workers and bosses; the legal framework for unionism that people have gotten used to over the past 80 years is a peace treaty, and it cuts both ways.”</p><p>UVW-CWA also takes aim at another pressing issue currently facing the video game industry: layoffs. The union is kicking off a campaign at GDC with a petition about layoffs it plans to pass around, but more broadly, this new structure provides a means by which designers, programmers, artists, QA testers, and every other discipline under the sun can join the movement even if they’re not currently employed.</p><p>"One of the nice things about a direct-join model is, the company doesn't get to define or say who is in the union. The government doesn't have a say in who's in the union,” Kinema said. “So we can define the union as broadly as we want, and for us we're saying it's all workers. Whether you're a direct-hire employee at a major company, you're at an indie studio, you're a freelancer or contractor, or you're unemployed, it doesn't matter. If you're in and of the industry, you belong in the union. You deserve to have a voice in the movement."</p><p>Kinema pointed to the history of the United Auto Workers – now one of the most influential unions in the country – which began outside the bounds of formal unionization and bargaining rights.</p><p>"A lot of people look to the '30s and '40s as the heyday, the golden era of labor organizing in the United States, right? You get the GM/Flint sit-down strikes of '37 and the steel strikes – all sorts of different things," she said. "People take away valuable lessons, but the wrong lessons in some ways, like 'Oh, you need to map out social leaders' and 'You need to do this and that kind of recruitment' and 'These are the kinds of conversations [the Congress of Industrial Organizations] had.' But they were also organizing a direct-join model, where if someone wanted to support the campaign, if they wanted to be in the union, they would just join. They would become a member, they would get trained up, they would have leadership. They would have actions and things, skirmishes with the companies. It's a more powerful, flexible, and accessible model of organizing."</p><figure><blockquote><p>If you're in and of the industry, you belong in the union. You deserve to have a voice in the movement.</p></blockquote></figure><p>That’s more or less what UVW-CWA is hoping to accomplish with the video game industry, in which <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/game-developers-are-more-interested-in-unions-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a majority of workers approve of unions</a>, but only a small minority are able to participate in them. Make no mistake, though, this is not just a loosely affiliated conglomerate of workers; it is a union with dues and all the rest.</p><p>"There are dues,” Kinema said. “$15 USD is the minimum, and then it ranges to one percent income, depending on how you define it. It's all honor system, of course, and it's self-deducted, self-raised. It's not through payroll or anything like that, like a typical union campaign would be. The idea is, we can build leverage and power together by building our resources, by building community, by building a new cadre of organizers in the industry with new experience based off the last several years of organizing."</p><p>This approach takes inspiration from preexisting unions in other countries, like <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IWGB Game Workers Union</a>, the largest union for game devs in the UK at over 1,500 members, which also relies on direct-join unionism. Austin Kelmore, IWGB Game Workers co-founder and chair of the branch, told Aftermath that direct-join unionism allowed the union to reach its current size in just a couple years, but there are potential downsides – such as members expecting a service during times of tumult.</p><p>"[Workers] join the union and think they've done what they need to do to improve the industry, and the union will support them if anything comes up," said Kelmore. "This service model for trade unions is easy to fall into and is one of the reasons why unions have lost so much power in the previous decades. ... It's impossible to support an entire industry's workers with staff hired with the small amounts of membership dues we collect. So the challenge, then, is to talk with workers and let them know the power of a union comes from the workers, not the staff. We prefer an organizing model where the workers build power together and push for change themselves. So far, many of our members have been receptive to that message, which fills me with excitement at what we can accomplish together."  </p><p>Despite all the talk of sticking it to elected officials and bosses – and the unholy hybrid of the two that Trump and Musk’s intertwining serpent tongues represent – Kinema believes that this new approach is plenty compatible with the trail workers and CWA have blazed at companies like Microsoft.&nbsp;</p><p>"By no means do we think the direct-join model and the certification model are mutually exclusive to each other. We think they can complement each other, actually, and expand upon each other,” Kinema said. “Part of it is going to be welcoming this new influx of people into the movement through this direct-join model and then giving them the training and education and onboarding such that they can still turn around and do meaningful organizing that doesn't put them at risk in an unnecessary way."&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>To be attacked by the enemy is to be respected by the enemy.</p></blockquote></figure><p>It’s a big moment for CWA, both in terms of potential growth and possible consequences. While Kinema acknowledged that the government could simply declare membership in UVW-CWA illegal, she believes that's unlikely. However, former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has repeatedly rattled his saber in CWA’s direction, going so far as to accuse the union of masterminding Blizzard’s 2021 legal woes in an effort to juice membership during <a href="https://aftermath.site/activision-unfair-labor-practice-guns-cwa-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent podcast</a>.</p><p>Kinema finds that perversely encouraging.</p><p>“To be attacked by the enemy is to be respected by the enemy,” she said. "When the boss starts to get scared, when they get nervous, when they start putting out statements, when they start putting out lies, when they start putting pressure on, that's a sign that you're doing something right. That's a sign that you're moving the needle. You're changing the industry for real. I think it's in the psyche of a lot of bosses now that the 'threat' of unionization is on the horizon for them if they don't tread lightly, if they don't treat their workers with care.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-review-impressions"><h3>Two Point Museum: It’s Great</h3></a><p>No tombs were raided in the making of this video game</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-dead-inside-do-not-enter"><h3>Kotaku.com.au Would Have Been Better Off Dead</h3></a><p>A 404 would have been preferable to whatever this is</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/united-videogame-workers-union-official-launches-in-north-america/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>United Videogame Workers (UVW), in conjunction with the Communication Works of America (CWA) and the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) have announced the first ever industry-wide, direct-join union in North America. The UVW-CWA Local 9433 was revealed during Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2025 in San Francisco, California.</p>



<p>As a direct-join union, anyone working in the video game industry in both the United States and Canada can join. That includes artists, developers, QA tester, and more whether they are freelance or full time. It also doesn’t matter how many people from their specific company have joined.  </p>



<p>“The creation of this union was not done in isolation; it’s a cumulative effort by the thousands of video game workers who have been fighting for years to redefine what it means to stand together and reclaim power in one of the largest and highest-grossing industries on the globe,”&nbsp;said CWA’s Senior Director of Organizing Tom Smith <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-launch-industry-wide-union-communications-workers-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via press release</a>. “These workers are taking a bold stand, joining together to build power for the workers behind the games we all know and love.”</p>



<p>CWA President Claude Cummings Jr. added: “As video game studios have consolidated, the workers whose creativity, dedication, and skill bring the games to life have become more an afterthought. They are subject to endless cycles of layoffs and rehiring as corporate executives pursue short-term profits at the expense of a sustainable future.”</p>



<p>The press release adds that as part of the union’s launch, its members will be running a petition “demanding dignity and job security for all video game workers, particularly those facing layoffs.” They will also have a large presence around GDC 2025, including panels and other events.</p>



<p>The unions mission statement reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Our mission is to take back our lives, our labor, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs; to empower our fellow workers; to link up arms with the laid off, with the freelancer, with the disillusioned contractor, with the disenfranchised and the marginalized, with the workers laboring invisibly to keep this industry afloat</em>. <em>We are going to create a game industry that works for us, one that nourishes its talent and invests in its future, rather than constantly seeking short-term profits. We are the ones that make the games, so we must be the ones that set the terms of how we work.</em></p>




</blockquote>



<p>As of publishing, there have been a <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">known 1,493 jobs lost</a> due to layoffs in 2025 across 47 companies. This comes after an estimated 16,000 people lost their jobs in 2024.</p>

However, the final plan is not finalized and things could change, he said.</p><p>An update planned for May will allow players to visit a gym where they can change their character's body shape; an August update will add a "cat-themed city" for <a href="https://awareness-days.co.uk/awareness-day/international-cat-day/2025-08-08/#:~:text=August%208%2C%202025&amp;text=This%20day%20encourages%20cat%20lovers,a%20leading%20cat%20welfare%20charity." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">International Cat Day</a>.

Like The Sims, players create, control, and observe the lives of "Zois" who are living in a simulation of the player's design.</p><p>InZoi releases in early access for PC on March 27. It's also in the works for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but a release date for those console platforms has not been announced.</p>

We’ve previously covered <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-spring-2024-new-releases" rel="nofollow">some great new releases from last Spring</a>, and even further back we’ve looked at the addition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-late-2023-new-release-review" rel="nofollow">House Bolton with Late 2023 releases</a>. Now let’s dive in and see what the tenacious Brotherhood brings with our review of&nbsp;<em>A&nbsp;</em><i>Song Of Ice And Fire TMG Brotherhood Without Banners Starter Set</i>!</p>



<p>The <i>Song Of Ice And Fire TMG Brotherhood Without Banners Starter Set</i> includes everything one player needs to jump into the game.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Box Contents:</p>

<ul><li>Core Rulebook</li>
	<li>Combat Unit, Attachment, Tactics, Special Rules, Siege, Mission, Objective, Reference, and Non-Combat Unit Cards</li>
	<li>Measuring Stick, Tactics Board, and Cardboard Tokens</li>
	<li>10 Brotherhood d6 Dice + 1 White d3 Die</li>
	<li>4 Movement trays</li>
	<li>54 Miniatures (4 units, 6 heroes)</li>
	<li>Flat Cardboard Terrain Pieces and Castle walls</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h2><b>What Characters Are Included in The <i>Song Of Ice And Fire TMG Brotherhood Without Banners Starter Set</i></b><b>?</b></h2>

<p>Characters included in the <i>Song Of Ice And Fire TMG Brotherhood Without Banners Starter Set</i> include six different characters for the army. Those are: Beric Dondarrion (with a card for him as an attachment or as commander), Thoros of Myr (with a card for him as an attachment or as commander), Lem Lemoncloak (attachment), Tom Sevenstrings (attachment), Ghost of High Heart (non-combat unit), and Ravella Smallwood (non-combat unit).</p>

<h3><b>Ravella and Ghost</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-ghost-and-rowena.jpg?itok=cSTpwoVF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-ghost-and-rowena.jpg?itok=GCO5vmIg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Let’s start with a quick chat on the NCU’s included in this starter set. With Ravella, while I <i>love</i> to see a miniature based on this crucial but under-the-radar character, her ability to restore 2 wounds to a unit 3 times per game won’t move the needle all the much.</p>

<p>Ghost of High Heart, however, is more interesting, with her ability to influence a unit to give them +1 to morale tests and punish enemy units who destroy ranks of the unit she’s influencing (giving them Vulnerable and Weakened). You could absolutely run her to punish enemies who focus on your rather squishy Peasant Levy units.</p>

<h3><b>Tom and Lem</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-lem-and-sevenstrings.jpg?itok=ecB-GnrD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-lem-and-sevenstrings.jpg?itok=xdqutV3E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Tom is an interesting attachment unit with the Order: Taunt ability that punishes an enemy unit that could (but doesn’t) Attack or Charge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lem, one of my all-time favorite characters from the books, has the seriously powerful Battle Scars ability which allows you to give his unit, while attacking, either: Vicious, re-roll any attack dice, or roll at its highest attack die value. As you loose ranks, you gain +1 option.</p>

<h3><b>Thoros and Beric - Non-Commander Units</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-thoros-and-beric.jpg?itok=eIwLu6CP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-thoros-and-beric.jpg?itok=31eZepgf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Thoros and Beric are available to either run as the commander of your army or as a character attachment, let’s take a look at the non-commander options first.</p>

<p>Thoros’s character, as you might expect, embraces his unrelenting, hard-to-kill spirit with the ability to heal 1 wound each time his unit activates (+1 wound to that if you control crown) and has the relentless ability which lets his unit perform an attack action after that unit is attacked. That’s huge!</p>

<p>Beric’s character card, Azor Ahai, gains faith tokens throughout the game which you can spend add attacking dice or get some last licks in before your unit goes down.</p>

<h3><b>Thoros and Beric - Commander Units</b></h3>

<p>For Thoros as commander, you can also gain and spend Faith tokens to make your attacks more powerful and punish panicked foes at long-range by restoring wounds to friendly foes they’re fighting.</p>

Let’s take a moment to chat about what each of these units does (or doesn’t) do well.</p>

<p>First up, the humble Peasant Levy, which cost just 4 point per unit to field. They have a fairly unimpressive 5+ attack roll, 6+ defense roll, and 6+ Morale. Not great, for sure, but their two abilities force enemies attacking them to suffer -1 to Hit, and they gain a +1 to Hit and +1 Attack Die when they attack while next to another friendly unit.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-men-at-arms.jpg?itok=IfbsLe88 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-men-at-arms.jpg?itok=jCiOiWZg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For the Men-At-Arms, they’re better provisioned with a 4+ hit, 4+ defense, and 6+ morale. They also hit with Critical Blows, and deal out Panicked and Weakened status effects to enemies they charge from the flank or rear.</p>

<p>And finally, there are the Brotherhood Archers, who might be some of the best ranged fighters in the game! Their Hidden Shot attack is long-range, hits on a 3+, ignores units and terrain when determining line of sight, and gains Precision and Vicious when targeting enemy flanks or rear. Add to this their ability to perform a free 3” maneuver action if no enemies are within short range, and this highly mobile unit is meant to get in and cause chaos.</p>

<p>So putting this all together, what are we really looking at with this Starter Set? I think this is a decent start to the army, but it doesn’t feel quite as cohesive as other recent new armies like the Bolton or Martell armies. But I suppose that’s the point of this army - they’re made up of deserters, small folk, anyone without a voice.</p>

<p>In that sense, I do think there’s a lot of fun flexible list-building to be done here, especially since they have a special ability that allows them to take a unit from Stark or Baratheon without it counting toward its Neutral points total. In other words, you can sneak in a unit from either of those armies, and still fill out your army with more neutral units.</p>

<p>While it doesn’t have a huge personality out of the box, there are two other unit boxes coming out that really do a lot of work rounding out this army. We’ll cover that shortly, but with the focus here on this Starter Set, the flavor is bigger than any larger army synergy.</p>

            <p>The Communications Workers of America (CWA) are set to launch an industry-wide union of video game workers in the U.S. and Canada at this year's GDC. The United Videogame Workers-CWA (UVW-CWA) will bring together "video game artists, writers, designers, QA testers, programmers, freelancers and beyond to build worker power irrespective of studio and current job status".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The union’s mission is to not only build community and solidarity amongst video game workers, but also to build large-scale education campaigns about labor organizing in the video game industry," say the CWA. "Their first issue campaign will be around layoffs – given the fact that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/almost-a-third-of-developers-think-generative-ai-is-a-negative-for-the-games-industry-says-new-survey">1 in 10 video game developers were laid off in 2024</a>, many video game workers have been mobilized to organize. And now they can! Workers will be sharing around a petition to address the industry-wide layoffs and hope to gain widespread support while at GDC".</p>
<p>If you're attending GDC, you'll be able to pick up a zine they've put together, which includes "UVW-CWA’s mission statement, FAQs, an op-ed on direct-join unionism from CODE-CWA Senior Campaign Lead Emma Kinema, and member quotes". Otherwise, the zine will be available from the <a href="https://code-cwa.org/">CODE-CWA's website.</a></p>
<p>From the zine:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We are going to draft a video game worker bill of rights, setting standards that have been glaringly absent from our craft for too long. It will address inequality in hiring, the pervasive reliance on crunch, healthcare for contractors, and protections against all manner of injustice. Armed with this bill, new organizers can activate with clarity of goal and action, cultivated by the shared knowledge of not only fellow game developers, but workers in the entire labor movement."</p></blockquote>

Steranka said, “So if there are any fears that this is going to other places that you may or may not know or may or may not trust, I hope that what I’m sharing today can help quell any of those fears.” Well, no.</p><figure id="" data-id="5f8eb16e199bc2b074723cc802d3b1a9" data-recommend-id="image://5f8eb16e199bc2b074723cc802d3b1a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Archen standing on a rock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Archen standing on a rock." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Niantic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5f8eb16e199bc2b074723cc802d3b1a9" data-recommend-id="image://5f8eb16e199bc2b074723cc802d3b1a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Archen standing on a rock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course, all of Steranka’s assurances fail to recognize that the game is already an absolute cluster of monetization that’s only gotten worse and worse over the years.

<p>F1 25 is set to be revealed next week, that’s according to known data miner billbil-kun. In addition to the game’s full reveal date, we also know the expected release date for F1 25.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ea-sports-f1-25-on-vous-devoile-la-date-de-sortie-et-plein-dautres-infos-sur-le-prochain-jeu-de-formule-1-60060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, F1 25 will be revealed on March 26, 2025. At that time it’ll be announced that the game will release on May 30, 2025.</p>



<p>F1 25 will launch with two editions for players: Standard and a new Iconic Edition. The standard edition will cost $59,99 and release on May 30. The Iconic Edition, however, will retail for $79.99 and give three days early access starting May 27. Those with EA Play and/or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will get a 10-hour trailer of the game upon release.</p>



<p>What still isn’t known as of publishing is what else will come with the Iconic Edition of the game. It’s also currently unclear if F1 25 will be available on the last-gen Xbox One and PlayStation 4.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, Saudi Arabian-owned mobile developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-set-to-be-acquired-by-saudi-arabias-scopely-in-3-5-billion-deal/1100-6530064/" data-ref-id="1100-6530064">Scopely confirmed that it's buying the gaming division of Niantic</a>, the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/" data-ref-id="5000-449545">Pokemon Go</a> and other hit mobile games. It was a $3.5 billion deal, and one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/" data-ref-id="2900-4718">largest gaming buyouts in history</a>. But for any fans who are worried about Scopely imposing certain unwanted changes on Pokemon Go, the game's senior director, Michael Steranka, wants to assure them that won't be the case.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go/541768/scopely-niantic-interview-michael-steranka" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Steranka indicated that he's spent months talking with Scopely's team, and he related that they don't want to rock the boat of Pokemon Go's success. For example, he indicated that Steranka won't shift the game from a free-to-play model, or force intrusive ads into the experience.</p><p>"[Intrusive ads are] not happening in Pokemon Go--not now, not ever," said Steranka. "Again, Scopely really recognizes how unique this game is, and they've told us themselves that they would be foolish to try to change the recipe of what's made this such a huge hit and a success. So yeah, absolutely not. We will not be building into our games any type of obtrusive ads or anything like that. I just really want to reiterate Scopely as a company, the way that they operate is they give all of their teams the agency to make the decisions that’s right for their games. And that is not something that we feel would ever be right for Pokemon Go."</p><p>Regarding player data, Steranka reiterated that the company doesn't sell that to third parties, and offered assurances that it won't be changing that policy now or in the future. He also confirmed that Niantic's in-person events, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-fest-heads-to-paris-this-summer/1100-6529961/" data-ref-id="1100-6529961">Pokemon Go Fest</a>, will continue to be held. Steranka went on to explain that Scopely is very interested in examining why Pokemon Go remains popular, and wants to integrate some of the lessons from that into its own games.</p><p>For the immediate future, Steranka noted that he's currently planning the celebration of Pokemon Go's 10th anniversary, which will arrive in 2026.</p><p>"We've been planning on this for a long time, so I really want to make sure that next year is as big of a celebratory moment as possible for Pokemon Go," said Steranka. "And as you probably know, it's also the 30-year anniversary for Pokemon as a brand. So I think next year as a Pokemon fan, you are going to have just the best year of all time."</p><p>Fans won't have to wait that long for Pokemon's next game on Switch. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a> will arrive later this year, and Nintendo recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meet-the-three-starters-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/1100-6529758/" data-ref-id="1100-6529758">unveiled a few of its starter Pokemon</a>.</p>

            <p>Shipments for Analogue's upcoming console - known as the Analogue 3D - have been delayed.</p>
<p>The Analogue 3D looks like a pretty smart piece of kit, and one which allows users to play original N64 cartridges in 4K. Oh, hello nostalgia, my old friend!</p>
<p>Anyway, this console was originally available for interested patrons to preorder at the end of 2024, with a scheduled shipment window of Q1 2025. However, shipping has now been delayed, and moved to the balmy summer month of July. So, if analaysts are right, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-analysts-predict-400-price-and-biggest-console-launch-ever-in-june">month after the Nintendo Switch 2 may grace our shelves</a>.  </p>

<p>But, I digress. Back to the Analogue 3D. </p>
<p>"We are working hard to get your 3D order in hands asap and appreciate your patience," a <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/resource/3d-preorder-faq">notice on Analogue's website reads</a>. The console's maker said if you currently have an open preorder, then no action is required.</p>
<p>"As always, if you’d like to cancel your pre-order at any time, Analogue has always had a no questions asked, 100 percent refund policy for pre-orders," the website continues.</p>

<p>"Analogue 3D represents a milestone in video game preservation: it's not only the world's first reimagining of an N64 - but the world's first 100 percent-compatible recreation of an N64," the company shared on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/analogues-new-console-is-a-4k-n64-machine-that-uses-original-cartridges">the Analogue 3D's initial reveal last year</a>.</p>
<p>"No more incompatibilities found in software emulation like input lag, graphic/audio inaccuracies, timing/frame rate issues and more. For the first time, you can re-experience the N64 exactly as it was meant to be, without compromise."</p>
<p>I wonder if my <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask">Majora's Mask</a> cartridge still works...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is far from being the only entry in the series to offer multiple playable characters, but the differences between the characters have never been as big as they are in Shadows. Naoe and Yasuke are very different characters who excel at very different things, and their unique abilities determine how you should approach the many challenges the game offers.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250311183830_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In many ways, <strong>Naoe embodies the traditional Assassin's Creed series playstyle</strong>. Extremely agile, the shinobi from Iga is the fastest playable character, can climb on buildings and mountains with ease thanks to the grappling hook only she can use, and has every tool you may need to infiltrate enemy strongholds and remain in the shadows undetected, such as kunai for long range kills, and smoke bombs to conceal her presence. If it comes to a fight, Naoe can hold her own reasonably well but requires perfect play due to her low health, which makes her almost always a few steps away from death, especially at Expert difficulty.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the second Assassin's Creed Shadows protagonist, <strong>Yasuke</strong>, is extremely <strong>good in combat</strong>. Not only does he have tons of health that allow you to make some mistakes and still survive, but he also has a lot of great combat options with amazing weapon variety - three melee and two ranged options - and plenty of Adrenaline right from the get-go that makes it easier for him to use skills. By advancing on the dedicated skill tree of each weapon type, Yasuke can become a killing machine that can even fight multiple enemies at once with extreme ease, especially with a naginata equipped. All this combat power, however, comes at a cost. Yasuke is not only much slower than Naoe but is also far less agile, meaning that using parkour is almost always not an option for him. He is meant to face enemies head-on, fully embodying the direct combat playstyle that was much the focus in Asssassin's Creed Valhalla, although he can still be stealthy by taking enemies from afar with the bow.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250310180655_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>With the two Assassin's Creed Shadows main characters featuring very different playstyles, which of the two is the better character to play the vast majority of the time? <strong>The answer to this question depends on how you want to approach the game</strong>. Playing as Naoe will allow you to play the game as if it were any of the classic Assassin's Creed games which placed great emphasis on stealth gameplay and killing enemies undetected. The vast majority of main quest missions have been designed to allow you to take full advantage of Naoe's superior parkour, making a stealth approach extremely satisfying most of the time. At the same time, given Naoe's low health, you will be forced to play slowly to avoid making mistakes, getting discovered, and then forced into an all-out battle which Naoe may have trouble surviving. Yasuke, on the other hand, can literally barge into enemy strongholds from the front entrance, take on every enemy that confronts him, and easily survive the vast majority of fights. This approach is also the fastest to clear enemy camps and strongholds, which also means you will be able to get your hands on powerful Legendary equipment more quickly using him.</p>
<p>No matter who you choose,<strong> every quest in Assassin's Creed Shadows can be completed without too much trouble at the normal difficulty settings</strong>, so don't agonize too much over which character is the best to use. Get acquainted with both of them and pick the one you have the most fun with, with the knowledge that, at times, you will be forced to use the other in specific quests.</p>

            <p>Let's be honest, when it comes to The Sims, sometimes it is quite a lot of fun to kill off various members of your community, be it by letting them get devoured by a cowplant or the always classic pool ladder removal technique (although, you now also need walls to box those Sims in).</p>
<p>So, if you are like me - and don't pretend that you aren't - you will probably be wondering what methods there will be to kill off your characters in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">Inzoi</a>, the upcoming Sim-like from Krafton. And, the good news for us players who like to flex those Godly muscles, Inzoi has "16 different types of deaths" for players to discover.</p>

<p>"One of the biggest features of this game is death," game director Hyungjun 'Kjun' Kim said during an Inzoi livestream (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/in-good-news-for-sim-murdering-sickos-inzoi-has-16-different-types-of-deaths/">PC Gamer</a>), acknowledging that "life comes with death".</p>
<p>So, what of those deaths? "In Inzoi you could go to the bathroom and if you slip you might die. Or if you eat some old food you might have to go to the bathroom and, again, die," the director shared.</p>
<p>"And when you fix broken-down electronics you might get electrocuted, so you need to be careful. I made the chance really low, but actually electronics can very often break down. We have 16 different types of deaths."</p>
<p>Now, some of those deaths sound very similar to deaths in EA's The Sims series, but Inzoi will have one rather unique death -  "dying from the need for recognition".</p>
<p>Said Kjun: "In the modern world you find a lot of people feel fulfilled from being recognised by others and this death reflects that. For example, in Inzoi let's say I fought with someone and that rumor spread and came back to me. I could get a text message about it, or a friend of mine could tell me about the rumor and if the rumor is negative then my need for acknowledgement can go down.</p>
<p>"And if that drops too drastically then you might die from that."</p>
<p>Inzoi's characters can also get hit by cars, so be sure to practice some road safety when out and about. "I reiterate, we have a simulation and death and this type of thing is a part of the game," Kjun concluded.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft has launched the Xbox Adaptive Joystick, a companion controller that looks very similar to the Wii's Nunchuk accessory. 
</p>
<p>
Fans of Nintendo's retro console will spot the same shape as the Wii Nunchuk, with two trigger buttons on the back of the device and an analogue stick on top. Four face buttons are also included.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-expands-accessibility-range-with-new-xbox-adaptive-joystick">Xbox Adaptive Joystick was announced last year</a> as a further aid to accessibility, and plugs directly into any Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S console, Windows 11 PC, or the Xbox Adaptive Controller device.

<p>
For now, the controller is being <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/accessories/controllers/xbox-adaptive-joystick">sold via the Microsoft Store</a> for £25, or $30. 
</p>
<p>
"With more than 429 million players with disabilities worldwide, we know each player has unique needs and preferences for how they choose to play," Microsoft's chief accessibility officer Jenny Lay-Flurrie <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/03/18/microsoft-ability-summit-2025-accessibility-in-the-ai-era/">said in a Microsoft blog post</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"The Xbox Adaptive Joystick is a singular, wired controller primarily designed to meet the needs of players with limited mobility. Its versatility helps players seamlessly incorporate it into their existing gaming setups. Built with the Gaming and Disability community who inform the development of Xbox products from the beginning. The joystick joins our family of adaptive accessories including the mouse, pen, adaptive kit and Xbox Adaptive Controller."
</p>
<p>
Buttons can be remapped via the standard Xbox Accessories app. A range of 3D-printable thumbstick topper designs are also available via the Xbox Design lab, to allow users to customise their controller further to their needs.

            <p>
Forthcoming life sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inzoi">InZoi</a> - the plucky (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inzois-system-specs-make-me-want-to-see-this-handsome-sims-killer-running-on-a-pocket-calculator">genAI-ridden</a>) David to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s Goliath - will cost $40 at its early access launch, the developers have announced. What's more, "all updates and DLCs will be provided for free" until the game hits 1.0, according to translated commentary from game director Hyungjun Kim. 
</p>
<p>
This is being styled as a gift unto the gamers, and another way of tempting them from the clutches of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>, whose DLC packs commonly sell for full-game prices. The other way of looking at it is that of course early access "updates and DLC" should be free. The point of early access is that you're paying for an unfinished game with the expectation that it'll eventually be worth the money. Also, what's the difference between an update and a DLC? My my, Inzoi, what a can of worms you have opened.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The news arrives care of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/QkXfP9rwrm8">a global showcase</a> last night, which also breaks down the new life sim's early access development - it's launching on 28th March. We can expect four major updates this year, together with new outfits and furniture every three months. Here's an approximate rundown. 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Update 1, May</strong>
</p>
<p>
Mod kit (Maya, Blender)
</p>
<p>
Changes to weight, muscle adjustment
</p>
<p>
In-game cheat codes
</p>
<p>
Relationship improvements
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Build mode improvements &amp; new furniture
</p>
<p>
Create a Zoi improvements
</p>
<p>
Outfit updates
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update 2, August</strong>
</p>
<p>
Ghost play
</p>
<p>
Swimming &amp; pools
</p>
<p>
More resources for edit city
</p>
<p>
AI build mode
</p>
<p>
Freelancer jobs
</p>
<p>
Improvements to text messages &amp; skills
</p>
<p>
Parenting improvements
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update 3, October</strong>
</p>
<p>
Family time
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Mod updates
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update 4, December</strong>
</p>
<p>
Memory system
</p>
<p>
Move cities
</p>
<p>
Interaction responses based on traits
</p>
<p>
Build mode improvements and new furniture
</p>
<p>
Create a Zoi improvements
</p>
<p>
Mod updates
</p>
<p>
New outfits
</p>
<p>
Indoor temperature
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In terms of competing with The Sims, the key addition is probably that mod kit in May. InZoi will need a healthy community of tinkerers if it's to usurp the EA colossus (or perhaps just prosper alongside it - why do I insist on pitting them against each other? Why am I like this?)</p>
<p>I'm also quite interested in the ability to play a ghost - there are 16 ways a character can die in Inzoi, and if you have bad karma when you pop your clogs you'll linger on as a spectre, thwarting the birth of new Zois by, as far as I can tell, contributing to the neighbourhood population cap.
</p>
<p>
Returning to the point about the unfairness of charging for early access DLC - obviously, game development isn't that cut and dried. Perhaps a developer runs into unexpected costs that require them to slap a price tag on an early access update. Perhaps they decide they want to add a player-requested feature they haven't scoped for. Perhaps they really needed to charge more for the base early access game but didn't feel they could get away with it.</p>
<p>Still, I don't like the dilution of the early access concept here. In general, it feels increasingly like developers and publishers view early access as simply a variant of the live service game, with more purchaseables being added over time.
