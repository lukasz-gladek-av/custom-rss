<p>Early-bird price expires today</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Over the coming years, we're likely to see a bunch of alternatives to the Switch 2's Joy-Con, but NYXI's new Hyperion 3 looks like it might be a solid early contender.</p>
<p>Available for pre-order now via the <a href="https://nyxigame.com/products/nyxi-hyperion-3-wireless-joypad-for-switch-2">NYXI website</a>, you can currently take advantage of a 30% 'early-bird' discount, bringing the price down to <strong>£88</strong> for those in the UK. This is only valid for the remainder of the day, by which point the price will return to <strong>£125</strong>.</p>
<p>The Hyperion 3 looks to be a thoughtful evolution of its predecessor, boasting a more ergonomically-friendly design that's sure to be a bit more comfortable to grasp than Nintendo's own official offering. You've also got Hall-Effect sticks to reduce the risk of drift, micro-switch face buttons, gyro support, and wake-up support. Not bad at all.</p>
<p>Here's the official list of features from NYXI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Hall Effect Joystick (No Drift)<br>
- Micro-Switch D-Pad &amp; A/B/X/Y<br>
- Micro-Switch Trigger/Dual-stage Linear Trigger<br>
- 9-Axis Gyro on Switch<br>
- Pro Controller Mode/Handheld Mode<br>
- Wake-up &amp; Screenshot Feature<br>
- Adjustable Turbo &amp; Rumble Function</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naturally, we'll reserve full judgement until we're able to get our hands on the Hyperion 3, but on paper at least, yeah, this looks pretty neat. The regular price of £125 could be a bit of a sticking point for some, but if the features justify it, then this could be a go-to accessory for those who like to play both docked and handheld.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/were-truly-sorry-opus-prism-peak-slips-into-2026">a last-minute delay</a> towards the end of 2025, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/opus-prism-peak">OPUS: Prism Peak</a> — the spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/opus_echo_of_starsong_-_full_bloom_edition">Opus: Echo of Starsong</a> (a game we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/opus-echo-of-starsong-full-bloom-edition">absolutely adore</a>) — finally has a brand new release date for Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Coming out on <strong>26th March 2026</strong>, Opus: Prism Peak is a narrative puzzler where you play as a photographer who has stumbled into a strange realm. Accompanying him is a young girl who seems to understand this world you've ended up in, and the game focuses on your photography skills and the relationship between the two main characters.</p>
<p>The brand new trailer features a stunning theme song 'I Am Farewell Itself, I Am Life', composed by Kevin Penkin, the composer of anime such as <strong>Made in Abyss</strong>, <strong>The Apothecary Diaries</strong>, and <strong>Tower of God</strong>, as well as for the narrative video games <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/necrobarista_final_pour">Necrobarista</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/florence">Florence</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of what to expect from the game when it launches later this year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Highlights:</strong><br>
* Adventuring Together: The heart of the experience lies in the evolving relationship between the two protagonists as they navigate a landscape of spirits.<br>
* Photography as a Narrative Bridge: While exploring, use an old camera to uncover the world's mysteries. Photography is how you interact with the world and strengthen the connection between characters.<br>
* Grownup Regrets meets Shinkai Aesthetic: Experience a world that blends Makoto Shinkai’s vibrant visuals with the midlife disillusionment of Firewatch</p>
</blockquote>

			<p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> is one of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2026-martial-artists-spies-super-heroes-and-criminals/">most anticipated games</a></strong> launching on consoles this year. Following <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">two delays</a></strong>, the excitement surrounding the game has only increased, and many are getting ready to jump into this new rendition of<strong> Vice City</strong> with a physical copy of the game to complete their series collection.</p>



<p><span>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<strong>it seems like this won't be possible</strong>, at least not at laun</span>ch, in a move that is just as <strong>unprecedented</strong> as the game is set to be when it is released later this year.</p>



<p>In a new report shared today, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/397290/gta-6-a-wersja-pudelkowa-sprzedawcy-zwiastuja-smutna-wiadomosc-dla-fanow-fizycznych-wydan.html">Polish publication PPE</a></strong>, which has proven <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-playstation-5-november/"><strong>quite reliable over the past few months</strong></a>, revealed that the highly anticipated game will <strong>only be available digitally at launch.</strong></p>



<p><em>"This source, who handles physical video game sales in Europe, informed us that Grand Theft Auto 6 publisher Take-Two is currently not planning a physical edition of Lucia and Jason's story. At least not for release due to possible story or gameplay leaks,"</em> the report reads via an automated translation. The physical release will only arrive a few months later, but the source doesn't know if this will happen only a few weeks after launch or only in the first half of 2027.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"We're hearing more and more that the physical version won't be released simultaneously with the digital version to prevent leaks. We're getting conflicting reports: some say the physical version will arrive three to four weeks after the digital release, while others say it won't happen until early 2027,"</em> another source said. Thankfully, more information will reportedly be available in mid-February.</p>



<p>Needless to say, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>launching in digital format only is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">incredibly disappointing</strong>. However, considering how many highly anticipated games get into the hands of gamers <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ahead of the official release date</strong>, it's not surprising that Take-Two is willing to go so far to protect what is set to be t<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">he <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time</a></strong>, and possibly earn more by exclusively selling the game digitally at launch.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this decision, if final, will not <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">prevent the release of any Collector's Edition</strong> at launch, which could still include a voucher for the digital version of the game alongside whatever extra goodie is packed in. The value of such a proposition, however, would certainly be diminished by the <strong>lack of a physical copy of the game.</strong></p>



<p>Would a digital-only launch of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em> make you wait for the physical release, or would you still get the game when it launches on November 19? Let us know in the comments!</p>

Today I became aware of Bolt Action, a historical strategy sim based on the World War II tabletop miniatures game from Warlord Games (founded by erstwhile Games Workshop staffers John Stallard and Paul Sawyer). It sees you fretting over questions of morale, line-of-sight and cover, while leading US, British or German armies across maps that range from beaches to churchyards. There’s multiplayer, too. Trailer ho!

In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3856030/view/541128612120628420?l=english">a blogpost this week</a>, developers Frag Games simultaneously announce their desire to do right by the source material while making clear that they don’t want to just transplant it, Victoria Crosses and all.  “We’ve all seen ‘PC adaptations’ that strip the soul out of a tabletop game to make it ‘accessible,’" they sneer, like grown men disproving the existence of Santa Claus. “So our designers spent weeks in ‘boot camp’: reading rulebooks, painting minis, rolling dice, measuring distances with tape, and feeling the genuine panic of a FUBAR roll.
</p>
<p>
“We learned a lot, and we’re still learning,” it continues. “But the one thing we DID know from the beginning was that we didn’t want to build a digital version of Bolt Action.  Bolt Action already exists! Playing a table-top experience will always remain special. What we want is the best Turn-Based Tactics videogame built on the Bolt Action ruleset.”</p>
<p>There follows a breakdown of the “six tactical choices” that await you whenever you pick a unit: firing, advancing, running, ambushing (aka overwatch), rallying (aka getting rid of suppression “pins”), and going prone. 
</p>
<p>
Another section explores vehicles, which are proof against small arms and have a selection of armour facings. There’s a bit on how indirect fire works, with the accuracy of consecutive shots on a target improving each turn, and a bit on platoon experience levels, upgrades and customisation.
</p><p>
It looks like a tidy little wargame – no release date yet - but that’s not why I’ve written it up. “We’re building a game for the person with five unpainted armies sitting on their shelf, but also for the strategy fan who wants a WWII game with complex rules and deep gameplay,” the devs comment near the end of that blogpost.</p>
<p>The mention of unpainted armies fills my heart with decades-old guilt – alas, Teclis, Loremaster of Hoeth, I never did get round to finishing your cape – but also, <em>possibility</em>. Adaptations of tabletop miniatures games often come with elaborate livery editors, but now that I reflect, I’m not sure I’ve played one that lets you show up to the brawl with an unpainted force.
</p>
<p>
It’s been a while since I wielded a physical range ruler, but there is surely no better way to demonstrate your contempt for an opponent - and maybe, throw them off - than by rocking up with some High Elves you couldn’t be bothered to basecoat, let alone shade and layer. Imagine if Henry V came to Agincourt with no pants. How might the French have reacted? Clarification: I have not researched the Battle of Agincourt, so apologies if going commando was, in fact, a critical element of the English strategy. 
</p>
<p>
Less abrasively, I just think miniatures adaptations could do a better job of reflecting the fact that a lot of miniatures collectors aren’t great painters, however enthusiastic. There should be an editor function that recreates the effect of a spirited 10-year-old getting Warhammer for Xmas and trying to pimp out a whole Lizardman battalion in felt tip. I think this could be wholesome? Authentic, even?

Against the overbearing weight of modernity, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/old-school-runescape">Old School RuneScape</a> continues to complete a Sisyphean task of simply existing two and a half decades after it originally launched. It just celebrated that 25th anniversary at the start of the year in fact, and now during a Winter Summit a slew of updates coming to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> were shown off in a roadmap from developer Jagex.
</p>
<p>
Kicking things off on the roadmap is Deadman: Annihilation, a "high intensity, PvP everywhere" variation on its main PvP mode that'll run from January 30th through to February 21st. This one'll feature some new sigils and breaches, and you can earn points to pick up cosmetics. Following that, in April Leagues is returning with Leagues VI: Demonic Pacts, complete with bonus XP drops and loot boosts, alongside some reimagined combat masteries.

Sailing, the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/old-school-runescape-is-getting-its-first-new-skill-since-it-launched-and-so-the-xp-grind-begins-anew">first new skill since it changed from regular RuneScape to Old School RuneScape</a>, will be expanded upon sometime in 2026 too, namely new quests to do. Those of you that have been around for a long time will be interested to hear about the Blood Moon Rises update coming in the summer, a Grandmaster-tier quest that'll wrap up a story started all the way back in 2004. Jeepers creepers! Pull out the champagne for that questline. On top of all that, there's also The Fractured Archive, the game's first new raid in four years.
</p>
<p>
As always I'm just impressed this thing is trucking. It's the first online anything where I had an actual username (no I'm not telling you, some things are best kept as secrets), those types of internet histories are typically lost to time. Kudos!

            <p>A group of modders wearing the finest reverse-engineering goggles has managed to port birdly and beary platformer Banjo-Kazooie to PC, with a bunch of extra bells and whistles to make sure it won't make for a disappointing dip back into your childhood or adulthood. Their creation's dubbed Banjo: Recompiled, and it dropped over the weekend.</p>

<p>This recompiled version of the N64 classic, brought to life using <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp">N64: Recompiled</a>, is primarily the work of modder Wiseguy. It works on Windows, Linux, and Mac, provided you bring along the game files via a legally-sourced ROM of the North American 1.0 version.</p>
<p>If you do, you're in for a version of Banjo which offers a bunch of helpful features designed to ensure it's ideal to play on today's hardware, though it is also promised to run on more potato-shaped boxes. There's support for high framerates if you don't fancy leaving it at a solid 60, widescreen and ultrawide modes, and rapid loading times. A dual-analog camera steup, the ability to keep your notes if you die or exit a level, and support for playing on Steam Deck are also part of the puzzle.</p>
<p>Finally, there's built-in mod support in case you want to get Doom running in the jigsaw minigame. Or just download the likes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLzv0U3cFlo">Jiggies of Time</a> and or a revamped texture pack.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a project that looks well worth the wait of eons for Banjo to get a proper PC port, something Microsoft haven't yet deigned worth digging back into the nostalgia toybox to whip out.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving Banjo: Recompiled a go, you'll find it and its souce code on <a href="https://github.com/BanjoRecomp/BanjoRecomp/releases/tag/v1.0.0">GitHub</a>, where Wiseguy also notes they're planning on delivering ray tracing to it at some point down the line.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>If you’ve grown up with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>, you have no doubt dreamt of waking up in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe. That’s a pipe dream, but if you can make it to Tokyo, you can get a facsimile of this experience at PokéPark Kanto, a new theme park opening on February 5. In the months since The Pokémon Company announced the attraction, we’ve </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-pokemon-theme-parks-first-trailer-still-doesnt-explain-anything-2000642904"><span>mostly only seen mock-ups of what the park was going to look like</span></a><span>. Well, some Japanese press and content creators finally got to see the park ahead of its grand opening and have posted videos and photos, and y’all, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cph2QjATgeo"><span>I want to go to there</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The idea of PokéPark Kanto is that you’re essentially being transported to the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world, with statues, character actors, and photo ops all meant to immerse you in the setting. Think of it like one of the immersive experiences at Disney World, but instead of </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>characters, you’re rubbing shoulders with Pikachu and hundreds of other critters. There are several outdoor displays, but you’ll also find spots like a Pokémon Center and a professor’s lab.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite the name, there are Pokémon from several regions, not just the Kanto setting of the original games. You can find “scenes” of Pokémon battling and interacting in the wild while others like Chansey, who stands behind the desk at the Pokémon Center, act as helpers for the staff. There’s also a shop with exclusive merchandise, and you can probably expect some of those items to end up on reseller sites in the coming weeks.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202601/64249"><i><span>Famitsu</span></i></a><span> has a rundown of their experience at the park, and there’s a ton of photos of the different Pokémon on display, the different buildings and attractions you can visit, and&nbsp; the exclusive merchandise that you can buy at the shop.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Proposes 200 Job Cuts At Paris Headquarters]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-proposes-200-job-cuts/</link>
            <guid>1416454</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> is already looking at cutting jobs, just days after its announced company-wide restructuring.</p>



<p>According to a new report, Ubisoft is proposing cutting up to 200 jobs at its Paris headquarters. These jobs would be filed under a Rupture Conventionnelle Collective (RCC) that allows employees to come to a “mutual termination agreement.”</p>



<p>Ubisoft currently employees 1,100 people at its Paris office.</p>







<p><strong>“In line with last week’s announcements on its new operating model and the acceleration of cost-reduction initiatives, Ubisoft International has initiated discussions regarding a potential Rupture Conventionnelle Collective, a collective, voluntary mutual termination agreement that could involve up to 200 positions at its headquarters in France,”</strong>&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft spokesperson said to IGN</a> on the matter. </p>



<p>Ubisoft says that this remains just a proposal at this point. A final decision can’t come until an agreement is made between the company and employees. It then has to be “validated by French authorities”.</p>



<p><strong>“The proposal applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide,”</strong> Ubisoft said.</p>







<p>It’s unclear exactly how many jobs could be lost across the entire company over the next two years. Based on past history, it wouldn’t be surprising to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-human-cost-ubisofts-next-cost-cutting-measure-could-see-another-2000-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see another 2,000 or more people</a> lose their jobs during that time span. </p>



<p>On January 21, Ubisoft announced that it was going through a company-wide restructure. These plans called for the cancelation of six games, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>. It also saw the company split into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-operation-model-features-5-creative-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">five “creative houses”</a> that would oversee various Ubisoft franchises. </p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Autumn 2026 could be the definitive release window for Xbox and Playground Games' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fable-2024">Fable</a>, which last week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fable-finally-gets-a-release-window-following-xbox-developer-direct-will-launch-in-autumn-2026">confirmed</a> its journey to PS5 on top of Xbox Series X/S and PC. Years after its original announcement, it's had its ups and downs, but the powers that be appear to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-xbox-and-playground-making-the-right-move-sticking-so-closely-to-fables-history">a solid grasp on what they want to achieve with it</a>. Now, we also know it'd been a dream project for the developer for a while.</p>
<p>"The first conversations we had about doing something other than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> and building a second team go right the way back to the year after we shipped <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-3">Forza Horizon 3</a>," said Playground general manager Ralph Fulton during <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/why-playground-games-ambitious-open-world-fable-reboot-is-a-fresh-start-for-the-series-this-has-to-be-playgrounds-fable/">an interview for GamesRadar</a>. It was in 2016 that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-3-review">Forza Horizon 3</a> was released and cemented the open-world driving series as a modern behemoth.</p>
<p>"It was the best Forza Horizon we'd made. The team really hit its stride – the game was really high-quality, it landed with a wide audience. We felt great about that," Fulton added. Around that time, conversations started at the studio about building a second team which maybe could take on something different: "The conversation around building a second team and doing something else, doing something different, was really about wanting to challenge ourselves – to learn and grow as developers." As we all know, the Forza Horizon series has become essential to the studio, especially after Xbox bought it, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-shows-off-largest-ever-map-as-microsoft-confirms-a-may-release">its sixth entry</a> could help offset any possible disappointment with the Fable reboot.</p>
<p>Still, we're generally optimistic about the ambitious RPG, especially after the franchise was left for dead following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-acknowledges-missteps-in-its-handling-of-lionhead-studios">Lionhead Studios' closure in 2016</a>. A lot of what's made Forza Horizon special over the years seems to be on full display on Playground's Albion. Fulton admits the veteran devs "felt our transferable skills were, in a genre sense, open-world game design, open-world technology, and open-world streaming," which helped the studio narrow down what it could do outside of driving sandboxes.</p>

</figure>
<p>Fulton went on to explain how the technology had to be modified and optimized to fit an open-world RPG and how passionate the entire team is about Fable and its legacy. But funnily enough, he doesn't exactly remember who first brought the famous IP up as a real possibility: "I don't remember who mentioned [Fable], but as soon as I heard the word I was sold."</p><p>As underlined by the trailers released so far and the in-studio videos we've received over the past few years, Playground wants to make its own version of Fable instead of Fable 4 under a different, simpler name: "We're not Lionhead, we're a different studio with different people and a different culture. It would be inauthentic for us to try and just make Fable 4."</p>
<p>From the focus on sitcom-inspired comedy to leaning more on a fairytale-like aesthetic, it's safe to say this extremely British take on Fable has a voice of its own. The question now is whether it'll live up to most players' terribly high expectations after six years of teases and development hiccups.</p>

<p>February? Say it ain't so!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="861b0e4e49fc1"><a title="Nintendo Direct 9.12.2025 screenshot" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/861b0e4e49fc1/nintendo-direct-9-12-2025-screenshot.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>New year, new Nintendo Direct rumours — Nintendo usually likes to hold a big presentation every February, and it appears that it's continuing that trend in 2026, as a proper Nintendo Direct (not focused on the <strong>Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life</a>) could be coming as soon as next week.</p>
<p>This rumour comes from prominent podcaster and YouTuber Nate the Hate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwMQiG9bc4c">on his podcast</a> (via the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qnigei/natethehate_the_first_nintendo_direct_of_the_year/">GamingLeaksAndRumors subreddit</a>), who says he has heard from his sources that a Nintendo Direct will be airing "in the opening week of February", potentially <strong>Thursday 5th February</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, before you get too excited, Nate does stress that he hasn't been able to confirm this with his best sources, but given Nintendo's history, we'd be extremely surprised if we didn't get a Direct --either a big one or a Partner Showcase — sometime next month.</p>
<p>We will say as we always do with stories like this, take this with a pinch of salt. Nothing is official until Nintendo says anything, so for now, we can just speculate on <em>what</em> exactly Nintendo might bring to the table.</p>

<p>2025 was obviously an outlier in terms of February Directs as the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal came in January. 2024's big February showcase was actually a Partner Direct. Prior to last year, the Japanese gaming giant hasn't missed a February since 2018.</p>
<p>Of course, we're getting some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct-announced-for-thursday-29th-january">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream later this week</a> thanks to a specific Direct, but Nintendo has a busy slate for 2026. Y<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">oshi and the Mysterious Book</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a> are just some of the titles we know about.</p>
<p>We've also got indies such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a> awaiting brand new release dates after they were delayed out of 2026. Plus, there may well be a bunch of third-party port announcements for Switch 2 on the horizon. We'll see!</p>

 <p>Ever since <em>Shadows</em> dared include an African samurai as one of its two protagonists, it’s been the target of anti-woke attacks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007">including from Elon Musk</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007"><span>(who was later ratio’d by whoever runs the official </span></a><a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1904648274675445938?s=20"><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007"><span> X account)</span></a><span>.</span>&nbsp;Some of those same people have now been saying the company’s financial fallout vindicates their attacks on diversity and inclusion in gaming.</p> <p><span>Shimoda, who worked for the publisher from 2021 to 2024, stated “unequivocally” that Ubisoft’s DEI initiatives “didn’t wield that much influence” and were, in fact, “actually beneficial” in helping them expand in South America and the Middle Eastern territories.</span></p>

 <p><span>His comments regarding Ubisoft’s “excessively low turnover rate” and “lack of senior/lead-level staff with experience” imply that Shimoda lays the blame squarely at the feet of the publisher’s upper management, especially when paired with his “Big Business Syndrome” remark.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.omron.com/global/en/about/corporate/history/founder/06/"><span>Big Business Syndrome</span></a><span> is a term coined by Kazuma Tateisi, former president of Japanese electronic manufacturer OMRON, in 1987. In short, Tateisi believed that the profits of several prominent Japanese companies in the 80s began to fall once their leaders became too obsessed with maintaining the status quo. When stepping down as president in 1987, Tateisi warned OMRON employees that refusing to pursue the same riskier strategies that led to their initial success, yet continuing to expand in the process, would lead to them suffering the same fate as their contemporaries.</span></p> <p><span>Shimoda is arguing that Ubisoft has become a victim of the same mentality. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"><span>On January 21</span></a><span>, the publisher announced a painful shakeup that included the cancellation of “4 unannounced titles, including 3 new IP’s” and the formation of “Five Creative Houses” that will solely focus on developing games for their pre-existing IPs. But some current employees feel like this latest reset is just history repeating itself.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-trailer-leak-reveals-solos-squads/</link>
            <guid>1416388</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Headwinds, the first major ARC Raiders update of 2026, is set to drop tomorrow. It’ll introduce a new matchmaking option, a fresh player project, some hot new cosmetics, <strong>and </strong>probably a few new quests. Earlier today, the trailer for that update was ‘leaked’ early, with a Japanese Embark Studios social profile posting the short video ahead of whatever the intended drop time was.</p>



<p>The trailer was taken down, but not before users managed to capture the footage and circulate it on social media. Above all else, it reveals that a bizarre new ‘solos vs squads’ matchmaking option is coming into effect with Headwinds.</p>







<h2 id="h-headwinds-will-be-here-in-24-hours">Headwinds Will Be Here in 24 Hours</h2>



<p>Headwinds is an all-new update coming to ARC Raiders tomorrow. Embark Studios’ extraction adventure title suffered a little over the festive break with stagnation and some issues with cheaters and exploits, but now it’s all systems go. The team recently published a roadmap that covers four months of content, including tomorrow’s Headwinds update.</p>



<p>We’re not getting a new ARC Raiders map or large-scale enemy until <strong>April</strong>, but there’s still plenty on the way.</p>



<p>Per the ‘leaked’ trailer, we know that Headwinds is set to include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Solos vs Squads matchmaking mechanics</li>



<li>New map condition – Bird City</li>



<li>Project: ARC Trophy Display</li>



<li>New cosmetics: The Sandwalker set</li>
</ul>



<p>The first item on the list was previously known as the ‘LVL 40+ Matchmaking Option’, which left players wondering what that might look like. Nobody predicted it would be a solos vs squads mode, but it’s certainly a place for the most capable players to strut their stuff.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, we can imagine that Sandstorm will be an offensive map condition that forces players indoors, much like Cold Snap did, while the Sandwalker set will be themed very much <strong>on </strong>that condition.</p>



<p>The ARC Trophy Display project will give players something to aim for over the next few weeks. It’s likely a construct that pops up in your Raider Den that gives you the option to display literal trophies from the ARC enemies you slay outside Speranza.</p>







<p>What are you looking forward to most from the ARC Raiders Headwinds update? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>In the description of the teaser we can see the following game-specific showcases:</p>
<ul>
<li>World of Warcraft: 29th January 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5pm GMT / 6pm CEST</li>
<li>Overwatch: 4th February 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm GMT / 7pm CEST</li>
<li>Hearthstone: 9th February 9:30am PT / 12:30pm ET / 5:30pm GMT / 6:30pm CEST</li>
<li>Diablo: 11th February 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm GMT / 11pm CEST</li>
</ul>
<p>What's interesting is the teaser itself ends with a selection of logos placed under the words' Blizzard 35', including games not included in that list. This includes the logos of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/heroes-of-the-storm">Heroes of the Storm</a>, and Starcraft.</p>
<p>Starcraft itself is an interested absence from the list of showcase days, especially given the recent reports of <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crazy-blizzard-stories-with-jason-schreier-unlocked-661">an in-development Starcraft shooter</a>. However, how far through development this project is, or if it's even made it past the R&amp;D stage, has yet to be confirmed.</p><p>It's certainly a big year for Blizzard in terms of releases and major updates. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-expansion-midnight-release-date">World of Warcraft is getting its Midnight expansion soon</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> Lord of Hatred update. But who knows? Maybe even bigger surprises are around the corner. World of Warcraft: Classic fans have been begging for an expanded version of the original MMO, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/did-blizzard-just-drop-another-hint-for-classic-379737">which is an idea the developers haven't crossed out</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The video game industry is still reeling from last week, after <strong>Ubisoft</strong> announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">it would undergo a <strong>"<em>major reset,"</em></strong></a> which saw the entire company get restructured into five new 'Creative Houses.' The reset created <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft-1-3-million/">new leadership roles </a>that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tells-the-division-players-dont-worry-series-producer-julian-gerighty-leaves-for-battlefield/">pushed out Ubisoft veterans</a>, cancelled six projects (including the <strong>Sands of Time Remake</strong>), delayed seven more projects, and created four new ones - while also looking <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">to more layoffs and a return-to-office mandate</a> to try and help execute this plan.</p>



<p>Not only did this reset see the company's share price drop to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">its lowest point since <strong>2011 </strong>and mark a <strong>95% loss of total value</strong> <strong>in the last eight years</strong></a>, but it also sent employee morale to new lows and anger to new heights. French publication <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2026/01/23/how-ubisoft-the-french-video-game-giant-reached-breaking-point-after-years-of-turmoil_6749735_13.html">Le Monde</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/anger-and-despair-reigning-supreme-at-ubisoft-following-restructuring-plan-says-union">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>) reports that the French video games industry union <strong>Solidaires Informatique</strong> has already organized <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/solinfonat.bsky.social/post/3mcxfxwczwk2z">a strike that took place this past Thursday, January 22, 2026,</a> outside of <strong>Ubisoft Paris</strong> as an "<em>initial answer to the absurdity of management's decisions.</em>"</p>



<p>According to Le Monde, the protest was attended by ten people, which directly called out Ubisoft's chief executive officer, <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong><em>, </em>with the union bringing three core demands to this initial demonstration. An end to the cost-cutting program, maintaining and extending remote work policies, and "<em>decent pay raises</em>." In a quote given to GI.Biz from Solidaires Informatique union representative at Ubisoft Paris, <strong>Marc Rutschlé</strong>, he describes the internal state of Ubisoft as one where "<em><strong>anger and despair</strong></em><strong>"</strong> are <strong>"</strong><em><strong>reigning supreme</strong></em><strong>."</strong></p>



<p>"<em>At this state, it seems clear to us that Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees</em>," said Rutschlé. "<em>The company is continuing its cost reduction and layoff plan. Our teams are already working under pressure, often understaffed. After several years without pay rises (or very small increases), we understand that once again, employees will not receive a raise this year. At the same time, the reorganization is creating a number of high-level positions with excessive salaries</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>From our union's point of view, this forced reversal is a disguised redundancy plan, aimed at pushing employees outside the company. The atmosphere within the studio is particularly deplorable, with anger and despair reigning supreme. Staff representatives have witnessed several breakdowns in tears; some colleagues have made suicidal comments. If Guillemot wanted to make people miserable, he couldn't have done better</em>."</p>



<p>In addition to this report, <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/2014743495135596775">Insider-Gaming</a> adds that the internal communication channels in Ubisoft are "<em>full of employees shaming upper management and asking for change.</em>" Some have even <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brucelowmtl_a-quick-update-and-some-clarification-the-activity-7420215251842797568-NxZW?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">taken to LinkedIn to make it publicly clear they are looking for other opportunities</a>, despite not having been laid off.</p>



<p>It's unclear how Ubisoft will weather this storm, or if it can weather it at all. Losing 95% of your company's total value in eight years is a pretty damning mark on the company's leadership, <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-and-ubisoft-respond-to-allegations-of-mistreament-and-misconduct/">not to mention the allegations of misconduct at Ubisoft</a> that reportedly went unchecked by leadership, and the countless layoffs that have taken place in that time.</p>



<p>If something doesn't change within the company's leadership, the global publisher and developer that we've known for over two decades might not make it another eight years.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[I Have A Resident Evil Requiem Theory, And I Hope I’m Wrong]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-leon-infection-dead-dies-theory-2000663084</link>
            <guid>1416331</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-preview-leon-gameplay-grace-2000662270">played about three hours of </a></span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-preview-leon-gameplay-grace-2000662270">Resident Evil Requiem</a> </span></i><span>earlier this month, and I could not shake the feeling that I know where the rest of the game is going to go when it launches next month. Though I have not seen enough of the ninth entry in Capcom’s long-running horror series to be sure, I’ve got a theory, and it’s one that some fans have independently come to as well after combing through the trailers. There’s nothing in the time I played that outright confirms this is the way things are going to go, but there are clues that I’ve started latching onto. If you don’t want your experience of </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span> to be influenced even by speculation about where the story </span><i><span>might </span></i><span>go, turn back now.</span></p>  <p><span>I think Leon Scott Kennedy, one of </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span>’s long-time protagonists, is going to be dead by the end of </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>. Now, I know what you’re thinking. “Capcom would never kill one of </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span>’s recurring leads.” And yeah, we are in uncharted territory. Take my hand and follow me down this dark passageway toward the worst-case scenario.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In my time playing </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>, I learned something that astute fans have already picked up on: Leon has </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ResidentEvilCapcom/comments/1pmsq1z/leon_is_100_infected_in_this_game_leon_in_this/"><span>some kind of deadly infection</span></a><span>. He’s looking for a cure, which is why he ends up in the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center where his </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span> co-lead Grace Ashcroft has been taken. The infection manifests in a gnarly wound on his neck, but whatever’s going on, he still has time before he turns. How much time? That’s unclear right now. But that infection is only half the reason I think Leon is going to be pushing daisies by the end of </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The game’s name, </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>, has a few different meanings, both in and out of the context of the game. A requiem, </span><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/requiem"><span>as the dictionary describes it</span></a><span>, is a “mass for the dead,” or some kind of musical tribute to the dead. Yes, this could be in reference to Grace’s mother Alyssa Ashcroft, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-grace-trailer-gamescom-mother-2000618547"><span>whose death is an inciting incident</span></a><span> in the story, but it also has a very specific meaning attached to it that links Leon and Grace. Early on in the section I played, Leon and Grace meet, and the ex-Raccoon City cop gives Grace a powerful revolver named Requiem. Though I only had one bullet for it in Grace’s resource-scarce segment, it did blow a hole right through a zombie’s head, so thank you, Leon, for saving my ass with your gift of foresight. However, this moment could also be seen as a literal passing of the torch (or gun) to a new generation of </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>heroes, and that’s something Capcom has been pretty upfront about in its marketing.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two generations of survival. Grace Ashcroft and Leon S. Kennedy face unimaginable terrors in Resident Evil Requiem.</p> <p>🌿<a href="https://t.co/JBHl3u25qT">https://t.co/JBHl3u25qT</a> <a href="https://t.co/NrcAVXDNTf">pic.twitter.com/NrcAVXDNTf</a></p> <p>— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1999317087034950074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Grace’s playstyle is defined by her inexperience. A gun that wrecks shop in Leon’s hand barely harms a zombie when Grace is using it. This is her origin story, and while she and Leon might be separated for large parts of the game, she has his gun, whose name literally means a tribute to the dead, on her at all times. From a thematic standpoint, Leon entrusts something to her, and parts from her fully realizing he may never see her or the revolver again. I would not be surprised if </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>ended with Leon doing something to save Grace, ensuring she gets out of this whole outbreak alive and earning himself a big goddamn hero’s sacrifice, knowing that he was on borrowed time anyway. Grace escapes, but still has the Requiem revolver in hand, and uses it as a tribute to her fallen comrade in future cases. See? It all comes full circle.</span></p>

 <p><span>That’s all speculation, but if </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>is really meant to be a generational shift for </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span>, it would make a lot of sense for Capcom to sell that in the most definitive way possible. But hey, characters like Leon, Chris, and Jill have gotten through worse, so I also wouldn’t be surprised if he manages to squeeze his way out of this problem, too. We’ll find out for sure when </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem </span></i><span>launches on February 27.</span></p>

<p>The first full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a> Direct of the year could be coming next week.</p>



<p>In his latest video on Monday, known insider NateTheHate spoke about when Nintendo fans should expect the first full Nintendo Direct showcase. </p>







<p><strong>“From what I have been told, the first Direct of 2026 will be held during the opening week of February,”</strong> he said. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwMQiG9bc4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">He then said</a> that the expectation is that the show will take place on Thursday, February 5.</p>



<p>While he mentions next week as being the time, NateTheHate did leave it a bit open. He said that that he had yet to confirm the information with his “best contacts just yet”. Should he have to give an update or amend anything, he says, he’ll do it on social media when he can. </p>







<p>He added that he didn’t know the type of Nintendo Direct it would be, nor did he mention any possible games. </p>



<p><strong>“While I hope it will be a general direct so Nintendo can really start the year with strong momentum—begin to detail some of those brand new first party games coming out in 2026, let us know what they have planned for The Legend of Zelda’s 40th anniversary—it could just as easily be a partner showcase,”</strong> he said.</p>



<p>As with all rumors, please take this information on the Nintendo Direct with a grain of salt until it’s been independently verified by Insider Gaming or confirmed by Nintendo.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Nintendo isn’t leaving fans waiting too long for some news regarding its games. The company announced on Monday that it was holding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomodachi-life-nintendo-direct-arriving-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomodachi Life-specific Direct</a> on January 29.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is YAPYAP on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-playstation-xbox-nintendo-all-platforms/</link>
            <guid>1416319</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re starting to get into the meat of 2026, and everyone is looking forward to seeing what games appear out of nowhere to suddenly steal hearts (and player counts from other games). YAPYAP could be that, and if you’re a console player desperate to play it, let’s check its PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo status for you.</p>



<p>Everything about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-official-release-date-countdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YAPYAP</a> screams success. One thing to shout home about is that it’s coming to Steam and PC, that’s almost a given. If you’re looking for clarification about its console platforms, then come quietly.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-yapyap-on-ps5-consoles">Can You Play YAPYAP On PS5 Consoles?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It could appear, as if by magic. Credit to Maison Bap</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>YAPYAP is not on the agenda for PlayStation 5 owners, nor any PS4 players who haven’t upgraded yet.</strong></p>



<p>It appears as if YAPYAP is staying the course on PC for now. The game can be purchased through Steam—more details about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-cost-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YAPYAP’s price here</a>—and there will be no yelling down PS5 microphones for the time being.</p>



<p>As with all Steam games, if there’s a strong demand, it could come to PS5. It also depends on the developer and publisher, too. You only have to look at Content Warning as the perfect subject here.</p>



<p>Whereas games like Lethal Company and REPO—which are arguably more popular—have opted against a console release for the time being, Landfall is bringing Content Warning to console. It’s another of the recent ‘Friendslop’ trend, and should be a hit party game on console.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-yapyap-on-xbox-series-x-s-consoles">Can You Play YAPYAP On Xbox Series X|S Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>There will be no Xbox Series X|S console launch for YAPYAP either.</strong></p>



<p>The Xbox and PC link has been a popular one for many years. However, there’s still an element of separation where certain game releases are concerned, in this case, low-budget indie Steam titles.</p>



<p>YAPYAP has plenty of appeal and could be perfect for Xbox owners. If you want to play it with your friends and use knock-off Wingardium Leviosa spells to annoy them, you need a PC and Steam.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-yapyap-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2-consoles">Can You Play YAPYAP On Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 Consoles?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>All quiet on this front. Credit to Maison Bap</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Nintendo consoles commonly get a lot of low-key indie titles and third-party releases, but you won’t find YAPYAP on either the Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 anytime soon.</strong></p>



<p>The Switch 2’s stunning 4K, HDR, 120 FPS screen and setup won’t have you flying around YAPYAP. It’s a full-scale Steam release for YAPYAP, and there have been no messages or signals of intent to bring it to consoles yet.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for further updates, and keep checking back in case it does get a console port down the line.</p>







<p>Have you not been able to shut your traptrap about YAPYAP? It does look fun. Whether you played the demo or like the look of it, discuss YAPYAP via the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>
