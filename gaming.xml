            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-invincible-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher 11 bit Studios and developer Starward Industries have announced that&nbsp;<em>The Invincible&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed a major (but rather odd) milestone.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/731040/view/4404040636376861069" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a new post on the game's Steam page</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Invincible&nbsp;</em>has crossed the curiously specific sales milestone of 123,000 copies since its release in November last year. Why 123,000? Perhaps there's some kind of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/invincible-revealed-as-new-sci-fi-game-from-ex-witcher-devs">scientific significance</a> I'm missing.</p>
<p>In the post, Starward Industries thanks&nbsp;<em>The Invincible&nbsp;</em>players for helping it to reach this rather impressive sales figure, telling fans that there "really is nothing more simple and profound at the same time as 'thank you'".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-invincible-sales-arti.jpg?itok=umVFtbj5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-invincible-sales-arti.jpg?itok=ezSQw1wJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Invincible</em>'s thought-provoking sci-fi has proven a hit.</figcaption></figure><p>Starward Industries also says that it's planning further improvements for&nbsp;<em>The Invincible&nbsp;</em>in the future, as well as working on a "new, exciting project", about which it discloses absolutely nothing. Sorry, Starward fans.</p>
<p><em>The Invincible&nbsp;</em>was originally unveiled in 2020 and was set for a 2021 release, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/retro-sci-fi-game-invincible-release-date-set-for-2022">pushed back to 2022</a>, eventually arriving across PC and consoles <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-amd-partnership">in November last year</a>.</p>
<p>The game is an adaptation of Polish author&nbsp;Stanisław Lem's 1964 novel of the same name, arguably one of the most influential Polish-language science-fiction novels ever written.</p>
<p>You take the role of Yasna, a scientist who has landed on the unexplored planet of Regis III and who must quickly reckon with the loss of her crew and the danger posed by her newfound environment.</p>

<p>Being a narrative adventure, <i>The Invincible&nbsp;</i>isn't the kind of game you'd pick up if you wanted high-octane thrills, but if you're looking for a thought-provoking science fiction story with an "atompunk" setting (that's Starward's word), then you'll likely want to give this one a look.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Invincible&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/731040/The_Invincible/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002666" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-invincible/9N19RM08QL3K" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24195175/zenless-zone-zero-impressions-genshin-impact-mihoyo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve given up on trying to understand <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/13/23070689/zenless-zone-zero-trailer-rpg-beta-pc-ios"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>. In every other cutscene, I’m bombarded with in-game jargon about inter-knots, proxies, hollows, and w-engines that I just cannot keep straight. Meanwhile, my patience withers to dust as my eyes flit about the screen trying to make sense of the literal deluge of resources — dennies, polychromes, investigator logs, master tapes, and so, <em>so </em>much more — the game requires you to accumulate in order to progress. It is so overwhelming that the only time I feel a sense of peace is during the breakneck combat sequences filled with their own complicated waltz of combos, parries, and special attacks. It’s just too bad that those moments are few and far between.</p><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is the latest game from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22777194/genshin-impact-fanfiction-merchandise-rules-creators"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/24/23695826/honkai-star-rail-release-date-trailer-pre-install"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a> developer HoYoverse (previously known as MiHoYo). It combines action RPG combat with gacha game mechanics (<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/gacha">gacha</a> referring to the type of game where characters and resources are doled out randomly via loot boxes and other kinds of microtransactions). The game takes place in a futuristic urban setting where you play as a Proxy who controls a bangboo to guide your team of operators through a hollow to complete commissions taken from the inter-knot. And though this seems like a string of incomprehensible garbage, this is actually the easiest part of the game to understand.</p><p>Commissions work like daily quests and are categorized as to whether they’re story, combat, or exploration missions. No matter what type of mission it is, though, it seems like they all follow the same basic structure. First is the exploration part. The screen turns into a giant wall of TVs that you move your little rabbit avatar (called a bangboo... seriously) across to reach the goal. It looks kinda like a board game, with each TV representing some kind of event. Some TVs will have resources to pick up, while others hide combat encounters. If you run into a combat TV, the game changes, dropping your party into an arena with a bunch of monsters to fight.</p><div><figcaption><em>An example of </em>Zenless Zone Zero<em>’s exploration minigame.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Hoyoverse</cite></p></div><p>Usually, the <a href="https://youtu.be/GE_KeYdxG2A?si=VwCdy2HoUnOdktG-">highly polished, action-filled trailers</a> of most free-to-play games conceal actual gameplay <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%2Fshorts%2FBScFjetm_B0%3Fsi%3DM9jynaNI6YusdZpq">that’s either nothing like the trailer</a> or nothing more than a mindless clickfest. So, I was not prepared for how engaging <em>ZZZ</em>’s combat really is. It’s fast and fluid, with a bunch of different actions you can string together to execute slick-as-hell combos. Add to that the ability to switch to any one of your party members mid-combo, and it makes for an experience that could stand next to any blockbuster action RPG game. It’s a hoot landing a dodge just right to chain together devastating attacks from each party member again and again. Pure gas.</p><p>But for some reason, the game is determined to keep that gas away from me as much as possible. There are so many other elements to the game that interfere with what’s most fun. While I appreciate that you can visit a noodle shop where the food buffs your party and that there’s an arcade with little minigames you can play with your party, it all feels like too much fluff. All I want to do is lead my little bangboo around collecting items and fight monsters with my party members, and all the game<em> </em>wants me to do is run a Blockbuster — really. </p><p>Why am I running a Blockbuster? I have no idea, and I’ve given up trying to figure it out. The game’s insistence on throwing so much at you upfront and its inability to explain anything coherently are so bad that I don’t even know how the gacha mechanics work. </p><p>Each combat mission comes with information like the type of enemies you’ll face and their weaknesses, while your party members have their own unique abilities and affinities. The appeal, then, is to acquire as many different operators to mix and match your party so you’ll have the right tool for each job. There are scores of interestingly designed characters — like the superhot wolfman with ice powers and an exquisitely tailored waistcoat — that I don’t know how to acquire because I’m still busy fussing with what movies to rent out at my Blockbuster. </p><p>Maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe HoYoverse is trying to curtail <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/10/06/genshin-impact-gambling/">the criticisms a lot of gacha games get</a> for being naked cash grabs by obscuring the function of its microtransactions to all but the most motivated of spenders. I can see the shop, but where I’m at in the way-too-long tutorial, I don’t have the faintest idea of how to use it.</p><p>I recognize that as video game trends evolve while I get older, there will be some games that I’ll never be able to comprehend. Despite my best intentions and as open a mind as I could muster, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is that game. And if I don’t get that wolfman soon, I’m content to leave the game for the people who get it.</p><p><small><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now on Android, iOS, PC, and PlayStation.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Gaming hardware makers have often walked the line between enabling a player’s true skills, and simply delivering them an unfair advantage. Sometimes, honest accessibility aids are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/they-dont-care-inside-the-triumphs-and-failures-of-accessible-gaming-hardware">falsely accused of being cheating tools</a>; other times, a monitor will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-worst-and-weirdest-gaming-tech-of-ces-2024">straight-up play League of Legends for you</a>. This week, developments in gaming keyboards have sparked a new debate on what does and doesn’t fall within the scope of fair play, with mechanical keeb specialists Wooting <a href="https://x.com/WootingKB/status/1811425339697996247">declaring in no uncertain terms</a> that "Rappy Snappy is not the same as Snap Tap." Cool, glad that’s cleared up.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you’re convinced that only about half that sentence is comprised of real words... you’re right, but bear with me. A while back, Wooting announced the <a href="https://wooting.io/wooting-80he">80HE</a>, a superfast <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-hall-effect-keyboards">Hall Effect keyboard</a> that would introduce their new Rappy Snappy feature. This tracks two keys of your choosing and allows one of them to activate even when the other is already being partially pressed – unlike how most keyboards only track one input at a time. In theory, this enables faster side-to-side strafing in pacey <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS games</a> like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/counter-strike-2-best-settings">Counter-Strike 2</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a>, as you don't have to fully lift your finger off one directional key before you can start moving in the opposite direction. Unlike your hapless, technologically inferior opponent, who'll likely be full of holes before they can sort their mutually exclusive feet.</p>

<figcaption>Here's a more visual explanation of Rappy Snappy, beginning about 1:24 in.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz9pTOLbeos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 80HE is due to launch this September, but Razer – the dark green Goliath to Wooting’s presumably normal skin-coloured David – have pipped it to the post, releasing a firmware update to their existing <a href="https://www.razer.com/gb-en/pc/gaming-keyboards/huntsman-line">Huntsman V3 Pro</a> keyboards that adds a similar feature called Snap Tap. Like Rappy Snappy – which it turns out is really hard not to type as Snappy Tappy – Snap Tap allows for the same rapid strafing by letting you hold down one directional key and quickly hammer the opposite key for optimal sideways dodging.</p>
<p>Far from ushering in a new era of meritocratic manshooting, however, the near-simultaneous arrival of these duelling keyboard technologies has instead fuelled concern that such SnappyTapRapRapBabap systems are tantamount to cheating, with detractors citing similarities to similar-performing scripts that exist for games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> and CS2 progenitor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-global-offensive">CS:GO</a>. Scripts, as a concept, tend to occupy that grey area between 'Using the advantages available' and 'Being a cheating toe-rag', but I suspect most online shootists would agree that deploying them is not considered particularly good form.</p>
<p>Wooting elected to go on the defensive, <a href="https://x.com/WootingKB/status/1811425339697996247">tXeeting a series of tXeets</a> that explained how Rappy Snappy is functionally distinct from Razer’s Snap Tap – and therefore not as much of a competitive no-no as it might appear. In short, Wooting argue that Rappy Snappy only registers the input of whichever key is pressed in deeper; this still allows for faster transitions, because one key doesn’t need to be fully released before the next input can take place, but its effective usage still requires the player to put more force into just one key at a time. Snap Tap, on the other hand, merely registers the most recent input, meaning a player could (for example) fully hold down the D key with one finger and just mash the A key to strafe.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Razer-Huntsman-V3-Pro-series.JPG?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Razer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In other words, Razer’s system is more comprehensively flouting the comp-shooter rule of only one input being allowed at a time, whereas Wooting’s is... just fudging it a bit, I suppose? It’s still removing the need for a key to fully spring back before the initial input is considered complete, but it does sound like you’d still be manually and rapidly pressing <em>both</em> keys, as you would on a bog-standard keyboard. Snap Tap, by allowing for one key to be held down yet still register multiple inputs, probably does come closer to self-playing territory.</p>
<p>Either way, those looking to claim the supposed advantages of these systems may want to wait and see how they fare with anti-cheat systems. Valve don’t seem to be doling out VAC bans for those using Snap Tap in CS2, but different games will have different rules on hardware that could be considered assistive. And not just shooters, either: rhythm game and minor internet sensation Osu! <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Reporting_bad_behaviour/Handling_foul_play#is-using-specialized-hardware-considered-as-cheating?">enforces a ban</a> on "anything that decreases the skill required to play", a rule of which these input-boosting tools could very feasibly fall foul.</p>

<p>Starfy isn't a particularly familiar franchise to America players. They have received four games – three for Game Boy Advance, one for DS – but only the 2009 DS game ever released in America. Today, the original three Game Boy Advance games are now available for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. The games retain their original title, Densetsu no Stafy, and have not been localized. The gameplay has been describe as Kirby-esque, but I have never been able to confirm that myself until today.</p>

<p>If you’re waiting to get your hands on a new AMD Ryzen 9000 CPU for your next PC upgrade, it doesn’t appear to be much longer. While an official release date hasn’t been set for the latest CPUs from AMD — the only window given was July 2024 –, the Ryzen 9000 series has made its way to retailers ahead of the expected launch.</p>



<p>Reddit user ElectricalEmployer22 took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e193o8/just_got_them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCMasterRace subreddit</a> to share a quick snapshot of the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X in stock at his retailer. They didn’t share anything else about the CPUs, but seeing them in a retail store tells people that the release is coming.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The new flagship CPU lineup from AMD moves to Zen5 architecture, replacing the Zen4 architecture that launched in 2022. When they launch, there will be four new CPUs from AMD. There are two new Ryzen 9 chips (9950X and 9900X), one Ryzen 7 9700X, and the Ryzen 5 9600X.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>AMD CPU Model</strong></td><td><strong>Cores /</strong><br><strong>Threads</strong></td><td><strong>Boost&nbsp;/ Base</strong><br><strong>Frequency</strong></td><td><strong>Total Cache</strong></td><td><strong>PCIe</strong></td><td><strong>TDP</strong></td></tr><tr><td>AMD Ryzen™ 9 9950X</td><td>16 / 32</td><td>Up to 5.7 GHz /<br>4.3 GHz</td><td>80MB</td><td>Gen 5</td><td>170W</td></tr><tr><td>AMD Ryzen™ 9 9900X</td><td>12 / 24</td><td>Up to 5.6 GHz /<br>4.4 GHz</td><td>76MB</td><td>Gen 5</td><td>120W</td></tr><tr><td>AMD Ryzen™ 7 9700X</td><td>8 / 16</td><td>Up to 5.5 GHz /<br>3.8 GHz</td><td>40MB</td><td>Gen 5</td><td>65W</td></tr><tr><td>AMD Ryzen™ 5 9600X</td><td>6 / 12</td><td>Up to 5.4 GHz /<br>3.9 GHz</td><td>38MB</td><td>Gen 5</td><td>65W</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>These new CPUs will feature the AM5 socket and work with two new chipsets, X870E and X870. These new chipsets feature 44 PCIe lanes and “direct-to-processor PCIe 5.0 NVMe connectivity”.</p>



<p>As said, no official on-sale date has been announced. However, the latest rumors are that July 31 will be the date.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gaming-business-roundup-july-12th</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-week-in-gaming-business-nintendo-secrecy-and-ea-naughtiness.925854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gaming-business-roundup-july-12th<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We've got another gaming business roundup for you, and this week has seen some pretty big companies embroiled in (admittedly fairly minor) controversies, as well as a new indie startup, the listing of a major Korean developer on the stock market, and more.</p>
<p>Here's what's been happening on the business side of the industry in the past week!</p>
<hr><h2>EA gets a wrist slap for failing to disclose loot boxes</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-golf-clash-business-roundup.jpg?itok=0QjZLJhm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-golf-clash-business-roundup.jpg?itok=l02OGbCr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Golf Clash&nbsp;</em>has landed EA in a bunker of trouble this week.</figcaption></figure><p>This week, the UK Advertising Standards Authority gave EA a slap on the wrist for failing to adequately disclose loot boxes in an ad for the mobile game&nbsp;<em>Golf Clash</em>.</p>
<p>The ASA's <a href="https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/electronic-arts-ltd-a24-1239057-electronic-arts-ltd.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ruling</a> proclaims that the text declaring loot boxes in the&nbsp;<em>Golf Clash</em> ad in question&nbsp;isn't sufficiently visible, as it's too small and appears for too brief a time for consumers to understand what it's trying to tell them. Better luck next time, EA.</p>
<p>Notably, this <a href="https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/electronic-arts-ltd-a23-1222185-electronic-arts-ltd.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">isn't the first time</a> EA has been in trouble for&nbsp;<em>Golf Clash&nbsp;</em>ads, although in the last ASA ruling, the studio said the ad in question was mistakenly released, a defense to which it has not returned this time.</p>
<h2>Shift Up listed on the South Korean stock market</h2>
<p><em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>developer Shift Up <a href="https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_d982ee3c-c2b2-4519-8dc5-cf07bd2b7485" rel="noopener" target="_blank">saw its first day of public trading</a> on the South Korean stock market this week.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, the company's initial performance on the market was strong, with Shift Up jumping 18% on its first day and ending on 71,000 won (about $51) per share.</p>
<p>Recently,&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>'s sales topped a million, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million">according to Shift Up itself</a>, and a PC version of the hack-and-slash game is currently being mooted. We'll have to wait and see what happens on that front.</p>
<h2><em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>dev now lets staffers show off unreleased projects</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fae-farm-business-roundup.jpg?itok=yNdWexHz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fae-farm-business-roundup.jpg?itok=m9Gt74P_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>studio Phoenix Labs is making some neat moves.</figcaption></figure><p>In a rather unexpected and encouraging development, Phoenix Labs, the developer behind&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>, is now allowing staffers to show off assets from unreleased projects.</p>
<p>As noted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dave-sanderson-exdev_under-our-recently-updated-portfolio-policy-activity-7216138882679984129-Nz5_/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by external development director Dave Sanderson</a>, samples from the studio's unreleased projects have begun to appear online, with a view to helping former "colleagues and suppliers" find new work.</p>
<h2>New indie publisher First Break Labs reveals its first games</h2>
<p>This week saw <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/new-indie-publishing-and-investment-firm-first-break-labs-forms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the formation of a new indie publisher and investment firm</a> by the name of First Break Labs, and it's staffed partly by former Nintendo and Sega execs.</p>
<p>The company's staff includes ex-Sega product marketing head Alfonso Cubias, as well as former Nintendo product specialist Derek Seklecki. Its first four games will be the&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-esque&nbsp;<em>Entropy Survivors</em>, turn-based strategy game&nbsp;<em>Warside</em>, side-scroller <i>Baseless</i>, and adventure game&nbsp;<em>Particle Hearts</em>.</p>
<h2>Nintendo is having issues with secrecy</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/princess-peach-showtime-nintendo-business-roundup.jpg?itok=QVzcS6un 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/princess-peach-showtime-nintendo-business-roundup.jpg?itok=IrqWy5Wk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo isn't telling anyone who the developers on its projects are, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>Dataminer Yakumono this week <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nes-world-championships-developer-revealed-via-datamine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">uncovered the identity</a> of the developer behind Nintendo's speedrunning compilation&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition"><em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em></a>, prompting questions about Nintendo's apparent policy of secrecy.</p>
<p>Indieszero is just the latest developer not to be obviously credited for a Nintendo project; other recent examples include Good-Feel for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/princess-peach-showtime-demo-new-trailer"><em>Princess Peach: Showtime!</em></a>&nbsp;and ArtePiazza for the<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-mario-rpg-review-slightly-unbalanced-but-fun-romp">Super Mario RPG&nbsp;</a></em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-mario-rpg-review-slightly-unbalanced-but-fun-romp">remake</a>.</p>
<p>It's not a great look for the company; the lack of developer credit harks back to the dark days of early gaming, when developers often weren't credited for their work, leading to the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethporges/2017/12/20/the-true-story-behind-the-original-video-game-easter-egg-that-inspired-ready-player-one/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">creation of the first Easter egg</a>.</p>
<h2><em>Dying Light 2&nbsp;</em>dev Techland adopts a back-to-office approach</h2>
<p>Techland, the developer behind&nbsp;<em>Dying Light 2</em>, has become the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal">latest developer</a> to mandate that "most" employees return to the office or adopt a hybrid working approach.</p>
<p>The studio <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/techland-moving-most-roles-to-on-site-or-hybrid-model" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed its decision to GamesIndustry.biz</a> earlier this week, telling the site that the decision was made in order to "create a more collaborative work environment". This also includes staff working overseas.</p>
<p>Techland does, however, insist that it's still possible for workers to "request home office days on demand as needed", and that "remote work remains an option".</p>
<h2>Also in the news this week</h2>
<p>Embracer Group has <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-secures-new-600m-revolving-credit-facility" rel="noopener" target="_blank">secured a new credit facility for itself</a>, which the company says will "reduce interest expenses" and make Embracer a "leaner and more focused company".</p>
<p>Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier">announced the introduction of a new Game Pass tier</a> and a price hike for some of the existing tiers this week, adding further confusion to what's becoming a less and less streamlined system.</p>
<p>Sony and&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-sony-deal">signed a new deal</a> to help the creature-collecting survival game go beyond the world of gaming, so expect more&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>media very soon.</p>
<hr><p>That's all we've got for you this week! Join us again next week for another look at what's been going on in the world of gaming business.</p>

An aluminum edition is coming out this month, and the company says that the new handhelds “are precision CNC’d entirely in aluminum.” They come in four colors — natural, noir, black, and indigo — and will be <a href="https://store.analogue.co/">available to preorder</a> on July 15th at 8AM PT / 11AM ET, with units expected to ship on July 17th.</p><p>That metal body doesn’t come cheap, though. The aluminum Pocket will cost $499, a big boost over the $219 of the standard version. Analogue says that the new version will be “available in highly&nbsp;limited&nbsp;quantities and will never be sold again.”</p><p>Here’s a look at all the aluminum parts of the device:</p><p>Since its launch in 2021, Analogue has released a handful of other special editions of the Pocket, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/15/23961099/analogue-pocket-special-edition-classic-colors-gameboy-advance">some bright colors</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/28/23848739/analogue-pocket-glow-in-the-dark-preorders">a glow-in-the-dark version</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23888931/analogue-pocket-transparent-price-release-date">the always-popular transparent shell</a>. The device allows gamers to play old Game Boy cartridges (as well as other carts, with the right adapters) on a handheld with modern touches like a crisp LCD screen.</p><p>The Pocket was the company’s first handheld device after previously releasing high-quality recreations of consoles like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/31/14451542/analogue-nt-mini-nes-review">NES</a> (which also came in aluminum),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/7/16981722/analogue-super-nt-snes-nintendo-review">SNES</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/16/17967790/analogue-mega-sg-sega-genesis-mega-drive-price-release-date">Sega Genesis</a>. Up next is the Nintendo 64 with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23915941/analogue-3d-nintendo-64">the Analogue 3D</a>, which was originally planned for a 2024 release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Work on the<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-4-emulator-shadps4-bloodborne/"> shadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator</a> is proceeding smoothly, and recent developments have improved Bloodborne's emulation.</p>
<p>As shown in a new video, the latest version of the PS4 emulator now displays the game's menu with the correct colors. Unfortunately, the emulator still can't get in-game, but this quick emulation improvement definitely bodes well for the future of the emulator, which may end up being the only way to play FromSoftware's popular action role-playing game on PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bloodborne again (this time with correct colors) shadps4 v0.1.1 WIP" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zoMO4N92Vss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>shadPS4 is only one of the many PlayStation 4 emulators in the works, but it is among the few ones that can run 3D games, as most of the others can only run simpler 2D games. The PlayStation 4 emulation scene is still in its infancy, however, so things will definitely get improved in the future and possibly get on the same level as PlayStation 3 emulation, which now allows users to enjoy <a href="https://wccftech.com/rpcs3-can-now-run-all-released-playstation-3-games/">all of the games released on the system</a> with enhancements such as higher resolution and more stable performance. Something that could also be happening on the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S in the future, thanks to a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-run-playstation-3-games/">update to the consoles' dev mode</a> that could make running emulators such as RPCS3 possible on the systems.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-development-of-varsity-high-school-football-dynasty-mode/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When Varsity High School Football  releases,  it’ll will center around two main elements: gameplay and Dynasty Mode. We’ve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-development-of-varsity-high-school-football-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already talked about gameplay</a> and the plans Spear Interactive and Pyramid Lake Games have for it, but what about Dynasty?</p>



<p>To put it in a single word: deep.</p>



<p>The developers have been hard at work fleshing out and implementing all of the features that they want to include in the mode. From how the offseason works to the decisions you can make, everything is geared towards what you might expect when dealing with high school athletes.</p>



<p>So, how does it all work?</p>



<p>You start like any other Dynasty by creating a coach that’s either a head coach or coordinator. From there you’ll see a number of open jobs from some of the thousands – yes, thousands – of high schools in the country. Jobs are broken down by counties within a state. Some states, like Tennessee and Texas for example, will have more jobs and better opportunities than say Montana or North Dakota.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you look for a job, you’ll get to see things like the annual budget for your program to spend, how popular you are in the region, the size of the market, and more. It’s all done to help you make the most informed decision you can before you actually start as a coach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you’re at your school, the real work begins. You have to manage your roster throughout the year and keep your team eligible to play games. Some schools, because of their size and location, will only have a roster of 25 players. That means you’ll have players on both sides of the ball, doubling potential injury risk.</p>



<figure><video controls="" poster="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/vlcsnap-2024-07-12-10h44m31s507.jpg" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/VarsityMap.mp4" playsinline=""></video></figure>



<p>Your schedule is made up of teams in your district as well as filling any open dates you want. That said, you can choose, based on your current situation, to keep your schedule at just six or seven games to limit any risk of injury. It’s part of the decision making that goes into being a head coach.</p>



<p>As a head coach, you have goals you need to achieve. These goals vary based on your school and location, and help determine your overall job stability. Underperform, and you could find yourself looking for work. But don’t think it’s just on you. If you are a head coach, you’ll have to hire a staff that works with you to build your team, but you’re restricted to the budget you have to spend. And that budget goes towards much more than your staff hirings.</p>



<p>You use the money you have to hire staff and improve your facilities. Some schools like a major Catholic academy might have an annual budget of $50,000 to spend in a year while a smaller rural school might just have $10,000. Spend too much on staff, and you’ll be behind the eight ball on improving the program through other means.</p>



<p>There’s even the possibility of having to deal with parents who think their kids are the next big thing and deserve more playing time. It’s up to you to figure out how you want to handle that situation.</p>



<p>For those wondering, there will be a full Super Sim engine within the mode for your games, full season player stat tracking that’s realistic to high school statistics, and full league stats.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-offseason-is-where-programs-are-built">The Offseason Is Where Programs Are Built</h2>



<p>The actual football season only makes up a portion of what happens throughout the year. There’s a full offseason broken down by season (winter, spring, summer) that gives you various tasks to help improve your team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As mentioned, each part of the offseason will have different tasks for you. You have to reach out to boosters in order to try and raise money for your program. Some will be willing to give you a few thousand while others will be tough to just get $50 out of them. You’re able to see the likely willingness to financially support you before you ask for a specific amount that you can choose. Your success with the boosters directly influences your budget for the following year, so doing as much as you can to get the most money is key.</p>



<p>During the offseason you’ll be able to have training camps with your players. However, not every player may participate. You might find that your star running back is also a hockey player. That means he’s busy during the winter with that season, leaving you without a top player. In addition, there’s the risk of the players who are multi-sport athletes getting hurt resulting in missed offseason time or even the season. That’s why the facilities are important to improve because they will help with things like player recovery, injury resistance, skills, stamina, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When seeing everything that Dynasty has to offer, the developers felt confident that what they have will satisfy the needs of players. For the most part, development of the features within Varsity’s Dynasty Mode has been completed aside from a few things here and there. That said, they did say that there is the potential to add more that wasn’t discussed prior to launch if it makes sense for the mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were also some things talked about during our meeting that can’t be revealed just yet, but will be announced in due time. For the developers, it’s about making sure the timing is right and everything is official before putting news out there.</p>



<p>Varsity High School Football is currently in development. When it releases, it will be available for PC and console.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/breachway-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/manor-lords-publishers-sci-fi-deckbuilder-breachway-gets-release-date.925818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/breachway-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hooded Horse and developer Edgeflow Studio have announced the release date for sci-fi roguelike deckbuilder <i>Breachway</i>.</p>
<p>The game, which was originally scheduled to launch sometime in July, will now be arriving in Early Access on August 30th. Edgeflow and Hooded Horse say the extra development time has been used to add more content, polish what's already there, and fix bugs.</p>
<p>Endearingly, the devs also say the delay allowed them to add features to&nbsp;<em>Breachway&nbsp;</em>that were "just plain cool", like persistent battle damage that can only be repaired at hangars.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/breachway-release-date-early-access-battle.jpg?itok=MGg04pvM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/breachway-release-date-early-access-battle.jpg?itok=A3CAeE6C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sci-fi deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>Breachway&nbsp;</em>is finally hitting Early Access in August.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ftl-faster-than-light"><em>FTL: Faster than Light</em></a>, as well as deckbuilding roguelikes like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/slay-spire"><em>Slay the Spire</em></a>, then&nbsp;<em>Breachway&nbsp;</em>looks like it's going to be right up your alley.</p>
<p>The game sees you piloting a ship across the galaxy as you search for the source of a mysterious signal that's being broadcast across space. It's a much less bellicose objective than&nbsp;<em>FTL</em>'s tense flight from the rebel flagship.</p>
<p><em>Breachway&nbsp;</em>offers a multitude of ship types to choose from, and you can also add various weapon systems, defensive options, and other modules to your ship, each of which comes with its own set of cards to help you build a unique deck.</p>
<p>As you explore, you'll uncover upgrades that you can use to improve your ship's systems, and you'll also run across random events that will test your strategic skills to their limits. You can check out the brand new release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Breachway&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>

<p>The galaxy in&nbsp;<em>Breachway&nbsp;</em>also plays host to six unique factions with whom you can have various dealings; you might find them helpful, or they might hinder you on your journey depending on what happens across each run.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Breachway&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2118810/Breachway/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC in Early Access</a> on August 30th.</p>

When <em>MaXXXine</em>, the conclusion to the <em>X </em>trilogy, kicks off six years later, she is still living by it. Having escaped from the events of <em>X</em>, deliciously dubbed the Texas Porn Star Massacre, Maxine is now a bonafide sex symbol living in Los Angeles. Having taken the adult world by storm, she now seeks that coveted cross-over role into the mainstream.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Mia Goth’s performance showcases the trauma and tragedy that lurk within fame through a steely resolve and non-stop desire to get the life she wants. She survived that harrowing ordeal on the farm and has used it to blaze her path forward. Goth’s performance here is&nbsp;more subtle than her leading turn in&nbsp;<em>Pearl</em>, the trilogy’s second entry, but there’s red-hot emotion that burns in her throughout.</p><figure id="" data-id="c697e85f5387182e2b6a7a72d28aae79" data-recommend-id="image://c697e85f5387182e2b6a7a72d28aae79" data-format="jpg" data-width="1958" data-height="1100" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kevin Bacon in an image from MaXXXine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kevin Bacon in an image from MaXXXine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->A24</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c697e85f5387182e2b6a7a72d28aae79" data-recommend-id="image://c697e85f5387182e2b6a7a72d28aae79" data-format="jpg" data-width="1958" data-height="1100" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kevin Bacon in an image from MaXXXine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The chickens of Maxine’s past have come home to roost though and they mainly do so via the southern-fried charm of Kevin Bacon’s Detective John Labat. His performance manages to channel both Benoit Blanc and the Tasmanian Devil, creating a mangy, golden-fanged gentleman who shines whenever he’s on screen.<br></p><p>What follows is an odyssey through the grimy streets and smoke-stained backrooms of 1980s Hollywood. Tension and fear crackle around the city as a series of murders are taking place, targeting starlets and harlots alike. With the Satanic Panic in full effect, protestors and sycophants haunt the Hollywood streets and back-alley filming lots. A grainy haze of yellow and gold lingers throughout the film, bringing to mind the hallucinatory hopes and dreams of <em>Pearl </em>combined with the gritty reality of <em>X</em>. The allusions and references to the two movies that lead up to <em>MaXXXine</em> are not as heavy-handed as <em>Pearl</em>’s nods to its predecessor, but they’re still there for the keen-eyed viewer looking for easter eggs.</p><p>Director Ti West loses his grip a bit in the third act as <em>MaXXXine</em>’s tone leans fully into the campy aspects of the revenge fantasy and exploitation films of the era in which it’s set. The plot’s mysteries are too&nbsp;easy to deduce for those paying attention, and West seems more keen on fun than nuance.</p><p>The rest of the cast rounds out the picture wonderfully. Elizabeth Debicki is cold and collected as the determined filmmaker seeking to unite A-level ideas with B-level movies. Giancarlo Esposito portrays Maxine’s sleazy agent-cum-lawyer who would be just as at home in Atlantic City as Los Angeles. Bobby Cannavale and Michelle Monaghan are LAPD murder police who are looking to put an end to the ritualistic murders taking place, and their presence provides a dash of buddy-cop comedy to West’s bubbling cauldron of 80s cinema.</p><p>Fans of the first two <em>X</em> films will undoubtedly enjoy the finale, with opinions sure to be split on how well Ti West sticks the landing. What <em>MaXXXine</em> indisputably does is cement Mia Goth’s status as horror’s premier scream queen. This may be the last we hear from Maxine Minx but now, we all know her name.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Raid Bosses are even more challenging because of their huge HP pool and you’ll be relying on a base-worth of Pals instead of just your five-member party.</p><p>You don’t need to aim for perfectionism, though. It’s not as if everyone you bring needs to be perfectly bred with ideal traits and a high rank, but the more powerful your Pals will be, the better. This is essentially endgame content, after all. So you might need to become more familiar with the breeding and Pal Essense mechanics. At the very least, <strong>the Pals you bring to this battle should be at or very close to level 55</strong>.</p><p>Your best bet will be to <strong>load your base with Water-Types as Blazamut Ryu is a Dragon/Fire-Type and is thus weak to Water-based abilities.</strong> Jormuntide is still the absolute best option, but others such as Azurobe and Suzaku Aqua will be a big help too.</p><p>Something worth taking note of is that this raid boss functions similarly to the Bellanoir Liberio fight in that it has a second phase that changes its type. More specifically, it will regain a third of its health and become an Electric-Type. This will put all of your Water Pals at a distinct disadvantage and they’ll likely be disposed of quite soon.</p><figure id="" data-id="c5321e89bb83bda5f46067b8211aab3e" data-recommend-id="image://c5321e89bb83bda5f46067b8211aab3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player examines which Pals they have in their Palbox." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player examines which Pals they have in their Palbox." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pocketpair / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c5321e89bb83bda5f46067b8211aab3e" data-recommend-id="image://c5321e89bb83bda5f46067b8211aab3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player examines which Pals they have in their Palbox." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>I recommend bringing a hefty set of Ground Pals as well</strong>.

That 10-minute-timer means you should be aiming to deal the most damage as much as possible.<br></p><p>Alternatively, there’s also the tried-and-true Gobfin method. This sharky guy’s partner skill provides a 10% increase in player attack just for being in the party. If you’re feeling particularly devoted, ranking up with the Pal Essense Condenser can boost this to a 20% increase. This effect stacks and bringing four of them will provide a 40% increase at minimum. Fill the last spot with a Pal that buffs you more and/or can change the elemental affinity of your attacks to become a monster yourself.</p><h2 id="h83611"><a id="defeat"></a>How to defeat Blazamut Ryu</h2><figure id="" data-id="24e735ccf302252ccb0532d51d17000b" data-recommend-id="image://24e735ccf302252ccb0532d51d17000b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player fights against a massive boss in Palworld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player fights against a massive boss in Palworld." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pocketpair / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="24e735ccf302252ccb0532d51d17000b" data-recommend-id="image://24e735ccf302252ccb0532d51d17000b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player fights against a massive boss in Palworld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With your base of Water Pals out and about, it’s time to summon Blazamut Ryu. Confirm the dialogues at the Summoning Altar and then move away as fast as possible. It won’t take long for this boss to start attacking and you don’t want to be nearby when it does.</p><p><strong>Nearly all of Blazamut Ryu’s moves are AoE attacks that feel extra deadly due to how big they are</strong>. Keep attacking from a safe distance away to avoid unnecessary damage. Most of them are easy enough to avoid thanks to some obvious start-up animations. There are two of them in particular that you should prepare yourself for, though:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Brawn Impact: Blazamut Ryu swings its arms back, enlarges its hands, and then claps them together for a convincing Incredible Hulk impersonation. This is very hard to avoid because of the large AoE it covers as well as its speed. The likely visual clutter of the fight doesn’t help, as I often would get hit by this seemingly out of nowhere.</li><li>Magna Crush: Blazamut Ryu jumps into the air and turns into a moving purple fireball. They reappear after a few seconds and lunge forward with a powerful ground-pound attack that causes further nearby explosions after two seconds. It can practically cover the entire base with the lunging part of the move, which is why I suggest moving in the opposite direction of the purple fireball.</li></ul><p>After dealing enough damage, Blazamut Ryu will fall face down on the ground and enter a stunned state. You have around 10 seconds to deal uninterrupted damage here, so I suggest going for the head. Distance yourself once it stands up and repeat the strategy of peppering it from afar.</p><figure id="" data-id="a9e1cf4f2cf8107cb42b44e900a052bb" data-recommend-id="image://a9e1cf4f2cf8107cb42b44e900a052bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="650" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character fights a large boss in Palworld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player character fights a large boss in Palworld." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pocketpair / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a9e1cf4f2cf8107cb42b44e900a052bb" data-recommend-id="image://a9e1cf4f2cf8107cb42b44e900a052bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="650" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character fights a large boss in Palworld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The second phase will start once you’ve brought it to 10-percent of its HP. Light will begin to gather around and after a few seconds, it will send out an electric wave that stuns everything nearby. While this doesn’t do any damage, it will lock you in place for a little bit. A great way to use this to your advantage is to stay close to the Palbox as the first phase nears its end and then head into the Palbox Management Menu as Blazamut Ryu begins its change. Make it in time and although you’ll still be stunned, you can use these precious few danger-free seconds to begin swapping your Water Pals for the Ground ones!</p><p>Treat this second phase the same way you treated the first. The worst part of the monster’s new Electric attacks is that some might stun you. Thankfully, all of them are pretty easy to avoid as long as you’re not close by. Keep the pressure up with your second set of Pals and it’ll be over in no time.</p><h2 id="h83612"><a id="rewards"></a>Blazamut Ryu raid rewards</h2><p>Finishing this raid will give you all sorts of awesome exclusive loot such as Training Crystals. The two major standouts are a Huge Dragon Egg that’s guaranteed to spawn a Blazamut Ryu of your own and a Blazamut Ryu (Ultra) Slab. If this fight wasn’t enough of a challenge for you, that slab can be used at a Summoning Altar to start the Blazamut Ryu (Ultra) fight.</p><p>In the Ultra fight, Blazamut Ryu has twice as much HP with the same 10-minute time restriction. You can use the same strategy I’ve listed above, although you’ll need Pals at their absolute maximum potential to have a chance. I suggest grinding it out against Alpha Pals or the new <strong>Tower Boss</strong> to gain experience quickly.<br>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/did-you-know-farscape-is-streaming-around-the-clock<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You may or may not remember <em>Farscape</em>, an Australian sci-fi show that ran from 1999 to 2003. It featured a mis-matched cast fleeing space authorities aboard a living ship, a setup that gave us a steamy and complicated romance, lots of cool Jim Henson aliens, and–if you ask me–one of the best series endings on TV if you pretend the mini-series doesn’t exist. I recently learned that <em>Farscape</em> streams 24/7 on Youtube, and I’m here to share that information with you.</p><p>Shout Factory, which has the rights to the show, runs a nonstop <em>Farscape</em> channel on its <a href="https://shoutfactorytvlive.com/farscape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a> and on YouTube, where episodes of the show just play one after another in order. It’s just playing there, whenever you want! The Youtube channel has a chat, where as I look right now, 100 viewers are talking about what time it is in their respective locations. (Someone is also complaining about how TV is too woke these days, so, as always with the internet, proceed with caution.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="👽 FARSCAPE by Jim Henson 🐸 Streaming Now❗️" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dEfEhLh8jXE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I found out about this thanks to games journalist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/carlivelocci.com/post/3kvresitlfk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carli Velocci</a>, who brought it up a few weeks ago on Bluesky. I’m not quite sure when it started, though the channel says it started streaming on June 6. There’s several languages available, and Shout also runs live channels for <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000 </em>(would watch) and <em>Pee-wee’s Playhouse</em> (would maybe watch), among others.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Farscape</em> hasn’t been that hard to find–you can watch it on Amazon Prime, among others–but I think there’s something uniquely pleasurable about watching TV when it isn’t under your control. I’m old enough to remember when we didn’t have streaming and its attendant choice paralysis; instead, you either arranged your schedule around a show you wanted to see, or you just watched whatever was on. I don’t have TV anymore, but when I visit my parents, I always find something nostalgically soothing about flipping through the channels, throwing my viewing choices to fate instead of scrolling endless menus.</p><p>The <em>Farscape</em> channel feels like a very good version of that, because it is just episodes of a show I want to say I remember being very good. Honestly, my memory is a little fuzzy; I was introduced to it by a buddy in grad school, who parcelled out episodes to our friend group at a pace carefully crafted for maximum drama. I remember begging to watch the next episode in a multi-episode arc, only for him to make us wait, and spending the week wondering what would happen next. So I have strong emotional associations to the show, but I can’t say for sure I remember the plot.</p><p>What I do remember, though, is… delightful, if I couldn’t confidently say good. The basic premise is that American astronaut John Crichton accidentally goes through a wormhole into a far part of space, where he runs afoul of the militaristic Peacekeepers, forges a complicated romantic relationship with ex-Peacekeeper Aeryn Sun (played by Claudia Black, of <em>Mass Effect</em> fame), and makes enemies with, among others, Peacekeeper leader Scorpius, a wrinkly latex-clad dude who is weirdly compelling and I won’t say sexy, but I won’t <em>not</em> say it either. (There’s a lot of bodysuits in the show.) There’s a bunch of other characters too, both puppets and costumes: Worf-esque warrior Ka D’argo, plucky ne’er-do-well Chiana, and deposed ruler Dominar Rygel XVI. Space-faring adventures abound, relationships come together and break apart, and Crichton’s efforts to get back to Earth are thwarted by circumstance and by his growing connection to his friends and the universe they inhabit. (Several episodes focusing specifically on Crichton’s relationship with Earth are real standouts.)</p><p>It’s campy as hell, blending some serious and heart-wrenching storylines with a playful, quirky aesthetic that draws heavily from other sci-fi mainstays. It’s got distinct vibes, and whether or not they hold up to the quality of TV two decades later, it definitely has its own special delights. <em>Farscape</em> was cancelled abruptly by the Sci-Fi Channel in 2002, leading to an incredible cliffhanger series end that, to me, feels so perfect for the nature of the show. Fans, of course, were furious, and eventually, a three-hour miniseries called <em>The Peacekeeper Wars</em> wrapped things up in a way that I can see the need for but also feel like I could live without.</p><p>If you haven’t seen the show, it might be hard to jump in on the stream, and if you–like me–only kind of remember it, it might also be hard to tell what’s going on. But nevertheless, I’ve been letting it roll while I do my thing around my apartment, and revisiting the familiar characters and all their bonkers drama has been really great. (While writing this blog, I just heard Crichton yell at Chiana, “Why do you have to sleep with all my friends?!” if you want a sneak peek of what you’re in for.) Thanks, Carli, and thanks, the internet.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The trailer ends with an exchange between Sam and Ross in which the distressed president says, “You may be Captain America, but you’re not Steve Rogers.” Sam says he’s right, and we see him don not only the Captain America suit and shield, but also his own wings to fly through the air while fighting.</p><p>It’s a nice way to cap off [<em>No -Ed</em>] the trailer, solidifying “things are going to be different this time.” With the overarching story of the Marvel Cinematic Universe <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-victoria-alonso-ike-perlmutter-jonathan-majors-1850289779&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-victoria-alonso-ike-perlmutter-jonathan-majors-1850289779">in a state of disarray</a></span> after Marvel decided to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/11/14/the-mcu-is-now-reportedly-backing-away-from-kang/?sh=5b73df763b44&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/11/14/the-mcu-is-now-reportedly-backing-away-from-kang/?sh=5b73df763b44" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abandon the Kang storyline</a></span>, going back to a more grounded superhero story not weighed down by all the multiverse baggage sounds like the right call. The final shot of the trailer, however, is one of the more tantalizing teases, as it shows the Red Hulk throwing the Captain America shield into the ground. The shot is brief and doesn’t show the big guy’s face, but anyone who knows the Marvel comics will be excited to see how this red tank of a supervillain might show up in this movie’s setup.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1811751120508764170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X, the developers behind The Division 2 confirmed plans to re-evaluate Seasons 2.0 and the potential for Seasonal Characters.</p>



<p>The team states that it has “the goal of progressing without” Seasonal Characters. The decision followed “thorough examination and discussions with the team.” </p>



<p>The Division 2 team also says fans should expect more information after it has “ironed out the finer details,” with a livestream and PTS on the way. It seems likely the devs will move away from Seasonal Characters if possible. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The team also reassured fans that “this change will not impact the previously announced Year 6 plans.” Fans quickly praised the team’s response to feedback regarding Seasonal Characters for The Division 2, and the open communication.</p>



<p>The developers <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1810690378242175054" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently revealed</a> a full events roadmap for July 2024. It currently includes Target Hercules, with Hercules League, SHD Exposed, and Guardians events coming soon to round out the month.</p>



<p>Ubisoft recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-has-canceled-the-division-heartland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled The Division Heartland</a>, years after first announcing it. In an earnings report, Ubisoft cited “increased selectivity of its investments.” </p>



<p>Back in September 2023, Ubisoft did announce that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-3-confirmed-by-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Division 3 was in development</a>. This came as part of an announcement for Julian Gerighty taking a key role for the Division brand. So, the series still seems to have a solid future, particularly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-project-resolve-revealed-with-dlc-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Project Resolve</a>.</p>

It launched on PC via Steam in September 2023, but after seeing a peak concurrent player count of 10,272 on Valve’s platform, the player count plummeted. Just a month after launch it struggled for 1,000 concurrent players on Steam. At the time of this article’s publication, the 24-hour peak was just 23. Overall Steam user reviews were ‘mixed’, but that has fallen dramatically to ‘mostly negative’ for recent reviews.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/synced-1720789372386.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Synced goes dark in September. Image credit: Level Infinite.</figcaption></figure></output><p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1008080/view/4221643401499519220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a note to the players who remain</a>, Tencent said Synced “will be retired” this September, a year after launch. Servers go dark on September 9, 2024. It remains playable until then.</p><p>Tencent said it may retain some player personal information for a period of time after this date. “The reason we may store your information after terminating Synced is to be able to meet our obligations to you and to other parties,” it said.</p><p>“For example, if you choose to exercise your data subject rights (if applicable), such as the right to request access to the personal information we hold about you, we will be able to respond to your request. In addition, we may be legally required to retain certain information about your transactions in Synced for a prescribed period.”</p><p>Then: “We are grateful for all the love and support we received for Synced and we hope you will enjoy our other new and existing titles!</p><p>“We apologize for any inconvenience caused.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Synced is the latest casualty in the live service war that has seen an increasing number of participants in recent years. Even games that have thrown hundreds of millions of dollars at their development, including Rocksteady’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, have failed to find an audience. And yet, the live service shooters are coming thick and fast. In recent weeks Korean company Nexon released live service looter shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a>, which is a big hit after securing 10 million players in seven days, and NetEase released survival game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/once-human">Once Human</a>, which is off to a strong start on Steam.</p><p>As for Synced, it hadn’t received an update since March, so the writing was very much on the wall. Level Infinite is set to publish Sharkmob's tactical open-world extraction shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/exoborne">Exoborne</a>, and Funcom’s open world survival MMO <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

"While there are several potential reasons for this from tone changes to hardware features/limitations, it is clear that Persona 4 Golden looks very different.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p>"This mod is a visual overhaul mod for Persona 4 Golden that aims to restore the visuals of Persona 4, starting with some of the most iconic areas of the original P4: the dungeons. I've always felt the original P4 looks really nice, and my goal with this was to make a mod that would allow people to finally experience the visuals of the original Persona 4 through Persona 4 Golden, a game that is infinitely more accessible today."</p><p>As noted, the mod currently only covers the dungeons of Persona 4 Golden and overall is 40% done. The modder behind it has plans to restore the entire game, however, even the areas not included in the original.</p><p>Persona 4 originally launched in 2008 and only received a mainline sequel with 2016's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-5">Persona 5</a>.

Persona 3 received three remakes in Portable, FES, and 2023's Reload, while Persona 5 received Royal a few years after its launch.</p><p>That latest entry has sparked the most spin-off titles, however, including tactical role-playing game <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-tactica-review">Persona 5 Tactica</a>, rhythm game Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, action game <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-strikers-review">Persona 5 Strikers</a>, and more.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

		<p>Oh, it’s Friday already? Well, I won’t complain about that too hard, but it’s felt like the week has raced by for me, and not necessarily because of having my face buried in some video games. I have played some games, though, passing the pad back and forth in a jolly jaunt through Little Kitty, Big City, getting the inside scoop on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/11/planet-coaster-2-preview-slip-and-slide-into-the-wet-stuff/">Planet Coaster 2</a>, and kicking in a few doors in Anger Foot – though not many, as I left it to <strong>Miguel</strong> to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/11/anger-foot-review/">review</a>. I’ve also been continuing on with SteamWorld Heist 2 for a review closer to launch.</p>

<p>Between meandering discussions about the potential future (or lack thereof) for Game, the precarious balance of politics around the world and <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-port-sex-toy-electronic-fleshlight-mod-weird-1851587885">the latest X-rated device</a> that has had Doom installed on it, we also checked in on what everyone else has been playing.</p>
<p>Having been a tad disappointed by Man of Medan’s use of the ghost ship premise, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has been pleasantly surprised to discover that his potato of a laptop can emulate PS2 games these days, and has been playing The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age – “It’s basically Final Fantasy but lord of the rings. It’s pretty great.” He also tried “the best football game of all time” in the form of RedCard, Burnout Revenge and State of Emergency 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while <strong>Dom</strong> would love to play more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/09/zenless-zone-zero-review/">Zenless Zone Zero</a>, and has been doing so, his patience is being tested by it needing updates almost every time he wants to load it up. Thankfully we’ve been distracting him with reviews of other games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/infinite-inside-review/">Infinite Inside.</a></p>


<p>Avoiding the update churn by playing something so old that updates would have been measured in megabytes, <strong>Jim’s</strong> been continuing on with Skyrim and has taken a detour into the Dawnguard DLC questlines. He’s also been playing Cyberpunk 2077, which is starting to grow on him, though he regrets making stealthy distraction-based characters for both these RPGs.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> had reviews of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/11/blacksad-under-the-skin-review-2/">Blacksad: Under The Skin</a> and Rack &amp; Slay too do this week: “Blacksad is a decent noir detective game, though a bit predictable. Rack and Slay is a nice basic, roguelike based around billiards. Enjoyable in short bursts.”</p>
<p>It’s been Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden for <strong>Steve</strong> this week, which is basically tailor made for his particular interests, though he complains about the pacing… which he himself is exacerbating – “Part of the length is my own fault as I am doing all the sidequests and finding all the collectables to prolong things even more.” He also checked out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/12/the-smurfs-dreams-preview-the-3d-platformer-to-drive-away-your-blues/">The Smurfs – Dreams</a>, restarted Sons of the Forest, dipped into Escape Academy and has Once Human lined up for some playtime next.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong> has been mixing his usual Dead by Daylight with an attempt to finish off WWE 2K24. He’s also&nbsp;started Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess and is excited to dive deeper into.</p>
<p>And we can round things out with <strong>Tuffcub</strong> who has, obviously, been playing Destiny 2, but also has RoboCop: Rogue City on the go, “because our review was clearly wrong.” – Ade thought it was “utter poo.” Who is right?</p>
<p>Now then, what have you been playing this week?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've been waiting for the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>console release to happen, then you're in luck, as developer Kinetic Games has announced that the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the ghost-hunting game are coming this year.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/739630/view/4250916799060403949" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam FAQ</a>, Kinetic says that the console version will be released during the 2024 Halloween event, which was admittedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release">also the plan</a> for last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-delay-halloween">now-delayed</a> console release.</p>
<p>When the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions drop, however, they will support full crossplay, so if you're playing on console, you'll be able to hunt ghosts alongside your PC-playing friends if you want to.</p>

<p>It'll be rated at 16+ or Teen, although this rating will vary depending on region, and there are also no plans to bring&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>&nbsp;to any of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier">however many tiers Xbox Game Pass currently has</a>.</p>
<p>The console versions of&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-update-point-hope">use the game's 0.10 build</a>, with further improvements and updates coming later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will also be a price hike for&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>when the console versions arrive; you'll be paying $19.99 for the game. Kinetic says this is "due to the amount of content and playtime added since the start of Early Access".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike-ouija-board.jpg?itok=o96h6Dut 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike-ouija-board.jpg?itok=hHicnW8L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"Will&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>be launched on consoles this year?"</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer ghost-hunting horror game that sees you and your friends exploring haunted locations to find evidence of paranormal activity.</p>
<p>You'll use what the devs amusingly term "real" ghost-hunting equipment to identify the paranormal entity haunting the location you're investigating and figure out how best to deal with it.</p>
<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and it's due to come to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>
