            <p>Ubisoft has wiped over a third off its share price after announcing a "reset" would close down two studios and cancel six games.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/22/ubisoft-shares-plummet-after-assassins-creed-maker-cancels-six-games.html">CNBC</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ubisoft-shares-plummet-to-lowest-price-in-over-14-years-amid-its-recently-announced-restructuring-centered-on-cancellations-layoffs-and-generative-ai/">PC Gamer</a>), the stock price had progressively declined since the pandemic, but on Thursday - the day after its announcement - it plummeted another 34 percent. It's the lowest share price the company has had since 2011, when it reported losses in the multi-millions, and closed at just €4.06. Just seven days prior, the share price was €6.89.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft closed two studios and cancelled six projects</a> - including its much-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake - last week as part of a major restructuring effort that will also see delays for seven games. Described as a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset", the publisher/developer said the cuts come as it struggles to compete in a "persistently more selective AAA market and an increasingly competitive shooter landscape".</p>
<p>As well as the six cancellations, Ubisoft has also confirmed it is delaying seven unspecified games "to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met" and to "maximise long-term value creation". Though not confirmed, it's widely believed that this includes the unannounced but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">much-rumoured Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake</a>.</p>
<p>All this has led Ubisoft to revise its guidance for the full financial year, saying it now expects net bookings of around €1.5bn - a reduction of €330m.</p>
<p>As Matt reported for us at the time, the restructuring will now see the publisher split its efforts across five "creative houses", respectively focused on "scaling and extending" its biggest properties (including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six); on competitive and cooperative shooter experiences (The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell); on live experiences (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>, The Crew, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/riders-republic">Riders Republic</a>, Brawlhalla, Skull &amp; Bones); on immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes (Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, Beyond Good &amp; Evil), and on casual and family games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft">Former Assassin's Creed leader Marc-Alexis Côté is reportedly suing Ubisoft following a surprise and suspicious departure from the company last year</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="59e46ca28b147"><a title="Robert Burns Night AC" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/59e46ca28b147/robert-burns-night-ac.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>"Aloha!" as we say here in Scotland, and welcome to an impromptu Nintendo Life Burns Night celebration, with me, an Irish fella.</p>
<p>Now, for those unaware, and to get things off in a high-brow sort of way through the illusion of learning, Robert Burns was a Scottish poet, now the country's national poet no less, who lived from 1759 until 1796. Just 37 years. However! In this tragically short lifespan, he managed to imprint himself permanently on the Scottish psyche through his powerful works which contributed greatly to the Romantic movement, don't you know.</p><div><figure data-videoid="CiNQNWrXoic" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiNQNWrXoic?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytCiNQNWrXoic" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CiNQNWrXoic?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiNQNWrXoic?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed82b568uvkqwp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>The fact that Burns wrote in a Scots dialect (although he did use a watered-down version, making his verses and lyrics much easier to parse for non-native speakers) made him incredibly popular and personal to the Scots, and in death he's become a figure of inspiration for socialist and liberal movements, in particular.</p>
<p>Of course, we probably all know <strong>Auld Lang Syne</strong>, his poem which became lyrics sung on New Year's Eve to "ring in the bells" as folk say up here in Scotland (they kidnapped me in 2007 and made me live here, please help). But other works — and we're getting to the end of the learning bit now, class, so stay strong — include very well-known stuff like <strong>A Red, Red Rose</strong> and <strong>Tam o' Shanter</strong>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b9ab63965a8a5"><a title="Robert Burns Night AC" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b9ab63965a8a5/robert-burns-night-ac.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, Tam o' Shanter. That's right. If this rings a bell, gamers, it's because back in 2010 Nintendo helped celebrate Burns Night with a special Animal Crossing item. Burns Night — which happens every 25th January (Burns' birthday) and which I'm currently enjoying immensely, thank you — sees some folk in Scotland read and/or perform from a selection of the poets' works, eat lots of haggis, neeps and tatties (that's turnip and potatoes to you), and, well, some people may even like to have small thimble of whiskey, too. Then straight to bed!</p>
<p>If you happened to have been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/animal_crossing_city_folk">Animal Crossing: City Folk</a>, or <strong>Animal Crossing: Let's Go To The City</strong> as it was known o'er here — sorry, went all Burns there — back in 2010, you'll have got to celebrate your very own Burn's Night by nabbing a very exciting (mild sarcasm detected) "Tam o' Shanter" hat. Aye, a wee Scottish tartan bonnet for putting oan the in-game heid eh a bonnie wee lad/and or lassie. (Apologies to all my Scottish friends for that sentence.)</p>
<p>The coolest thing about this particular hat, as you'll no doubt already know, was that it gave your character a shaggy new Scottish hairdo as an extra to boot, and this celebration of Scotland's national bard has also gone on to feature in both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> (hey, that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">just got an update!</a>).</p>
<p>So, seeing as it's Burns Night and all that, and seeing how I'm currently in Glasgow, the unofficial capital of Scotland, why not join me, in...well...it's not exactly the same as raising a glass to the great man, but why not hop into your copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons (or New Leaf), stick yer hat oan, and join me in some deep breathing exercises as we consider Robert Burns, and his many, many excellent poems. But most especially Tam o' Shanter, as it's the one holding this vaguely game-related article together.</p>
<p>With me? Right! Can't find your Tam o' Shanter? To nab the headgear in New Horizons, you need to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/animal-crossing-new-horizons-gulliver-souvenir-list-how-to-wake-up-where-to-find-communicator-parts">get it from Gulliver as a reward for helping him find his communicator parts</a>. No worries, you can just jump into the game's custom designs portal to look for (or design!) some Scottish and tartan-themed gear. If you're wondering, you got the hat from Pelly or Phyllis at the Post Office in New Leaf.</p>

<p>Once you've got your hat on, and have your plate of haggis (that's sheep liver, lungs, heart, etcetera, all mixed up with delicious oatmeal, or there's a veggie option available!), grab yourself a thimble of something delicious and we'll offer up a toast to Rabbie Burns, and to Animal Crossing, I guess, on this latest Burns Night.</p>
<p>And to close out, here's a little excerpt from Tam o' Shanter, in which we contemplate the transient nature of joy, man's inability to control time, and the nature of mortality. Annnnnnnd relax:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>But pleasures are like poppies spread,<br>
You seize the flow'r, its bloom is shed;<br>
Or like the snow-falls in the river,<br>
A moment white–then melts forever . . .<br>
. . .<br>
Or like the rainbow's lovely form<br>
Evanishing amid the storm.–<br>
Nae man can tether time or tide;<br>
The hour approaches Tam maun ride;<br>
That hour o' night's black arch the key-stane,<br>
That dreary hour Tam mounts his beast in;<br>
And sic a night he taks the road in,<br>
As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I'm off over to Wikipedia to get this Animal Crossing malarkey added to the site's official list of cultural references for Robert Burns.</p>
<p>Gabh cùram!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>As a retro gaming fan, I was thrilled when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122341/apple-app-store-game-emulators-super-apps">Apple opened its App Store to emulators in 2024</a>, but I’ve yet to find a controller that makes me want to fully embrace retro gaming on my phone.</p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/661382/the-new-backbone-pro-could-be-the-one-controller-for-all-your-gaming">Clamp-on controllers like the Backbone Pro</a> are a bit too bulky, and I don’t want to prop my phone up somewhere to use a standalone gamepad. The Abxylute M4 seemed exactly what I was looking for when it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/809274/abxylute-m4-snap-on-mobile-wireless-smartphone-controller-magnetic-magsafe">debuted a few months ago</a>. It’s a compact wireless gamepad that uses a magnetic mount to attach to my iPhone. It’s a clever design, but one that’s let down by stiff thumbsticks and a magnetic mount that doesn’t always feel like it’s securely supporting my phone.</p><p>There are two components to the Abxylute M4: a retro-looking rectangular gamepad that connects to your smartphone over Bluetooth, and a Q-shaped mount that attaches the controller to your phone so it feels like you’re playing a handheld console. The mount is compatible with MagSafe iPhone models and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762426/google-qi2-wireless-charger-pixelsnap-pixel-10-series">Google Pixel 10 Series</a>. I primarily tested it with an iPhone 16 Pro, but Abxylute includes an adhesive metal ring you can stick to the back of any phone to make it compatible.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4’s magnetic mount can double as a smartphone stand using a ring-shaped kickstand.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The ring of magnets on the M4’s mount stuck to the back of my iPhone as securely as any MagSafe accessory or Qi2 charger I’ve ever used. It’s not going to come off until you want it to. It also features a smooth finish, allowing you to rotate the mount and attach the gamepad so that it completely hides behind your phone instead of hanging off the side. But the whole thing ends up being too bulky and thick to slip into a pocket, so I’ve been removing it entirely when not playing.</p><div id=":R1j2r6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4 controller doesn’t protrude far enough from the bottom of a phone to play games in a portrait orientation.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4 can be attached so it completely hides behind your phone. But you’ll need giant pockets to carry it around like this.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>One limitation of the M4’s design is that when attached, it can only be used to play games in a landscape orientation. In a vertical mode, the controller doesn’t protrude far enough for all its controls to be accessible. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but as a decades-old Game Boy fan, I tend to prefer playing games vertically. Recently announced mobile controllers like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860093/pocket-taco-pocket-taco-pocket-taco">GameSir Pocket Taco</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860160/8bitdo-flippad-hands-on">8BitDo FlipPad</a> support that.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The mount attaches to the M4 controller using one of two magnetic connectors.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>A far bigger issue with the M4’s design, and a potential deal-breaker, is the connection between the mount and the controller. It also relies on a strong magnet that makes the controller snap into place when attached to the mount. But the connection doesn’t feel strong enough to always keep the mount securely connected to the controller while your phone’s attached.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The mount’s connection to the M4 controller feels strong, but it doesn’t take a lot of force for it to accidentally disconnect.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The connection between the mount and controller feels secure enough when I’m holding the M4 and my phone up in front of me while playing a game. But at some angles, or when I accidentally bump my phone, the mount can separate from the gamepad. The two will also consistently disconnect if you absentmindedly turn the whole thing upside down, sending the phone and the attached mount falling. Thankfully, all my testing was done on a soft sofa.</p><p>I’m not the only one to experience this behavior. <a href="https://retrododo.com/abxylute-m4-controller-review/"><em>Retro Dodo</em>’s Brandon Saltalamacchia</a> did, too. The connection might fare better with a lighter phone, like the iPhone Air, but given smartphones are now a significant investment (my iPhone 16 Pro cost just shy of CA$1,500 here in Canada, or around $1,100 US), I’m not comfortable using the M4 as it’s designed.</p><p>The M4 isn’t entirely dependent on its magnetic mount. It can be used as a standalone controller with phones, consoles, or any device that supports Bluetooth gamepads. I was surprised at how comfortable it was to use with my gigantic hands. Its square-shaped design lets me reach the M4’s shoulder buttons without contorting my index fingers, and the build quality feels solid.</p><div id=":R1n2r6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4 controller’s action buttons are small, but the D-pad feels comfortably sized, even for my large thumbs.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>There’s two pairs of shoulder buttons atop the M4 controller, which I found easy to reach without having to overstretch my fingers.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>The controller’s four action buttons are small but have a satisfying amount of resistance. They’re paired with a large D-pad that’s a bit mushy and prone to registering inputs from multiple directions, but adequate for pick-up-and-play gaming sessions. Choose a different controller if you’re chasing high scores.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4’s analog joysticks feature a sliding disc design similar to what the Nintendo 3DS offered. But on the M4 they’re stiff and uncomfortable to use.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Abxylute includes two analog joysticks, a feature rarely found on controllers this size. They use a sliding disc design similar to what Nintendo used on the 3DS — but less effective. The sliding joysticks on the M4 are stiff and uncomfortable, making subtle movements nearly impossible. My thumb ached after just a handful of races in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, and I can’t see myself using either of the joysticks again.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>For $49 the Abxylute M4 is one of the more affordable ways to turn your smartphone into a handheld console, but the risks don’t feel worth it.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>As compact controllers go, the $49 Abxylute M4 is good, but far from great. But that’s not why people are going to buy it. Its promise of turning a smartphone into a handheld console helped the company raise over $300,000 from nearly 6,000 backers on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1932181238/m4-snap-on-magnetic-phone-controller-for-anytime-pocket-play">Kickstarter</a> — a lot of whom I think will be frustrated or disappointed if they’re not extra cautious while using it. Trusting your $1,000 mobile device to the M4 requires a leap of faith that’s a bit too far for me.</p><p><em>Photos by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/864821/abxylute-m4-snap-on-mobile-controller-magsafe-magnetic-bluetooth]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dataminers believe they've found evidence that Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has changed the ending to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3</a> in the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> 3.</p>
<p>Though the game isn't even out yet, some dataminers claim to have discovered the full script hidden in the playable demo, suggesting the ending has been revised.</p>
<p><strong>The report that follows contains HUGE spoilers for Yakuza 3, so only proceed if you're happy to be spoiled!</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the original Yakuza 3, the game's main antagonist, Yoshitaka Mine, plummets to his death, taking fellow bad guy Andre Richardson with him, and setting up the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-4">Yakuza 4</a>. Now, however, if the claims are true, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qk5rws/yakuza_3_kiwami_script_leak/">Mine miraculously survives the fall</a> and joins the Daidoji, with a considerable knock-on effect on the rest of the franchise. Dark Ties, a spin-off game bundled in with Yakuza Kiwami 3, is a prequel starring Mine (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-ending-leaked/">TheGamer</a>).</p><p>"The ending for Dark Ties has been leaked and has massively retconed the end of the game to the point where it rectons something in Yakuza 4," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qm2kzp/comment/o1ivapa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one player. Another said they had "definite proof" regarding the amended conclusion, writing: "I was sceptic first, but after having datamined the demo myself with a datamining tool and exploring the auth file (for anyone trying themselves -&gt; par decomp. -&gt; data and db.bis.en-&gt; Auth file), I found the proof for the new end."</p>
<p>Back in September, though, the studio said there "won't be any major changes to the story", but did suggest we'd get to learn more about the motivations behind why certain characters behave the way that they do.</p>
<p>The silver lining, I guess, is that we don't have long to wait to find out if this is just a troll kicking up trouble or that the game's conclusion really has changed: Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is set to release for PC, PS5, Xbox Series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and last-gen consoles on 12th February, 2026.</p>
<p>This latest furore comes on top of pressure from fans to remove Teruyuki Kagawa, who portrays Goh Hamazaki, from the cast after he <a href="https://kbizoom.com/roppongi-class-teruyuki-kagawa-admits-sexual-harassment-of-a-female-club-employee/">admitted</a> to sexual misconduct and forcibly touched a woman without consent in 2019.</p>
<p>Last weekend, we learned<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-3-remastered-will-not-be-available-to-buy-as-a-standalone-game-after-yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-releases-next-month"> Yakuza 3 Remastered will no longer be available as a standalone purchase after Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties releases next month</a>. While people who already own the game will "still be able to continue playing it", "those new to the series who wish to experience the original version" will only be able to play it if they buy the whole Yakua Complete Series bundle.</p>

<p>PlayStation Plus subscribers will be able to access Undisputed, the latest attempt at a realistic boxing game, for free starting in February 2026.</p>



<p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-voici-le-titre-phare-de-la-selection-de-fevrier-2026-60911" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/undisputed-review-redefining-the-boxing-game-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Undisputed </a>will be the flagship PlayStation Plus free game for February 2026. Undisputed was released in October 2024 on PlayStation and Xbox after years of being an early access title on Steam.</p>



<p>Undisputed sets out to bring dream fights to the ring with everyone from Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali to Buster Douglas and Jake Paul. Even Lupe Fiasco’s in the game.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>The game currently has a mixed reaction on Metacritic with a 70 Metascore. The user rating is a little more unforgiving, currently at 4.8. Some reviews knock the game for being buggy and urge others not to buy. Well, PlayStation Plus users won’t have to buy the game in February if they want to try it out. </p>



<p>Currently, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed and Need for Speed Unbound are available to download for free on PlayStation Plus.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has unveiled a new trailer showcasing the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> Movie, giving us our first look at Yoshi and, I'm delighted to report, Birdo.</p>
<p>The two-minute preview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-super-mario-galaxy-movie-nintendo-direct-coming-this-sunday">which debuted overnight,</a> was introduced by Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, and sees Mario and Luigi - seemingly cosplaying as Dune characters - pull up in the Tostarena Kingdom to address a "troubled pipe". Complete with the score we all know so well, the brothers enter what appears to be an ancient temple and meet a very familiar face.</p>
<p>You can check it out below:</p>

<p>We also get to see Baby Mario and Luigi, Peach, Toad, Birdo, and catch Luigi ribbeting in a Frog Suit.</p>
<p>"After the first trailer was released, people were asking, is Yoshi not going to be in the movie?" Miyamoto explained. "Of course he's in it! For over 30 years, Yoshi has been a significant part of Mario's adventure.</p>
<p>"When we began developing Super Mario World, Yoshi was created from the idea of wanting to run around while on a small dinosaur. Mr. Kondo added percussion to the background music, and Yoshi - who's fun to use for running, jumping, stomping, eating things, and laying eggs - was born.</p>
<p>"Even after evolving into 3D, Yoshi has continued to play an active role across different games."</p>
<p>Illumination's Chris Meledandri also confirmed that animation has now been "fully completed", and the movie has moved into post-production, with teams now focused on music and sound design, which includes a 70-piece orchestra.</p>
<p>Along with Mario and Luigi, the upcoming animated sequel will also see Bowser Junior and Rosalina joining the chaos, the latter of which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-gets-its-first-trailer-revealing-rosalina-and-bowser-jrs-voice-actors">is being voiced by long-time Nintendo fan</a>, Brie Larson.</p>

              <p>For some reason, Nintendo decided to hold <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2YywtBYAaw">a “Direct”</a> presentation on a Sunday about the upcoming <em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>. In it, we get a new trailer showcasing a few new <em>Mario&nbsp;</em>characters joining the cast in the sequel, though we didn’t get any confirmation on whether big celebrity actors are voicing them like they are rest of the crew. Yoshi and Birdo will both make their cinematic debut in the movie when it premieres on April 1.</p> <p>The trailer opens with Mario and Luigi investigating a pipe that apparently has some kind of monster trapped inside. The two activate their Fire Flowers and get ready for a fight, only to find that there’s no monster in there, just a scared little dino guy. Aww. Thus begins the beautiful onscreen friendship between the Brooklyn plumbers and a prehistoric sidekick that eats baddies and poops them out into eggs.&nbsp; Though this is the first official reveal of the character, we saw what he would look like back in November <a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-yoshi-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-comes-from-a-box-of-cookie-dough-2000642406">after a cookie dough box revealed his movie look early</a>.</p>

  <p>We also see Birdo and Peach fighting in a brief action montage, but it’s a blink-and-you’ll-miss it shot, so there’s not much to glean from it just yet. Nevertheless, the cast of characters for the second <em>Mario</em> movie is growing pretty substantially, with Bowser Jr. and Rosalina also joining, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-rosalina-bowser-jr-direct-2000643447">as revealed back in the first trailer last year</a>. We even see a glimpse of Baby Mario and Baby Luigi in this latest tease, but it’s unclear if those will be distinct characters or just some kind of transformation state that the brothers go through during their next adventure.</p> <p>At the end of the direct, Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri said that all animation on the film is complete, and it has officially entered post production, focusing on sound design and finishing up the score. Does that mean it’s too late for them to fix whatever the hell is going on with those <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-bowser-jr-eyes-bloodshot-2000643518">gross, bulging eyes on Bowser Jr.</a>? Probably. <em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> isn’t out for another couple of months though, so who knows what other surprises Nintendo still has waiting in the wings.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-dji-gopro-hero13-black-hits-its-lowest-price-as-amazon-offloads-waterproof-action-cameras-2000661985</link>
            <guid>1415488</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The GoPro HERO13 Black features 5.3K60 video, 27-megapixel photographs, and is waterproof, dustproof, and shockproof, with a ruggedized design for capturing professional-quality videos and casual social media posts. The camera has been engineered to withstand muddied, snowy, and wet environments, including up to 10 meters underwater, while continuing to record high-quality video that can be slowed down or repositioned. Additionally, the camera will allow you to continue shooting in harsher environmental conditions thanks to its Enduro battery, which provides longer recording times in extreme temperatures.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6865/">Go to Amazon to buy the GoPro HERO13 Black for $319, down from $430, for a $111 discount and a 26% price reduction.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6865/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The perfect camera to capture all the action in your life</h2>
<p>With the GoPro Hero 13, you can record at 5.3K resolution at up to 60 frames per second, providing your video with greater clarity and detail than standard 4K or 1080P recordings. Additionally, if you’d like to capture both a video and a high-resolution photo, you can do so by pulling still images up to 24.7 megapixels directly from your video in the Quik application. When you’re trying to showcase some of the most exciting parts of your video, such as splashy moments, tricks, and quick movements, slow-motion recording allows you to slow down the action to approximately 13 times slower than real-time.</p>
<p>HyperSmooth 6.0 Stabilization smooths out bumps and small vibrations that may occur when the camera is shaken on trails, in the water, or in the snow. So, even the fastest runs appear smoother rather than choppy. In addition, a water-repellent lens cover helps quickly remove water droplets from the lens, thereby reducing glare in wet conditions. The ruggedized case is designed to protect against knocks, scrapes, and other forms of wear and tear from traveling between shoots.</p>



<p>The updated mounting system, combined with the camera’s small footprint, makes attaching it to new locations a simple process. Included with the purchase of the GoPro Hero 13 is a curved adhesive mount, a mounting buckle, and a thumbscrew, allowing for a basic setup to be attached immediately. Additionally, the Enduro lithium-ion battery is optimized for long runtime regardless of the environment’s temperature. Highlight Video Tools, along with Cloud Backup support, help streamline the process of converting your recorded sessions into completed and ready-to-post videos.</p>
<p>While additional mounting options and lens mods can be purchased separately, all the necessary accessories to get started with the camera are included in the box. These include a USB-C cable for charging and transferring data, a microSD card slot to select the storage capacity based on your intended usage. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6865/">Right now, you can buy the GoPro Hero 13 for $319, down from the typical retail price of $430</a>, and get rugged 5.3K video, enhanced battery life, and expanded creative options with various lens mods in a single, compact package.</p>

<p>The latest trailer for the Super Mario Galaxy movie reveals a couple of fan-favorite characters. Also, it shows that the upcoming film has taken more inspiration from recent Mario games than was once believed.</p>



<p>In a special Nintendo Direct specifically for the Super Mario Galaxy movie, Shigeru Miyamoto revealed the latest trailer for the upcoming film. The trailer begins with Mario and Luigi traveling through the Sand Kingdom from Super Mario Odyssey. They run into several Tostarenans who are excited to see the plumbers. </p>



<p>They point them toward the disturbances they’ve been experiencing. This leads to a dark cavern, requiring Mario and Luigi to use a fire flower, and when they reach the center warp pipe, Yoshi is revealed. At first, they are just as afraid of Yoshi as he is of them, but they quickly realize that they have found a new companion in everyone’s favorite green dinosaur.</p>

<h2 id="h-yoshi-is-not-the-only-character-revealed-in-this-new-trailer">Yoshi Is Not the Only Character Revealed in This New Trailer</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In addition to Yoshi, there was a brief fight scene featuring Princess Peach and Birdo, paying homage to the fact that Birdo was a boss battle in the second Super Mario Bros game. In the trailer, Birdo was shooting eggs at Princess Peach with great ferocity. There was also a brief moment of Luigi wearing a frog suit.</p>



<p>Keegan-Michael Key’s Toad also returns, and he is initially annoyed at the fact that Yoshi immediately joins the group. The whole gang is later seen running away from the realistic dinosaur featured in Super Mario Odyssey.</p>







<p>Chris Meledandri from Illumination also appeared at the end of the presentation to say that the movie was currently in post-production and had finished animation. The movie will be released in theaters on April 1.</p>

<figure data-uuid="cedc5f3abce7c"><a title="Nintendo Life Mailbox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cedc5f3abce7c/nintendo-life-mailbox.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Welcome back, lovely people, to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/mailbox">Nintendo Life Mailbox</a>! We're still in the first weeks of a new year, and we can all now officially confirm that it's...another year. Hmm.</p>
<p>Enough <em>dwelling</em> - there's more than enough of that to do when you click elsewhere on the web. Let's talk video games, shall we? Got something you want to get off your chest? We're ready and waiting to read about your game-related ponderings.</p>
<p>Each month, we’ll highlight a Star Letter, the writer of which will receive a month’s subscription to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">our ad-free Supporter scheme</a>. Check out the submission guidelines at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>So, let's see what you've got to say...</p>
<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - January 2026</h2>
<h3>"[redacted] for his birfday" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I still don't have a Switch 2. I totally want one, but they're SO expensive (living in Japan but playing games from all over the world I'll have to buy the extra expensive "international" version, not to mention a new gigantic SD card since I'm 100% digital, a new Pro controller, etc.). And according to my spreadsheet, I've completed 85 out of 148 or so games on my Switch. I'd love to play fancy new games (or upgrades to older games) on Switch 2, but I'm not exactly in a hurry. In fact, when it was originally released I decided that I'd wait until fancy new colors or an even fancier limited edition of some sort got released.</p>
<p>Well, fancy new colors got released this week, and I absolutely love them. But... it's not a set, and buying a Switch 2 plus extra Joy Cons goes back to my initial complaint.</p>
<p>So like, how much longer do you think I should wait?? My son is demanding that I buy him [redacted] for his birfday, but out of spite I refuse to put that thing on my Switch, so I'd rather buy a Switch 2 and let him have my original to do with as he pleases. Yes, I know, I'm a terrible father. His birfday is approaching very rapidly, though, so I kind of want to use him as an excuse to just take the expensive plunge, but if I DO buy a Switch 2 and a day later Nintendo announces a limited edition Xenoblade 4 Switch 2 I'll never forgive him because obviously it will be his fault. To summarize concisely: Me want buy fancy non-standard Switch 2 but when is happen you think does???<strong><br>
Kurt Asbestos</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, excuses-wise, it definitely won't be getting cheaper anytime soon - and there's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/switch-2-predicted-to-follow-in-playstation-and-xboxs-footsteps-this-year-with-global-price-hike">a good chance the price will go up</a>. Given the global challenges around production and distribution on top of the general economic strife, Nintendo won't be in a rush to put out the inevitable upgraded version, either.</p>
<p>Personally? I don't see them doing some crazy variant for a while. They might put a Triforce on it or something, but I can't imagine them doing a white one (for example) until they've got at least another holiday season ticked off. It would just anger recent adopters still stinging from the hole in their wallet.</p>
<p>Seriously, what monster contemplates putting a Light Purple Joy-Con into a non-matching Light Blue mag slot anyway? <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"2026 has started"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>2026 has started (by the time of the next reader letters issue) and I have 3 Nintendo predictions for the year:</p>
<p>1. Tomodatchi Life Living the Dream gets a direct.<br>
2. The 40th Anniversary of The Legend of Zelda isn't too big of a deal with Zelda news being saved for later in the year for the lead up to the Zelda movie.<br>
3. Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow (and maybe Gold, Silver and Crystal) finally get a Switch release that is much more confusing and annoying than just adding it to Game Boy Nintendo Classics or selling them (be it an NSO price hike around the same time, a 3rd tier of NSO or some other new annoyance).<br>
<strong><em>Aidan</em></strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>"<em>Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Pokémon: Let's Go, Furret! and Let's Go, Porygon2!</em> is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in Summer 2026.</p>
<p>"<em>Pokémon: Let's Go, Furret! and Let's Go, Porygon2!</em> will also be available on Nintendo Switch, and the <em>Pokémon: Let's Go, Furret! and Let's Go, Porygon2!</em> special DLC pack — <em>Pokémon: Let's Go, Furret! and Let's Go, Porygon2! - Dazzling Crystal</em> — will be available for both platforms later in the year. Pre-orders will open after this broadcast and come with a limited-time bonus: the original <em>Pokémon Red</em> and <em>Pokémon Blue</em> for Nintendo Game Boy, available exclusively with this DLC set until February 27th, 2027. Please look forward to future announcements." <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"'more serious' platforms"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Where are all the new colour variations for the Joy-Con 2?! You know times are strange when 'more serious' platforms like the PlayStation and Xbox are churning out different controllers on a quarterly basis, whilst Nintendo leave us in the dark with the boring grey duo... Same for the Pro Controller 2! I'd personally love to see some colours pay homage to the NGC; Indigo, Platinum, and Orange, with coloured buttons to boot!<br>
<strong><em>Moochy</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There they are, Moochy! No sooner had you sent this than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-reveals-first-new-joy-con-2-colours-for-switch-2">Nintendo announced a new boring grey duo</a> with pastel accents.</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind seeing some more interesting colours, but I'd be happy if we could just get through the generation without drift.</p>
<p>Oh, and 'Orange' is so vulgar; it's <em>Spice</em>, darling. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/zelda/related-articles:196020 @ 1769359584 -->
<h3>"whip out something ridiculous"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi there NL gang,</p>
<p>I'm beginning to think that with every Switch 2 Edition Nintendo conjures, there is a unwritten rule that each title must be longer than the other!</p>
<p>*Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV*<br>
*Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World*<br>
And god forbid... *Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabell Park.*<br>
I mean, seriously though, where *do* you draw the line when it comes to something like this? Does Nintendo even care if we need to take a breath midway through announcing them?!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>But I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for now, those three games above _are_ fairly lengthy titles in their own right.<br>
So I think we're safe... and of course now that I've said that, they'll whip out something ridiculous like *Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition = Lubba's Fury* ...There's just no escaping it!<strong><br>
Nintoz</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has become an office joke around these parts. They start to look like equations if you stare at them long enough. 'Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Bowser Jr.'s Big Bash', anyone? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<figure data-uuid="cc158784eeed4"><a title="Link's Awakening amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cc158784eeed4/links-awakening-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h3>"great plastic"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Nintendolife!</p>
<p>I’m a big Zelda fan and I love collecting items from the series. Unfortunately, Nintendo hasn’t released new amiibo for quite some time, despite there being so many interesting characters that could be made into these great plastic figurines.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>I’d like to leave you an idea for a poll on the site...<br>
<strong>Franc001</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, let's do it. (The Mineru's Contruct amiibo is still to come, remember.)</p>

<p>Not a bad selection! A comically enormous Deku Tree amiibo would make me grin, but I'd like a Sprout, too. And a Mido. And a Deku Scrub. An... <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em>It's really cheesy, and not the good kind of cheese." - <strong>L27</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>All kinds of cheeses are good, my friend. Except that Wensleydale with the fruit in it. Horrific idea. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em>it's probably a steaming pile of dung." - <strong>WoomyNNYes</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey, if it looks like dung, and smells like dung, and tastes like...</p>
<p>Oof, probably should have stopped after the first two, in hindsight. Anyone got a Tic Tac? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em>Has research been conducted on this?" - <strong>Davis</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm surrounded by people in lab coats brandishing clipboards as we speak. Several of them are wearing glasses. Spared no expense. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>

		<p>During the Dragon Ball 40th anniversary event, Bandai Namco confirmed that Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero will be getting new DLC, including new characters, stages, new costumes and new super attacks. All of this is in addition to the free Mission 100 update that will be coming to the game on January 26th, allowing players to use different characters to clear challenges and missions.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO – New DLC Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XxDRoyx8zG8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new characters that appear to be confirmed for the Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero DLC include Super Android 17, King Piccolo, Super Saiyan Bardock, Spike the Devilman, Grandpa Gohan, Champa, Tao Pai Pai, Zangya and Pikkon. There is also a glimpse at the new costumes for some of the characters and a very brief view of some of the new stages. The DLC will arrive in the Summer for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS, with the Switch and Switch 2 releases being staggered for after.</p>

<p>In our Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero review, Jason said, <em>“As a modern successor and sequel to the classic PS2 era Budokai Tenkaichi trilogy, Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is a great time for Dragon Ball fans. You’ll have to ease yourself into the controls, but once it clicks it’s a lot of fun to explore the full roster and smash anime characters together.”</em></p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has announced a brand new Dragon Ball game, and it is going to be a completely new entry to the series lore. New Game Project Age 1000 is being created by Akira Toriyama, who is expanding the Dragon Ball universe with new characters and a new world. The teaser trailer shows us who will presumably be the new main protagonist, with this character having the ability to go Super Saiyan.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON BALL | NEW GAME PROJECT &quot;AGE 1000&quot; Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HW4vLS8HIzs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The unnamed protagonist is part of the Capsule Corp and has the initials GS imprinted on his uniform, which could either be a clue related to his name or a rank of some kind. The trailer shows this character battling in a virtual training room against masked attackers, before a mysterious figure enters the room causing the unknown protagonist to go Super Saiyan. More details are expected at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026, which is taking place on April 18th and 19th. The Age 1000 game is expected to launch in 2027.</p>

<p>We went tactical <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-final-fantasy-tactics-a2-grimoire-of-the-rift-ds">last week</a>, as we matched up a pair of covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/final_fantasy_tactics_a2_grimoire_of_the_rift">Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift</a> on the DS, and it's got to be said, the results were the most one-sided we've seen in a long time. The bright European / Japanese version took home a staggering 90% of the vote, leaving the bland North American variant with a measly 10%. <em>Oof</em>.</p>
<p>With a new Yoshi game on the horizon, we're throwing it back to one of the delightful dino's most beloved entries (in the handheld space, at least), as we take a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/super_mario_advance_3_yoshis_island">Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island</a>. Those with a good memory might remember us tackling the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/08/poll_box_art_brawl_duel_55_-_super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">SNES original</a> way back in 2020, but the GBA version comes with a pair of covers all of its own, so let's take a look at them.</p><div><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytbhK3W_3CW7w" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97fzyqxnu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<h2>Europe / North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="0d7b39a2a9d7d"><a title="SMA: Yoshi's Island - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0d7b39a2a9d7d/sma-yoshis-island-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2227-super-mario-advance-3-yoshis-island">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European and North American cover will be instantly familiar to those who remember the SNES layout. It sees Yoshi and Baby Mario merrily making their way across the island as a giant Nep-Enut emerges from the water behind them. It's clean, it's colourful, it's iconic.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="3d1c930803cc2"><a title="SMA: Yoshi's Island - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3d1c930803cc2/sma-yoshis-island-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2227-super-mario-advance-3-yoshis-island">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the flipside, the Japanese design opts for something far less level-based. Baby Mario and Yoshi still take centre stage, but they are instead surrounded by a bunch of other Yoshis, all decked out in different pastel colours to stress the multiplayer potential. The pink background might not tell you quite as much about a typical level structure as the NA/EU cover, but it is really rather cute.</p>

The Dragon Ball Genkidamatsuri was held in Japan over the weekend to celebrate the global manga, anime and video game phenomenon. Taking up the huge Makuhari Messe event space near Tokyo, the event featured everything from exclusive merch, live game contests, and specially-curated exhibits of original artwork. The main stage was packed with exciting announcements about where the series is headed after the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/akira-toriyama-creator-of-dragon-ball-and-manga-pioneer-dies-at-68"><u>death of series creator Akira Toriyama</u></a>, including two new anime TV series, a new game and a “massive” new DLC for Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Dragon Ball Super: The Galactic Patrol Anime</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The event kicked off with a brief talk between Son Goku’s Japanese VA Masako Nozawa and Dragon Ball series executive producer Akio Iyoku, followed by the premiere of a <a href="https://youtu.be/VSPa8C2WYTw?si=gnTb9cHARYZJJY85" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>special video</u></a> marking the 40th anniversary of Dragon Ball. Featuring music specially composed by Hans Zimmer, the film celebrates the evolution of Dragon Ball over the years, from Toriyama’s original manga drawings through to its various anime adaptations. The end of the video revealed a brand new anime series, Dragon Ball Super: The Galactic Patrol, prompting excited clapping from the audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Ball Super: The Galactic Patrol will adapt the Moro or Galactic Patrol Prisoner Arc (Chapters 42 to 67) of the Dragon Ball Super manga. It follows on from the Universe Survival Arc of the Dragon Ball Super anime, which aired between 2015 to 2018. Dragon Ball Super: The Galactic Patrol is currently in production, and fans will have to wait until 2027 to see Son Goku and Vegeta battle it out against Moro.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/25/dragon-ball-1769330257081.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A key visual for the new Dragon Ball Super anime was revealed.</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Age 1000 Game Project</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, Iyoku was joined on stage by Dragon Ball Games producer Masayuki Hirano, who revealed a <a href="https://youtu.be/pLscMRafsLI?si=W0B4WUhoWDBBte_m" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>flashy trailer</u></a> for a brand new game project, Age 1000. However, the game’s official title will be announced later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Age 1000 project is good news for fans who thought they would never see any new creations from Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama after his death in 2024. Apparently, Bandai Namco started developing Age 1000 around seven years ago, and Toriyama himself put a lot of work into the game’s worldbuilding and brand new characters. The trailer shows a mysterious grey-haired young man decked out in Capsule Corp gear, with Hirano revealing that “I asked Toriyama sensei to create this character especially for the game.” Although the new character seems like a new Super Saiyan, Hirano was tight-lipped about who he is. However, fans will have to wait for Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 (to be held on April 18-19 in LA) for further details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The project’s name calls to mind Dragon Ball Online, which took place in the age 1000- so it seems the new game will also be exploring this time period. “We have spent a long time carefully crafting this project.” Iyoku explained. “I think this game will allow us to experience a brand new part of the Dragon Ball world.” Age 1000 is slated for a 2027 release.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO to get “massive” new DLC</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero producer Jun Furutani revealed that the fighting game will be getting a “massive” new DLC this summer. The trailer for the DLC teased even more playable characters (including Super Android 17 and Demon King Piccolo), new costumes, new super attacks for Vegeta and Goku, as well as new stages and modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upcoming DLC will also have its own theme song, Zero, sung by series veteran Hironobu Kageyama- who is known for his many Dragon Ball Z theme songs. Kageyama performed the new song, saying he was honored to contribute to Dragon Ball again after 18 years. With Zero, he aimed to create a cheerful and powerful song that will energize anyone who hears it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who can’t wait, producer Furutani also reminded PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam players that Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero is getting a free DLC on January 26, the Mission 100 single player mode (which longtime fans will remember from Dragon Ball Budokai Tenakichi 3). He announced that Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 versions of the game will be getting the DLC at a later date: “please bear with us a little longer.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Dragon Ball Super: Beerus Anime</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After lunch, Dragon Ball series executive producer Akio Iyoku and Son Goku VA Masako Nozawa returned to the stage alongside VA Koichi Yamadera for another new anime series announcement. Dragon Ball Super: Beerus, a remake of Dragon Ball Super’s first arc, is coming in Fall 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iyoku describes Dragon Ball Super: Beerus as an “enhanced version of the story.” The upcoming anime series is designed to be “more faithful to the original manga” created by Akira Toriyama. Dragon Ball Super: Beerus will feature enhanced visuals, redrawn and newly added cuts, narrative reworks, and promises to deliver “even more immersive battle scenes” than the original Dragon Ball Super anime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Ball Super: Beerus also aims to show Beerus in a more serious light than the mischievous villain people are used to. “Beerus is a powerful enemy and a powerful character, so I wanted to make sure to bring that out this time.” Iyoku explained. Beerus’s voice actor Yamadera added, “You think he (Beerus) is just a weird uncle talking about food (…) but he’s actually the God of Destruction!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Ball Super: Beerus will be airing on Japan’s Fuji TV in Fall 2026, with details about international distribution expected to be announced soon. For now, check out the trailer, below.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Hype (@DbsHype) <a href="https://twitter.com/DbsHype/status/2015278347702722990?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 25, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Akira Toriyama’s passing, Dragon Ball fans have plenty to look forward to over the next two years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>The Dragon Ball series is currently celebrating its 40th anniversary, and as part of a special '<a href="https://youtu.be/SkH1AHJDW6E">Dragon Ball Genkidamatsuri</a>' event this week, Bandai Namco has shared some video game announcements.</p>
<p>First up, there's <a href="https://en.dragon-ball-official.com/news/01_3963.html">"breaking news"</a> regarding the latest game in the works. It's the official announcement of the new game project "<strong>AGE 1000</strong>". This title, which will get an official name at a later date, has been in development for "about 6 to 7 years now including the initial concept phase". It features a new "never-before-seen world and characters" from legend and series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/akira-toriyama-the-dragon-ball-dragon-quest-and-chrono-trigger-artist-that-inspired-the-world">creator Akira Toriyama</a>, who passed away in 2024.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Toriyama-sensei has been heavily involved in this AGE1000 project, in its world-building, characters, and many other aspects."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AGE 1000 is currently "set for 2027", although no platforms have been revealed at this point in time. As for the details about this story, the team was willing to say much at this stage, but 'AGE' refers to the year in the Dragon Ball world. There's already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1qm6ekl/comment/o1jvyhv/">plenty of speculation</a> about the game as well.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball fans can expect more information about this game at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026, which kicks off in April.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Ball ‘AGE 1000’ is Revealed, and Fans Think It’s Dragon Ball Online 2]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/</link>
            <guid>1415407</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Dragon Ball team recently revealed an all-new project, codenamed ‘AGE 1000’, set to be released in 2027. In a short trailer posted online that showcased a never-before-seen character, it was confirmed that a full reveal will take place on April 18 during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to pick up on the AGE 1000 reference, which until now, has only been used in connection with Dragon Ball Online. This MMORPG debuted in 2010 but has long since been shut down, being replaced somewhat by <em>Xenoverse</em>.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-dragon-ball-game-coming-2027">New Dragon Ball Game Coming 2027</h2>



<p>The Dragon Ball team wrote on social media that AGE 1000 offers ‘a new world and new characters brought to life by Akira Toriyama,’ the father of Dragon Ball. You can see the two-minute teaser trailer below:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Announcing a New Dragon Ball Game Project, "AGE 1000", set for 2027!<br>A new world and new characters brought to life by Akira Toriyama!</p><p> The latest updates will be unveiled at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 in the U.S. on April 18-19.<br>Stay tuned for more information. <a href="https://t.co/ouBqvz5FwA">pic.twitter.com/ouBqvz5FwA</a></p></div>— Dragon Ball Games (@dragonballgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/2015246051461210565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Eagle-eyed fans spotted the AGE 1000 reference in seconds, pointing out that, until now, the only other game to use that setting was Dragon Ball Online.</p>



<p>In <strong>that </strong>game, players are transported to the age 1000 in a time-traveling adventure that sees them explore an open-world environment, search for Dragon Balls, and interact with NPCs and other players on their journey. It boasted multiple classes and races, several settings in terms of time and location, and diverse quest mechanics.</p>



<p>While Dragon Ball Online died years ago, <em>Xenoverse </em>almost took its place, adopting the core story elements and character creation features that surfaced in DBO.</p>



<p>This is why fans think AGE 1000 is a direct follow-on (or reboot) of Dragon Ball Online.</p>

<p>Following the release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mysims_cozy_bundle">MySims Cozy Bundle</a>, there's reportedly been a new EA survey sent out to select Sims players, and it's believed to be hinting at a new MySims game for the Switch and other platforms.</p>
<p>It apparently suggests the game would be a "cozy, collaborative adventure simulation" title where players can "explore a whimsical world, customize their village, befriend residents &amp; pets, and uncover delightful secrets".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067grpxsk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>This title would supposedly offer solo play and multiplayer with "up to four friends". Many <a href="https://simscommunity.info/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/new-mysims-game-features.jpg">other features are listed</a>, too. This latest development follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-removed-ea-app-listings-suggest-more-mysims-revivals-might-be-on-the-horizon">discovery of some MySims game listings</a> in January last year.</p>
<p>Following the release of MySims on the Switch, EA's CEO Andrew Wilson mentioned how the Cozy Bundle had performed "well ahead" of the third-party giant's expectations.</p>
<p>In our review, we gave the Switch bundle seven out of ten stars and said the titles were still engaging and easygoing spin-offs.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/rayman">Rayman</a> series is currently celebrating 30 years, and it seems an announcement could be taking place soon.</p>
<p>A new rating has appeared on the Australian Classification Board for <strong>Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition</strong>. The classification took place on 22nd January 2026. Additional details list Atari as the developer and publisher, and UI Entertainment as the applicant.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8ee436245b45a"><a title="Rayman - Game Boy Color Box Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ee436245b45a/rayman-game-boy-color-box-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ubisoft kicked off Rayman's 30th anniversary celebrations last September and it followed with some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/">rumours about a Rayman Remake</a>.</p>
<p>The original 2D <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/rayman">Rayman</a> platformer launched in 1995. On Nintendo platforms, this eventually followed with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/eshop/rayman_gbc">Game Boy Color version</a>, a Game Boy Advance port, and years later <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/dsiware/rayman">Rayman</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2009/12/rayman_dsiware">for DSiWare</a>. In December last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a> was added to the Switch Online's Nintendo 64 library.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJEHFv10kUS0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6ngkivz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>This rating follows news of Ubisoft's major organisational restructure. Rayman has been confirmed as being part of the company's future plans. Its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">creative house 'CH4'</a> will be responsible for the IP and other "narrative adventure" series such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/prince_of_persia_the_sands_of_time">Prince of Persia</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/beyond_good_and_evil">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a>.</p>

<p>Relive the classic war between WWE and WCW in WWE 2K26.</p>



<p>During the WWE Saturday Night’s Main Event special on January 24, WWE announced that the most expansive edition of the upcoming WWE 2K26 video game would be the Monday Night War Edition.

<p>Pre-orders begin on January 30.</p>



<figure></figure>











<figure></figure>



<p>As announced on January 23, WWE 2K26 will also have a special <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/">Attitude Era edition</a>. The key art for that edition features many legends from the 1990s and 2000s. WWE and 2K have yet to announce who will be featured on the standard edition of the game. Still, much more information has been revealed about the forthcoming WWE video game.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/">As first reported by Insider Gaming, </a>four new match types will be playable in this year’s release. WWE 2K26 will introduce the new Dumpster Match while reviving three classic match types once playable in previous games: the Inferno Match, the I Quit Match, and 3 Stages of Hell. </p>

How do teens in IT classes waste their time these days? When I was a young whippersnapper, when my teacher wasn't looking I'd head to sites like Miniclip, Nitrome, wherever I could get my hands on some Flash games, to play all sorts of little oddities, particularly system heavy ones that were fun to mess around with for 10 minutes once in a while. Games like that feel rare now with the death of Flash, but I think Tower Lab, a physics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> tower defence deckbuilder where you attempt to blast enemies off a ledge into an infinite void to their demise, feels pretty close.
</p>
<p>
Tower Lab works thusly: there are two portals, one where variously coloured upright beans are emitted, another where they enter. You are presented with a selection of cards, all of which cost a certain amount of points, points which you are in limited supply of, that allow you to plant different bits of machinery to try and shove these enemy beans off a ledge.

These machines come in a range of flavours. For example, one is quite simply a fan, turning on every so often to attempt to push the beans off. Some beans are too heavy, however, so you might place a shrink ray earlier along the tower so that they're easier to blow off. A gif on the game's Steam page shows how you can take this even further by shrinking them down, making them weightless, blowing them away, before making them even larger than before so that they fall to their deaths. Systems! They're quite neat, and from what I can tell your technical know-how will be put to the test more and more over the course of the game's various levels.
</p><p>
This is exactly the kind of game I would have loved messing about with as a distracted teen. IT class is a waste of time! But a game like Tower Lab isn't. It's quite satisfying in small doses, and levels don't waste your time either. I quite like the foundations that have been laid here, and look forward to recreating scenes from my youth when it launches later this year. In the meantime, you can wishlist the game on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3084810/Tower_Lab/">here</a>.

			<p>The rumors of a <strong>Resident Evil Code Veronica Remake</strong> have gotten a lot louder over the past month. To kick things off, dedicated CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-resident-evil-remakes-code-veronica-2027-zero-2028/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed in mid-December</a> that Code Veronica and <strong>Resident Evil Zero</strong> would be <strong>the next remakes</strong> on the schedule, with the former targeting a 2027 launch and the latter aiming for a 2028 debut. A few days ago, he added that the closest game to release <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-resident-evil-remake-that-starts-with-c-and-ends-ode-veronica-will-be-announced-this-year-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be formally announced sometime in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Now, though, we have another renowned insider confirming the rumor and even adding to it. <strong>Nate the Hate</strong>, probably <strong>the most reliable insider</strong> at the moment (he also won the <strong>'Leaker of the Year'</strong> award in a community poll on Reddit's GamingLeaksAndRumors), <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2014767509803512263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>Yes, Code Veronica is being remade and deep in development. Target of release is the first half of 2027.</em></p>



<p>This means we might be just a year and a few months away from being able to play the game. So far, all three Resident Evil remakes have been successful, although 2 and 4 have been more successful and critically acclaimed than 3. RE2 Remake is now <strong>CAPCOM's third best-selling game of all time</strong> with <strong>16.30 million units</strong>, only behind Monster Hunter World and Rise, and the far more recent RE4 Remake (which launched in March 2023) is closing in with <strong>11.10 million units</strong> already sold. RE3 Remake, on the other hand, is at <strong>10.60 million units</strong>, which is still not shabby.</p>



<p>In late 2023, CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-more-remakes-coming-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> they were working on more remakes. Franchise fans had long been yearning for the Resident Evil Code Veronica Remake, and for good reason: <strong>the original game was originally an exclusive for SEGA's final console, the Dreamcast</strong>. Sure, it eventually launched on PlayStation 2 and later on GameCube, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, but by then, it was old and didn't get much traction. </p>



<p>For those who haven't played it and are looking forward to this remake, the game takes place about three months after Resident Evil 2. Its protagonists are <strong>the Redfield siblings</strong>, Claire and Chris, who desperately try to survive a viral outbreak <strong>at a remote prison island in the Southern Ocean</strong> and <strong>a research facility in Antarctica</strong>.</p>
