<p>Announced earlier this year, 22nd July marks the second <strong>Pokémon Presents</strong> of 2025. While you're all jamming along to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsskPQsZRaE&amp;ab_channel=TheOfficialPok%C3%A9monYouTubechannel">DJ-ing Pikachu</a> out there, what do we think we're going to see today?</p>
<p>The stream kicks off at <strong>6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm GMT / 3pm CET / 12am AET (Wednesday)</strong> and looks to be roughly around 25 minutes.</p>
<p>We're sure <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is going to show up, and the usual slate of mobile updates will be coming, but we hope to hear more about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_champions">Pokémon Champions</a>, and perhaps that pair of Pokémon GameCube games on Nintendo Switch 2's NSO service.</p>
<p>Well, no matter what's on the horizon, trainers can gather here and talk about everything we're about to see. We'll be bringing all of the news to you, so we might not be around for the chatter here. But still, grab a snack, some drinks, and your favourite plush — it's time to see what's in store for the franchise going forward.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hellraiser-revival-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/single-player-horror-game-hellraiser-revival-announced-by-saber-interactive.1249563/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and Boss Team Games have announced&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival</em>, the first ever dedicated video game based on Clive Barker's immensely popular horror franchise.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival&nbsp;</em>will take the form of a first-person, single-player survival horror game. You'll play as a new protagonist by the name of Aidan, who must rescue his girlfriend from Hell. Now that's a nostalgic plot setup, eh?</p>

<p>Saber's Tim Willits reveals more in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/22/announcing-clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival-horror-that-doesnt-hold-back/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>&nbsp;accompanying the new trailer. In the post, Willits confirms that both melee and ranged weaponry will be available in&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival</em>, and that the development team consulted with Clive Barker himself to make sure the game is "authentic" to the original<em>&nbsp;</em>novels and movies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hellraiser-revival-club.jpg?itok=1AVTLOIt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hellraiser-revival-club.jpg?itok=CGqRC_M5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hellraiser: Revival&nbsp;</em>is the property's first dedicated video game.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, Aidan will also have access to "the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration" to help him navigate Hell and save his girlfriend. You'll be harnessing the box's "infernal abilities" to avoid the wrath of the iconic Pinhead.</p>

<p>Said character will be played by original actor Doug Bradley, who Saber says is "returning to the role for the first time in nearly two decades". I don't think that's accurate, though; Bradley provided his voice for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-hellraiser-update-arrives-on-test-servers" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s Pinhead Killer</a> back in 2022.</p>

<p>In any case, as revealed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-ever-hellraiser-game-announced-with-doug-bradley-returning-as-pinhead" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Barker himself seems enthusiastic about&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival</em>. He says the game captures the "essence" of the property, namely "the seductive pull of suffering" and "the beauty within the grotesque", so if you're a&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser&nbsp;</em>fan, it sounds like you'll be well-served by the game.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival</em>, which shows off a little bit of gameplay as well as the aesthetic of the game, right here.</p>




<p>We don't yet have a release window for&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival</em>, but when it launches, it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1551980/Clive_Barkers_Hellraiser_Revival/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10012313/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/Clive-Barkers-Hellraiser-Revival/9NSWRGZBQ2MC" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

        <p>Revolving around the nature of Stop Killing Games YouTuber Ross Scott's involvment</p>

    </div>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The Stop Destroying Videogames citizens' initiative, the EU petition that's part of the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign, has had an anonymous transparency complaint filed against it.</p>
<p>That's according to Ross Scott, the YouTuber who's become the figurehead of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake">Stop Killing Games</a>, which in case you're out of the loop aims to stop publishers rendering online games unplayable when official support ends. Instead, the movement wants companies to be required to put concrete end-of-life plans in place if they elect to do things like turn servers off.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a video posted to his channel Accursed Farms, Scott said that the Stop Destroying Videogames EU initiative has had an <a href="https://mega.nz/file/W3YTHCqQ#i-D2f_fgILqBILJiavLwX-eh3pUPGnYeaQfdadiFH20">anonymous transparency complaint</a> relayed to it by the European Commission. As the YouTuber makes clear here, this initiative - which is listed as having amassed 1.4 million signatures thus far - has different organisers to the wider Stop Killing Games campaign Scott's become the public face of, despite the latter frequently promoting the former. And, you know, their names being very similar.</p>
<p>The complaint document, which Scott linked in the video's description, accuses the Stop Destroying Videogames initiative of violating the rules for such calls on the European Commission to consider introducing new laws in two ways. It alleges that the initiative's organisers have provided a "false 'no funding' declaration" by leaving the sources of funding section of its <a href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007">listing on the EU site</a> blank, and that there's been "systematic concealment" of major contributions to the campaign.</p>
<p>Both look to hinge on one thing: the nature of Ross Scott's involvement with the initiative. The complaint alleges that the sorts of hours Scott says he's often dedicated to the campaign "far [exceed] any reasonable volunteer threshold". So, the complaint argues that since "professional time investment constitutes quantifiable in-kind contribution under transparency regulations", Scott's involvement  is equal to professional contributions it values at being worth €63,000-147,000.</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQN_ZA5WRpo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>So, to put a bow on things, the complaint's argument is that this sum, which Scott says he very much hasn't been paid because he's been volunteering, should have been declared by the initiative. The complaint also cites Scott frequently being identified as being responsible for or in charge of the EU initiative to back up this claim, to which the YouTuber responded by pointing out that he's not listed among the organisers on the initiative's page and has "no actual authority" over it.</p>
<p>In the video, Scott speculates that this complaint represents "someone...trying to kill the initiative" and implies that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-only-games-prohibitively-expensive-to-create-argue-eu-lobby-group">recent responses to the initiative</a> lead him to think it may be connected to some sort of games industry representative. There's currently no concrete evidence for the latter, given that as the YouTuber says the version of the complaint that's been passed on is anonymous, as is standard protocol with EU transparency complaints. In order to <a href="https://transparency-register.europa.eu/complaint">submit one</a>, you've got to provide details about who you are to the EU, but the body will then "not reveal your identity publicly" unless you ask them to.</p>
<p>Also, when it comes to Scott's fears about this potentially having serious repercussions for the initiative, it's worth noting that <a href="https://transparency-register.europa.eu/faqs-and-contact_en#code-of-conduct-and-complaints">the EU site</a> says the following with regards to what happens to groups who have complaints submitted against their initiatives:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we consider the complaint to be admissible, we will ensure that you receive a copy of the complaint and ask you to provide a reasoned response by a certain deadline.</p>
<p>We may ask you to provide additional information and will treat any information that you indicate to be considered sensitive as confidential. You will be given all possibility to be sufficiently heard before any decision is taken. We expect you to cooperate sincerely and constructively throughout the investigation.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, no talk of any immediate existential threats to the initiative prior to the claims made being thoroughly investigated. Assuming that Scott is being transparent in his arguments above, it seems that the initiative has nothing to worry about from this.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/campaign-asking-eu-to-stop-publishers-destroying-online-games-hit-by-anonymous-transparency-complaint]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Moon Studios, the developer behind the Ori games, will focus on PS5 over Xbox for its forthcoming game No Rest for the Wicked due to "current market conditions".</p>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked is currently in early access on PC, with a console release due in future. But on the <a href="https://x.com/delmontyb/status/1947313884584398874">game's Discord</a>, studio CEO Thomas Mahler stated: "given current market conditions, we might only release on PS5 and potentially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> for the time being - we'll have to discuss things with MS to see what makes sense for Xbox."</p>
<p>It's quite the turnaround, considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ori-and-the-blind-forest">Ori and the Blind Forest</a> (and its sequel) was first released on Xbox with Microsoft as publisher.</p>

<p>Responding to a further comment on social media, Mahler walked back his statement slightly.</p>
<p>"There's nothing to officially confirm yet," he said. "We want to support consoles and just looking at the numbers, PS5 makes the most sense at the moment. Ultimately we'll ship on all platforms, but likely not at the same time!"</p> <div>

<p>Over on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/no-rest-for-the-wicked-may-be-skipping-xbox-due-to-market-conditions-update-dev-reply-added-to-op.1686511/">NeoGAF forum</a>, Mahler provided a further response that this wasn't a "shakedown" of Microsoft but "common f*cking sense".</p>
<p>"Folks, can we drop the conspiracy theory insanity?" he began, adding that co-op and console support are what the community want the most.</p>
<p>"And in order to get there fast, we'll first support the platform that has the most users purely out of resource reasons," he continued. "We're a comparatively small indie studio, so doing a console port at the quality level we want is not a small task. Porting to Xbox means porting to Xbox Series X and Series S and that'll take more time to optimise compared to porting to PS5 and PS5Pro. So we're most likely going to do PS5/PS5Pro first and launch there in order to make fans happy and supply other ports later.</p>
<p>"That's literally all there is to it. And yes, we'll need to discuss with Xbox and Nintendo what the best strategies are to support their platforms and their features in the best way possible and that'll be an ongoing discussion."</p>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked gets off to a "shaky start", according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-review-a-shaky-start-but-theres-potential">our review of the early access release</a> in April 2024. However the game has received multiple updates since then and sits with a Mostly Positive rating on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371980/No_Rest_for_the_Wicked/">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Back in March, Moon Studios secured the publishing rights to the game from Take-Two and announced it was a fully independent studio.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ori-studios-focus-on-ps5-over-xbox-for-next-game-isnt-a-shakedown-but-common-fcking-sense-says-ceo]]></content:encoded>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The developers at Boss Team Games have such sights to show you: the studio just announced that it’s taking the terrifying world of the classic <em>Hellraiser</em> films and turning it into a survival horror game. The new title is called <em>Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival</em>, and somehow it’s the first gaming adaptation of the franchise, which has been around since 1987.</p><p>According to the studio, the game will blend “survival horror with a single-player, story-driven action experience.” And, yes, there will be a dark and mysterious puzzle box. There are also some notable names on board. Doug Bradley, the original actor for <em>Hellraiser</em>’s iconic villain Pinhead, will be reprising the role, and series creator Clive Barker is assisting with the game’s story. In a statement, Barker said that “I’m eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the <em>Hellraiser</em> mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation.”</p><p>While this will be the first <em>Hellraiser</em> game, it’s part of a growing trend of classic horror franchises being adapted for the medium. The likes of <em>Friday the 13th</em> and <em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</em> were turned into asymmetrical multiplayer games, as was <em>The Evil Dead</em>, which was developed by Boss Team.</p><p>Single-player survival horror seems like a better fit for <em>Hellraiser</em>, however, though it’s unclear yet when it might be available. Right now it’s listed as simply “in development.” It’ll be available on the PC, PS5, and Xbox whenever it does launch.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/710637/clive-barker-hellraiser-revival-game-trailer-ps5-xbox]]></content:encoded>

That’s to say nothing of the Disney+ show <em>Ironheart</em>, which felt like it was just unceremoniously dropped on the service with little promotion or fanfare. In righting the ship, Marvel just can’t seem to hit smooth sailing.</p><p>Naturally, then, with the release of the studios newest movie, <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, there’s bound to be some good old-fashioned hand-wringing about the state of the MCU. On paper, the movie is splashy and full of exciting talent. <em>WandaVision</em>—one of the MCU’s biggest successes of what we’ll call its “expansion era”—director Matt Shakman is at the helm, joined by a quartet of beloved actors in the form of Pedro Pascal as Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as the Invisible Woman/Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as the Human Torch/Johnny Storm, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as The Thing/Ben Grimm. From a visual perspective, it boasts a <em>Jetsons</em>-like retro-futurism that’s both timeless and an exciting departure from much of Marvel’s recent output. Shakman also committed to a (welcome) sense of practicality, with an “emphasis on practical sets and props,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/fantastic-four-first-steps-space-race-kubrick-exclusive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/fantastic-four-first-steps-space-race-kubrick-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">per a report from <em>Empire</em></a></span>. All of these signs point to exciting, well, <em>first steps</em> toward ensuring the film is of the utmost quality.</p><p>Yet, <em>Fantastic Four</em> arrives with a healthy dose of concern, under some pretty burdensome circumstances. At once, it’s one of the handful of projects that fell under the great reshuffle, the third reboot of Marvel’s first family in 20 years, and one of the last solo Marvel movies before the release of <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> in December 2026. That last point is especially pertinent, as the lead villain for the upcoming <em>Avengers</em> is none other than <em>Fantastic Four</em> antagonist, Doctor Doom, which means <em>Fantastic Four</em> has to do some more heavy lifting than, say, <em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.</em></p><p>Played by Robert Downey Jr, in a decision that still reads as a desperate attempt at chasing the heyday of MCU years’ past, Doctor Doom <em>is</em> an incredible foe, when done correctly. Doom and Reed’s relationship is richly layered. In comic books, their rivalry dates back to their days at college, where they become bitter rivals with a begrudging respect for one another. They’re mirror images of one another, with Doom isolating himself from others while Reed embraces friends and family. They can’t exist without each other, forged forever in a fire of spite and anger, with Doom refusing to acknowledge that Reed is his superior. This often involves Doom trying to drag Reed down to his level, not unlike the Joker trying to pull Batman into having one bad day.</p><p>The relationship between Doom and Reed informs the backbone of <em>Secret Wars</em>, written by Jonathan Hickman with art by Esad Ribić. After a series of multiversal impacts tear the fabric of reality apart, Doctor Doom manages to salvage the existing universes into a patchwork reality. The culmination of the story involves Reed and Doom facing off, where Doom eventually admits that his tried and true foe would have found a proper way to restore all the disparate universes. Here, at the end of all things, Doom realizes that all his faculties are nothing in the face of Reed.</p><p>With the MCU looking to adapt—either directly or in parts—that very same <em>Secret Wars </em>story in the next two <em>Avengers</em> films, the future of Marvel storytelling hangs on the success of <em>Fantastic Four</em>.</p><p><em>Fantastic Four</em> needs to be a hit. Not only to prove that non-<em>Avengers</em> Marvel movies still have the juice, but to set up the Four and Reed as critical figures before introducing Doom. It’s telling that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZXBFirj6b4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZXBFirj6b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the famed chair video</a></span>, which revealed the expansive cast of the movie, Pedro Pascal’s chair appeared right before Downey Jr’s, seemingly indicating the pair will be critically important to the next <em>Avengers</em> films, a fact confirmed by Shakman who told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/fantastic-four-director-interview-matt-shakman-casting-auditions-1236461087/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/fantastic-four-director-interview-matt-shakman-casting-auditions-1236461087/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Variety</em></a></span> that Reed will be <em>leading</em> the Avengers by the time it’s all said and done. Audiences need to invest in Pascal’s performance as Reed for the emotional throughline of <em>Doomsday</em> and <em>Secret Wars</em> to work. Those <em>Avengers</em> movies may not hit the financial pinnacles of the pre-pandemic success of <em>Infinity War </em>and <em>Endgame</em>, but Disney’s surely counting on them to get as close as humanly possible.</p><p>Every Marvel movie this year has faced some level of concern. But <em>Fantastic Four</em> feels like it has so much riding on it. With such a large gap between this film and <em>Doomsday</em>, a sour note could be the thing that causes the worm to turn on Marvel writ large. But if done right, it’s the buoying force that could sustain a new level of optimism and enthusiasm for the MCU just when it’s needed the most.</p><p>Marvel Comics achieved tremendous success when Stan Lee and Jack Kirby introduced the Fantastic Four in 1961. Now, almost 64 years later, the MCU is looking to four intrepid heroes to do so once again, ushering in a new era of excitement. Will history repeat itself?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-dr-doom-doomsday-avengers-1851786672]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The talent behind Critical Role have previously hinted at their collective desire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critical-role-may-expand-into-video-games/1100-6528190/" data-ref-id="1100-6528190">to create a video game</a>.

Critical Role's Travis Willingham also indicated that characters from the Vox Machina, Mighty Nein, and Bells Hells could appear, but the story "would have to be something brand new."</p><p>Willingham was instrumental in bringing AdHoc into co-development on the new game after he was cast in Dispatch. He noted that Critical Role wants to follow Dispatch's template and open up the narrative based on player choices.</p><p>"We're tossing around ideas, what are we thinking about in terms of scope and budget, and some of the things we must have," said Willingham. "You are going to want to see your favorite characters."</p><p>The actor went on to explain that Critical Role doesn't see its new endeavor as a AAA title, and the team wants to complete the game in a faster timeframe than the typical five-year cycle for larger projects.</p><p>Earlier this year, Critical Role's Darrington Press <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dungeons-dragons-designers-join-critical-role-publisher/1100-6532474/" data-ref-id="1100-6532474">hired two of the designers behind Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition</a> to create new fantasy projects for the company.

            <p>A new development in the troubled history of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/duke-nukem-forever">Duke Nukem Forever</a> has revealed itself. COO of Digital Extremes Sheldon Carter revealed to Eurogamer that while there was an "alternate history" where the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a>-creator took the game under its wing, the studio had its hands full at the time with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">Bioshock</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-darkness-ii">The Darkness 2</a>.
</p>
<p>This conflicts with a May 2022 post by Apogee and 3D Realms co-founder Scott Miller, <a href="https://www.apogeeent.com/devblog/dnf-truth">who wrote a short history of the game</a> after a 2001 build was leaked online. In it, Miller claimed he tried to pass the game onto Digital Extremes.
</p>
<p>Miller stated: "I recognised that DNF was in deep trouble back in 2004 and tried to get the entire game developed by a more experienced studio, Digital Extremes (now famous for Warframe). The owner there was eager to take over DNF from us, and we even had the blessing of our publisher at the time (Take-Two), but this idea was shot down internally. It turned out to be a fatal suicide shot."

<p>But according to Sheldon, Digital Extremes was too busy to take up development of a third game: </p>
<p>"What can I say about this... I mean these are still those stories that are tough, tough to tell. I would say the things that were neat were that we definately got to see it all, and we got to have meetings with George [Broussard, co-founder Apogee and 3D Realms] who was amazing and has always been a cool guy. It was an exciting time for us. I think in the end they ended up being published by 2K right? We were working on The Darkness 2 and Bioshock, both were kind of cranking at that point. So, there's an alternate history [laughs] on how that all worked out. </p>
<p>"But I can't imagine it could have been anything but George's baby to be honest."</p>
<p>When asked if this was the main reason Digital Extremes didn't take on Duke Nukem Forever, Carter emphasised it was moreso the work on The Darkness 2 and Bioshock was taking priority. Carter explained: "I think mainly we were pretty commited with the stuff that we had. <em>My baby</em> at the time was The Darkness 2, that was my obsession.
</p>
<p>"The way our company was structured, we had two games which was really cool, and they were both going at that time with 2K. So it was natural for [3D Realms] to approach, as we were executing two first-person-shooters, but I don't think it ever went to the level that might have been implied. We weren't in a position to aquire it or take it on, it never got to that stage. It was definately cool though!</p>
<p>It turns out this week is a special one for the infamous Duke Nukem Forever. The game took 5,158 days to release since its announcement on the 27th April, 1997. Eventually coming out on 10th June, 2011, 5,158 days later, you've got the 24th July, 2025. How about that! On Thursday, we'll be one Duke Nukem Forever away fron Duke Nukem Forever.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/digital-extremes-coo-claims-digital-extremes-was-too-busy-with-bioshock-and-the-darkness-2-to-take-on-the-troubled-duke-nukem-forever]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Today's the day! The Pokémon Company's next Pokémon Presents broadcast goes live in just under an hour, at 2pm UK time - and you can watch it right here on Eurogamer.
</p>
<p>For anyone watching across in the States, you'll want to tune in at 5am Pacific and 8am Eastern. For Japan, it's a bit later on, taking place at 9pm JST. </p>
<p>Per metadata from the Pokémon YouTube channel, the stream will run for just over 24 minutes (making it one of the longer presentations in recent years).</p>
<p>The livestream was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-presents-livestream-date-reveal-points-to-something-musical-rather-than-simply-an-update-on-pokemon-legends-z-a">teased last week</a> with an image of Pikachu standing in front of a set of speakers and a DJ deck, leading many to think the presentation would announce something music-related.</p>
<p> In actuality, The Pokemon Company <a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/1946525436080480353">revealed</a> that the tease was pointing towards a pre-show music stream. At 1pm, an hour before Pokémon Presents, a pre-event show called "Everyone Gather! DJ Pikachu Live" will show the little yellow mouse channeling his inner-Avicii. Fair enough!</p>
<p>Check out the pre-show concert below.</p>

<p>Other than this peculiar and charming development, we can expect updates on a few key Pokémon titles coming over the next few months; I anticipate updates on the next mainline game (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>), some updates on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Go</a>, new content for Pokémon Pocket TCG, and I'm also hoping for more information on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-shown-at-this-years-pokemon-presents">Pokémon Champions</a> - the upcoming strategy video game developed by The Pokémon Works and published by Nintendo.
</p>
<p>So far, we know the game is coming to the Nintendo Switch, Android and iOS. It has no release date at the time of writing, and basically continues the ideas set out in Pokémon Stadium, way back in 1999. The game will connect with Pokémon Home, so you can use your caught Pokémon from the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-scarlet-violet-walkthrough-tips-9015">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>. It seems like a tentpole project for TPC, and I'm curious to see what more we learn about the game today.</p>

<p>In a previous Pokémon Presents, we also got confirmation that Pokémon Concierge will return for a second season - I'm hoping we'll get a release date for the beautiful, stop-motion Netflix series beyond the vague 'September 2025' window we currently have. For me, it represents a very deep understanding of the Pokémon brand: welcoming, warm, and with a focus on the creatures themselves. I look forward to learning more about it soon.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-pokemon-presents-here]]></content:encoded>

<p>Blames Star Wars for poor performance thus far...</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Ubisoft CEO, Yves Guillemot, has been answering questions during a recent general meeting about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which has struggled thus far to live up to expectations, with rather poor sales figures overall.</p>
<p>Now, ask this writer and he'll tell you that Star Wars Outlaws is a genuinely cracking game, really and truly, and we're all very excited for its Switch 2 release here at Nintendo Life. Indeed, it's likely to prove the console's first 'impossible port' of sorts, especially if it manages to arrive in a decent state, so interest is high in this one, for sure, even for non-SW fans.</p>
<p>With regards to the game's current sales issues, and as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-blames-star-wars-outlaws-missed-sales-targets-on-star-wars-itself-being-in-choppy-waters-but-hopes-further-improvements-and-a-switch-2-launch-can-revive-the-open-world-game/">GamesRadar</a>, Guillemot says that he sees Star Wars itself as part of the problem, with fans perhaps feeling done in with constant TV shows which, in 2024 when the game was released, had sort of run out of steam a little. Yes, we didn't like The Acolyte either, Yves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The game suffered from a number of items. First, it suffered from the fact that it was released at a time when the brand that it belonged to was in a bit of choppy waters, said Guillemot, whilst also acknowledging that the game wasn't quite perfect at any rate, "The game had a few items that still needed to be polished...they were polished and debugged in the early weeks after release, but it did affect sales volumes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily for Switch 2 fans, then, it also seems that the version we'll get our hands on come September 4th will arrive with some added improvements, too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We did heavily improve the game by troubleshooting and debugging. When it will be released on upcoming consoles such as the Switch 2 it will have a new version of the game. Improvements on the game are not finished."</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Steelrising&nbsp;</em>developer Spiders has apparently become the latest studio to be swept up in the ongoing wave of industry layoffs.</p>

<p>According to a LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7353013917415079936/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> by lead animator Erwan Perrin (spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/spiders-greedfall-series-hit-by-layoffs.1249359/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Maxime</a>), Spiders will soon "proceed [with] a layoff plan" which will affect "most of the animation and rig team" at the studio. That's the team that creates character animations and frameworks.</p>

<p>It's not clear exactly how many employees will be hit by the layoffs, but it's not a great sign for Spiders if "most" of an entire team at the studio is being let go.</p>

<p>In many ways, the studio is similar to&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Elex&nbsp;</em>developer Piranha Bytes, which should probably come as more cause for alarm; that studio, which was based in Germany, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">shut down in 2024</a> by parent company THQ Nordic.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>is currently in Early Access, it's not entirely clear what these Spiders layoffs mean for the future of the game. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1997660/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, however,&nbsp;<em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>has a 24-hour peak player count of just 13, so things aren't looking great for the studio.</p>

<p>These layoffs at Spiders are part of a wider industry pattern that has seen multiple studios lay off employees, cancel projects, or shut down entirely, and the phenomenon isn't just limited to smaller studios either.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what these layoffs might mean for Spiders, but I'm concerned about the studio's future. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Valve recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">changed Steam's rules and regulations</a> to give banks, payment processors, and internet service providers some control over the definition of acceptable "adult content" on Steam, in line with their own respective policies. As Valve suggested to RPS in a statement, it was either that or risk a credit card firm or bank blocking Steam purchases at large. Alongside all this, Valve also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy">delisted a bunch of sexually explicit games</a>, including a number of games that depict incest.</p>
<p>Valve have yet to specify which games they've delisted as a direct result of the policy change, or which particular institutions prompted them to make this rather momentous shift. But it looks increasingly like the result of an anti-violent pornography game campaign directed at Valve, Mastercard, Paypal, Visa, Paysafe Limited, Discover and the Japan Credit Bureau in early July, carried out by Australian pressure group Collective Shout. This is the conclusion offered by Collective Shout themselves, anyway - they've described the Steam delistings as <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1946431955446431970.html">a "victory for child safety campaigners"</a>, while commenting that they are now being sent misogynistic abuse and threats by players in retaliation.</p><!--more-->
<p>Founded in 2009, Collective Shout have long called for the banning or delisting of games they regard as violently sexist, exploitative and abusive, as part of a wider campaign against the sexualisation and objectification of women in media. Much of their campaign is based on the argument that there is a causal relationship between such representations and real-life abuse. On their <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/about">About page</a>, they quote a 2016 <a href="https://discovered.ed.ac.uk/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_1783913257&amp;context=PC&amp;vid=44UOE_INST:44UOE_VU2&amp;lang=en&amp;adaptor=Primo%20Central&amp;tab=Everything&amp;query=null,,1995,%20%C2%A91995">meta-analysis of 135 studies of media sexualisation</a> carried out by L. Monique Ward. I don't have the permissions to access it, but according to the abstract, exposure to "sexually objectifying portrayals" of women is "directly associated with a range of consequences, including higher levels of body dissatisfaction, greater self-objectification, greater support of sexist beliefs and of adversarial sexual beliefs, and greater tolerance of sexual violence toward women."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The latest action against Steam appears to have begun on July 11th, when Collective Shout published an <a href="https://archive.ph/o/x5cGQ/https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors">"open letter to payment processors profiting from rape, incest + child abuse games on Steam"</a>. The open letter cites Collective Shout's <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/tags/no_mercy">previous call for the removal</a> of an outright rape simulation game, No Mercy, and states that they have "discovered hundreds of other games featuring rape, incest and child sexual abuse on both Steam and Itch.io". It does not share any details of the games in question.</p>
<p>As a result of this letter, Collective Shout claim to have brought about the delisting of 500 games from Steam, a statement that Valve have yet to corroborate (and which as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/australian-anti-porn-group-claims-responsibility-for-steams-new-censorship-rules-in-victory-against-porn-sick-brain-rotted-pedo-gamer-fetishists-and-things-only-get-weirder-from-there/">PCGamer</a> observe, appears to include a number of duplicate entries). They're also calling for the removal of a further 82 games "tagged with rape and incest", without sharing names.</p>
<p>I think it would be constructive for Collective Shout to specify the games they're referring to publicly, and to articulate the context of the sexual content they're objecting to, given that some of their previous campaigns against "sickening" video games make assumptions that border on misinformation. In 2018, for example, Collective Shout <a href="https://x.com/CollectiveShout/status/964663931439480834">endorsed a petition for a ban</a> on the sale of Quantic Dream's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a> in Australia, declaring that it features "child abuse and violence against women."</p>
<p>I am no great fan of Quantic Dream, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quantic-dream-deny-abusive-working-conditions">have been accused of cultivating sexism in their workplace</a> and who have a track record for <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/detroit-become-human-review-marginalized-struggle/">using sexual violence to define their female characters</a>, but it seems important to insist - as the petition itself acknowledges - that the scenes referred to are, in fact, <a href="https://x.com/BryanDechart/status/939703243956895744">designed to create empathy for the victim</a> as part of a story about social injustice. They are not wish fulfilment for abusers. Collective Shout's endorsing of the petition suggests minimal familiarity with the game they're trying to ban.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>2K Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In 2014, similarly, Collective Shout called for a ban on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s sale in Australia, summarising it as a "video game that encourages players to brutally murder women for entertainment". I think it's fair to say that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a>'s portrayal of women has long been abysmal - this is the series that turns sex workers into health packs and yes, lets you kill them afterwards to recover your fee. I'm interested to see whether <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> changes the record here - it has a female protagonist (and an often-underdressed male co-star), but is also partial to booty shots in trailers.</p>
<p>At the same time, GTA has never been a series designed to indulge fantasies about murdering women and sex workers. The Changelog.org petition in question does not place its allegation in the context of a farcical open world simulation in which it is possible to brutally murder <em>everybody</em>, from pimps to the police. Again, it does not give much indication that Collective Shout and the organisers played the game they're trying to have removed from sale.</p>
<p>Valve's change of policy has prompted an outcry from developers of erotic games and journalists who see this as continuing a pattern of financial institutions using their control of transactions to silence 'taboo' expressions of sex and sexuality - a push for conformity that may accompany a sincere desire to protect children and women from exploitation, or may simply use that professed desire as camouflage for, say, a conviction that trans and queer people are deviants, and that sex work of any kind should be illegal.</p>
<p>The discovery that Collective Shout may have goaded Mastercard and co into demanding changes has fuelled this argument, given Collective Shout's connections to certain fundamentally religious and conservative-leaning organisations such as the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) and Exodus Cry - both of whom signed Collective Shout's open letter from July 11th.</p>
<p>In an investigation for Vice, Ana Valens dug into the history of these groups, which I'll summarise with a few pieces of information from my own research. Exodus Cry are an American Christian non-profit advocacy organization who seek the abolition of the legal commercial sex industry, from porn to strip clubs and sex work, as well as illegal sex trafficking. In 2013, their founder and CEO, Benjamin Nolot, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/11/melissa-mccarthy-exodus-cry-apology">compared abortion to the Holocaust and described gay marriage as an "unspeakable offence to God"</a>, though he says his views on these subjects have changed since.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>NCOSE, meanwhile, were founded by American clergymen in the 1960s, and have asserted that pornography at large is a "public health crisis". Katherine Cross <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/opinion-illuminating-the-shadowy-group-celebrating-valve-s-latest-censorship-drive">wrote a piece for Game Developer</a> in 2018 about NCOSE's previous attempts to have games featuring "sexual exploitation" removed from Steam, concluding that "what these groups actually want has nothing to do with the dignity of anyone, and everything to do with restoring a traditional gender order that criminalizes both sexual expression and sexual labor."</p>
<p>I'd tell you to read the rest of Valens's piece on Vice, but Vice have since pulled the article and a previous article on Collective Shout, without explaining why. Valens has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v">claimed</a> that Vice's parent company, Savage Ventures, called for the removal of her articles "due to concerns about the controversial subject matter - not journalistic complaints". She and several other staffers have now resigned from the site in protest. I'll ask Savage Ventures for comment. In the meantime, you can find a copy of Valens' article on <a href="https://archive.ph/x5cGQ#selection-1137.55-1137.118">the Internet Archive</a>.</p>
<p>As for my own take on the situation, I don't think it can be disputed that violent sexualised media contributes to a culture of violent sexualisation, but the extent of that contribution is difficult to identify and as such, needs to be addressed case-by-case. Collective Shout, so far, have avoided going into details - they haven't disclosed which games they consider abhorrent, or explained why these games in particular are in contravention of Steam's existing prohibition against games that promote hatred, violence, or discrimination based on gender, or which "exploit children in any way".</p>
<p>Collective Voice may be sincere in their anger and desire to protect women and children, but it's not enough to say that certain topics are self-evidently unfit for representation in a work of fiction and enlist vast financial corporations as enforcers - particularly when your choice of affiliations suggests you may have ulterior motives, and particularly when you have a track record for getting important details wrong.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The first-ever Hellraiser game is in development as a single-player, survival horror action release, with the team behind it all promising the chance to experience the infamous series "like never before".</p>
<p>It's coming from Saber Interactive and Boss Team Games, and will of course pit players against Pinhead. For fans of the series, the upcoming game - known as Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival - will also see actor Doug Bradley returning to the role for the first time in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>"Discover the tale of Aidan, who must unlock the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration, a mysterious puzzle box, to help his girlfriend from a hellish abyss," reads the official blurb. "As Aidan, you'll harness the box's infernal abilities to survive your pact with the sinister Pinhead and battle against the twisted cult that worships him and the Cenobites. Fail, and your suffering will be legendary, even in Hell. We have such sights to show you..."</p>
<p>You can check out a trailer for Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival below.</p>

<p>"Working on the first true Hellraiser game has been a venture deep into the recesses of my darkest imaginings," said Hellraiser creator Clive Barker. "The dedication that Saber and Boss Team Games have shown is nothing short of remarkable. They've immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence - the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque - and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold.</p>
<p>"I'm eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation."</p>
<p>Saber head Matthew Karch, meanwhile, called Hellraiser "the quintessential horror franchise", and one which "lends itself perfectly" to a video game.</p>
<p>"Saber has had success with horror IPs in the past, and working alongside Clive to create tense gameplay and a new story that delves into the twisted depths of pain and pleasure has been a real treat," Karch said. "We look forward to opening up the gates of hell."</p>
<p>Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival is available to wishlist now via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>While this will be, in Barker's words, the first true Hellraiser game, it won't be Pinhead's first foray into the world of video game horror. He has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylights-hellraiser-dlc-is-getting-yanked-from-sale-soon">popped up in Dead by Daylight</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/first-ever-hellraiser-game-announced-with-doug-bradley-returning-as-pinhead]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A Fallout New Vegas RTX Remix mod is now in development, aiming to introduce path tracing to one of the most loved entries in the series.</p>



<p>The mod is currently in development by skurtyyskirts, who has provided an overview of what it will feature and a very early look at it. Besides introducing path tracing, which already brings significant improvements in indoor locations but significantly impacts the original atmosphere in outdoor locations, the mod will also introduce new textures that will work better with path tracing. You can take a look at this very early version of the mod below.</p>

<p>Despite having been released 15 years ago, Fallout New Vegas continues to enjoy immense popularity, and it is regarded as one of the finest entries in the post-apocalyptic RPG series. Despite its reputation among fans of the series, the game developed by Obsidian Entertainment never received a sequel, although it is rumored that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-talks-reportedly-happening-at-microsoft-obsidian/">New Vegas 2 could be a thing in the future,</a> something that may have been facilitated by the fact that Microsoft now owns both Bethesda and Obsidian Entertainment. Sadly, it's been over three years since we heard some rumblings about this potential sequel, so the current status of a game that many would be happy to know it's in development is unknown.</p>

            <p>What is the half-life of comedy? WRONG. Comedy is a vibe, not a substance, you buffoon. I know this because I am a man of science. I have played survival crafting game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a> for an unspecified number of hours, and have learned many things. Most recently, I learned that the developers are releasing it from early access peer review today, but the shiny version 1.0 comes with a few notes scribbled hastily in the margins. If you already have a save file and don't want to lose any pet mutants you've trained, you might want to read on. </p>

<p>"Before you update your save to the new 1.0 version, please take your Pests out of their Pest Traps and Pest Wheels!" developers Deep Field Games warn in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/543361383085900698">a guide to upgrading your save</a>. "Pests in cages or wheels will be lost so be sure to set them out to roam before updating!"</p>
<p>Pests, for those uninitiated, are slimy cross-dimensional maggot things that normally attack you, but can be subdued and turned into pets, which is an anagram of "pest". Is rearranging letters an indivisible element of comedy? We do not yet know. Further research is required.</p>
<p>Anyway, the warning above is just one small note in a handy guide that details how much the update is likely to affect players' existing worlds. Mostly, your base, character and story progress will be fine. But pets seem to have proven tricky to cross over. Soups too.</p>
<p>"Due to some changes in how we store soup data (now stored in a better, cleaner way) existing pots full of soup that have been placed in the world will all be turned into Pest Goulash," say the devs. Yes, you do also chop up and eat the pests.</p>

<p>Obviously, if you're coming into Abiotic Factor as a new player none of this will be a problem. Likewise if you intend to restart from the beginning, something which the developers gently suggest is a good option. </p>
<p>"Starting a new world save when 1.0 lands will give you a more 'intended' playthrough with more tools at your disposal," says design director Geoff "Zag" Keene, "but if you don’t want to do that, that’s fine too. I’m not going to make you do anything. I’m not your dad."</p>
<p>Thanks dad - I mean Zag. Whichever way you come at this, you're in for a good time if you slurp often upon survival games. Abiotic Factor was one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-24-favourite-games-of-2024">our favourite games of last year</a> just on the strength of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> adjacent sense of humour. As for the future of the blood-spattered labratory explorer, the devs are "already working on ABF’s next update plans" and promise that it'll continue to see "bug fixes, quality of life improvements and general support". </p>
<p>Version 1.0 is due to come out today at 6pm BST, aka 1pm EDT. Please don't ask me to type out any more time zones. I'm not World Time Buddy. Here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/543361383085904750">a map with all the release times</a> from the developer. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scientifically-funny-survive-em-up-abiotic-factor-is-hitting-version-10-today-and-your-pets-are-in-danger]]></content:encoded>

And Arnie. And it was goofy-ass perfect. The astonishingly po-faced approach to such a ridiculous concept was directed by the soon-to-be mighty John McTiernan, the movie he made before <em>Die Hard </em>(and just 16 years before his career would collapse in a heap of abysmal flops, and 19 before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/what-happened-die-hard-director-905219/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/what-happened-die-hard-director-905219/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">criminal proceedings</a></span> would begin that would end with him spending a year in prison for wiretapping and perjury). <em>Predator </em>was a massive success despite an inevitable critical mauling, but has one of the weirdest legacies of the era.</p><p>Rather than spawning a run of rinse-and-repeat sequels, it instead saw the fantastically incongruous and amazingly terrible <em>Predator 2</em>, a Danny Glover vehicle directed by Stephen Hopkins (<em>Lost in Space</em>), which is basically <em>Babe 2: Pig in the City</em> but with killer aliens. That put the kibosh on the franchise for over a decade, until the satanic deal was struck that allowed spin-off universe&nbsp;<em>Alien vs. Predator</em> to become a movie in 2004. In 2010 we got the almost entirely forgotten <em>Predators</em> directed by the almost entirely forgotten Nimród Antal, then in 2018 <em>The Predator</em> from the occasionally brilliant Shane Black (<em>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</em>, <em>Iron Man 3</em>). That too got slaughtered by critics, and despite making back its money is considered a failure, including by Black himself. (It didn’t help that he cast a sex offender friend of his in a minor role, and then defended this.) </p><p>With all variants of the “Predator” title worn out, this finally brings us to 2022's <em>Prey</em>, from director Dan Trachtenberg (<em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em>), which heads back to 1719, focusing on the predator/prey relationship between an alien hunter and young Comanche woman, and <em>boom</em>, someone had finally figured out a way to make a new <em>Predator</em> movie that didn’t suck. Then just last month, animated feature <em>Predator: Killer of Killers</em> was released, set across four disparate timelines, and again won critics over to a long-struggling franchise.</p><p>So how is Trachtenberg following up this far calmer, far more composed approach to the alien hunter franchise? By going batshit ‘80s crazy, and I am <em>delighted</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="8239222bcc1ef0f19d57d25a5e6468ef" data-recommend-id="image://8239222bcc1ef0f19d57d25a5e6468ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1602" data-height="901" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dek and Thia walk through some wreckage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dek and Thia walk through some wreckage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8239222bcc1ef0f19d57d25a5e6468ef" data-recommend-id="image://8239222bcc1ef0f19d57d25a5e6468ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1602" data-height="901" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dek and Thia walk through some wreckage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Straight away, we get a shot of a synthetic woman, and a view through a camera with the text “WEYLAND-YUTANI BIO-WEAPONS DIVISION” stamped on screen.

Then we have flying ships, behemothic monsters, somehow a bunch of armed humans, and then the closing image of what I’m pretty sure is a P-5000 Powered Work Loader mech suit—the thing Ridley uses at the end of <em>Aliens</em>.</p><p>Apparently an entire language has been developed for the Predators, which stuntman-actor Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi learned for the part, and clearly everyone involved has gone wonderfully, spectacularly mad.</p><p>The only thing that could make this better would be an Arnie cameo</p><p>We only have a few months to wait, the film releasing to theaters November 7.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/predator-badlands-trailer-dan-trachtenberg-prey-aliens-1851786667]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Following the casting news for Nintendo's upcoming Legend of Zelda film, Google has added a sweet little Easter egg.</p>
<p>The Easter egg appears, at least on mobile, when you search for the Link and Zelda actors. That's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reveals-its-link-and-zelda-for-forthcoming-the-legend-of-zelda-film">Benjamin Evan Ainsworth and Bo Bragason respectively</a>. Typing in those actors' names into your search bar will throw up all the expected bits and pieces you would expect - their wikipedia pages, social media accounts, a selection of images and so forth - but also a little nod to their latest castings.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to discover the Easter egg for yourself, please head elsewhere now to avoid it being spoiled.</strong></p>

<p>Right, to the Easter egg. If you search for Zelda actress Bragason, a little note now appears at the top of the page which reads: "Well excuse me, Princess." A little female elf emoji also shows.</p>
<p>This is a nod to Link's catchphrase in the animated Legend of Zelda series, where in a change from the game's the hero actually talks. This expression has become a bit of a meme, often used to respond to criticism (Link often said it to Zelda when she was pointing out some kind of flaw).</p>

<a aria-label="Excuse me, Princess!" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FPxY8lpYAUM?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</p>
<figcaption>Excuse me, Princess! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPxY8lpYAUM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Meanwhile, when you search for Link actor Evan Ainsworth, you will notice that rather than a fully coherent bit of dialogue a la 'Well excuse me, Princess', you will instead see a message that reads: "KYAAAA! HYAAAAA!" A little male elf emoji sits next to this. This is clearly meant to represent the noises of exertion Link makes as he slashes his way through the various foes and dungeons in Hyrule (or, Termina/Koholint/etc).</p>
<p>Of course, Link in the game's famously does not speak, and some titles in the series have given a reason for his muteness. In Legend of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, for example, Link can read Zelda's diary when making his way through Hyrule Castle. In her writings, the princess said she had slowly managed to get Link to open up to her, but he "feels it necessary to stay strong and to silently bear any burden". This "has caused him to stop outwardly expressing his thoughts and feelings", Zelda writes.</p>
<p>"I always believed him to be simply a gifted person who had never faced a day of hardship. How wrong I was..." the Breath of the Wild diary reads. "Everyone has struggles that go unseen by the world... I was so absorbed with my own problems, I failed to see his. I wish to talk with him more and to see what lies beneath those calm waters, to hear him speak freely and openly... And perhaps I, too, will be able to bare my soul to him and share the demons that have plagued me all these years."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>, Zelda can come across a journal entry written by Impa's brother, Lueburry. Here, Lueburry explains that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-famously-mute-link-almost-spoke-in-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Link was "one of the kids" who had been "stolen away" by the strange rifts that had opened up across Hyrule</a>, setting in motion much of the game. According to this entry, "all of the kids taken by the rifts" had lost something, and in Link's case, this was his ability to speak.</p>

<p>It therefore makes sense that Google's nod to Evan Ainsworth's new role isn't a full blown bit of dialogue. I now just wonder how the film's writers will handle this same particular obstacle…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Now, that's what I call a backlog</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure><a title="clair obscur actor Mario 64" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eb2cd6f669cba/clair-obscur-actor-mario-64.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sandfall Interactive</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/xbox-series-x/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is one of those games that, even though it isn't available on any Nintendo consoles - well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-seems-open-to-a-switch-2-port">not yet anyway</a> - we've all likely heard plenty about it thanks to just how widely-acclaimed it's been since launch earlier in the year. And rightly so!</p>
<p>Indeed, this very writer gave the dazzling RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-seems-open-to-a-switch-2-port">a rather nice 10/10</a> over on our sister site Pure Xbox, so yeah, it's a proper all-timer. And therefore, it may come as something of a surprise to learn that Charlie Cox, who plays Gustave in Sandfall Interactive's epic, reckons he hasn't played a video game since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>...which is ages ago.</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-actor-charlie-cox-vows-to-finally-play-the-game-his-first-since-super-mario-64">as reported by Eurogamer</a>, Cox, who spent just four hours recording his lines for the game, and says he feels like a "fraud" as a result, has been chatting during a Q&amp;A at GalaxyCon over in New Orleans, as you can see from the following clip from the chat that's been shared on social media.</p>

<p>The British actor, who was most widely known for his roles in Daredevil and Stardust before his newfound Clair Obscur fame, said that <em>"I remember being in the studio and thinking, 'this is beautiful, the visuals are extraordinary...They've come a long way since Mario 64, which is probably the last computer game I played."</em></p>
<p>Now he's promising to pick up an actual console and play the game that's thrust him into the spotlight as a bonafide video game star, <em>"I wanna play the game,"</em> he remarked, <em>"I need to play the game. I need to get a console first, and then I need to play the game."</em></p>
<p>Maybe, once he's eased back into the pastime with some of his own game, he'll be ready to return to the likes of Mario, who, we think it's fair to say, has changed a little bit since the last time Mr Cox had a blast.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 port of Hitman World of Assassination may have revealed some new details on the system, including a possible hidden system feature.</p>



<p>On the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a good look at the port of the latest entry in the series developed by IO Interactive after having been informed that the game seemingly runs better when lowering the system's resolution. After conducting some tests, the tech experts confirmed that Hitman World of Assassination indeed changes resolution when the system resolution is changed via the system menu, allowing users to enable some sort of Performance Mode by lowering the resolution to 720p. In the GPU-limited Whittleton Creek area, the game is 62.5% faster at 720p, 9.7% faster at 1080p resolution than in 4K resolution, and in the Berlin area, which is similarly GPU-bound, the performance differentials are very similar - 61% faster at 720p, 7% faster at 1080p.</p>



<p>While the discovery of this hidden Performance Mode is quite interesting by itself, there are a few other things that make this unique Hitman World of Assassination feature notable. For starters, the performance difference between 1080p and 4K resolution can only be explained if 4K resolution uses NVIDIA DLSS to upscale the image from a lower resolution, and the around 10% performance difference discovered during testing could very well be the performance cost of upscaling with DLSS from 1080p to 4K resolution. Even more interesting is the fact that the game instantly changes the resolution when the system resolution is changed, which could be a hidden Nintendo Switch 2 system feature,  as the tech experts noted how IO Interactive could have made these display modes options available via an in-game menu if they wished to have them in the game.</p>

<p>Being the first handheld device that uses NVIDIA DLSS, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a very interesting system from a technical standpoint, but each new discovery is making it even more interesting as users delve deeper into what it offers.

			<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-rejects-sony-settlement-over-playstation-game-sales-2025-07-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Reuters</a>, a United States District Court judge from the Northern District of California has rejected a Sony-approved settlement over a PlayStation credits class action lawsuit. The plaintiffs claimed that Sony overcharged for digital games distributed through its monopolized PlayStation Store, and Sony agreed to settle the lawsuit by allocating $7.8 million in PlayStation credits to millions of PlayStation Network users.</p>



<p>However, the judge denied the settlement for a variety of reasons, including the fact that 'coupon settlements' such as this one are 'generally disfavored'.</p>



<p><em>The motion fails to include an estimated recovery had the proposed class prevailed on each claim, and it fails to provide any estimate of the discount applied to the claims. Importantly, though the motion acknowledges the potential damages were smaller than initially contemplated, the motion provides no estimated class recovery given that discovery. These shortcomings alone warrant denial of Cendejas’s motion for preliminary approval because it prevents the Court from meaningfully assessing the fairness of the proposed settlement. Any renewed motion for preliminary approval must include a chart setting forth the anticipated breakdown of the $7,850,000 settlement distribution, including amounts estimated for attorney’s fees, service awards, costs, administration expenses, and other amounts to be paid. From the resulting net settlement amount, Cendejas shall provide a ballpark estimate or range of amounts to be distributed to each Settlement Class Member. </em></p>



<p><em>Moreover, the Settlement calls for Class Members to receive compensation in the form of cash-value PlayStation Network (“PSN”) account credits. The Court views such PSN account credits as settlement coupons, which are generally disfavored. Any renewed motion for preliminary approval must address the propriety of such settlement coupons and whether the value and structure of this settlement remain defensible.</em></p>



<p>For its part, Sony had actually denied any wrongdoing, but added that it was settling to avoid the further expense and distraction of continued litigation. Following this ruling, it remains unclear whether users will actually see those PlayStation credits or not.</p>



<p>A similar lawsuit was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-to-face-7-9-billion-mass-lawsuit-due-to-playstation-store-pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed in the United Kingdom</a>, although the plaintiffs are asking for compensation orders of magnitude greater than the US one.</p>

			<p>What if your computer mouse was designed by Ridley Scott and HR Giger? It feels like that was the elevator pitch for the entire GravaStar brand, a new peripheral maker whose designs are influenced by science fiction and extraterrestrial iconography. In practice, these are peripherals that look utterly unique, organic and ‘alien’, effortlessly standing out amongst the hordes of matte-black plastic devices that litter our desktops.</p>
<p>The Mercury M1 Pro is the first GravaStar offering we’ve had the chance to review, and that fictional elevator pitch feels closer than ever when you take it out of the box. Built from Magnesium Alloy, this is a metal mouse, cool to the touch, with sweeping organic lines entirely at odds with our average idea of technology. Frankly, it’s captivating, and you immediately want to interact with it.</p>
<p>Thanks to the metal framework, this is a mouse with plenty of weight behind it, but not enough that it feels as though you’re going to lose out in a Fortnite head-to-head. The silver frame is open, like an alien skeleton frame, displaying some of the internal mechanisms, including the bulbous glowing RGB ‘body’ within, and that’s definitely going to help to keep your hand cool during long gaming sessions – the honeycomb, not the RGB light, to be clear. Every time I touched the Mercury M1 Pro, I marvelled at how good it felt, and the effect hasn’t worn off through six weeks of testing.</p>



<p>It’s definitely a gaming mouse, and this isn’t for anyone that’s looking for a shy and retiring setup for their desktop. Between the unique styling, metal frame, industrial logos and RGB, you cannot miss this mouse from across the room.</p>

<p>You have your two main inputs on top, both outfitted with mechanical switches that are certified for some ludicrous number of presses. You certainly wouldn’t bank against it achieving those numbers and more, because it feels rock solid in your hand.</p>
<p>The scroll wheel is also incredibly tactile, with a uniquely uneven design that fits into the overarching alien feel. I can see this being a point of contention for some people – it’s unlike any scroll wheel I’ve ever used, and there’s definitely a period of acclimatising yourself to how it feels under your finger, but personally, I ended up loving it. It definitely helps that it feels super defined, and the operation is incredibly smooth and purposeful.</p>
<p>There’s a further two buttons beneath your thumb, each of which can be customised in the GravaStar software and turned to whatever function you need from them. They sit just out of the way, so if you don’t need to use them you can basically ignore them, but they’re easily reached when you’re ready to call on them. You’ll know whether two additonal inputs is enough for your gaming setup, but for everyday work and gaming, it’s perfect.</p>

<p>Putting the GravaStar M1 Pro through its paces with Overwatch 2, showcased the precision and definition afforded by the 26,000 DPI sensor, and the mouse’s 4000Hz polling rate (the number of times your mouse talks to your computer, which is equivalent to every 0.25 milliseconds). Everything feels effortlessly quick, and I have to say that the 88g of weight in the body made my movements feel more precise and on point. While it’s heavier than some go-to mice like the Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 (60g) or a HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Pro (61g), it’s still a very lightweight mouse that compares favourably to the most mice out there, though if you do want to shave off a few more grams, the Mercury M2 has a plastic shell for 79g. And a little extra weight here isn’t necessarily a bad thing, depending on your feel and style of play, as I feel like I might overshoot opponents with something lighter. The responsiveness is helped by teflon plates that sit beneath the body of the mouse, giving you a super smooth and durable material to whizz around on.</p>
<p>All of this is wireless, to boot. The M1 Pro is a tri-mode mouse, usable with a 2.4Ghz dongle, Bluetooth, or wired, though there’s compromises around the unwired options. For one thing, the included dongle only supports a 1000Hz polling rate, with the 4000Hz dongle sold separately. You sacrifice a lot of that peak performance when stepping down to Bluetooth, but you do get up to 200 hours here, when compared to the up to 146 hours using the 1K dongle. In either case, you won’t need to reach for the charging cable all that often.</p>

<p>Coming in at £109, the Mercury M1 Pro is priced competitively. Sticking with MSRP, it’s a good bit less than the aforementioned Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 at £150, but more than the HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Pro’s £100.&nbsp;Of course, you need to add the £25 4K dongle on top, which the HyperX inludes, and the Logitech has even higher 8K polling. They’re not as stylish, but if peak performance and value are what matters…</p>
<p>Life with the GravaStar line of mice is made easier by the option of either a full downloaded app, or the increasingly more common web app portal, which allows you to customise your mouse via your web browser, doing away with the hassle of downloads, updates and further clutter on your desktop. You can customise the RGB lighting here, with a range of effects and a full spectrum of colours to choose from, as well as customise the button layout, which lets you mess with pretty much everything. You can build macros from here too, before assigning them to a button, and it’s all extremely easy and user friendly to put together. This is exactly the customisation experience you’d hope for in 2025.</p>
