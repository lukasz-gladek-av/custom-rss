            <p>
Singing roses, warbling willows, trumpeting daffodills. From rearranging furniture to creating a musical garden, here's a first proper look at Tempopo - the next project from Australian indie developer Witch Beam, studio behind the brilliant Unpacking.
</p>
<p>
A melody-infused puzzle game, it sees you collecting a garden of musical flowers across 60 whimsical floating 3D levels that look a little similar to Nintendo's own Captain Toad. 
</p>
<p>
Tempopo is set to launch later this year for PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S (yes, curiously there's no mention of a PlayStation release for now).

"Use your wits or trial and error to find the perfect configuration, solving puzzles with inventive solutions involving multiple Tempopo performing different roles," Witch Beam's description of the game reads. "Once returned to Hana's garden, the flowers put on a unique musical performance for players to enjoy."

<p>Unpacking was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamers-game-of-the-year-is">Eurogamer's Game of the Year for 2021</a>, and remains a solid favourite around these parts for its subtle storytelling and mindful gameplay.

			<p>During today's Xbox Showcase event, publisher Square Enix and developer Deck Nine Games announced a new entry in the Life is Strange series - Life is Strange: Double Exposure.</p>
<p>According to Square Enix, Double Exposure is an all-new supernatural murder mystery that will appeal to both new and players familiar with the franchise. The game tells the story of Max Caulfield - photographer-in-residence at the prestigious Caledon University. She "discovers her closest new friend, Safi, dead in the snow. Murdered. To save her, Max tries to Rewind time – a power she’s not used in years… instead, Max opens the way to a parallel timeline where Safi is still alive, and still in danger! Max realizes the killer will soon strike again – in both versions of reality.<br>
Only Max can Shift between the two parallel timelines to solve and prevent the same murder."</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>

<p>More details about the title will be revealed during a live stream on July 13 at 9 am PDT/5 pm BST/6 pm CET on the <em>Life is Strange</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/lifeisstrange" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure is slated for a release on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S later this year on October 29. The game is also slated for a Switch release - more details are to be announced. More information about the title can be found on the official Life is Strange website.</p>
<p>The most recent main entry in the Life is Strange series is 2021's True Colors&nbsp; - here's what we wrote about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-true-colors-an-emotionally-painted-masterpiece/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> back then. "Life is Strange: True Colors is another success for Deck Nine, highlighting how well they understand the source material and its connection with the audience. The new characters, location, and power are an instant classic of the series and we can only hope they continue to develop this world alongside DONTNOD."</p>

It is inspired by the real-life events of the 1957 Windscale disaster in the North of England, picking up the story five years after the fire in a fictionalized quarantine zone.</p><p><em>Atomfall</em> is an original title that incorporates single-player gameplay and story elements in ways Rebellion has never attempted before. The studio will be revealing more about <em>Atomfall</em> soon.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_890679"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>“In <em>Atomfall</em>, we wanted to take the picturesque British countryside and flip it on its head,” said Rebellion Developments CEO Jason Kingsley in a press release. “So, this classic picture postcard setting now serves as an eerie backdrop for a dark mystery that players will have to piece together for themselves. <em>Atomfall</em> is a new story based on a real disaster and told in the speculative fiction style typical of 1950s/60s Britain. So, players can expect to see post-war Britain, Cold War paranoia, and mysterious folk <a title="Genres > Horror [426 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> blended with elements inspired by classic British sci-fi like Day of the Triffids, Doctor Who, and The Quatermass Experiment. Growing up in Britain, this style of fiction influenced many of our team and really plays to Rebellion’s strengths as a British games studio. We can’t wait for players to uncover the mystery of <em>Atomfall</em>.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Rebellion Development associate head of design Ben Fisher added, “The quarantine zone in <em>Atomfall</em> has been cut off from the outside world for some time. This means that you’re dealing with a bunch of people that have been left to their own devices and it’s safe to say that things have gone a bit ‘Lord of the Flies’ in places. You’ll need to explore this hostile world and navigate bizarre characters, mysticism, cults, and murky government agencies. Your interactions with these are important and will shape your story. Investigate clues to piece together events, be prepared to scavenge to survive, and remember that every encounter is a matter of life and death.”</p><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

<p data-characters="362" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Frost Giant Studios revealed its upcoming RTS <em>Stormgate</em>‘s third playable faction today as the Celestial Armada. An ancient and advanced civilization, the Celestial Armada traverses the universe in massive world-ships ruled by the Sovereigns, immortal beings. Frost Giant also announced an August 13 release date for the RTS Early Access to begin.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Stormgate faction reveal trailer and developer interview | PC Gaming Show 2024" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hnq6SQnYk94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="758" data-injectable="true">Essentially space nomads, the playstyle of the Celestial Armada looks rather unique compared to the two other factions. The Celestial Armada is built around the Arcship, a flying HQ that assists with the creation of new bases rather than utilizing builder units like the other factions. Similar to the Protoss from <em>StarCraft</em>, buildings constructed by the Celestial Armada will generate a cascade field that expands the possible building area for the faction.</p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Interestingly, the Celestial Armada does not have to worry about supply. This faction starts with the max cap of 300, and can build as many units as their resources allow. Primarily focused on buildings rather than units, the Celestial Armada also has to juggle maintaining an efficient power grid by building power-generating structures to support the many buildings it will construct.</p> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="false">Those wanting to try out the upcoming RTS early can do so by purchasing a Founder’s pack for access on July 30, or wait until it releases for free into Early Access on August 13, 2024 on PC via Steam.</p>

            <p>The maker of superb village builder <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dorfromantik-review-gentle-elegance-from-a-deceptively-challenging-village-builder">Dorfromantik</a> has lifted the lid on its next game, Star Birds.</p>
<p>Unveiled at the PC Gaming Show this evening, Toukana Interactive's new space puzzler is being made in collaboration with German YouTube science channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/inanutshell">Kurzgesagt: In a Nutshell</a>, who are providing the cheerful, cartoon visual style for this asteroid-themed base builder.</p>

<p>Designed to offer a "fresh and accessible" approach to resource management games, Star Birds is all about helping its titular avian explorers establish a thriving mining empire on as many asteroids as they can sink their beaks into. The asteroids in question will be procedurally-generated, and you'll need to work around their unique shapes, sizes and terrains in order to tap the precious materials they hide beneath the surface.</p>
<p>This involves building all kinds of whimsical-looking contraptions, connecting them up with cables and pipes, and keeping them powered by hooking them up to various energy sources - I spied generators and solar panels to name but two of these in the reveal trailer (above), but these machines will no doubt evolve over time as you start to gain access to bigger and better technologies.</p>

<p>You'll also need to look after your birds' various needs and wants as your enterprise starts to grow (rocket-fuel fatballs, anyone?), and from the looks of the reveal trailer, there will be larger mysteries to solve along the way, too.</p>
<p>Toukana say Star Bird's resources and production processes have all been inspired by real science - no doubt informed by Kurzgesagt's expert knowledge on the subject - but you won't need a degree in rocket science to have a good time with it (looking at you, Kerbal Space Program). Rather, the aim is to hopefully teach us something as we get to grips with its colourful building tools, and to pique our interest about the stars above us.</p>
<p>Star Birds is scheduled to launch on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/www.star-birds.com/steam">Steam</a> in 2025.</p>

			<p>South of Midnight, Compulsion Games' <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-a-new-ip-from-we-happy-few-studio-compulsion-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming deep south folktale</a>, has received a gameplay reveal trailer during today's Xbox showcase.</p>
<p>Last year we received a reveal trailer for the upcoming action-adventure, and today Compulsion Games and Microsoft released the game's first gameplay trailer. The footage is taken from around a third of the way through the story and features the main protagonist Hazel alongside her companion Catfish. You can check out the gameplay reveal trailer for the game below.</p>
<p><iframe title="South of Midnight - Gameplay Reveal - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4UHyaaWXuw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alongside the new trailer, the game's<i>&nbsp;</i>Creative Director David Sears, Art Director Whitney Clayton, and Game Director Jasmin Roy also <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/south-of-midnight-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided some additional details</a> about this interesting new upcoming title on the official Xbox Wire. “[Players] are really in control of traversing there,” Jasmin Roy explained about the game's "wide-linear" environments. “So the way we built the environment is because we want players to follow the narrative, but have more to sink their teeth into – you can sometimes see some more open, hub-like sections.”</p>
<p>Art Director Clayton added, "‘The world Hazel comes from is inspired by the contemporary Deep South, but as you dive deeper into the world, things become more mystical and surreal. We wanted the feeling that you’re being pulled into a folktale, rather than, say, crossing a barrier like in Alice in Wonderland.”</p>
<p>The trio also talked about Hazel's weaving powers, which will serve different purposes throughout the game. “We don’t want to reveal everything in this particular gameplay trailer just yet,” said Roy, “[but] the spells are going to be used for traversal, problem-solving, <em>and</em>&nbsp;combat. This is how Hazel expresses the use of her power, through the different gameplay elements.”</p>
<p>Clayton continued, "“We needed to find something that connected to [the lore] and also have this Southern Gothic influence – this idea of taking back feminine crafts, and making them powerful, because we knew we wanted a female protagonist. That concept inspired this idea of a sort of living lace.”</p>
<p>South of Midnight is slated for a release on Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2025 - and <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-may-be-targeting-a-2024-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not the possible 2024 release that a LinkedIn resume appeared to hint at</a>.</p>

			<p>Following today’s big <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, Microsoft and Activision fully pulled the wraps back on what’s sure to be the biggest game of the year with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> Direct. After a couple shaky years for the CoD franchise, this looks like the game fans have been waiting for, with an ambitious campaign, major updates to core gameplay, the return of round-based Zombies, and more. You can check out the full Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct below, provided you have around 25 minutes to spare, or you can scroll on down for our recap of the important points.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qtI25vEDx38?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>Campaign</strong></h2>
<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct provided an in-depth look at the game’s campaign, which is being headed up by Raven Software alongside Treyarch. This looks like one of the more interesting CoD campaigns in some time, bringing to life an early 90s setting, which brings back a wheelchair-bound Frank Woods who acts as a mentor of sorts for new Troy Marshall and a new team. Oh, and yes, Russell Adler is back too.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, Raven is promising more open-ended missions, with different ways to achieve your objectives, some of which don’t involve combat. Yes, you’ll actually be able to talk your way through some scenarios. There will also be a new Safe House campaign hub around which you’ll return to between missions. Here’s a bit more detail about the campaign’s story.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFcallofdutyblackops64.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em>“Black Ops 6 blends the rich and gritty history of previous Black Ops titles with both returning and bold new characters – and veteran Frank Woods acts as the through-line in our story. Across the Campaign, we see a different side of Woods following his traumatic injury at the hands of Raul Menendez. He’s been pulled from the field, and you’ll interact with him as he adjusts to a new role within the CIA.</em></p>
<p><em>His protege is Troy Marshall, who has been making a name for himself in the field. Marshall is a methodical leader, driven by a strong moral compass. They soon realize they must trust each other to get to the bottom of what’s going on, and this must be done without any of their usual resources. They must build their own team of rogue agents, recruiting two intriguing new characters in Felix Neumann, a technical genius, and Sevati Dumas, a mysterious assassin.</em></p>
<p><em>With a mixture of new and familiar faces, a legendary wildcard also returns to the fight – the infamous Russell Adler is back! While his allegiances and motivations remain unclear, this former ally may have become a new and daunting enemy.”</em></p>
<p>And here’s some detail on campaign variety and the more open-ended approach to objectives…</p>
<p><em>“Mission variety is a key component in the twisted, covert world of Black Ops 6. Raven Software has created individual missions from the ground up, with each one also offering diverse methods in the way you approach and execute them.</em></p>
<p><em>For example, one mission involves you infiltrating an old sewer system underneath an opulent casino in southern Europe, and these catacombs are one of many locations that are more ideal for stealth, where only the muffled yells or crumpled falls of the enemy can be heard, before you tactically reposition topside to pull off an audacious heist in the casino itself. Other areas are more appropriate for large-scale battles, such as an assault on a palace in the Iraqi desert.”</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFcallofdutyblackops65.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Omnimovement and Gameplay Updates</strong></h2>
<p>Treyarch is also significantly overhauling core Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 gameplay, with the new Omnimovement system. This allows players to do new, more realistic moves, like slide, dive and shoot, sprint in any direction, shoot, roll, and maneuver while prone, and more. “Intelligent Movement” means this can all be done with fewer button presses, too.</p>
<p><em>“For the first time ever, players can sprint, slide, and dive in any direction (forward, sidestepping, and backpedaling) and move like a true Black Ops action hero. This innovation immediately allows the player to move like never before and seamlessly chain combat maneuvers together, like sliding, diving and a newly enhanced supine prone, all with a full 360 degrees range of motion.</em></p>
<p><em>If you can sprint in any direction, then it logically follows that you can slide and dive in any direction, too. This opened a world of new movement options. With a simple – and extremely engaging – prototype up and running, the team instantly knew this was much more than a modest improvement to the way you maneuver your Operator in combat.”</em></p>
<p>Other significant improvements to gameplay include the ability to fully customize your HUD, and enemies that have more advanced AI and more hit regions, that will result in more realistic death animations. Interestingly, the game will also be boosting its visuals using cloud-based texture streaming, which means, yes, you'll need to have an online connection even when playing single-player.</p>
<h2><strong>Multiplayer</strong></h2>
<p>Activision is holding back on traditional Mutliplayer info until a later reveal, but they’re promising 16 all-new maps at launch (no remasters), most of which will be classic-style three-lane affairs. Theater mode will also be returning to capture your best moments. More info on multiplayer is coming August 28.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFcallofdutyblackops66.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Zombies</strong></h2>
<p>Finally, traditionally round-based Zombies is making its return, with a continuation of the Dark Aether storyline. Treyarch is promising two all-new maps, which will undoubtedly be packed with their usual array of Easter eggs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-order-benefits-game-editions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-orders for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 are now open</a>, with everyone who plunks their money down getting early access to the beta and the Woods Operator pack. There is also the $100 Vault Edition, which includes the following extra content…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFcallofdutyblackops67.jpg"></a></figure>

<ul>
<li><em>“BlackCell” content including -- Full Battle Pass, with access to over 100 rewards, 1,100 COD Points unlocked instantly, 20 Battle Pass Tier Skips, instantly unlocked BlackCell-exclusive content, and special BlackCell variants of Battle Pass Operator Skins, Weapon Blueprints</em></li>
<li><em>Hunters vs. Hunted Operator Pack.</em></li>
<li><em>Mastercraft Weapon Collection.</em></li>
<li><em>GobbleGum Pack.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on PC (via Steam, Battle.net, and Microsoft Store), Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 on October 25. And yes, the game will be available via Game Pass, regardless of what tier you’re signed up for.</p>

<p>BioWare has revealed its plans for a ‘Summer Reveal’ for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>



<p>The following ‘Summer Reveal’ consists of:</p>



<ul>
<li>June 9 – Reveal Trailer</li>



<li>June 11 – 15+ Minutes of Gameplay</li>



<li>June 11 – Summer Game Fest First Impressions</li>



<li>June 14 – Discord Developer Q&amp;A</li>



<li>June 18 – Game Informer Cover Story</li>
</ul>



<p>Today marked the first of the Summer Reveal, which was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-unveils-dragon-age-the-veilguard-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brand-new reveal trailer</a> during the Xbox Games Showcase. </p>



<p>At first glance, the reception seemed to be fairly mixed on the reveal. But we’ll see where BioWare lands at the end of its Summer Reveal event.</p>



<p>“Rally a team of seven companions, each with rich lives and deep backstories. These are characters to befriend, and even fall in love with. Among them, an assassin, a necromancer, and a detective will each bring their own expertise and unique abilities to the fight. You are never alone; decide who to take into battle and together face down demons, dragons and even ancient gods”, the official game description reads. </p>



<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is said to be released later in 2024, but a more precise release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>



<p>When do you think the next Dragon Age game will be revealed? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-games-showcase-black-ops-6-direct-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The Xbox Games Showcase and Black Ops 6 Direct 2024 is over! As usual we gained some insight into upcoming Xbox titles through a selection of new reveals and updates for released titles. Much like last year with Starfield, the showcase ended with an extended look at one special game - and this time it was Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. </p>
<p>Alongside Black Ops 6, we also got a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a>, Avowed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and South of Midnight. And, as you'd expect, many of the games shown are going to be available from Game Pass from day one. Now, let's stop messing about and get the trailers started!</p>
<h3>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h3>
<p>The Xbox Game Showcase began with the campaign trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. Set in the 1990s after the end of the Cold War, it promises to bring guns, action, conspiracies and motorbikes (at least in the cutscenes.)  </p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be released 25th October on PC and Xbox Series X/S. It will also be on Game Pass from Day One. For more on the game, our Chris Tapsell has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forget-levolution-and-drivatars-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-now-has-omnimovement">had an extended look and chatted with its developers</a>. </p>
<p>We also discovered that, sadly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sorry-you-cant-play-as-margaret-thatcher-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">you can't play as Maggie Thatcher</a>.</p>

<p>We then visited the skies with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-look-at-starfields-shattered-space-expansion-but-still-no-release-date">the Shattered Space expanion for Starfield</a>. Here you'll find yourself visiting a mysterious space station, new planets and even the den of the Great Serpent. (Or at least the home of its worshippers.)</p>

<h3>World of Warcraft: The War Within</h3>
<p>It was fantasy time again with the trailer for The War Within expansion of World of Warcraft. My World of Warcraft lore knowledge is pretty darn small, so I had no idea what was going on in that trailer but it didn't look good for our heroes. </p>
<p>The War Within will arrive in World of Warcraft on 26th August.</p>

It is, of course, all about stealth and Snake's codename is Naked Snake this time round. Thankfully, that's because he doesn't have much equipment not because he has no clothes.</p>
<p>Currently, no release date has been announced for Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater.</p>

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 - the latest instalment in Microsoft's long-running aviation sim - launches for PC and Xbox Series X/S on 19th November, introducing aerial firefighting, cargo hauling, hot air balloon trips, and more.
</p>
<p>
Flight Simulator 2024 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-features-an-incredible-list-of-new-flight-activities">announced last June</a>, amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-continue-to-support-flight-simulator-2020-after-launch-of-2024-sequel">some controversy</a> given developer Asobo had previously pledged to provide 10 years' worth of support for the 2020 iteration of the game. Since then, the studio has rather nebulously said it'll "continue to support" the current version after Flight Simulator 2024's release, but this year's outing is undoubtedly its focus.
</p>
<p>
And Flight Simulator 2024 launches with a frankly staggering list of activities, massively expanding the series' reach after a instalment predominatly focused on getting from A to B. There's aerial firefighting, search and rescue, helicopter cargo transport, air ambulances, crop dusting, mountain rescue, skydive aviation, aerial construction, cargo transport, air racing, glider piloting, scientific research, low altitude training, experimental trips, airship tours, hot air balloon trips, plus VIP charter and executive transport services. Oh and it somehow manages to be even more drop-dead gorgeous than its predecessor.

<p>
Over on its <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-release-date-announcement/">website</a>, Asobo calls Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 the "most ambitious consumer flight simulator ever undertaken", one that features the "largest, most diverse and detailed fleet of aircraft, the most complete representation of airports and air traffic, and the most visually stunning rendition of Earth ever created".
</p>
<p>
While Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is officially a full-priced "standalone sequel" to 2020's outing, Asobo has previously confirmed it'll feature all "current aircraft and airports", and will support "virtually all" add-ons available in the current game's paid store, meaning players won't need to purchase them again. Expect plenty more details in the run-up to its newly announce 19th November release on PC and Xbox Series X/S.

			<p>World of Warcraft The War Within, WoW's most ambitious story arc to date, will be released on August 26 and can now be pre-ordered.</p>
<p>Blizzard and Microsoft announced the release of World of Warcraft's 10th expansion during today's Xbox Showcase. To announce the release date, Blizzard released a new trailer for the expansion, which we've included below. <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-q-were-already-building-midnight-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As announced last year</a>, the War Within is the first entry in the new Worldsoul Saga. As said, pre-orders are now open for the upcoming expansion, and those who purchase either the Epic Edition or physical collector’s edition will get early access to the expansion three days early on August 23.</p>
<p>To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise and the 20th anniversary of World of Warcraft, Blizzard is introducing the $25 USD limited-time <a href="http://email.triplepointpr.com/c/eJwczUGOrSAQQNHV4ExTQGFRAwZ_4j4QimjiE4P4TXr1ndfTm5ucHOIshOsgQZMmduR4HrbAGeLsnNdiUTsUpuLQMWXPQIR52IMBgzADa29m66ZiGdll0GUuxUJWCL3t1yFX3c9-tSnVz3CErffrVvafMosyy3NP91avaY29HzKd0pVZ5ByfW5nlajU_6Vve2o481jK-saUWSx9fOVL9yNjrGH-k1b4NLURpZ326QnhTKl3S9of2QIRgpWjDcSVXdFkja_QEbKisDr8LW28teLIWhDJ7sNpEJwYxZ51w-B_MbwAAAP__VkxaWg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://email.triplepointpr.com/c/eJwczUGOrSAQQNHV4ExTQGFRAwZ_4j4QimjiE4P4TXr1ndfTm5ucHOIshOsgQZMmduR4HrbAGeLsnNdiUTsUpuLQMWXPQIR52IMBgzADa29m66ZiGdll0GUuxUJWCL3t1yFX3c9-tSnVz3CErffrVvafMosyy3NP91avaY29HzKd0pVZ5ByfW5nlajU_6Vve2o481jK-saUWSx9fOVL9yNjrGH-k1b4NLURpZ326QnhTKl3S9of2QIRgpWjDcSVXdFkja_QEbKisDr8LW28teLIWhDJ7sNpEJwYxZ51w-B_MbwAAAP__VkxaWg&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1718047758072000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1TfaOykvqAKmKZuVFGohmv">“Welcome to Azeroth” bundle</a>, which includes a level 60 character boost, 60 days of game time, and the Dragonflight expansion.</p>

<p>World of Warcraft: The War Within will be released for PC on August 26 globally. Back in November of 2023, we had a chat with Lead World Artist Kristy Moret and Associate Design Director Maria Hamilton. Be sure to <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-q-were-already-building-midnight-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out that Q&amp;A here</a>. More recently we joined a roundtable Q&amp;A session featuring WoW Production Director Michael Bybee, Sean McCann (Senior Content Designer), and several colleagues from the press to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-war-within-qa-wow-devs-dive-deep-into-every-aspect-of-the-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk about the War Within expansion</a>. We've included a small part of the Q&amp;A session below:</p>
<p><em>"Just to jump in there a little", </em>said when asked about the new Warband feature<em>. "The intent is that at max level, you will be able to do a variety of content and get gear that will be Warbound. The specific quantity of gear is something that we're still going to tune in all of our testing. I think it's pretty reasonable to expect that you won't be able to max gear your character doing the max level content, but may be able to get items that are a little bit lower item level for your alts to help them catch up and make sure that they don't have to do all of that and run around and race behind. But as Sean points out, we will be figuring all that out alongside you as we're testing this on the Alpha together.</em></p>

Sometimes a low-fantasy science fiction story works well, but as I said last year, <em>Starfield</em> really could’ve stood to dazzle us a bit more:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>[<em>Starfield</em>] draws more on the “grounded” sci-fi of material like <em>Star Trek </em>and <em>The Expanse </em>than it does the high space fantasy of <em>Star Wars </em>and <em>Destiny,</em> which isn’t inherently bad, of course. However, it does so in a way that emphasizes their utilitarian view of the future while largely overlooking the elements that make them compelling. Just a dash of space opera fun could have gone a long way in livening up the game’s tone. </p></blockquote><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,195606,195805" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>One of the factions that didn’t get a whole lotta love in <em>Starfield</em> was its very creepy, reclusive, and religiously zealous House Va’ruun faction. Though they’d appear here and there in the main story and side quests, it was rarely enough—especially as they were one of the only interesting factions in the game. Warping to a new star system and hearing Va’ruun ships openly broadcasting a prayer to the enigmatic “Great Serpent” was not only creepy, it offered up a mystery that, sadly, the base game doesn’t let you chase. </p><figure id="" data-id="49605da44654e7ae44637f7bb09519cb" data-recommend-id="image://49605da44654e7ae44637f7bb09519cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="NPCs pray before a strange cosmic landscape." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="NPCs pray before a strange cosmic landscape." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="49605da44654e7ae44637f7bb09519cb" data-recommend-id="image://49605da44654e7ae44637f7bb09519cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="NPCs pray before a strange cosmic landscape." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Thankfully, <em>Shattered Space</em> looks like it <em>will</em> let us chase that mystery, adding in some <em>Dead Space</em> or <em>Event Horizon</em> vibes to its otherwise very vanilla lore. The new trailer has way more color going for it first of all, with vistas that would look more at home in <em>Destiny</em> than what we saw in <em>Starfield</em>. But even the voiceovers in the trailer deliver a satisfying amount of spookiness that makes me want to learn more about these people and what’s in store in this expansion: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Speaker 1: Hold very still and choose your words carefully. They will determine how long you live. You trespass in the home of House Va’ruun. Your fate will be decided by the Great Serpent.</p><p>Speaker 2: Can you feel its embrace encircling your heart? Constricting until there is no more you…Only us.</p></blockquote><p>As anyone who’s played a Dark Brotherhood quest from <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> can tell you, Bethesda RPGs are often particularly compelling when they’re dipping into the creepy side of things. <em>Fallout</em>’s had its share of that as well with “The Family,” a group of people living as vampires beneath the surface of <em>Fallout 3</em>’s map. As with the Dark Brotherhood, having some darkness to roleplay with and immerse yourself into proved to be a lot of fun. Hopefully that will be true of <em>Starfield </em>as well.</p><p><em>Shattered Space</em> launches later in 2024, so time will tell if this expansion gives <em>Starfield</em> some serious character in its colossal, sometimes too empty and drab galaxy.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"Explore the Living Lands, a mysterious island filled with adventure and danger," Avowed's story trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykgkdU1NJUU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube description reads</a>. "As an envoy of Aedyr, you are sent to investigate rumors of a spreading plague with a secret that threatens to destroy everything. Can you save the island and your soul from the forces threatening to tear them apart?"</p><p>In addition to more insight into Avowed's story, a new companion named Giatta debuted in the latest trailer. According to the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/avowed-story-companion-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire blog post</a>, Giatta is a "brilliant and outspoken anticancer" who is a scholar on soul energy and is on a mission to unravel the solution to Dreamscourge.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Obsidian showed an in-depth look at Avowed's gameplay during the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-new-gameplay-shows-off-choice-combat-fall-release-window-xbox-direct-2024">Xbox Developer Direct event this past January</a>.

Early last month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145262/xbox-games-showcase-summer-2024-call-of-duty-direct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge's Tom Warren reported</a> that Obsidian's next project may be released sometime in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-xbox-game-release-windows-for-rest-of-2024-reportedly-revealed">November of this year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-first-campaign-and-zombies-details-first-multiplayer-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is releasing later this year and it continues the story events from 2012’s Black Ops 2. The year is now 1991 and Adler is back and more determined than ever. I went to the Black Ops 6 summit to play some multiplayer and get the low down on campaign and Zombies details.</p><h3>Campaign</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/08/bo6-campaign-adler-motorcycle-1717883399822.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The campaign for Black Ops 6 picks up after the events of Cold War and Black Ops 2. The official timeline was revealed to be Black Ops 1, Cold War, Black Ops 2, Black Ops 6, Black Ops 4, and Black Ops 3. Cold War takes place in 1981 while Black Ops 2 is set in 1989.</p><p>Sometime between then and 1991, where Black Ops 6 is set, a lot has changed for Adler. Unfortunately, some of his past squadmates have died (no spoilers here yet) and Frank Woods has been injured and is relegated to the sidelines in this story.</p><p>Woods is still running his team but just in a different way from before since they had to break away from the CIA, due to being mislabeled as traitors, and go rogue. There’s a new force at play threatening democracy, and Woods and Adler are forced to scrounge up their own resources and team and clear their names.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/08/bo6-campaign-marshall-casino-1717883921314.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Black Ops 6 really leans into the rogue aspect, as this special forces team no longer has access to tech and funding as they did before and are now forced to get creative. These agents are now breaking all the rules they knew before and aren’t really bound to any morals they’ve previously agreed to before, so we’re going to see them get creative and especially violent.</p><p>The campaign seems to really revolve around a “whatever it takes” theme and an “at all costs” mindset. A lot of features from Cold War will be returning to Black Ops 6, like the safe room you can return to after missions and puzzles you can solve for that you find in the world.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/08/bo6-campaign-park-1717883950929.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In addition to returning mechanics, we’re also getting more story options with new dialogue trees with your companions and multiple ways to complete missions. Black Ops 6 is branching out from just being your typical Call of Duty spy espionage storyline to being a fully-fledged campaign story experience that is tailored to how you want to play.</p><p>When you speak with your teammates in safe houses or in the world, you’re able to choose different dialogue options that will then open up unique connections and conversations. In these dialogue trees, there’ll be better looks into the Black Ops lore and references to previous games as they fit into the story.</p><h3>Zombies</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/08/bo6-multiplayer-action-1717883467799.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Black Ops 6 brings back classic round-based Zombies. The Zombies storyline, meanwhile, is directly continuing from Cold War’s campaign, where [SPOILER ALERT] Richtofen is revealed to be the Director who’s locked up Grigori Waver, Elizabeth Grey, and Mac Carver. </p><p>The story follows Dr. Peck who was shown at the ending of the Cold War campaign in Japan in the year 1990 looking for some old friends. Peck is looking to rescue his old crew with a new companion, Maya Aguinaldo, off a prison island that looks and feels like Alcatraz.</p><p>You can play Zombies as any of the Operators you have, but if you play using any of the characters in the story (Weaver, Grey, Carver, and Aguinaldo), you’ll be able to progress the storyline and get additional dialogue related to the campaign.</p><p>There will be two brand new maps at launch: Liberty Falls and Terminus (the prison site). Liberty Falls is set in the Appalachian mountains in a small town with lots of buildings to expand your runs with, while Terminus has multi-level areas set on a small island so you can gain several vantage points unlocking the different levels on the map.</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/08/bo6-zombies-terminus-1717883546051.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Black Ops 6 Multiplayer is keeping all the modern aspects I love about first-person shooters now, but with classic Call of Duty elements. The UI is reminiscent of the original Black Ops but with a new cleaner look that doesn't clutter the screen.</p><p>While the HUD does keep to classic Black Ops looks, like the scorecard font and the circular minimap, you’re actually able to adjust all the on-screen widgets with some new premade presets that change the layout. Similar to how you can adjust the HUD in mobile versions of FPS games, you’re able to reposition where the on-screen widgets are and change the minimap to square if you prefer.</p><p>Hardcore players might rejoice because classic Prestige is returning with 10 total Prestige levels. The max level to hit before you can roll to Prestige is 55, and you can unlock Prestige Master at 1,000 levels. This feature is available to players right at launch so you can start grinding immediately if that’s your thing.</p><p>One of the biggest additions to Multiplayer that I’m really looking forward to is the new omnidirectional movement mechanic. No, it’s not the cool Advanced Warfare movement but it does give the ability for players to sprint, slide, and dive sideways without losing momentum.</p><p>In my opinion, Call of Duty has always suffered in terms of modern FPS movement mechanics due to it leaning more into the “realistic” side of military games. Based on what I’ve seen so far, I’m glad for the change.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/08/bo6-multiplayer-omnimovement-1717883608759.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>It’s not something that’s never been seen before in an FPS, but it’s definitely the first time it’s being used in a Call of Duty title and I anticipate some players needing an adjustment period to get used to that mechanic.</p><p>You <em>can</em> turn the option off, but having played a few matches of multiplayer, I can tell you right now that if you do not utilize that movement tech, you will be at a heavy disadvantage. How far the new movement mechanics will go, I’m not sure. I did ask the developers if tap-strafing, the  ability to change directions mid-air, would be possible now in Black Ops 6 due to the omni-directional movement but was not given a concrete answer.</p><p>I think it’ll take veteran players some time to get used to and the especially technically talented players will jump ahead in skill level at launch. However, I will say the movement felt incredibly smooth and the sliding and jumping chaining felt very satisfying. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/08/bo6-campaign-capitol-station-02-1717883642408.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If you want to optimize your movement in game even further, there’s actually a new intelligent movement button assist system that you can turn on to auto sprint, auto tactical sprint, auto mantle, and even auto crouch when you’re walking for a certain amount of time. Automating a lot of these movements will make game flow much easier for yourself and you can focus on the new omnidirectional movement tech instead.</p><p>Along with new movement mechanics, there are new loadouts with combat specialities and a dedicated melee weapon. So now your loadout will consist of one Primary Weapon, one Secondary Weapon, and one Melee Weapon.</p><p>With perks, there are three combat specialties: Enforcer Perks, Recon Perks, and Strategist Perks. If you select three of the same type of Perk into your loadout, you’ll get a fourth extra perk that aids your specific playstyle.</p><p>You can build up to 10 custom classes that allow you to have up to 5 attachments as default, but you can unlock 8 with the special Wildcard. I wasn’t told about what Wildcards would be in the game but they teased that they revolved around more attachments and potentially having two primary weapons.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Gunsmith, showcase weapon, and shooting range are all returning in Black Ops 6. There will be 16 brand new maps at launch with 12 Core Multiplayer maps and 4 Strike Maps for Gunfight and other additional modes. The two factions in Black Ops 6 are the Rogue Black Ops (the previous CIA agents) and Crimson One (the CIA-backed team).</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/08/bo6-campaign-capitol-station-01-1717883741712.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>There are also 12 new weapons that are era-appropriate for 1991, and new equipment and field upgrades. A few examples include an older prototype of the RC-XD (which is a crude little RC car with a bomb attached to the top of it) and War Cry (a field upgrade that allows you to smash two flares together to give you and nearby teammates a temporary buff).</p><p>Overall I’m really excited to see how Multiplayer and Zombies will play out in beta and launch since the time I got in Multiplayer seemed very promising especially with the new movement and intelligent button assist mechanics. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's called Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, and it stars the main character of the original Life Is Strange, Max Caulfield. It's planned for release on October 29 of this year for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In the trailer we saw today, we got a look at an older Max who still has strange powers. In this game, she's discovered that while she's unable to rewind time the way she used to, she now has the ability to experience two parallel timelines at once. The timelines are identical, but in one timeline, hew new friend Safi has been murdered, and the in the other, she's still alive, but in grave danger. Using her new power, Max must solve and prevent both murders and reunite the two disparate timelines. </p><p>Max previously starred in both the original Life Is Strange (developed by series creator Don't Nod) and prequel Before the Storm (developed by Deck Nine). Both Life Is Strange 2 and Life Is Strange: True Colors alluded to events in these games, but this is the first time Max's story has been picked up in earnest by the video games since then.</p><p>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure will be available in a standard, deluxe, and ultimate editions with various digital and physical bonuses. Ultimate edition purchases will also include early access to the first two chapters two weeks ahead of the game's releaset We can expect more information on Life Is Strange: Double Exposure in a livestream on June 13 at 9am PT.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure Reveal Trailer Screenshots - Xbox Games Showcase 2024</h3></div></output><p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-hidden-nazi-symbols-were-the-tip-of-a-toxic-iceberg-at-life-is-strange-developer-deck-nine">reported on Deck Nine</a> as part of a larger investigation into the company's work culture. We found in our investigation that during the development of Before the Storm, True Colors, and Double Exposure, the C-suite had seemingly protected multiple abusive leaders, encouraged crunch, and allowed bullying of individuals advocating internally for more authentic representation in Life Is Strange. We additionaly reported on a number of canceled partnerships Deck Nine had experienced in recent years and subsequent layoffs, concluding that Deck Nine is largely dependent now on the success of the Life Is Strange franchise to continue to be sustainable.</p><p>You can catch up on everything announced at the Xbox Games Showcase <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">right here</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced"><u>everything Sony announced at its recent State of Play</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-announcements-from-ign-live-2024"><u>everything we’ve shown as part of this year’s IGN Live</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2024-everything-announced"><u>the highlights from this year’s Summer Game Fest presentation</u></a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Developed by Sandfall Interactive (its debut title), the turn-based RPG unfolds in a fantastical world governed by a powerful figure who wipes out countless innocents every year via a mysterious number.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clair Obscur's world is at the mercy of the Paintress, who awakens once a year to paint a cursed number on a monolith. That number causes every person of that age to instantly vanish in wisps of smoke. The citizens dealing with this recurring threat know that her next number is "33" and a brave collection of them have one day to mount an expedition to her island to stop her once and for all. However, these "Expeditioners" are merely the latest of dozens of failed attempts at killing the Paintress. Thus, this team will retrace the steps of every squad that came before them as they explore a dreamlike world filled with dangerous threats.</p>

<p data-characters="90" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">For the first time since 2021, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> brings back round-based zombies. </p> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">As part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtI25vEDx38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Call of Duty</em> Direct</a>, Treyarch confirmed that <em>Black Ops 6 </em>will launch with two round-based zombie maps. Liberty Falls is set in West Virginia during the day, while Terminus is set in a black site area with a dark setting. </p> <p data-characters="643" data-current-count="875" data-injectable="true">Zombies in <em>Black Ops 6</em> continues the narrative that started in<em> Black Ops 6</em>. Treyarch confirmed a mix of new and returning power-ups and a healthy dose of easter eggs for players to put their detective hats on to solve. In addition, the movement overhaul will also be available for players in Zombies. This means that players will be able to slide, dive, and sprint in any direction, and the intelligent movement option allows you to move forward and auto sprint, auto mantle, and auto crouch. Lastly, the new Supine Prone lets you rotate your body while laying prone. Treyarch also teased that there will be new zombie-exclusive features too. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qtI25vEDx38?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="769" data-injectable="true">This has been a long time coming for Zombies fans. Treyarch opted to turn away from round-based gameplay in <em>CoD Vanguard</em> and instead focused on players completing objectives, which went down poorly with the Zombies community. The decision went down poorly, so the development team backtracked and added round-based maps at the end of the title’s life cycle. As it turned out, those two maps wound up being the last two round-based environments for several years. </p>
 <p data-characters="154" data-current-count="154" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, players won’t have to wait much longer, as Treyarch plans to unveil new information about the beloved game mode in the following weeks. </p>

<p data-characters="196" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There were a lot of big announcements to come out of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-at-the-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Showcase</a>, but the actual biggest announcement was likely the new <em>Life is Strange</em> and the return of original protagonist Max Caulfield.</p> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-brings-back-max-caulfield-launches-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a></em> was dropped seemingly out of nowhere at the Xbox event in a franchise that many assumed was dormant, if not done entirely. Not only does the franchise live on, but it’s also bringing back fan-favorite Max, the original game’s master photographer with the ability to travel through time. </p> <p data-characters="148" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true">Fans are having a huge response on Twitter, and it’s honestly heartwarming to see so many people excited for the return of Max after so long. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true">Max Caulfield is the protagonist of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-did-life-is-strange-come-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2015’s <em>Life is Strange</em></a>, an episodic series about a college student who discovers she can travel backward in time by looking at photos. With her newfound power, Max sets about trying to solve a murder and prevent her friend’s death. </p>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">The game infamously ends by facing the player with an impossible decision: go back in time and allow the murder of your friend and possible romantic partner, Chloe, to happen, or allow the entire city of Arcadia Bay be destroyed by a massive hurricane. </p> <figure data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'M SO EXCITED FOR THIS!!! Def gonna have me in tears again but it's so worth it!!</p>— Fine🫧 (@ofc_fine) <a href="https://twitter.com/ofc_fine/status/1799872722014454179?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why didn't i know of this before.

 <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="217" data-injectable="false">No word yet on if the game will canonize one of the original’s endings or feature the protagonists from the other sequels, but none of that matters right now. All the fans really care about is that Max is back. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/all-digital-xbox-series-x-will-debut-this-holiday/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has unveiled three new variants of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> consoles, with the most intriguing of the three being the all-digital Xbox Series X. All will be available later in 2024 in time for the holidays.</p>
<p><iframe title="Three New Xbox Series X|S Consoles - World Premiere Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzDPNi77F24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The all-digital Xbox Series X will come in the Robot White of the Series S, feature a 1TB SSD, and most importantly ditch the disc drive. This will be priced at $449.99/€499.99 ERP​ – a $50 saving on the standard Xbox Series X, but only matching the original launch price of the console (the price was hiked last summer).</p>
<p>If you still like optical drives, then there’s also a special edition Xbox Series X with a sparkly Galaxy Black design and featuring a 2TB internal SSD. This will set you back $599.99/€649.99​ ERP, so a $100 jump over the main console.</p>
<p>And if you liked <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/11/xbox-series-s-carbon-black-edition-gets-a-1tb-internal-ssd-and-350-price/">the 1TB Xbox Series S</a>, but didn’t want it in black, then that will be available in the base Series S white colour scheme. It’s got the same $350 price point.</p>

<p>It would certainly seem that Microsoft has dropped plans for an “adorably all-digital” cylindrical Series X design, which is a a little shame. It would have been a bit more interesting than these variants, with Microsoft seemingly just treading water when all the rumours and insider reports point to Sony having a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/18/report-ps5-pro-specs-leak-reveals-big-gpu-bump-faster-ram-cpu-and-more/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> waiting in the wings.</p>

            <p>Up and atom! There is a British Fallout-like game on the horizon from Sniper Elite studio, Rebellion.</p>
<p>It's called Atomfall, and it was revealed at this evening's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-xbox-games-showcase-right-here-with-us">Xbox showcase</a>. The team describes Atomfall as a single-player survival action game which will see players exploring a post-nuclear environment, and then scavenging, crafting, bartering and - of course - fighting to survive.</p>
<p>While Atomfall's story is fictional, it has been inspired by a real-world nuclear disaster that occurred in northern England in 1957. Players will experience Britain five years after this event, and find that "everything has changed" after that fateful day. You can check out the trailer - complete with British hymns, bunting and phone boxes - below.</p>

<p>"Atomfall blends post-war Britain with Cold War paranoia, folk horror, and elements of classic British sci-fi like Day of the Triffids, Doctor Who and The Prisoner, to create an immersive and thrilling gameplay experience," reads the official blurb. "Set in the rolling British countryside with idyllic pubs, quaint villages, and red phone boxes it soon becomes clear that things are far from normal."</p>
<p><a href="https://support.rebellion.com/hc/en-gb/categories/18824031303325-Atomfall">Atomfall</a> is set to release across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4 and PC at some point in 2025. It will also be available day one on Game Pass. We can expect to hear more "soon", so stay tuned. </p>

            <p>Microsoft and Blizzard have slapped a release date on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4-best-class">Diablo 4</a>'s forthcoming content-o-season Vessel Of Hatred. It's out 8th October 2024, and sees you hooting and hollering down the road to the new region of Nahantu in search of Neyrelle, a character "who is both suffering the fate of her choice to imprison the Prime Evil Mephisto, and seeking a means to destroy him". In the process, you may choose to become "the apex predator of the jungle as the all-new Spiritborn class". You can also recruit mercenaries to help you, fight alongside other players in a new PvE co-op activity, "and more".</p><!--more-->
<p>Microsoft published a cinematic trailer for Vessel Of Hatred during their latest Xbox Game Showcase stream. The trailer is full of horrible squelching noises and screaming. I had it playing in another tab while I was writing up a trailer for the relatively wholesome and unhellish <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playgrounds-fable-slated-for-2025-release-heres-a-trailer-hinting-at-what-its-like-to-play">Fable</a>, and the clashing combination of stimuli has done a number on my brain. I refuse to actually watch the trailer. You can though. Here's the embed. I'm sure it's not as bad as it sounds. They have kids watching these showcases, don't they? I'm sure all the squelching and screaming is just... jungle calls, or something. Possibly a species of forest mushroom that resonates in a bizarre way under certain conditions.</p>

<p>You can learn more of Hatred's Vessel on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3043530/Diablo_IV_Vessel_of_Hatred/">the Steam page</a>. Hang on, they've got pictures of widdle baby cats on there! Not remotely squelchy or screamy or hateful or even apex-predatory! I can get behind that. These are seemingly the new pets that Blizzard have just now added to the game - you'll find them when you next log in. </p>
<p>Long-in-the-tooth Diablo players like Graham will, of course, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4s-first-expansion-revives-diablo-2s-mephisto-the-lord-of-hatred">recognise Vessel Of Hatred</a> as a throwback to the story of Diablo 2.
