		<p>After years of successful collaborations with different video game franchises, Sony has struck a deal with Hasbro’s Wizards of the Coast directly, selling their best-known characters directly into Magic the Gathering.</p>
<p>Launching on 27th October, seven direct-to-consumer products will arrive in a limited print run as part of the PlayStation Secret Lair Superdrop. These are:</p>


<ul>
<li>Secret Lair x The Last of Us Part I</li>
<li>Secret Lair x The Last of Us Part II</li>
<li>Secret Lair x God of War: Greek</li>
<li>Secret Lair x God of War: Norse</li>
<li>Secret Lair x Uncharted</li>
<li>Secret Lair x Horizon: Into the Forbidden West</li>
<li>Secret Lair x Ghost of Tsushima</li>
</ul>
<p>Each ‘Secret Lair’ is a set list of usually five or six defined cards, and will feature the characters and lore of the associated franchise. While the full card lists are yet to be announced, you can be sure we will cover each of them as we know more, ahead of each one launching.</p>
<p>The first drop, featuring God of War’s Kratos and his son Atreus, goes on sale on October 27th at 5pm UK time (9am Pacific Time).</p>


<p>You need to beware generally sell out within an hour, so if you’re a fan, make sure you sign up for alerts at secretlair.wizards.com.</p>
<p>Hasbro’s best-selling cash cow, MTG —&nbsp;which made a whopping 82% of their operating profits last year — has just come off <a href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/why-magic-is-how-it-is-in-2025-and-why-everything-changed">a record-breaking quarter for profits</a>, thanks to<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/final-fantasys-crossover-conundrum-why-nobody-can-preorder-magic-cards/"> the Square Enix collaboration</a>, at 95%.</p>
<p>‘Universes Beyond’, the subsection of Magic with direct tie-ins to real-world franchises, has been crucial to Hasbro’s bottom line, featuring the likes of Doctor Who, Cloud Strife and SpongeBob Squarepants (rather than original characters like ‘Magic’s Pikachu’ Loot, or his carers Jace and Vraska), widening the appeal of the game to new fandoms.</p>
<p>The summer’s MTG x Final Fantasy release was an unprecedented success, with its employees noting that they simply couldn’t print the product fast enough. This lead to the scenes earlier this year where Collector Booster boxes were selling for $1k apiece.</p>
<p>The PlayStation Secret Lair Superdrop is significantly smaller in scale than MTG x Final Fantasy was, which contained several hundred unique cards. Instead, this is seven sets of defined cards, which will sell for a significantly lower price — $39.99 for the regular versions or $49.99 for the foil (shiny) versions (or the equivalent amount in your local currency).</p>
<p>And unlike MTG x Final Fantasy, which could be bought from your local Waterstones, these Secret Lair drops can only be bought from WotC directly, as part of a very limited print run… before hitting the secondary market at a massively inflated price.</p>
<p>While the more recent Spider-Man collaboration with Disney’s Marvel has yet to appear in financial reports, community sentiment seems to be that it has not sold as well. Indeed, resale prices for individual cards are, on the whole, significantly lower than their Final Fantasy counterparts.</p>
<p>We will bring you more information on each of these secret lairs, and whether the cards within them are any good, as soon as we know more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is closing another Final Fantasy 11 server to new players because it's proven too popular.</p>
<p>Back in July, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/23-years-after-its-release-final-fantasy-11s-biggest-server-is-closed-to-new-players-due-to-popularity">popular Asura server was closed</a>, meaning new players would be unable to join. Producer and director Yoji Fujito said at the time the overpopulation "has led to a series of unexpected issues that have managed to affect the quality of that experience somewhat."</p>
<p>As a result, players have instead moved to the next popular server, Bahamut, which has now met a similar fate.</p>

<p>"Bahamut has consistently had the second most concurrent users out of all Worlds and has been close behind Asura in terms of total character population, leading many new adventurers to begin their journeys there," said Fujito in a <a href="http://www.playonline.com/pcd/topics/ff11us/detail/22742/detail.html">new statement</a>.</p>
<p>"While we are pleased to see these Worlds bustling with activity, having too many concurrent users can overwhelm server processes on that World, which affects server responsiveness and increases the likelihood of other related issues."</p>
<p>From 9th October, players will no longer be able to transfer characters to Bahamut, nor will they be able to create new characters. The Vana'diel Adventurer Recruitment Programme will also be suspended for the server.</p>
<p>Fujito added Asura remains closed as the server load remains unchanged despite a slight decrease in player population.</p>
<p>All of this is occurring 23 years after the MMORPG first launched.</p>
<p>So why are so many players returning or joining Final Fantasy 11? There were discount campaigns earlier in the year that have contributed, but it's also due to a crossover with MMORPG follow-up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, which has seen a decline in players following its less popular Dawntrail expansion.</p>
<p>As for Final Fantasy 14, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-and-final-fantasy-14-are-collaborating">Monster Hunter Wilds collaboration is on the way</a>, which will add new mounts and a new battle scenario.</p>

However, not happy with the stunning attention to detail, dinky little game carts, and interchangeable screens that the vanilla Lego GB is rocking, one master builder has decided to bring hers to life.</p>
<p>In what's got to be some sort of record for a mod turnaround, Australian Game Boy modder and self-taught circuit-board designer <a href="https://nataliethenerd.com/">Natalie the Nerd</a> has got her Lego handheld playing real GB games via real carts with nary a Raspberry Pi or other modern doodah in sight.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6spvonr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Indeed, this is the real deal, with Natalie explaining to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/790093/lego-game-boy-natalie-the-nerd">The Verge</a> that she put together a bespoke Game Boy circuit board with actual chips, and all that other stuff that goes inside these things. Magic and that.</p>

<p>Working with the "smallest screen kit on the market", the main target in this build was to get a circuit board inside the set that was smaller than the dimensions of the set itself, which she has achieved, albeit by removing one or two bricks.</p>
<p>The Game Boy's buttons, which aren't yet finished, will be set onto a bespoke PCB and, with the whole thing already wired for USB power, she says she'll release the circuit-board designs once she's done with the build, ensuring that everything can indeed be awesome for us all. Hooray!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.nataliethenerd.com/i-turned-the-lego-game-boy-into-a-working-game-boy-part-1/">Natalie goes into much more detail about the planning and build process on her blog</a> - we highly recommend you give it a read!</p>
<p>Now, you'll have to excuse us, we're off to build our own set. It won't play games, though, so Natalie has sort of ruined it now. Do any of you folks know how to build circuit boards?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/d-d-co-op-game-project-baxter-is-canceled-by-starbreeze-to-refocus-on-payday-franchise.1314538/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Project Baxter, the D&amp;D based cooperative game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in December 2023</a> by Starbreeze, has been canceled by the Swedish game developer. The news was <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-presents-updated-strategy-doubles-down-on-payday-and-expanding-the-heisting-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared this morning by Starbreeze</a>, which is 'refocusing' on its owned IP, PAYDAY, according to CEO Adolf Kristjansson:</p>



<p><em>I want to sincerely thank the Baxter team for their passion and creativity, and express appreciation to Wizards of the Coast for their support. Though we have made the decision to not continue forward with this project, we are proud of what was achieved in Baxter, and those contributions will carry forward into PAYDAY and the future of Starbreeze. By concentrating our efforts on PAYDAY, we give Starbreeze and all our employees the best chance to succeed.</em></p>



<p>Project Baxter was slated to launch in 2026, but it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-is-still-in-pre-production-yet-starbreeze-says-its-on-track-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still in the pre-production phase in February 2024</a>, which made us skeptical at the time. The decision to discontinue this D&amp;D game might have been a mix of problems with the project and the desire to fix the PAYDAY franchise, which has suffered due to the poor reception of the third installment and, more recently, due to the controversy surrounding the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new PAYDAY 2 subscription</a> and the simultaneous (<a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-admits-mistake-payday-2-subscription-infamous-collection-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now reverted</a>) price increase of the Infamous Collection DLC bundle. This cancellation comes with a write-off of a $27 million investment for the game and the decision to fire around 44 employees between internal developers and external contractors.</p>



<p>Perhaps at some point, we'll get a glimpse of footage of Project Baxter to see what could have been.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-open-world-dd-rpg-from-hidden-path-shown-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It happened in June</a>&nbsp;with the canceled D&amp;D open-world RPG that was in development at Hidden Path.</p>



<p>As a Dungeons and Dragons fan, I hope no more games attached to the franchise get canceled. There's still a healthy lineup on the way, between Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked (out in 2025), a new game from Invoke (the studio behind Dark Alliance), and an action/adventure game in development at Giant Skull. Last month, the president of Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-wizards-of-the-coast-head-wants-new-dd-mmorpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confided that he'd love to see a new D&amp;D MMORPG</a>, though he also suggested it won't be happening any time soon, if at all.</p>

            <p>I’d almost missed that that Motorslice now has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2830030/MOTORSLICE/">Steam demo</a> out, despite enticing gifs of its Brutalist wallrunning and slicey, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-rising-revengeance">Metal Gear Rising</a>-tinged chainsword combat repeatedly finding their way into my Bluesky feed for months. I’m liking it so far, though don’t let its swingbars and trundling excavator enemies trick you into thinking this is some light platformer jaunt.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It is, in fact, quite tricky. Motorslice drops hints of wackiness – its name is derived from the practice of slamming your weapon into a wall and being yanked along by its cycling, biting teeth – and yet traversing the concrete megastructure requires care, even patience. P, your waifu-bait freerunner, has strong hands and lead feet, so there’s a weightiness to movement that’s easy to underestimate, especially on the transition between moves. I hit the dirt multiple times by wrongly expecting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a>-tier sharpness when pinging across walls.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>I'm using official screenshots because mine all came out motion-blurred to bits. Settings slider for the full game maybe hopefully please? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Top Hat Studios Inc.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's not sluggish, mind. It’s just a matter of getting a feel for P’s pace, after which it becomes much more satisfying to chain together hops, runs, and slides into smooth, almost rhythmic sequences of hazard-dodging. Once you’ve got a handle on it, the sense of exertion becomes an outright strength, especially during the demo’s climax: scaling a titanic, malevolent dump truck, its constant rumbling only heightening the peril of making a slip. Like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, if the Colossi were the kind of industrial machinery you’re not supposed to operate after having a paracetamol.</p><p>Fighting the lesser construction 'bots is also harder than it looks, albeit in a much quicker, punchier way. While a chainsaw stroke bisects them in a single hit, you’re just as fragile yourself, and the enemy diggers are both faster and more numerous than your anime tomboy. Non-boss battles are, thus, all about getting in quick and striking first, chopped actuators forming heaps in the sand before your blade finishes revving down. Brief yet bright flashes of near-instinctive action, to counterbalance the more considered parkour.</p>
<p>No release date on this one, but I’m glad there’s seemingly more to Motorslice than <a href="https://x.com/RegularStudio_/status/1869053388518006963">parryposting</a>. Here’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2830030/MOTORSLICE/">link to the demo</a> again.</p>

<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 is a truly amazing piece of hardware"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="fd25317d921e6"><a title="FF7 Tifa" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd25317d921e6/ff7-tifa.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's no secret at this point that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> looks pretty incredible on the Switch 2. We know through the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> that the console can handle some pretty graphically intensive ports, but this one really seems to go above and beyond.</p>
<p>According to director Naoki Hamaguchi via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-says-the-key-to-a-good-looking-switch-2-port-is-not-compromising-on-lighting/">Automaton</a>, making sure the lighting from the original remake was retained on Switch 2 was crucial to making the game look great. Instead, processing load from other areas were reduced to get the game running at a stable 30fps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I believe lighting is the crucial factor in terms of graphics quality and expression in this day and age."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to express gratitude that the team has become a model-case for delivering a high-end game on the Switch 2, before delivering some wisdom that other developers would do well to take on board for their own ports in the coming years:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In our experience, if you just use the hardware properly, you’ll be able to deliver games at the quality players expect. All in all, my honest opinion is that Nintendo Switch 2 is a truly amazing piece of hardware.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's only a few months to go until Final Fantasy VII Remake launches on the Switch 2 on <strong>22nd January 2025</strong>. We honestly can't wait to see exactly how the game holds up on Nintendo's new hardware, and we're thrilled that Rebirth and the untitled third entry will also be following suit in the months and years to come.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-game-reception-unexpectedly-positive-future-games-wont-follow-formula/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-producer-says-game%E2%80%99s-reception-was-unexpectedly-positive-but-future-games-won%E2%80%99t-necessarily-follow-this-formula.1314502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It appears that even the developers of Silent Hill f did not anticipate such a positive reaction from critics and fans. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/NhEFMQmxm1g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking on an IGN Japan livestream during Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>, producer Motoi Okamoto said:</p>



<p><em>I'm grateful that it was rated higher than I'd expected. I think you'll understand if you play it, but since it's a game with a lot of challenges, I thought there might be some pros and cons, but it's been very well received, and it has a Metascore of 86, the same as the Silent Hill 2 remake. Well, I was really surprised.</em></p>



<p>That doesn't necessarily mean future installments will follow the Silent Hill f formula, though:</p>



<p><em>We'll be putting out something different, with a different flavor. We want to explore all sorts of different aspects of game design and story.</em></p>



<p>Later, Okamoto clarified his statement <a href="https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1972230163380535537" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a tweet published on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>As I said in the interview, not all future Silent Hill games will have the same gameplay as f, but rather I want the series to always be challenging in a good way, so that players can enjoy a different flavor of gameplay with each installment.</em></p>



<p><em>Of course, there are some things that will remain the same, the most important of which is the quality of the story. I am convinced that a psychological story is essential to what makes Silent Hill unique, and I will continue to focus on that point and release future titles with confidence.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>



<p><em>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</em></p>

I have been sort of enjoying former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> executive producer Mark Darrah's reinvention as a Youtuber who trades insider BioWare anecdotes for merch. He's got an actual T-shirt line, including a T-shirt for babies upon which Mark threatens to "pump NFTs" unless you buy his gear. Respectable Crazy Uncle energy. Maybe don't invite him to your kid's baptism. But maybe do watch his new video about what might happen to EA's many development studios in the wake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">the company's $55 billion acquisition</a> by Donald Trump's son-in-law, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and the gilded suits of Silver Lake.
</p>
<p>
The tl;dr/tl;dw is that Darrah thinks EA's various sport game teams, like Madden and EA Sports FC, are probably fine under the new privately-owned EA. Those games bring home a lot of bacon, after all, and EA's new dads in Riyadh are keen on sports in general. He's less confident about the studios clustered under EA Entertainment, and especially those such as Darrah's old joint BioWare who might have more pronounced cultural objections to the new ownership, based on the kinds of stories they tell.

<p>
Darrah - who worked at BioWare for 23 years before leaving in 2021 - prefaces his comments with the disclaimer that he is not a proper financial analyst or a solid source of hot tips for investors, noting "that any attempt that I've ever made to predict what a stock is going to do has been wrong, even when I've tried to take my wrongness into account". Nonetheless, he argues that EA "has been looking to change its corporate structure for a while", with plans including "a potential merger with NBC Universal", and that the acquisition will likely accelerate that transformation, because the consortium who bought EA did it with $20 billion of borrowed money, and the interest on that loan is going to stack up fast.
</p><p>
There follow some hypothetical napkin calculations in which Darrah suggests that EA might have to pay a billion dollars a year, just to keep up with the debt. For context, EA<a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf"> reported net income of $1.273 billion in the year ending March 31st 2024</a>. "So, the company as it currently stands is in a dangerous position." 
</p>
<p>
Going private will save EA some money by getting rid of the "giant accounting group that's necessary to prepare your finances for your public statements", but this will be a drop in the ocean, Darrah continues. He thinks we can expect job losses across EA's organisation, and possibly even some studio closures.
</p>
<p>
Which teams might be particularly affected? Well, Darrah reckons EA Sports at large are "very safe", primarily because they make a lot of cash. Darrah notes that around three-quarters of EA's revenue in 2024 came from live service projects, and that EA's various football and American football series accounted for a large chunk of that cash. 
</p>
<p>
He also notes that Saudi Arabia's PIF - who previously owned around 10% of EA shares, which have now been rolled into the acquisition - are partial to investing in sporty things, whether as a means of relieving Saudi Arabia's dependency on oil revenue, or as a distraction from the Saudi government's tendency to treat women like second-class citizens and have critics of their rule imprisoned or killed.</p><p>"It's hard to imagine that acquiring a $55 billion media company, which is ultimately what EA is, won't play into that effort, won't be used in some way to further their own political goals in terms of public perception of the country," Darrah comments. One comparison point here is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisofts-deal-with-saudi-arabia-over-free-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-has-reportedly-seen-staff-pushback">Ubisoft's recent collaboration with the PIF to make an Assassin's Creed: Mirage DLC pack set in 9th century AlUla</a> - it's arguably government-sponsored virtual tourism.
</p>
<p>
Darrah thinks the various developers and series grouped under EA Entertainment could be in trouble, however. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, at least, is "a consistent cash revenue source". As for Battlefield, "I guess we will see what happens with Battlefield 6". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>? "Potentially not" a good fit for the "messaging desires of the three groups that are involved in the acquisition", but the series does make money. Which leaves the studios who haven't shipped anything yet, or not in a while, or who've shipped games that did terribly.

<p>
"The groups working on the Marvel games and, of course, BioWare are, I think, going to be in a different position," Darrah notes. "If this is a PR move for the Saudi government as much as it is a financial one, the studios that don't have much of a track record, what you might do is just come in and put your thumb on the scale and push their messaging in directions that you want, in directions that make you look good or at the very least, steer them away from messaging that makes you look bad. 
</p><p>
"But for the studios that have more of a track record, especially a track record that maybe doesn't line up with your own political views - again, BioWare - you're going to look at that studio and wonder how you make them fit into your new structure," he goes on. "It's hard to imagine that you have BioWare pivot from having very progressive messaging to having the reverse, because it's what the government wants. It's hard to imagine that the public perception of a game that comes out of BioWare, even if you do do that, isn't apocalyptically bad. 
</p>
<p>
"So in that case you either have to decide that you're willing to just leave it alone, or you have to think that they don't fit anymore within the goals of this new organisation."
</p>
<p>
For what it's worth, my own experience of working for arch-capitalists sitting on giant hills of money is that they are generally OK for you to swing left, providing this adds to the height of said giant hill of money. After all, Disney were happy to profit from Andor. I have no real insight on Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, but I suspect they'll be absolutely fine with BioWare expressing all kinds of progressive positions in-game, providing BioWare are sufficiently lucrative. BioWare don't, however, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/01/23/dragon-age-inquisition-performed-half-as-well-as-expected-says-ea/">appear to be sufficiently lucrative for EA</a>, at least under the old regime, so perhaps Darrah is right to suggest that the new owners will seek to sell them off or shut them down.
</p>
<p>
In addition to dangling the prospect of studio sell-offs or closures, Darrah broaches the possible sale of EA intellectual property. EA have historically avoided selling their IPs, Darrah says, because management have not wanted to risk handing off a promising property to a competitor that then proceeds to ean eleventy-squillion dollars. "But as this deal closes, those incentives could radically change," Darrah goes on. "We could enter into a situation where now the incentives are to shed costs or generate revenue if at all possible. We need to generate revenue to pay down as much debt as we can as quickly as we can. We need to cut costs to give us more wiggle room to make sure that we are not in a dangerous position when servicing our debt."
</p><p>
He notes that "EA has a huge repository of dormant IPs that are just sitting there dormant. It seems unlikely that the new resulting structure is going to be eager to suddenly revive a bunch of those IPs. So, one option might be to sell the whole lot of them for $100 million if you could get it, because $100 million can come off the debt." 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
He posits that the acquiring consortium might even try to sell the entirety of EA Entertainment to a group with "deep pockets, like say Sony". Perhaps this has been the plan since the acquisition was first discussed. "It is conceivable that EA's new structure was intentionally conceived with this action in mind. Or you could imagine that what happens is this new [owning group] plucks all the parts it wants out of EA Entertainment and then sells off whatever is left over." Whatever happens, "it's incredibly unlikely that EA stays exactly as it currently is in a private structure, especially carrying $20 billion worth of debt."
</p>
<p>
Darrah does suggest that there might be an upside to the acquisition for a studio like BioWare, in a side-commentary on the rhythms financial management at publicly-owned companies. He argues that the quarterly earnings report cycle of a public company doesn't make much sense for how videogames are developed, because game projects tend to be an on-going cost for years followed by a "burst" of revenue. 
</p><p>
This is part of the reason companies love live service projects with steady monetisation, Darrah says: it doesn't just increase the returns but renders them more predictable. Private companies don't have to report their financials, he says, which means that "if they want to see a studio go dark for 25 years in order to investigate some sort of radical new way to develop games, they can do that."
</p>
<p>
He paints a more optimistic picture of a possible future "where you have EA Sports generating revenue, being this source of cash, servicing the debt and paying money into whatever structure ends up being formed. And then on the other hand, EA Entertainment being tasked with something different. Still making money, but with different time horizons. maybe simply with a goal of making games that sell the most that they possibly can sell regardless of when they release or making games that make EA look good".
</p>
<p>
Even if that comes to pass, however, Darrah seems convinced we can expect job losses and potentially studio closures and the flogging of entire gameworlds, as EA's new owners try to rustle up a few billion for the bank. In what is perhaps a show of Darrah's sense of the idea's viability, he doesn't discuss the recent insider claim that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eas-new-owners-are-making-a-huge-bet-on-generative-ai-cost-cutting-to-help-repay-a-20-billion-loan-claims-report">EA's new owners are gambling on generative AI as a cost-cutting measure in order to repay the debt</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rock-band-4">Rock Band 4</a> will be de-listed later this week, developer Harmonix has stated, meaning this is your last chance to grab any remaining song packs.</p>
<p>The game was original released a decade ago for PS4 and Xbox One, but now the licenses for the core soundtrack are expiring.</p>
<p>As such, the game will no longer be available to purchase and download from 5th October, while DLC song packs will gradually be removed once they hit the ten year mark themselves.</p>

<p>Of course, if you own the game already it will remain in your library, as will any purchased songs.</p>
<p>"We're so grateful for the passion this community has shown," said Harmonix. "From the team, it's been a special experience to serve you with Rivals challenges, a super deep downloadable content library and a best in class band sim. If you've been meaning to grab a few last songs, now's the time."</p>

            <p>Blizzard has announced that player housing will be coming to World of Warcraft starting 2nd December, ahead of the Midnight expansion launch.</p>
<p>This initial rollout for housing will not be feature-complete, with the full suite of mechanics arriving when it enters the game proper at Midnight's launch sometime in 2026. With the housing release in December, players will be able to buy a plot of land, establish a neighbourhood with other players, and begin designing your home with a selection of decor items.</p>
<p>Future updates to housing will include hundreds of decorations, including some furnishings that come from older achievements and content from prior expansions such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-warcraft-legion">World of Warcraft: Legion</a> Order Hall completion.</p>

<p>In addition, players will be able to level up their houses over time, which provides increased interior and exterior decor placement budget, fixture budget, and room placement budget. Neighbourhoods can be both private and public, allowing those from the same guild to build up an estate of sorts together within a variety of biomes.</p>
<p>Not only that, but neighbourhoods will be able to participate in endeavors. These are monthly neighbourhood events that provide exclusive decor to use on participants' homes. As such, some level of community collaboration is intended for the housing system.</p>
<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight is the second part of a three-part trilogy, which started with The War Within last year. It'll take players back to Silvermoon city, where the Blood Elves are having a rough time fending off void ne'er-do-wells. In addition players will be able to play as the Haranir as an allied race, a faction of note throughout The War Within's narrative.</p><p>When Blizzard first announced housing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-shares-first-look-at-world-of-warcrafts-housing-with-unsubtle-dig-at-rival-final-fantasy-14">it did so with a subtle jab at Final Fantasy 14, another popular MMO with its own housing system and housing-related problems</a>. It's worth noting that unlike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, housing isn't limited in World of Warcraft, so players won't be <em>unable</em> to get a house come December, which is good!</p>

			<p>Award-winning game designer and writer Ken Levine, known for his work on System Shock 2 and the BioShock franchise, talked about the similarities and differences of those games with his next title, Judas, currently in development at Ghost Story Games.</p>



<p>In a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPbdgQpA6Uc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published this week by YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a>, Levine claimed that while there are familiar elements (such as dual-wielding powers and weapons), Judas will be radically different in many ways. He also said it can be considered somewhere between BioShock and the first System Shock, meaning it's more complex and offers greater player expression and depth than the most recent BioShock titles.</p>



<p><em>There are parts of Judas that are more similar to Bioshock, and there are parts of Judas that are really, really radically different and it's nice to have some things that you're familiar with. I'm sure people noticed there's a gun in one hand and you got powers in the other hand. We have an additional hacking thing which we haven't shown off that much, but the way the game works and the way the game is populated and the way you choose between these relationships is something we've never ever done before. The way the world is decorated, the way encounters come in, the way you choose paths in the game, those are all so radically different. The way the story is delivered, too. It was good to start with some basis, but this is probably the biggest radical departure we've made since, you know, since I did BioShock. This is more of a departure in some ways than BioShock was to System Shock 2.</em></p>



<p><em>Judas is sort of somewhere between BioShock and System Shock, not between BioShock and System Shock 2, in terms of its depth. It's just a bigger game and a more complex game, but it's in service of doing something we started in BioShock Infinite, which is really how do you build a relationship with characters in games that feels way more granular than you normally see in games where you're really just making a few big choices, but really low-level reaction and commentary, being able to play people off of each other and feeling people getting angry at you and then being able to pull them back from the edge of that anger to and then maybe piss somebody off at the same time. That was what we're most interested in. Also, Infinite felt a little light to me on player expression, so we went back a little more towards player expression and build depth.</em></p>



<p>Levine <a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levines-new-game-is-small-scale-open-world-sci-fiai-themed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first discussed the 'narrative LEGOs' concept around ten years ago</a>. It wasn't until The Game Awards 2022 that Ghost Story Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-announcement-trailer-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled Judas as its debut project</a>, but fans had to wait until March 2024 to get a lot more info from the man <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a massive 75-minute interview featuring Geoff Keighley, Ryan McCaffrey, and Levine himself</a>. </p>



<p>In late August, Ghost Story Games shared the first developer log <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/388860/view/538863491448045972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, confirming that work had finished on the Villainy feature that will ensure emergent gameplay between the player and the game's three potential villains:</p>



<p><em>When you play BioShock or BioShock Infinite, the villain is always going to be the villain. Fontaine, Comstock — they’re always going to be the bad guys. In Judas, your actions will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends. But ignore one of them enough, and they become the VILLAIN. From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals.</em></p>



<p>Judas still has no official release date, but Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-mafia-the-old-country-is-a-wonderful-premium-title-seems-to-confirm-judas-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">included it in the company's 2026 lineup</a>.</p>

            <p>Fresh off of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-londons-first-dlc-rabbit-and-pork-is-finally-out-and-adds-30-new-quests">releasing the massive mod's first DLC</a> earlier this week, the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> have confirmed that they've still got no plans to port it to the next-gen update version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>. There is, however, one factor that could lead them to reconsider doing so.</p>
<p>Since Team FOLON's take on a post-apocalytic English capital released last summer, playing it has required downgrading your copy of Fallout 4 to an older iteration released prior to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-update-fallout-4-for-your-next-generation-pc">April 2024's next-genning of Bethesda's RPG</a>. With the next-gen update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-sized-fallout-4-mod-fallout-london-has-been-delayed-indefinitely-by-bethesdas-incoming-next-gen-update">arriving out of the blue just ahead of Fallout: London's planned initial release</a>, the modders opted to put it out on this older version for stability reasons, following a delay that allowed them to explore their options.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In response to the downgrade requirement being raised again on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/1234891241184038973/1422862310489325580">Fallout: London's Discord server</a> yesterday, project lead Dean ‘Prilladog’ Carter weighed in to make clear Team FOLON's current stance on it. "We have the skill to put it on the next-gen [version], we just do not want [to]," he wrote.</p>
<p>"The current next-gen [iteration] has issues Bethesda Game Studios still [hasn't] fixed and would likely be broken by any future update that they may also do on a whim," the modder continued. "Thus, we have no plan to move it to the next-gen. If however, BGS allows console access for mods of this scale, then that is a potential different conversation."</p><p>Given the much tighter restrictions/limitations console mods have long had compared to PC, it'd take a substantial change to make a Fallout: London port possible, at least if you wanted the mod to be anywhere near as large and complex as the current version of it is. So, more of a pipedream at this point, but something it's still cool to see Team FOLON leaving the door open for.</p>
<p>For now, downgrading on PC's still your only option if you fancy checking out the mod's freshly released add-on Rabbit and Pork. It's not a problem if you're playing via a GOG-bought copy of Fallout 4 due to that storefront's built-in downgrader, but for those with Steam copies, you'll need to use the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/1">downgrader mod</a> Team FOLON put out. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-londons-first-dlc-will-require-a-brand-new-save-team-folon-confirm-but-it-sounds-like-other-future-add-ons-wont">Starting a fresh save is also a requirement</a> the first time you fire up after installing the fresh update which delivers the DLC.</p>

			<p>A Nickelodeon dungeons and dragons style mash up sounds very good on paper, drawing on characters from across their many different IP to take up various roles from a tabletop fantasy RPG. That’s what Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny does that well, as Timmy from Fairly Oddparents transforms into a wizard and SpongeBob becomes a knight, but outside of the cartoon mashup, this is quite a basic game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pPHWEJK_7U0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny, Timmy wishes to be transported into the world of one of his favourite games. However, the wish goes wrong and pulls in characters from other shows, as well as dungeons based upon various Nickelodeon shows such as Avatar: The Last Airbender, and enemies inspired by the shows to boot. Battling through the world renders this as an isometric action RPG, and while you’re probably not expecting genre-beating graphics, what’s odd is that character models look desaturated. Katara looks deathly pale and far from her normal skin tone. This desaturations is mostly noticeable on characters with the levels themselves looking better with more vibrant colours.</p>


<p>Between levels you end up in a hub called The Tangle, filled with shops and side missions. It is also here where you can switch between characters to try out which playstyle is best for you. As mentioned, Timmy is a wizard with range attacks, while SpongeBob is a knight so gets closer in. Other characters fall into the rogue, barbarian and healer roles, which works for multiplayer. In single player, picking one character is better after a little experimentation. I ended up sticking with Timmy due to his range and ability to target multiple enemies.</p>


<p>Each character has special abilities to use too to deal with more powerful enemies and groups of them, but the majority of the time you will be using the same basic attacks which can get repetitive, even if you do switch characters. The game throws weapons, armour, talismans, and consumables at you, so there is always better gear. These can be found in chests, from completing challenges, buying them from the shop, and defeating bosses.</p>
<p>Levels themselves are pretty linear though a few do have some winding paths and one has you working out which portals to use to move forward. These variations are far between, with the majority of levels looking fine and different across worlds, but being samey in playstyle makes things a bit uninteresting. You can tell effort has gone into crafting levels that use the Nickelodeon shows as inspiration, but more could be done.</p>

<p>Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny’s story is fine and does draw on humour from the various shows it uses, but do not expect anything with depth. This is definitely aimed at a younger audience, so things are easy to follow. It is all voice acted and it is decent, though it could be stronger. There are some performance issues present in the game too, playing the Switch 1 version of the game on Switch 2. Some cutscenes just glitched with frames jumping back and forth, overlaying on each other in a way that hurt to watch. There were also a few times where characters would get stuck while moving around levels.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny does have entertainment value to it, especially for a younger audience, but those looking for a nostalgic trip revisiting Nickelodeon characters might be a bit disappointed due to how basic the gameplay and levels are. There are also technical hitches that need to be addressed.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Questions surrounding the profitability of Xbox Game Pass have existed for as long as Microsoft's gaming subscription service has been on the market. Ever since the launch of June 1, 2017, and increasingly more so over the years as Microsoft improved the subscription's value through various acquisitions such as Bethesda and Activision Blizzard, the widespread consensus was that it was 'too good to be true': an amazing deal for gamers, sure, but how long would even Microsoft, one of the most valuable companies on the planet, be able to sustain it?</p>



<p>Xbox executives such as Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-isnt-burning-cash-says-spencer-its-very-sustainable-and-continues-to-grow/">have repeatedly assured fans of the profitability of Xbox Game Pass</a>, and now Xbox president Sarah Bond has done the same once again in a <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/2049598.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TGS 2025 interview with Japanese website Game Watch</a>:</p>



<p><em>Last fiscal year, Xbox Game Pass sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a record high of $5 billion</a>. It's a profitable business, and as more creators join Xbox Game Pass, payments to creators increase, so we think it's a good business for creators.</em></p>



<p>However, in light of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday's shocking news that the subscription service would now cost $29.99 on its Ultimate tier</a> (with hikes for the other tiers, too), fans have criticized Bond's statement. If it was already profitable and a good business for everyone, why did it have to be subjected to such a massive (+50%) price increase? </p>



<p>Granted, Bond conducted the interview a few days before this announcement, but as president of Xbox, it stands to reason she was absolutely aware of the incoming news. Taking her statement as accurate, the only plausible explanation is that it was not nearly as profitable as Microsoft would want, especially as it starts demanding more from the Xbox division after spending $75.4 billion on Activision Blizzard and $7.5 billion on ZeniMax Media/Bethesda Softworks to bolster the Xbox Game Pass lineup.</p>



<p>Even with all those big games on the subscription services, like Elder Scrolls, Fallout, DOOM, Diablo, and Call of Duty, the subscription service hasn't grown as much as Microsoft wanted (or like some analysts, <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-to-reach-100-million-when-activision-games-are-added-says-pachter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as Michael Pachter</a>, had estimated). If it can't have more subscribers, Microsoft seems to have decided it will now get more money out of those existing subscribers - only, it remains to be seen how many will remain at $29.99 monthly. Shortly after the announcement, too many requests <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overwhelmed the web page where Xbox Game Pass subscriptions are canceled</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s MMORPG update season, and Metin2, Gameforge’s long-running free-to-play entry in the genre, looks set to receive its latest update next month, with the Tyranny of Aamon arriving this November. In the run-up to its release, though, the game will be running a month-long pre-event phase to get players prepped and ready for the host of new features this new update will bring.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metin2: Tyranny of Aamon - Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IR0akUawX4Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The teaser trailer, may just be the most teasing of teaser trailers I’ve seen for a while, and other than some moody visuals and a disturbing laugh, there’s not all that much to go on. There definitely will be a dark new region, weeks of in-game events, Twitch Drops, and exclusive giveaways — including gaming PCs worth €2,400 so that seems well worth checking out.</p>
<p>The free expansion will introduce the mysterious Moonshadow Vale — a new region filled with dangerous dungeons, powerful bosses, and unique gear to craft.</p>
<p>Ahead of the release, players can take part in a month-long pre-event phase starting October 8, 2025, featuring exclusive missions, community activities, Twitch Drops, and massive prize raffles with rewards ranging from valuable in-game items to premium merchandise — and even two state-of-the-art gaming PCs valued at €2,400 each. Visit the Tyranny of Aamon promo page for more information.</p>

<p>“For almost two decades, Metin2 has inspired millions of players worldwide. With Tyranny of Aamon, we are opening a new chapter that challenges long-standing veterans while also making it easier for new players to join. This update exemplifies our philosophy of continuously evolving established games while also introducing fresh challenges along with new content,” said Patrick Mathieu, Senior Product Manager at Gameforge.</p>
<p>Highlights of Tyranny of Aamon will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moonshadow Vale as a new zone – A mysterious landscape full of dangers and diverse quests.</li>
<li>Dark dungeons &amp; fearsome foes – The sinister Aamon serves as the central antagonist, but many other dangerous creatures lurk within the new dungeons.</li>
<li>New items – Weapons, boots, and other valuable rewards await victorious heroes.</li>
</ul>

		<p>Nobody really wants to see games delayed, especially when you’re looking forward to them, but equally, no one wants to play something that isn’t quite at its best. The development team for Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, have made that difficult decision, though seemingly not to spend more time tweaking and improving (though I’m sure they are) but rather to avoid the holidy release melee that we’re currently in the midst of. Moonlight 2: The Endless Vault’s new release date will be November 19th, where it will launch into Early Access on PC via Steam and the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault | Behind the Counter Ep.3 - The Art of Moonlighter 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3GCa-ZiTv4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault is coming from Digital Sun and 11-Bit Games, and is the direct sequel to the original Moonlighter, a game that mixed some lovely shopkeeping mechanics by day with a little moonlighting as a hero spelunking through dungeons at night. It stands as one of the absolute best indie games of recent years, so we can totally forgive the team for holding onto the sequel for just a little longer, particularly so it can breathe a little easier with fewer big releases around it.</p>
<p>The team at Digital Sun released a statement, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While our original plan was set for October 23, the month has filled up with so many other great releases that we feel it has become too crowded for us. And as every wise shopkeeper knows, even the most precious gem can be overlooked in an overstuffed showcase.</p>

<p>With that in mind, we’ve decided to&nbsp;<strong>move our release to November 19</strong>.</p>

<p>While we understand extending the wait isn’t the best news, we have a small treat for you! We plan to run Closed Playtests on Steam and via the Microsoft Store, allowing you to test some of the changes we have implemented in the game based on your feedback.&nbsp; You can expect more details on that very soon!</p>

<p>We truly appreciate your patience and understanding. Consider it a little extra time to sharpen your swords, restock your shelves, and prepare for the adventures ahead.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Publisher 11-Bit Studios may have contributed in some part to the delay themselves, with the console release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/frostpunk-2-console-review/">Frostpunk 2</a> recently hitting shelves, and proving to be the perfect timesink while players wait for Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault to arrive.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/02/raven2-netmarbles-new-open-world-mmo-will-launch-later-this-month/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/raven2-%E2%80%93-netmarble%E2%80%99s-new-open-world-mmo-will-launch-later-this-month.1314424/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There are few larger time sinks than an MMO. That’s eased somewhat by being able to play on your mobile and your PC, and Netmarble will be hoping to steal plenty of players’ time with Raven2, their latest cross-platform MMO, when it launches later this month on the 22nd of October.</p>
<p><iframe title="[RAVEN2] RELEASE DATE TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EqoymgYC96M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So, what’s Raven2 all about? This medieval fantasy looks to have some seriously slick hack and slash action, with the speed tuned to just the right side of frantic, and players will be able to choose from eight different classes, each of which offer unique playstyles and customisation. One of the most interesting things though has to be the massive, unified battlefields, and though we’ll have to see how those play out, the trailer gives an interesting impression of how players will either work together or against each other as they attempt to hack their way to glory.</p>
<p>The global version of Raven2 will support 150 countries and 16 languages, including English, Thai, German, French, Indonesian, Malay, and more. Its service will be divided into three major regions: North America, Southeast Asia &amp; Oceania, and Europe. Each region will host 2 Worlds, each containing 12 servers, enabling players to freely select any server within their region.</p>
<p>To honor the launch, Raven2 has prepared a special launch event. Players can earn Crystals by leveling up, and the top 100 players per server will compete for one million Crystals. Additionally, a special tax fund of one million Crystals will be pre-deposited in each server’s Market, and players can claim it by participating in guild activity. The full version of “Dev’s Message” video is available on Raven2’s official YouTube, Facebook, Discord, and on the Epic Games YouTube channel, giving players a closer look at what to expect at launch.</p>


<p>Players can pre-register on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=raven2&amp;c=apps&amp;hl=en">Google Play</a> and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/raven2/id6448719154">App Store</a>, or wishlist the game on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/raven2-2c3f27">Epic Games Store</a>. Pre-registered players will receive exclusive rewards including a heroic grade Holy Garment and a special package at the game’s official launch.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine, Raven2 definitely looks the part, brining with it a vast universe set in a dark fantasy realm where players become a member of the Special Corps bearing the “Cursed Stigma.” As you investigate strange and perilous phenomena unfolding across the world, you’ll embark on a journey to vanquish demons and uncover the secrets behind the world’s fate. If this all sounds good to you, make sure you register ahead of the game’s launch on the 22nd of October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Marvel Rivals has managed to maintain a good amount of momentum through its first year, and that’s set to continue with Netease announcing that Season 4.5: Heart of the Dragon, the midway point for the mainline season, will release next Friday, October 10th. The headline additions are always characters, and this time is no different, bringing the iconic Daredevil to the roster, alongside the Man With No Fear’s melee combat-heavy moveset.</p>
<p><iframe title="Daredevil: The Man Without Fear | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iV8lE08wGoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is definitely a slightly different take on the character than the Matt Murdock we’ve seen embodied by Charlie Cox on Netflix and Disney, with the Marvel Rivals’ version sounding much gruffer and tougher. Visually, his armourset has clear Eastern influence, with Samurai-esque pauldrons on each shoulder, though I’d expect his more traditional look to pop up as part of the Season Pass.</p>
<p>Daredevil fits into the Duelist class, and his radar sense makes all evil visible; nothing escapes his “sight.” In combat, he can pick a priority target based on the situation, use his agility to close the gap, and unleash rapid attacks with his Billy Clubs. When facing tough opponents, Daredevil taps into The Beast’s power, amplifying his martial arts for even more deadly strikes! Activate his Ultimate Ability, and Daredevil fully unleashes The Beast. Any enemy who dares look at him will be gripped by fear, awaiting his cold justice!</p>
<p>If you have Disney+, you can also unlock a complimentary Disney+ inspired Daredevil costume, offered exclusively for a limited time from October 10, 2025 to January 8, 2026. You can learn more about this at <a href="http://disneyplus.com/perks">disneyplus.com/perks</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside Daredevil, the biggest change to the game is the much-needed addition of cross-progression. That means that no matter where you play, you can carry on working on the same characters and season pass. That said, it’s only going to be open to a small number of players through 4.5 as this feature is tested, with the expectation that cross-progression will unlock for all players alongside Season 5.0. Rank and leaderboard progression will stay separate for each platform, which I suppose will ease any questions of those keyboard and mouse players butting up against console controllers.</p>

<p>Finally, this update also brings another round of Team-Up Ability adjustments such as removing Ragnarok Rebirth (Hela – Thor) and taking Namor out of Gamma Charge (Hulk – Namor/Black Panther). Two brand-new Team-Up Abilities are coming: Bestial Hunt (Daredevil – The Punisher) and Deep Wrath (Hela – Namor). Next, there will be a special Halloween event and themed costumes so players can celebrate this mysterious and lively season together, and there’s also a mystery new mode coming, which we’ll have to wait until the 17th of October to find out more about.</p>

<p>An all-star line up</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>The beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a> is on its way to the Switch and Switch 2 this year, and earlier today, it got a demo on Steam.</p>
<p>It allows players to jump into the beat 'em up action with multiple iconic heroes and try out this new title before its official launch. That's not all, though, as there's apparently been a datamine, seemingly revealing – <strong>spoiler alert</strong> – Iron Man and Phoenix as playable characters. There also seems to be possible DLC planned.</p>

<p>These characters would reportedly be the final two playable characters for the main roster. When this news is shared officially, we'll let you know. These characters would join a cast already made up of heroes such as She-Hulk, Rocket Raccoon, Venom, Phyla-Vell, Spider-Man, Storm, Wolverine, Nova, and Captain America.</p>
<p>There's no mention of this demo releasing on other platforms, but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>
