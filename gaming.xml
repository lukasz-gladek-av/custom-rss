			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-delays-first-half-2025-26-fiscal-results-release-major-announcement-could-be-coming/">Last week, on November 13, approximately fifteen minutes before</a> they were meant to be published, Ubisoft announced it would be delaying the release of its financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year. It also announced that it would stop trading ahead of the market's opening the next day, which was a step reportedly taken "<em></em><em>to limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay</em>." Now, it has been confirmed <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2ek0UOt9DZO072eswdJsmx/8585762d888e7a5f75001725aba1ab2b/PR_19_11_2025_EN.pdf">that those delayed results will be public by the market's opening on Friday, November 21, 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, nothing can stop people from speculating, necessarily or otherwise, and the big speculation surrounding the delay is the idea that Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">is going the way of EA and becoming a privately owned company</a>. Not owned by the same Consortium that is in the process of owning EA Sports FC, but by Chinese publisher and developer Tencent, with which Ubisoft recently opened a new subsidiary called Vantage Studios.</p>



<p>The same Vantage Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">that now houses the rights to Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six</a>, the three franchises Ubisoft considers to be its most significant across its portfolio. It's worth noting that there's been no official word that Ubisoft is actively looking to be acquired. </p>



<p>We've seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">reports of the company's shareholders allegedly talking about a buyout</a>, but Ubisoft's only word on the question has been, "<em></em><em>We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options.</em>"</p>



<p>It's also worth noting that the delay could have been for something as small as a copy error in the results that needed fixing, instead of the latest major shift in the layout of the video game industry. Though if it happens, it'll continue the streak of extremely high-scale consolidation we've seen in recent years.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-40%E2%80%B3-full-hd-smart-tv-2025-looks-more-like-a-clearance-giveaway-than-a-real-sale.1358236/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Entertainment upgrades don’t have to be expensive, especially with early Black Friday deals dropping in fast.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you’re after a modest-sized screen that still delivers on both visuals and sound, here’s some good news. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5695/">The 2025 model of Samsung’s 40-inch Full HD F6000 Smart TV is currently available on Amazon for just $148, thanks to a 25% discount</a>. It normally retails for close $200, so this deal is taking a good chunk off the price, making the upgrade much more affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5695/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>You don’t have to worry about entering any weirdly long coupon codes or following some complicated checkout steps to score the discount. Just add the item to your cart, and the offer applies automatically. It’s also important to note that the retailer has listed it as a limited-time discount, which means it won’t be around for long. If you’ve been looking to treat yourself to a new screen, now is the time to make the move.</p>

<h2>Brilliant, Sharp Visuals for All Your Content</h2>
<p>This screen is not exactly big, which makes it ideal for smaller living rooms and even bedrooms. The sleek profile and slim bezels give it a minimal look while also keeping distractions at bay.</p>
<p>It pushes 1080p Full HD resolution for brighter, sharper visuals. Of course, it won’t rival a 4K screen, but it’s still fairly decent for everyday streaming. There’s High Dynamic Range (HDR) that actively expands the contrast between the lightest and darkest parts of a scene for better color accuracy, plus mega contrast, which automatically adjusts brightness and depth in real time. Watching a nature documentary or streaming your new favorite crime thriller, you’re going to enjoy an immersive viewing experience that pulls you in.</p>



<p>The Object Tracking Sound Lite feature helps the TV simulate directional audio to make it feel more dynamic. It’s pretty solid on its own, but you can always add a compatible Samsung soundbar to improve it even further.</p>
<p>The TV is also powered by Samsung’s One UI Tizen platform, which brings all your major streaming apps into one place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5695/">You’re going to have instant access to over 2,700 free channels, including 400+ from Samsung TV Plus.</a> New content is also frequently added, so there’s always going to be something new to watch. Best of all, it also lets you cast your phone to the big screen to scroll, watch shows, and even take video calls.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-budget-headphones-slashed-an-extra-50-off-now-nearly-free-for-black-friday-on-amazon-2000645455</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony%E2%80%99s-budget-headphones-slashed-an-extra-50-off-now-nearly-free-for-black-friday-on-amazon.1358233/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wireless headphones solve the tangled cable problem and keep your music private in shared spaces, but dropping $500 on AirPods Max makes zero sense when budget options deliver good daily performance. Most people need reliable Bluetooth audio for commutes and Zoom calls without the premium features that justify four-figure price tags.</p>
<p>Sony’s <strong>WH-CH520 headphones</strong> target practical users who want solid sound quality and marathon battery life without paying for luxury branding. Amazon has dropped<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/"> these already-affordable headphones to $38 for Black Friday, down from their regular $69 price</a>, and creates an all-time low that makes impulse buying almost mandatory.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>50-Hour Battery Life</h2>
<p>The<strong> battery life of 50 hours</strong> means you do not face the constant anxiety associated with premium headphones which boast a capacity of between 20 to 30 hours. You can wear these every day on your commute through an entire workweek without thinking about finding power, then charge over the weekend for another five days of use. Road trips and festival weekends can happen sans charging cables or hunting for outlets between sessions.</p>
<p>The <strong>lightweight construction keeps pressure off your head</strong> during those extended wearing sessions that heavier headphones turn into endurance tests. Swivel ear cups rotate to lay flat in bags without taking up excessive space and the the folding design collapses the headphones into a compact form for travel. The adjustable headband accommodates various head sizes without the tight clamping force that causes headaches after an hour of wear.</p>



<p><strong>Sound quality is above expectation for budget-tier headphones</strong> with well-balanced audio that doesn’t artificially pump up the bass at the expense of mids and highs. The Sony app <strong>includes EQ customization to let you tailor frequency</strong> <strong>response</strong> to your taste or simply make up for any differences in your hearing. You can punch up the bass for hip-hop, emphasize vocals for podcasts, or flatten the curve for classical that sounds better reproduced neutrally. DSEE technology upscales compressed streaming audio, restoring detail that lossy formats discard during encoding.</p>



<p>The built-in microphone does its fair share for phone calls and voice commands, though it is not up to the audio quality of dedicated headsets designed primarily for communication. You can answer calls without pulling your phone from your pocket and keep conversations hands-free while walking or working. The microphone picks up your voice clearly in quiet environments, though noisy settings with traffic or crowds overwhelm the basic noise reduction and require you to speak louder.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity maintains solid connections out to 30 feet</strong> in open spaces, serving typical home and office distances without dropouts. Walls and obstacles reduce effective range, but the headphones remain connected through normal room-to-room movement. Pairing is quick and easy through standard Bluetooth menus without any requirement for apps or complicated procedures; these headphones will work with <strong>Android, iOS, Windows, and any other device that supports Bluetooth</strong>.</p>
<p>At $38 for Sony wireless headphones with 50-hour battery life, you’re paying what knockoff brands charge for products that break within months. This 46% discount turns already reasonable headphones into the most cost-effective audio upgrade available this Black Friday.</p>

              <p>If you’ve already finished <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-2-yotei-review-in-progress-open-world-2000628700"><em>Ghost Of Yōtei</em></a>, then crikey, please can I borrow some of your spare time? I’ve yet to finish&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, let alone even start <em>Yōtei</em>, despite a strong urge to slaughter my way through all that cherry blossom. But for those so far ahead, good news arrives November 24! The game is receiving a free update that’s adding a pretty detailed New Game+ option.</p> <p>At first glance, it appears to be a fairly traditional NG+, allowing you to start the game over once you’ve completed it, but this time with all the equipment and skills you picked up on the way. That comes with new difficulty levels that’ll let you boost the challenge to accompany your greater abilities (although c’mon, you know it’s fun to wait a bit before turning those on and just enjoy being ludicrously over-powered for a little while first), and a couple of new Trophies to earn.</p>

 <p>But it’s adding a whole bunch more than that. Weapons and armor sets are being given a new suite of upgrades to unlock, adding a bunch more motivation to play through again, alongside 30 new cosmetics and 10 new charms. It’s also adding a whole new in-world currency called Ghost Flowers, which are used to buy these new bits and bobs from a brand new merchant. There’s also a new feature added for the NG+ that’ll offer “stat tracking” as you replay the challenges. You can see a lot of this new stuff in brief glimpses in the trailer:</p>

  <p>Patch 1.100.000 will also come with a few new features for the main game, with a bunch of new doodads for the photo mode, including shutter speed and a composition grid, as well as more silly filters for…for…what <em>does</em> anyone do with these? There are also to be improvements to accessibility, with directional button remapping and other as-yet unrevealed changes. Plus, we assume, a bunch of bug fixes and the like.</p> <p>The co-op multiplayer mode <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-legends-multiplayer-trailer-release-date-2000618559"><em>Ghost Of Yōtei Legends</em></a> and its supernatural take on the events is still a fair ways off, with the ambiguous release date of “2026,” but when it arrives, it too will be free.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/interplay-co-founder-and-pioneering-game-developer-rebecca-heineman-dies-at-62/</link>

<h2>From champion to advocate</h2>
<p>During her later career, Heineman served as a mentor and advisor to many, never shy about celebrating her past as a game developer during the golden age of the home computer.</p>
<p>Her mentoring skills became doubly important when she publicly came out as transgender in 2003. She became a vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ representation in gaming and <a href="https://glaad.org/releases/glaad-national-board-directors-announces-new-members-hannah-hart-rebecca-heineman-and/">served</a> on the board of directors for GLAAD. Earlier this year, she <a href="https://gaymingmag.com/2025/11/gayming-icon-and-lgbtq-games-pioneer-rebecca-heineman-has-died/">received</a> the Gayming Icon Award from Gayming Magazine.</p>
<p>Andrew Borman, who serves as director of digital preservation at The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York, told Ars Technica that her influence made a personal impact wider than electronic entertainment. “Her legacy goes beyond her groundbreaking work in video games,” he told Ars. “She was a fierce advocate for LGBTQ rights and an inspiration to people around the world, including myself.”</p>

<p>In the Netflix documentary series <em>High Score</em>, Heineman <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81019087">explained</a> her early connection to video games. “It allowed me to be myself,” she said. “It allowed me to play as female.”</p>
<p>“I think her legend grew as she got older, in part because of her openness and approachability,” said journalist Ernie Smith in an interview with Ars. “As the culture of gaming grew into an online culture of people ready to dig into the past, she remained a part of it in a big way, where her war stories helped fill in the lore about gaming’s formative eras.”</p>
<h2>Celebrated to the end</h2>
<p>Heineman was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma in October 2025 after experiencing shortness of breath at the PAX game convention. After diagnostic testing, doctors found cancer in her lungs and liver. That same month, she <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebecca-ann-heineman-fight-aggressive-cancer">launched</a> a GoFundMe campaign to help with medical costs. The campaign quickly surpassed its $75,000 goal, raising more than $157,000 from fans, friends, and industry colleagues.</p>

Now, EA's military shooter will seemingly no longer count the bots you kill in a match, but if you get blasted by a bot, that death will still show up in your stats sheet for now.</p><p>According to <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1990889499979632848" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a November 18 X post</a> by the community news source Battlefield Bulletin, the update was deployed to make the game's stats accurate and fair. If you visit your profile page now, you may see a significant drop in your kill-death ratio, possibly suggesting that many of the kills in that stat were merely on bots.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>Retired competitive pro player Otto "ottr" Boström <a href="https://x.com/ottrTweets/status/1990809560110584184" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">highlighted this change on his X account</a>, posting a side-by-side comparison of what appears to be his Battlefield 6 profile page on November 18. In one image, he had 88,838 kills, with a 92.950 average K/D. In the subsequent image, his kills dropped to 24,227, with his K/D falling to 3.814. Boström believes this will "expose a lot of players out there."</p><p>While bot kills seem to mean nothing to your overall kills now, Battlefield YouTuber DannyonPC <a href="https://x.com/DANNYonPC/status/1990891124697727425" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mentioned in Battlefield Bulletin's replies</a> that bot deaths--that is, you getting murked by a bot--still count toward your overall deaths. Battlefield Bulletin noted this, saying that it should be addressed "eventually" as well.</p><p>Battlefield Studios hasn't commented on the change yet, but its communications department did <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1991168660103180339" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">take to X on November 19 to post about other adjustments</a> it recently made to the game. This includes increasing the effective hitboxes of defibrillators, bumping the AFK kick timer in Sabotage from 60 seconds to 180 seconds, temporarily disabling bot backfilling in Sabotage, and clarifying Assignment and Challenge descriptions and criteria to make them easier to achieve and obtain.</p><p>All of these fixes appear to be Battlefield Studios' attempts at curbing bot farming. Since its October 10 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, the game has seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-xp-farms-will-be-patched-out-soon-but-player-progression-will-be-dramatically-improved/1100-6535517/" data-ref-id="1100-6535517">rampant use of bots as XP cattle</a>. An October 21 update <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-bot-xp-farms-are-no-more/1100-6535606/" data-ref-id="1100-6535606">dropped a grenade on these farms</a>, with a hotfix the following day <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-battlefield-6-update-aims-to-shoot-down-bot-filled-matches/1100-6535629/" data-ref-id="1100-6535629">reducing bots from filling matches</a>. Despite the gates limiting them, lead producer David Sirland explained on November 5 that bots play a crucial role: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/without-battlefield-6-bots-youd-be-waiting-a-lot-longer-producer-says/1100-6535956/" data-ref-id="1100-6535956">They help get games going</a>. And with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-a-new-casual-mode-where-bots-outnumber-players/1100-6535868/" data-ref-id="1100-6535868">a new Casual Breakthrough mode</a> that introduces a more relaxed way to play Battlefield 6, it's safe to assume they aren't going anywhere. They're just becoming a bit redundant.</p><p>Outside of this hush-hush change, Battlefield Studios did release a new patch for the game across consoles and PC on November 18. Dubbed Update 1.1.2.0, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-patch-notes-include-a-major-change-for-aim-assist/1100-6536292/" data-ref-id="1100-6536292">the patch substantially alters aim-assist</a>, making it "feel smoother and more predictable."</p>

			<p>Hades II presents a tougher challenge than its predecessor. With an increased focus on ranged combat and high enemy density, surviving the trek to Tartarus and the summit requires more than just high damage; it demands superior survivability.</p>



<p>While many players focus on maximizing DPS, one specific Boon is often overlooked, yet provides immense utility for nearly every single build: <strong>Aphrodite's Glamour Gain.</strong></p>

<h2 id="h-glamour-gain-is-the-best-defensive-boon-in-hades-ii">Glamour Gain is the Best Defensive Boon in Hades II</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251109193532_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Don't sleep on Aphrodite's Glamour Gain Boon</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Aphrodite's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Glamour Gain</strong> is arguably the most valuable defensive tool in Melinoë's arsenal, hands-down. It's often overlooked by players obsessed with big numbers, but its core utility - superior, passive survivability - is critical for clearing the more challenging later regions.</p>



<p>The reasons for its power are simple:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Passive Weak Curse Inflictio</strong><strong>n</strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">:</strong> Glamour Gain automatically inflicts the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Weak</strong> curse on nearby enemies. You don't need to attack, Dash, or Cast; merely being near a foe triggers the effect.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Damage Reduction:</strong> The Weak curse causes afflicted enemies to deal <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">at least 30% less damage</strong>, and this stacks with other damage-reducing effects (like the <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Strength Arcana, which also increases your attack power at the cost of Death Defianc</strong><strong>e</strong>).</li>



<li><strong>Magic Restoration:</strong> It gradually restores your <strong>Magic</strong> (starting at 6 points per second) while near enemies, giving you passive regeneration to fuel your Casts and Omega attacks.</li>
</ol>



<p>In Hades II, Melinoë is frequently swarmed by multiple enemies from all sides, especially in difficult areas like Tartarus and Mount Olympus. Since more than one enemy will be near you almost constantly, the effects of Glamour Gain ensure that nearly every hit you take is <strong>reduced considerably.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-comparison-with-other-weak-inducing-boons">Comparison With Other Weak-inducing Boons</h3>



<p>Other Aphrodite Boons can inflict Weak (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Rapture Ring</strong> with Casts or <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Passion Rush</strong> with Rushing), but they require active input. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Glamour Gain</strong> provides its life-saving utility automatically and consistently within Melinoë's effective fighting range, making it far more reliable and ultimately more useful.</p>



<h2 id="h-maxing-out-glamour-gain-s-potential">Maxing Out Glamour Gain’s Potential</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251110005409_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Broken Resolve Boon makes Glamour Gain even more useful</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Once you secure Glamour Gain, try to get these two essential Aphrodite Boons to maximize its effectiveness. With these additions, you not only reduce incoming damage but also significantly boost your damage against Weak-inflicted foes:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Sweet Surrender:</strong> Weak-afflicted enemies take <strong>+10% more damage</strong> (minimum, scales with rarity). This turns your defensive boon into a potent offensive multiplier.</li>



<li><strong>Broken Resolve:</strong> Weak effects are <strong>more potent</strong>, increasing the base damage reduction beyond 30%. This is pure survivability insurance.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-glamour-gain-as-often-as-possible">How to Get Glamour Gain As Often As Possible</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Equipping the Beautiful Mirror Keepsake increases your chances of obtaining the Glamour Gain Boon during Nights</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Due to roguelike mechanics of Hades II, there is no guaranteed way to be offered Glamour Gain on every run, but you can use the Keepsake system to dramatically increase your chances:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Unlock the Keepsake:</strong> Obtain the <strong>Beautiful Mirror</strong> Keepsake from Aphrodite by giving her Ambrosia to increase Melinoë's affinity with the Goddess.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Equip Strategically:</strong> While equipping the keepsake at the start of a run guarantees an Aphrodite Boon, I found in my own 67 runs that equipping the Beautiful Mirror for the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">second region</strong> in both the Underworld and Surface paths yields the best chance of Glamour Gain being offered.</li>
</ol>



<blockquote>
<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">If Glamour Gain is not among the choices offered, make sure to save the Boon Rarification chance granted by the Beautiful Mirror </em></strong><strong><em>K</em></strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">eepsake until it does show up. Maximizing this Boon's rarity early is highly valuable.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-glamour-gain-best-weapon-synergies">Glamour Gain Best Weapon Synergies</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Every weapon in Hades II benefits in some capacity from the effects of Glamour Gain</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Glamour Gain synergizes really well with every weapon in Hades II, as the passive <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Weak</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Curse application</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Magic regeneration</strong> are great to have regarldess of the weapon's capabilities.</p>



<ul>
<li>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Sister Blades,</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Moonstone Axe, </strong>and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">The Black Coat</strong> benefit the most due to he short range of their Attacks. Glamour Gain massively offsets this shortcoming, turning both weapons into really solid choices, especially if you have means to restore HP consistently</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witch's Staff</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Umbral Flames</strong> have slightly better Attack range than the tree weapons above, but they still benefit from Glamour Gain a lot thanks to the constant Magic regeneration, which helps both weapons dish out the best damage they can.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Argent Skull</strong> also benefits a lot from Glamour Gain, no matter the playstyle.

              <p data-start="0" data-end="283">We’re now right in the thick of the holiday season. The temperatures dropped, lights are going up on every house, and the sun is going down far too quickly for my liking. If you still have a ton of gifts to pick out for all your loved ones, family, and friends, you might be holding out for Black Friday and Cyber Monday so you can save some cash while you shop. Well, I’m hear to tell you that you don’t actually have to wait any longer. Amazon has pushed a handful of deals live ahead of the big savings event that follows Thanksgiving. Save on products across every category. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5691/">For a limited time, you can save 20% on the Bose SoundLink Flex Bluetooth speaker. It normally goes for $149, so the discount ends up saving you $30. That brings the price down to just $119.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>On Monday, Hypixel announced that it was back from the dead and had </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-minecraft-hypixel-revived-cancel-shutdown-2000645248"><span>acquired the rights to its canceled </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>-like game </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i></a><span> from Riot. The </span><i><span>League of Legends </span></i><span>company canceled the game and shut down the developer back in June, and now the band is getting back together, and fans who had been eagerly anticipating the game can look forward to an Early Access launch in the near future. Hypixel has released a lengthy gameplay trailer showing </span><i><span>Hytale </span></i><span>in motion, and if you were looking for a more fast-paced, action-packed version of </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Hytale </span></i><span>looks like it might be just that.</span></p> <p><span>The game has a similar blocky art style that will look familiar to anyone who’s ever taken a trip to the Overworld, but the 16-minute gameplay trailer also features a lot of smooth, stylish combat. </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>lets you whack enemies around, too, but it can feel a bit stiff. Which is fine. The best parts of Mojang’s game are its crafting and building mechanics, which more than make up for its simplistic combat. </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, however, looks like it focuses on the inverse. A lot of what Hypixel shows off here is the player using a whole arsenal of weapons. At first, it’s giving </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls </span></i><span>melee combat, but then the game switches to third person, and you see that you have some additional mobility options that make it look a bit more free-flowing.</span></p>  <p><span>Hypixel says it wanted to release footage of the game in motion as quickly as possible to “break the curse” after disappearing for several months, so this is essentially a proof-of-life reveal while the team prepares for Early Access. There’s no set date yet, but the </span><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved"><span>blog post announcement</span></a><span> says that it will be revealed “in the coming days.”</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Use these Roblox Yeet A Friend monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Stars, Boosts, Spins, Gems and Pets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yeet A Friend is a popular physics-based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-anime-infinity-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience where players are given the rather exciting task of throwing (or rather yeeting) a friend as far away as possible. The main objective of the game is simply to launch your friend the maximum possible distance, with all the upgrades and abilities in the game centred around the same.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Players have to gain strength and energy by clicking and performing other activities, as the strength meter resets with each throw. This means players have to regain strength after every throw, adding further replayability to this already enjoyable game. With multiple worlds to play in and a worldwide leaderboard for the best throws, Yeet A Friend is a game that players can spend hours on without getting bored. Although gaining strength and energy isn’t overly challenging, using some redeem codes can make it even more fun, because who doesn’t like a few free rewards?&nbsp;</p>

Throughout Baki’s pursuit of greatness and his stepping out of his father’s looming shadow, his hero's journey takes him through a gauntlet of increasingly deranged opponents including roided-out brawlers and prehistoric cavemen. All of this is vividly brought to life by Itagaki, who emphasizes and exaggerates human anatomy and the many ways muscles can bend and break. <em>Baki </em>is one of my unapologetic favorites for its ridiculously over-the-top, hype-filled fights, which have been trucking for 35 years now and show no signs of slowing down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xniBk7zAKMY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Baki Hanma | Official Trailer | Netflix Anime"></iframe></figure><p>But with every creative comes an editor whose job is to harness, rein in, and cheer on the creator's vivid imagination and keep them from getting lost in the hot pursuit of their ambitions.

</figure><p>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</p><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert:</strong> First off, congratulations on celebrating <em>Baki’s </em>35th anniversary. Looking back, did you or Keisuke Itagaki envision <em>Baki </em>would become a global phenomenon, especially with its recent resurgence thanks to its Netflix anime adaptation?</p><p><strong>Yuki Yokoi:</strong> Because this work features such unique and compelling characters, I always felt it deserved much more attention both in Japan and around the world. Back around 2010, as the editor in charge, I was driven by a sense of frustration that the series hadn’t yet been discovered internationally. So seeing it finally receive the recognition it truly deserves now feels deeply gratifying.</p><p>As for its adaptation into anime, I believe the theme of “strength”— a concept that transcends language and culture—has been successfully conveyed to audiences worldwide through Netflix’s global platform and its simultaneous release in multiple languages.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTMMdMVFRWE?start=16&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Insanity of Grappler Baki and Why You Should Care"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong><em>Baki</em> is often described as a celebration of human anatomy—sometimes to absolute surreal, obsessive extremes with relation to musculature. How does <em>Baki </em>balance that anatomical intensity with the emotional and philosophical depth of martial arts?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> When it comes to Itagaki-sensei’s detailed depictions of the human body, he does refer to anatomical and medical texts as well as human body atlases. However, his main reference materials are original scrapbooks he’s created himself, filled with cutouts from bodybuilding magazines that show individual muscle groups of various athletes. He keeps these clippings organized by body part, often focusing on the strengths of Mr. Olympia champions and other top competitors.</p><p>Of course, he also watches a wide range of combat sports footage, including UFC and boxing. It’s true that bodybuilding champions dehydrate themselves and push their bodies to the extreme before stepping on stage, which isn’t necessarily healthy. But Itagaki-sensei’s creative drive comes from his own fascination—a desire to depict scenes where those bodybuilder physiques actually fight and prove their strength in battle.</p><figure><blockquote>— 刃牙35周年プロジェクト【公式】 (@teambaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/teambaki/status/1702630665722953830?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">September 15, 2023</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>The series continues to evolve with new arcs and characters that somehow trump the last arc’s grand spectacle. What’s the secret that keeps <em>Baki </em>going strong after all these years?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> I believe the secret behind the series’ constant evolution lies entirely in the appeal of the characters that Itagaki-sensei creates. When he studied under manga master <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuo_Koike?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kazuo Koike</u></a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuo_Koike?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Gekiga Sonjuku</u></a>, a school that taught the art and methodology of storytelling, he learned the principle “If the character stands out—if it’s truly compelling—the work will sell.” Because of this, Itagaki-sensei often refers to himself as a “character craftsman.”</p><p>The worlds he builds are filled with these kinds of unforgettable characters — people who, the moment they appear, inevitably bring drama with them. As new and equally powerful personalities continue to emerge, the story’s momentum and vitality are constantly renewed.</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>Were there any narrative paths that were considered early in the series that were ultimately avoided to instead be the series fans know today?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> I once heard from the very first editor in charge that the initial draft of <em>Grappler Baki </em>actually began with a scene of Baki spending an ordinary day at school. If the series had started that way, perhaps the <em>Baki </em>saga might have taken a very different path.</p><figure><blockquote>— 刃牙35周年プロジェクト【公式】 (@teambaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/teambaki/status/1967845913529102693?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">September 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> How did you and Itagaki feel seeing <em>Baki </em>gain traction in the West? Were there any unexpected reactions or cultural interpretations of its characters and tales that stood out to you?</p><p><strong>YY: </strong>This may be similar to my earlier answer, but since this series is filled with such distinctive and fascinating characters and revolves around the universal theme of “strength,” which resonates across the world, I strongly believed it would find success once it could finally be delivered to North American audiences in an accessible way. I had confidence that it would become popular once people had the chance to see it.</p><p>That said, since the anime adaptation available on Netflix begins with the second part of <em>Baki The Grappler</em>, I expected that some viewers might feel a bit lost without knowing the first part of the story. However, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that many fans had already found ways to experience the first part through other means.</p><figure><blockquote>— Netflix Japan | ネットフリックス (@NetflixJP) <a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixJP/status/1963939407855046922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">September 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>Now that the first part has officially begun publication as an English-language comic, I sincerely hope that North American readers will pick it up as well—not only to fill in the missing parts of the story, but to experience the full scope of the <em>Baki </em>universe from its very beginning.</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>With new manga adaptations and special editions of <em>Baki </em>rolling out, what’s the guiding principle behind these expansions? Are they meant to recontextualize the story or simply offer fresh entry points for longtime and newcomer fans alike? Aside from new translations and lettering, will there be any textual changes or addenda to the original manga in these editions, or is the goal more about preservation and presentation?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> It’s the latter meaning. <em>The Grappler Baki</em> published this time by <a href="https://x.com/KodamaTales?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kodama </u></a>represents the beginning of the <em>Baki </em>series, a story arc that has not yet been streamed on Netflix as part of the anime adaptation.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today is the official release day of Keisuke Itagaki's Baki the Grappler by <a href="https://twitter.com/KodamaTales?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">@KodamaTales</a>!!

</figure><p>For fans who discovered the series through the anime, this release serves as a way to fill in the missing parts of the story, while for longtime readers already familiar with it, it provides an opportunity to own a high-quality, official publication.</p><p>This edition is based on the complete edition format released in Japan and has been produced using Japan’s high-standard printing and paper quality, ensuring that it can be appreciated as a collectible item by dedicated fans.</p><figure><blockquote>— Kodama (@KodamaTales) <a href="https://twitter.com/KodamaTales/status/1973467084651896981?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">October 1, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><strong>IC: </strong><em>Baki</em>’s Muhammad Ali tribute from Yujiro Hanma was a powerful moment, framing him not just as a fighter but as a symbol of resistance against racial injustice. What inspired that reflection, and how do you and Itagaki see Baki’s role in engaging with political themes?</p><p><strong>YY: </strong>Itagaki-sensei himself once competed as a boxing athlete, even being selected to participate in a national sports event for Japan, and his deep passion for the sport heavily influenced his creative vision. The character Yujiro Hanma, born from that admiration for boxing’s greatest stars and Itagaki-sensei’s own ideal of strength, was developed with the intention of showing mutual respect and recognition between Yujiro and real-world fighters — a way to bring the character vividly to life.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8CcYYVplX2o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Yujiro Hanma Respected Muhammad Ali"></iframe></figure><p>In Japan, manga historically began as something like a casual pastime—something you could finish reading during a single train ride, much like a piece of cheap candy you enjoy in passing. Because of that, Itagaki-sensei often says that manga must remain accessible and easy for anyone to understand.</p><p>Rather than delving into political or social themes, his work has always focused on the universal and timeless theme of “strength”—a quality that everyone, regardless of background or culture, can aspire to and be moved by.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> As a series, <em>Baki </em>has featured <a href="https://x.com/minedo_r/status/1892493589613051990?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>several presidential cameos</u></a> over the years. Is there a decisive favorite for Itagaki? What went into the decision to craft those moments as mainstays chronicling its sprawling stories alongside American presidential administrations?</p><p>The current president of the U.S., Donald Trump, is<a href="https://x.com/DaFeenom/status/1224426904079470593?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u> no stranger to manga cameos</u></a> with the likes of the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/donald-trump-death-note-manga-election-2024-2000520605?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Death Note</em> one-shot</u></a>. However, his recent cameo in <em>Baki</em> stirred quite a bit of buzz in the West. Can you share what inspired that inclusion and how it was approached tonally and artistically? Was there fear of blowback from how extreme it might’ve been taken in comparison to other presidential cameos in the series?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> I haven’t really heard Itagaki-sensei mention having a particular “favorite” president character. The depiction of Yujiro Hanma having a personal treaty with the United States was created as a way to express the overwhelming power and larger-than-life presence of his character. As a result, that idea has been carried forward and reinterpreted with each new U.S. president portrayed in the story.</p><p>Each depiction reflects Itagaki-sensei’s imaginative interpretation of how a real-world leader might react if they were to actually encounter someone like Yujiro Hanma. While, of course, it is entirely fictional, Itagaki-sensei is always careful not to portray the real individuals in a disrespectful manner, instead crafting these moments as character-driven episodes meant to entertain and enrich the world of the story.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TsK2IhO-gXc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Baki Hanma VS Kengan Ashura OP | Fly High by ATARASHII GAKKO! | Netflix Anime"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>With <em>Kengan Ashura</em> often mentioned in the same breath as <em>Baki</em>,<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baki-hanma-vs-kengan-ashura-review?ref=aftermath.site"><u> culminating in a crossover exhibition for both fandoms in the books</u></a>, what kind of clashes would you love to see between <em>Baki </em>and other popular fighting manga universes?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> <em>Baki </em>and <em>Kengan Ashura </em>are both Netflix Original anime series, and since <em>Kengan Ashura</em>’s creator, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=165156&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Yabako Sandrovich</u></a>, is a longtime fan of the <em>Baki </em>series, the collaboration came about quite naturally. The project was also made possible thanks to the close working relationship between editor <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=232520&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Sho Kobayashi</u></a> and myself, which allowed the idea to take shape smoothly.</p><p>If future opportunities arise with works that share a similar tone and creative connection, I would definitely like to pursue more collaborations like that.</p><p>On a personal note, since Itagaki-sensei once worked on the manga adaptation of <em>Garouden</em>—which also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/garouden-the-way-of-the-wolf-review-netflix?ref=aftermath.site"><u>has a Netflix Original adaptation</u></a>—I would love to see a crossover story between those worlds someday. Of course, that’s purely my own wish as a fan.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did you know? In Capcom VS SNK series Terry and Yamazaki's special intro is a direct reference to Bunnoshin Inagi VS Kaoru Hanayama from Baki the Grappler. <a href="https://t.co/vCk478m0b1?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/vCk478m0b1</a></p>— biollo (ॐ) (@EXbiollo) <a href="https://twitter.com/EXbiollo/status/1898154281674346576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">March 7, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Fans have been clamoring to see <em>Baki </em>in a fighting game—be it <em>Street Fighter</em>, <em>Tekken</em>, or even <em>Mortal Kombat</em>. If you could choose one fighting game to feature a <em>Baki </em>guest appearance, which would it be and why?</p><p><strong>YY: </strong>If I had to choose just one, I would say <em>Tekken</em>, in terms of narrative compatibility. The series shares a core storyline centered around a father–son conflict, which makes it feel thematically aligned with <em>Baki</em>.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> If you had to sum up the spirit of <em>Baki</em>’s future in one word or phrase, what would it be?</p><p><strong>YY: </strong>Perhaps the right word would be “expansion.” Itagaki-sensei continues to extend the story vertically by drawing new chapters, while at the same time, we are developing numerous spinoffs that broaden the world horizontally. Various forms of media adaptations are also currently in preparation, allowing fans to experience and enjoy the <em>Baki </em>series through multiple touchpoints.</p><p>In addition, we are planning a range of merchandising initiatives that will let fans engage with the series on a deeper level. Through these efforts, we aim to expand the universe of <em>Baki </em>and create many different ways for audiences to immerse themselves in its world.</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>As <em>Baki </em>enters a new era in 2026, what can fans expect in terms of tone, themes, character evolutions, or showcasing of martial arts yet to be featured in the series?</p><p><strong>YY: </strong>&nbsp;The latest series in the original manga saga, Part 6: <a href="https://baki.fandom.com/wiki/Baki_Rahen?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Baki Rahen</u></em></a>, is currently being serialized. In this installment, the story focuses on new battles and developments among the characters surrounding Baki. Within it, <a href="https://baki.fandom.com/wiki/Jack_Hanma?ref=aftermath.site#:~:text=He%20received%20from%20him%20a,him%20even%20more%20mentally%20unstable."><u>Jack Hammer</u></a> has established a new fighting style known as “Goudou” (the Way of Biting). In this way, there is a strong possibility that previously-introduced characters will continue to evolve, developing new techniques and fighting methods in their ongoing pursuit of strength.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>Bandai Namco has announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_berseria_remastered">Tales of Berseria Remastered</a>, which will be coming to Switch on <strong>27th February 2026</strong> for <strong>$39.99 / £34.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right, this is <em>not</em> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/tales_of_xillia_2">Tales of Xillia 2</a>, which series director <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/tales-of-xillia-2-remastered-on-the-way-with-more-to-come">Yusuke Tomizawa previously teased was "still in progress"</a>, just not formally announced. Guess we'll have to wait a bit longer for that one...</p>
<p>Still, Berseria is a <em>bit</em> of a surprise, given that it's available on PC and PS4 (and PS3 in Japan). So it's relatively accessible, unlike <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_graces_f_remastered">Graces f</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_xillia_remastered">Xillia</a>, which were stuck on the PS3.</p>
<p>But hey, Tales of Berseria is a good one! It's also much darker than the other games in the series, following Velvet on a quest for revenge after she's struck by tragedy at the hands of a person she trusts. The Remastered version will bring with it various quality-of-life enhancements, early access to the Grade Shop, map icons, the ability to turn off encounters, and access to a bunch of DLC.</p>


<p>The cast is great, the combat is great, and we're excited to try it on Switch. Of course, expect the usual caveats with the Switch port such as 30fps. When will one of these get a dedicated Switch 2 version, Bamco?</p>
<p>Tales of Berseria originally released back in 2017 in the West, and it got a great review from out sister site Push Square, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/tales_of_berseria">who scored it an 8/10</a>.</p>

			<p>Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord developer TaleWorlds Entertainment is set to release the biggest expansion yet for its strategy action game. War Sails, which adds naval combat to the ever-expanding war sandbox within Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord. The new expansion <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-sails-naval-expansion-mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-out-november-26/">will launch a week from the time of this writing, on November 26, 2025</a>, and ahead of that launch, TaleWorlds Entertainment has debuted a new gameplay trailer showing off the kinds of intense naval battles players will take part in.</p>



<p>The new eight-and-a-half-minute gameplay showcase shows a battle between the latest faction entering the game, the Nords, and the Khuzaits in a nighttime river battle.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The battle is an impressive display of what's to come for Mount and Blade II fans, with a whole new combat element arriving in the game for the first time. When War Sails arrives next week, it'll be available on all platforms simultaneously and can be purchased for $24.99.</p>



<p>For players not purchasing the expansion, there will be a free update going live that same day, adding a slew of updates and fixes to the game for all players, including overhauled mission atmospheres, overhauled spear bracing, improvements to melee, ranged, and cavalry combat, expanded modding capabilities, and more.</p>



<p>If you are purchasing the expansion, then you'll be able to build your naval fleet with 20 unique ships, including 15 warships, four trading ships and one civilian fishing vessel across an expanded Calradia. All of the ships are modelled after historic examples of medieval ships, and players will be able to undertake a naval campaign as part of the new expansion, where you'll be battling the elements as much as you are battling enemy fleets.</p>



<p>Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord is already a cinematic action strategy experience with its epic ground battles, so this step into naval warfare is the next natural evolution of its sandbox gameplay. We'll see how it lands with players when War Sails arrives next week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In one particularly memorable sequence in <em>Demonschool </em>— the new tactical RPG from Necrosoft that, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/764346/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-game-delays-cloverpit-faeland-aeterna-lucis">after a few hiccups</a>, releases on November 19th — I throw a doll at a zombie’s head, dispatch it with a roundhouse kick to the jowls as I watch my friends sweep demons off the floor in vortices of blood, and celebrate by returning to town and petting a dog. All in the name of passing a college assignment that I’m juggling alongside deciphering a millennia-old apocalyptic prophecy and making new friends.</p><p>For <em>Demonschool</em>’s demon-hunting protagonist, Faye, that would all preferably be achieved by kicking the apocalypse, and coursework, into submission across 10 in-game weeks of reference-laden gore.</p><p>Necrosoft isn’t shy about those inspirations, either. Launching from a setup that screams <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, a color palette ripped from Dario Argento’s <em>Suspiria</em>, and a smörgåsbord of horror — your first in-game quest is to track down a videotape that kills you within three days of viewing — <em>Demonschool </em>injects its own philosophy into what it draws from what’s come before. If “take your time” in <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3">Persona 5</a></em>, another of <em>Demonschool</em>’s many influences, felt more like a threat in a 100-plus-hour game, <em>Demonschool</em>’s deployment of the phrase is more sincere. There’s no time pressure to its main quest and, but for a few rhythmic missteps, the time you spend in <em>Demonschool </em>is yours to do with as you will.</p><p>That time will be split between two things. The first: exploring an island and engaging with its increasingly eerie residents — including a child whose ambition is to grow up to be a bench — and the comic interludes you and your growing band of new pals consistently wind up in. Upon arriving on the island, for instance, Faye drags reluctant new best friend Namako to explore, only to end up in a fight with local thugs (a hobby of Faye’s we’ll revisit shortly). “We’re hitting the town,” she tells Namako. “Pretend those guys are the town!”</p><p>The rest will be spent in <em>Demonschool</em>’s rendition of grid- and turn-based combat, with a focus on positional gameplay, where you’ll be maneuvering characters behind enemies. Faye’s basic attack pushes enemies back a square — enemy attacks can similarly influence your position — while Namako can phase through demons and drag them toward her original position. Drive enemies between characters and you can unleash a powerful combo; do enough damage and you can access characters’ special moves. Tactical combat becomes a string of considerations of how to maneuver enemies into your line of attack and stay out of range of their (often devastating given characters’ limited health) rebuttals.</p><p>That’s just the “planning phase.” The “action phase” follows, in which everything you’ve made your characters do is played out and, in the right combinations, sees your team weave around one another in cinematic — and cool-as-hell — ballets of punching, kicking, and arcane magic.</p><p>It lends a directorial bent to already tactically deep gameplay, as you decide not just what will finish a fight but how to look good while doing it. Which is fortunate, because you will be getting into <em>a lot </em>of fights. Getting to know your friends? Time for a fight. Completing an incremental step of a weekly assignment? Fight. Taking a break with a side quest? Fight. Going to the restroom? Fight… with 50 ghosts.</p><p>This isn’t unusual for an RPG, though these are unavoidable scripted events rather than random encounters, nor are these battles especially hard. But not being able to move to a new screen without running into a fight can get old fast. It only took me until the second week to toggle on the “almost invincible” accessibility option — <em>Demonschool </em>lets you rewind your movements and restart battles without penalty to clean up mistakes, too — just for a cognitive break while encountering fights every few minutes.</p><p>There’s a hint of self-awareness about the frequency of fights, which <em>are </em>occasionally refreshed as you develop new skills and find new companions, as Namako early on bemoans not being able to walk into Temsk’s cemetery without being ambushed by gangsters and the undead (yeah, Namako, I know how you feel).</p><p>The weight of that specific frustration is lessened, however, by everything else <em>Demonschool </em>offers. Let’s be honest: main quests are fine, but I’d rather decorate my clubhouse with friends, explore Temsk’s nightlife, and pull demon fish from the depths in a now-obligatory-in-RPGs fishing minigame.</p><p>There is a refreshing lack of extravagance to this side content, especially compared to where Necrosoft draws its inspiration from. Like all good high school horror, <em>Demonschool </em>is less about fighting the big bad than bringing together a found family of complex and relatable misfits to do so. In its straightforward approach to this aspect of <em>Demonschool</em>, Necrosoft not only lets its writing — particularly of its characters, who genuinely develop and grow — shine through, but also relieves potential for frustration. But for the odd misplaced karaoke lyric, if you spend time with your friends you become closer to them.</p><p><em>Demonschool </em>has rough edges, particularly in how it balances its excellent writing with slightly-too-frequent (though still interesting) combat. But in its open approach to its influences — while avoiding feeling like a lesser copy — its wit, and its charm, it builds a unique identity from its melting pot of inspirations to leave its deficiencies far outweighed by how much there is to love.</p><p><sub>Demonschool <em>launches on November 19th on the Switch, PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTgxMTk="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Geoffrey Bunting</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/770090/demonschool-review-switch-xbox-ps5]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/snag-the-lego-thestral-family-set-for-just-49-after-a-30-discount-at-amazon-2000645216</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-harry-potter-thestral-drops-to-almost-free-ahead-of-black-friday-early-shoppers-are-already-draining-stock.1358128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Harry Potter introduced us to a whole bunch of cool (and scary) creatures, but few are as quietly haunting as the Thestrals. In fact, these bat-winged creatures are only visible to those who have witnessed or processed death. And now, thanks to LEGO, you can bring a pair home – that too for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5694/">The Thestral Family set usually retails for $70, but we just spotted it for 30% off on Amazon, which drops the price to just $49</a>. It makes a great holiday gift for the Potterhead in your life, or even a fun treat for yourself if you’re looking to bring key elements of the Wizarding World home. Just note that Amazon has listed it as a limited-time markdown, which is why we highly recommend getting your orders in quickly. The sale is likely going to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5694/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Attention to Detail</h2>
<p>This set is designed for ages 10 and up. You get a total of 548 pieces, which come together to build two posable Thestrals (one adult and one baby), plus a mini Forbidden Forest tree. With under 550 pieces, it won’t exactly be a large project you need to dedicate your entire weekend to, but also not too short.</p>
<p>The attention to detail is impressive on the creatures with striking skeletal forms and distinctive bat-like features. The adult Thestral stands over 9.5 inches tall, and even both come with fabric wings that fold out for flight poses. The head, legs, and wings are articulated, meaning kids can adjust them according to the scene they are trying to recreate. Maybe fold out the wings when it’s roaming through the Forbidden Forest casually, or keep them up when it senses a threat nearby!</p>



<p>Speaking of the Forbidden Forest, the small tree adds to the atmosphere, pulling the set together nicely. Like all LEGO sets, this one comes with a detailed instruction book that takes you through each step one by one. It’s quite easy to follow, but if you also have the option to install the LEGO Builder app for 3D instructions. It lets you zoom in on each step, see it from all angles, track your progress, and more.</p>
<p>All things considered, this set can be a great holiday gift for a Harry Potter fan in your life, and you can even get it for yourself. Just be sure to grab it up before the sale expires.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-clears-its-macbook-air-m4-to-new-all-time-low-now-officially-2x-cheaper-than-macbook-pro-2000645418</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-clears-its-macbook-air-m4-to-new-all-time-low-now-officially-2x-cheaper-than-macbook-pro.1358125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple doesn’t do Black Friday promotions, at least on its official website. It prefers to keep prices premium while offloading inventory quietly through Amazon during big sales events. That way, the company preserves its brand image and still moves units at competitive prices via third-party retailers. For Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">the 2025 MacBook Air with M4 chip and 256GB SSD storage drops down to $749 on Amazon from its usual list price of $999</a>, an all-time low. That pricing makes the Air officially half the cost of the base MacBook Pro at $1,599 and creates a value gap which is impossible to ignore.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Performance Without the Pro Price Tag</h2>
<p>The M4 chip brings Apple’s recent silicon architecture to the Air lineup and delivers performance that rivals many Pro models. An eight-core CPU tackles multiple browser tabs and video calls simultaneously without the lag that plagues older Intel-based laptops. The ten-core GPU pushes enough power for casual gaming, 4K video editing in Final Cut Pro and 3D modeling in lighter applications like SketchUp. <strong>Apple Intelligence features run entirely on-device through the Neural Engine</strong> and it processes requests locally rather than sending data to cloud servers for privacy-conscious computing.</p>
<p>The 16GB of unified memory is double what Apple was offering in base configurations just two years ago and finally provides some headroom for professional workflows without forcing upgrades that can get very costly. The unified architecture allows CPU and GPU to share this pool of memory dynamically and allocates resources where they’re needed, rather than partitioning the RAM into separate zones.</p>



<p>The<strong> Liquid Retina display measures 13.6 inches, with a resolution of 2560 by 1664 pixels</strong> and up to 500 nits of brightness. That makes text and colors sharp enough for both content creation and consumption. True Tone automatically adjusts white balance according to ambient lighting to reduce eye strain during long work sessions. The screen supports P3 wide color gamut for displaying more saturated colors compared to standard sRGB panels, which makes photo editing and design work quite accurate.</p>
<p>This 256GB SSD has enough storage for operating system files, essential applications, and a working library of current projects, although creative professionals accumulating large photo or video libraries will want more external storage. Apple’s SSD delivers sequential read speeds of over 2000MB/s, launching applications and opening files almost instantly under heavy workloads that keep laptops responsive. The speed difference between SSDs and traditional hard drives is still dramatic, eliminating much waiting that used to characterize older laptops.</p>



<p>Going easier,<strong> it lasts up to 18 hours on light tasks like surfing the web</strong> or working in documents – a full workday plus evening use without having to hunt for chargers. It’s about 15 hours of video playback which should get you through the longest cross-country flights with runtime to spare. The fanless design ensures it runs silent no matter your workload, pulling off what Windows ultraportables promise but seldom deliver without thermal throttling or whine.</p>
<p>You’re getting M4 performance, 16GB of memory, Apple Intelligence integration, and that <strong>build quality that keeps MacBooks functional for 6-plus years for $749</strong>. That’s half of what the entry MacBook Pro costs, despite minimal real-world performance differences for the average user.</p>

<p>FromSoftware games are confusing at the best and easiest of times. Elden Ring’s huge popularity and mainstream breakthrough have meant that more eyes are on the company’s ambiguous storytelling than ever. If you’ve ever wanted to understand the nitty-gritty of Elden Ring, YouTuber VaatiVidya has explained all.</p>



<p>You might not have heard the name VaatiVidya, but if you’ve any interest in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-expansion-dlc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a>, you need to. The YouTuber has racked up over 3 million subscribers on YouTube and has become popular for their Elden Ring lore explainer videos. Well, that visual and audio content is now coming to the written medium in the form of a new (and somewhat pricey) book.</p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-lore-in-book-form">Elden Ring Lore, In Book Form</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Quality. Credit to VaatiVidya</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://youtube.com/post/Ugkxxl2QfRJDpRsk_HP0kzlQBg9jYy1PQU6D?si=9X2K9FGpqhQWFArG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VaatiVidya</a> used their YouTube channel to deliver a proud statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“So…I’m writing a book! An interpretation of Elden Ring’s lore. It’s my YouTube channel in physical form, and it’s called “Lore Bound”. Preorders are available at: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=backstage_event&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbTBNU0lNQkVOYmVHUGVRYTMxY1N6dmw4dWtLQXxBQ3Jtc0trc2wwX2FOUGtXTEwwblRKQS1sQXlXbmlHNDBnSXc1bHFfTy1GZU5HcGcyendQdG1MbHl0YjZISGo3dElHTzZBU3FkQjRIeEZMMnlxNDZWLXV3N0VNYkVpLXkxZGpKRDhLeHRwaFY3SmFTb2dhUEpSbw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tuneandfairweather.com%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://www.tuneandfairweather.com</a> This book will bind together everything I’ve learned from Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erdtree, and Nightreign into one single volume. My old video scripts will be updated, new illustrations will be commissioned, and every effort will be made to ensure each page is clear and engaging.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From characters to areas of the land, the book will be an all-encompassing encyclopedia of Elden Ring lore, knowledge, and explanations.</p>



<p>Prices start at $42 for the softcover edition, reach $95 for the deluxe edition, and ask as much as $144 for the full bundle. If you have doubts about the content or the nature of the book, the ‘Lore Bound: Elden Ring Explained (free digital sampler)’ might pique your interest as it gives you a digital copy of one whole chapter—free of charge.</p>



<p>If you’re an Elden Ring fan, it might be worth purchasing. You must wait until at least Q3 2026 for the book, but it should be one of the most in-depth Elden Ring books and lore explainers to date.</p>



<p>Will you buy it? Is it the perfect gift for all ER fans?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I like to think of the mainline Dragon Quest series sort of like a donut. A donut may have sprinkles on top, be glazed, or maybe tied in a knot, depending on where you get it, but at its heart, you know what to expect when you bite into one. You know you will get a delightful treat of fried dough, sweet, and usually covered with some sort of other goodies, and in Dragon Quest’s case, you know you can expect a grindy turn-based RPG, the distinctive designs of Akira Toriyama, and the vexation that comes with trying to dispatch smiling metallic blobs. That familiarity is comforting and the differences exciting, all at the same time. Dragon Quest is the same way, and even after nearly 40 years, even the latest entries all these years later, feel like a DQ game. After sinking my teeth into the upcoming Dragoon Quest VII Reimagined, slaying slimes and solving mysteries, this latest looks to retain that same DQ goodness.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined marks the third iteration of Dragon Quest VII, the best-selling entry in Japan, following the original 2001 PlayStation release just before the PS2, and the mid-2010s 3DS remake. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined Release Date Trailer - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Running around the dreary village of Wetlock, where my demo took place, I got a good look at the new art style of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined in action. Coming off the sprite-based goodness of the HD-2D Erdrick Trilogy remakes of Dragon Quests I &amp; II, seeing this new handcrafted style was quite a spectacle. The use of real-world materials as textures in the clothing and gear of the main characters, thanks to the highly detailed puppets that were made and scanned in, gives this version of DQVII, and Prince Kiefer’s broad chin, a distinct vibe and feeling all of its own.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The use of real-world materials as textures in the clothing and gear of the main characters, thanks to the highly detailed puppets that were made and scanned in, gives this version of DQVII, and Prince Kiefer’s broad chin, a distinct vibe and feeling all of its own.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to Reimagined’s producer, Takeshi Ichikawa, he explained that this shift in style was done to better capture the unique proportions and style that the characters in Dragon Quest VII have. “They're drawn shorter than the other mainline Dragon Quest characters. So we kind of wanted to leverage that. We explored a lot of ideas of visual styles that leverage the adorableness and the cuteness of those short characters.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking out my reverence for sprite-based games, the new style of Reimagined is impressive, but at least for me, it took some getting used to, and one that I’m not entirely sold on just yet. As you might expect from a DQ game, the distinctive art of Akira Toriyama is expertly rendered in this new way, but with representations of real-world materials such as the weave that made up the Bag O’ Laughs enemy, or more pronounced scales, felt… odd? It’s hard to describe, but it’s that “off” feeling whenever you see a more realistic version of your favorite cartoon or anime character, like seeing actual hair strands on Goku. Okay, maybe it isn’t that level of odd, but you get my point. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also noticed that the colors seemed rather muted compared to what I’ve come to expect from these games and Toriyama’s Dragon Quest work. The green of the hero’s little hat and outfit that I am used to being a vibrant spring-time green looked more like the color of a cloak – like what a sneaky elfish ranger may wear when trying to be seen among the brush, for instance. I’m also a bit bummed that we are losing out on party members changing their appearance based on the vocation they have equipped that was featured in the 3DS version, but I imagine making that many outfits for the puppets would have taken a considerable amount of time to do, and then scan in for the game, so I’m willing to forgive that one. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Trimming the Fat</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Square previously mentioned that, for Reimagined, the team removed non-critical storylines and other content, including Grondal, El Ciclo, Providence, the Casino, and more, to streamline the experience and make it more approachable. One area that the team has paid special attention to is the opening few hours, which, speaking from experience, really drag on, with your first encounter with a slime not coming until close to three hours in. It was a barrier that caused even Ichikawa-san to give up the game back when he first played it as a child in elementary school. Thankfully, he promises that you will be slaying your first critter within an hour of starting up the game this time. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I realize hearing terms like “streamlining” or “more approachable” – along with the mention of cut content – may be off-putting to hear for some folks, or even causing some to be concerned that Reimagined will be a “diet” version of Dragon Quest VII. Obviously, the small snippet I did get to try out doesn’t give me much insight into how the cut and adjusted narrative content impacts things. At least from a gameplay standpoint, Reimagined feels just like a Dragon Quest game should, with the new mechanics and features feeling right at home.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Get a Second Job</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Quest VII is part of the small and exclusive club of series, alongside the likes of Dragon Quests VI, IX, and III, that features a vocation system that lets you swap around the jobs, and as a result, the abilities of your party members. Reimagined further expands on this with the introduction of Moonlighting, which allows each character to have not just one, but two jobs, with abilities to pick from and level up, giving me flashbacks to Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age. I am a self-admitted job-system sicko, and even though a ton of jobs were still locked and hidden in the snippet I played, I could have easily spent my entire time tinkering around with different combinations of roles and seeing how they played off of each other. I appreciated that Reimagined also clearly shows what the requirements are to unlock new vocations, too, meaning I will be able to really target the ones I want when Reimagined  releases!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After fights, I would earn vocation points that act as experience that will level up whatever ones I had equipped. It looks like Reimagined pulls from the 3DS version’s school of vocations, as my characters could only use skills of the jobs they had equipped.  Vocations also come with associated “Perks” —special actions they can take when specific criteria are met, essentially a Limit Break of sorts. These can be big attacks, heals, or buffs that will help you turn the tide of particularly nasty boss fights, which Dragon Quest games are never lacking in. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Finding Fragments</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The aspect of Reimagined that I was most interested in checking out and seeing how this latest version would handle was the magical fragments, which are, debatably, the most defining mechanic of this seventh installment. These artifacts, which you collect and then stick together like LEGO to reveal new locations to visit, can be a real pain to find. The previous 3DS remake had a special finder on the system’s bottom screen that would alert you when one was nearby, and really eliminated a good bit of the frustration and headache from tracking the suckers down, so I was really curious how this new game would address it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This time around, fragments simply will show up on your minimap. When you collect them, they will appear greyed out, alongside a support system with the strange Caretaker and adjusted locations for the pesky tablets to make the whole hunt easier. I do hope there is still some challenge in finding fragments in the final release. I don’t need to feel like Indiana Jones uncovering a long-lost and forgotten artifact, but I don’t want to feel like a toddler picking out the square from an assortment of circles and triangles either. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tweaked for You</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There were other handy little tweaks and additions that aided me in my quest to discover missing townsfolk around Wetlock. I stumbled on special Goddess statues that I could save and heal at, which made them far more attractive spots to do some level and job grinding. Reimagined brings over some of the help options from the HD-2D remakes, like being able to toggle fully healing when a character levels up and adjustable difficulty settings, among others, to help bring this tale into the modern era with modern expectations. One unfortunate feature that Ichikawa-san and the team weren’t able to work out was a good way to use the lizard-gecko creature in this new game, never making it past early discussions on how you could utilize this creature. But at least our favorite little critter has made its triumphant return to the character art for the hero after being completely absent from the 3DS release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Dragon Quest VII first came to the West in 2001, a year after the PlayStation 2 was released, its dated sprites on 3D backgrounds were competing with the evolutionary leap of the RPG in Final Fantasy X that same year. The 3DS version suffered a similar though not as troublesome, release window in the States, coming to the aging handheld a mere six months before the Switch would begin its campaign to conquer the world with the likes of Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Super Mario Odyssey, and a little game called The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, redefining what was possible with a handheld gaming device. Dragon Quest VII Reimagined marks the first time that this story is being told from a standpoint of being already outdated on arrival in the West. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After my 45 minutes were up, I had successfully solved the mystery of the disappearing citizens of Wetlock, climbed to the top of a tower to avoid a devastating flood, and vanquished the monster behind it. All in all, a typical day in the life of a Dragon Quest hero and his friends. While many aspects of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined are still a mystery, all of those special little qualities and personalities that have kept this series going for almost 40 years are still on display. I am eager to see all that this new version has to offer and just how the removal of some story beats and addition of new ones impacts the overall campaign, along with what the new gameplay mechanics bring to the Dragon Quest DNA. 2026 may just be the year that the rest of the world really sees what has made Dragon Quest VII the best-selling entry over in Japan, giving it the stage to finally shine.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-goes-much-farther-than-the-hd-2d-remakes]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards</a> return this December, but how were the nominees selected and who determines the games that actually win? And does the public have any say? All of these are questions you might be wondering ahead of the event next week, and here's what we know about the key details.</p><h2><strong>What games are eligible?</strong></h2><p>To be <a href="https://thegameawards.com/faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eligible</a> for The Game Awards this year, games must be "available for public consumption" on or before Friday, November 21. Any game releases after then will be eligible for next year's show. This also means that games released on or after November 22, 2024 are eligible for this year's event.</p><p>Live-service games that released in a previous year are eligible for all categories, provided the voting jury determines that "their inclusion is merited due to new content, improvements, or service updates." There is also a dedicated category, Best Ongoing Game, which recognizes such titles.</p><h2><strong>How are nominees selected?</strong></h2><p>The Game Awards website states that an international jury of more than 100 media and influencer sources--including GameSpot--form a coalition that votes to decide on the nominees.</p><p>"Each voting outlet completes a confidential, unranked ballot based on the collective and diverse opinion of its entire editorial staff, listing out its top five choices in each category," reads a line from the website.</p><p>Ballots are counted and the five games that appear the most on ballots get selected as the nominees. Any category that comes up tied gets pushed to six (or more) nominations. This year, there were six nominees for multiple categories, including Game of the Year, Best Performance, Best Independent Game, and Best Family Game.</p><p>For the eSports, accessibility, and Best Adaptation categories, a "specialized" jury comes together to select those categories.</p><h2>How are winners selected?</h2><p>The Game Awards are ultimately decided upon by the same voting jury, but public fan voting factors in as well, which is why you may have seen developers call upon their fandoms to vote for their game. The voting jury controls 90% of the vote, with public fan voting making up the other 10%.</p><p>People can vote on The Game Awards website, or in China, people can make their selections on Bilibili. Voting closes on Wednesday, December 10 at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET.</p><p>Some have called on The Game Awards to adopt a 100% pubic fan vote stance where the fans have all the say, but the organizers say this would create "several challenges."</p><p>"First, given that some games are exclusive to one platform, a public vote puts single-platform games at an inherent disadvantage over multi-platform titles. In addition, it is important that winners cannot be socially engineered in any way. We find that a blended vote is the most credible and authentic way to select winners," the team said.</p><h2><strong>No fees</strong></h2><p>All games are "automatically eligible" for The Game Awards, with no submission process at all, and this means there is no fee for a publisher or developer to put their game forth for consideration. "The Game Awards strongly believes that no game developer or publisher should have to pay to have a game considered for nomination," the team said. Not every awards show works this way, as developers/publishers <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/gamescom-award" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pay to have their games considered at the Gamescom Awards</a>, starting at €440 ($508 USD).</p><h2><strong>Is Geoff Keighley involved?</strong></h2><p>Geoff Keighley is the creator and host of The Game Awards, but he is not a member of the voting jury. He has been very public about his close friendship with Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima, which has raised some eyebrows over the years at The Game Awards.</p><h2><strong>Other bias concerns</strong></h2><p>The Game Awards is funded, in part, by sponsors--some of whom have games in the running for awards. The organizers claim "there is no connection" between sponsorship and nominations/awards. The voting jury is "wholly unaware of who is sponsoring or participating in other elements of the program," according to The Game Awards. The group also claims that the nominees and winners are not shared with the developers beforehand, with teams finding out "at the same time as the public."</p><p>"The Game Awards does not disclose winners in advance of the live ceremony. There are no exceptions to this rule," the group said.</p><hr><p>The Game Awards will be held on December 11, and streamed live around the world. In addition to naming all the award winners, the event promises game announcements, trailers, and other reveals.</p>

The mode does exactly what you'd expect: allows you to replay the entirety of Atsu's revenge tale with all of the gear and skills you've already unlocked, giving you an edge--or a bullet--on the battlefield, which means you don't have to unlock the two different guns again. You'll start Atsu's journey already strapped.</p><p>You can also replay challenges with stat tracking to set scores for certain duels, experience harder difficulty options in the settings menu, and purchase new gear (like charms, dyes, and cosmetics) from a new merchant.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY8MXfksWuw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vY8MXfksWuw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Sucker Punch Productions' senior communications manager Andrew Goldfarb <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/19/new-game-plus-comes-to-ghost-of-yotei-november-24/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed more details about the free update</a> on the PlayStation Blog.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> lore expert VaatiVidya is releasing a book, following over a decade's worth of YouTube videos covering the work of FromSoftware.</p>
<p>The forthcoming book, titled Lore Bound, will focus on Elden Ring, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC, and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a> spin-off.</p>
<p>"It's my channel in physical form," the creator said in a video. Of course, it's not officially endorsed, but includes VaatiVidya's own interpretation of the ambiguous lore set forth by FromSoftware's writers.</p>

<p>There are other lore experts included, too, as each chapter will include boxouts with extra information and alternate takes from other fans. It also includes illustrations from John Devlin and Sebastián Franchini.</p>
<p>"Every Elden Ring video I've created first began as a script - lore written to be as concise and entertaining as possible for you all," said VaatiVidya. "So really it feels natural to transform these scripts into a book."</p>
<p>In collaboration with publisher Tune &amp; Fairweather, the book will come in a softcover edition for £32 (or with a sleeve for £50), as well as a deluxe edition for £72 with hard binding.</p>
<p>Lore Bound is set to be released in Q3 of 2026, but can be <a href="https://www.tuneandfairweather.com/collections/the-vaati-collection">pre-ordered now</a>.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>It's also not VaatiVidya's first book. His previous book, Soul Arts, features fan art inspired by FromSoftware's games and is still available from the same publisher.</p>
<p>Though there are plenty of Elden Ring lore videos on YouTube, VaatiVidya is generally considered the pre-eminent lore expert, providing in-depth analysis full of detail. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VaatiVidya/videos">videos feel definitive, if not official</a>.</p>
<p>Lore Bound is testament not only to VaatiVidya's own work, but the work of FromSoftware and Game of Thrones author George RR Martin, who created a rich world ripe for interpretation.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-of-thrones-creator-says-theres-some-talk-about-elden-ring-film-but-his-involvement-could-be-limited">Martin hinted there was "some talk" of an Elden Ring film</a>, but his involvement will be limited as he's behind on his latest book. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-live-action-film-officially-in-development">film was then officially announced</a> back in May.</p>

<figure data-uuid="17dd7efc036ac"><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/17dd7efc036ac/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>After 105+ minutes of gameplay and breakdowns, we have finally arrived at the launch week for Masahiro Sakurai's latest joint, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p>
<p>The game is mere hours away from boosting onto Switch 2 on <strong>20th November</strong> (that's tomorrow!), and that means that it's time to take a look at the reviews and give you a summary of all the different opinions out there.</p>
<p>We'll start with our own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">review</a>, naturally, where the wonderful PJ O'Reilly granted Air Riders a 'Great' 8/10, praising the sheer amount of content and depth of the racing — once you get your head around what's going on. Here's a snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a chaotic and frenzied racer, there's no doubt, but it's got depth for those who wish to learn and plenty of competition to be had both online and at harder difficulties for diehards</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:193790 @ 1763568005 -->
<p>But are we alone in our admiration? Let's take a look around the web and find out...</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with a whopping 9/10 review from <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/reviews/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-2-best-racer-791012-20251119">GamingBible</a>, where the outlet enjoyed just about everything the game had to offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> may fall short in terms of track selection compared to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, but I’ll be damned if it isn’t the best racing game released this year, and one of the best first-party Nintendo games to launch on the Nintendo Switch 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/kirby-air-riders-review/">The Gamer</a> opted for a 4/5, giving particular respect to City Trial mode and the game's overall presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even more so than the kart racing adjacent Air Ride, City Trial isn’t for everyone, and I can see a lot of people being put off by how relentlessly hectic and loud it can become. Still, as a connoisseur for carnage, I can’t wait to keep playing online and get wrecked by real players instead of CPU bots</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>On much the same page, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kirby-air-riders-review/">VGC</a> also awarded Air Riders a 4/5, even if it conceded that Road Trip, not City Trial, is the standout mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All this combines for a game that appears almost insultingly simple at first – virtually any action except for the special attack is performed with a single button – but hides a hidden depth in its vehicle diversity and special moves</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These good times continued in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review">IGN</a>'s 8/10 review, where the outlet sang the praises of the game's scope and strangeness, but felt the overall formula and controls didn't stack up to multiplayer mayhem elsewhere:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest hurdle to enjoying its dizzying amount of content is how it all controls, as its frantic pace and slippery one-button control scheme is endearingly novel, but occasionally too simple for its own good</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/kirby-air-riders-review">GFinity</a> went marginally lower in its 7/10 review, appreciating the frantic excitement of it all, but feeling slightly let down by some game modes and the generally overwhelming nature of the race structure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a game that fully embraces its mayhem, with it rather unapologetically overloading your senses. Sometimes that’s overwhelming, sometimes it’s confusing, but more often than not, it makes Kirby Air Riders uniquely entertaining</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, for a contrasting opinion, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review-nintendos-pink-puffball-rides-24741030/">Metro</a> wasn't as keen on Air Riders, giving it a 4/10 after struggling to get on with just about every game mode on offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If, however, you want to play an irritating, formless, racer that’s simultaneously overcomplicated and far too simple then Kirby Air Riders is the game for you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, Kirby Air Riders is sitting on a 78 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kirby-air-riders/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">Metacritic</a> score based on 64 critic reviews. Hey, at least there's not long to wait until we all get to go hands-on with the full game tomorrow.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-ceo-says-game-characters-should-be-able-to-be-ai-trained-on-human-made-scripts-to-have-more-natural-conversations.1358080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In a recent appearance <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/11/17/gaming-is-americas-pastime-and-the-entertainment-business-of-the-future-says-take-two-ceo-zelnick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on CNBC's morning business news program Squawk Box</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that in the future, game characters will likely be AI-trained on human-made scripts to have more natural conversations with players, instead of being limited to the scripted interactions that the developers had foreseen when they envisioned the game. </p>



<p><em>Historically, we had to script every single action that a character engaged in, and because it is interactive, think about how much scripting that is. Now, we're always going to need great writers, and we always will have plenty of scripting, but characters should be able to be trained on that very scripting that has been created by great writers and then interact in a way that feels more natural. I do see that happening.</em></p>



<p>Could that be one of the major new features that Rockstar Games has prepared for Grand Theft Auto VI, now officially one year away from its launch (provided there are no further delays)? Just two days ago, a new rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-is-likely-to-be-unmatched-for-almost-two-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surfaced</a> about the game featuring extremely ambitious features that may remain unmatched for 'decades'.</p>



<p>Regardless of whether a similar feature makes it in GTA VI or not, the technology is absolutely here now. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA ACE</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-and-nvidia-demonstrate-on-device-ai-character-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inworld AI</a> already offer something like that, where game characters can respond to natural conversations depending on what they should be aware of. </p>



<p>Zelnick's comment, however, comes at a time when there's a lot of tension on the usage of AI in the industry. Black Ops 7 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized for its 'AI slop' assets</a>, while ARC Raiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came under fire for using generative AI to voice NPCs</a>. On that subject, the developers behind the highly successful episodic adventure game Dispatch <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dispatch-is-on-course-to-beat-its-three-year-sales-target-in-three-months-heres-how" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told GamesIndustry</a>:</p>



<p><em>You're not going to be surprised because it's built on something you've heard before if you go the AI route. So, yeah, honestly, AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one. Maybe it's a creative one if you aren't creative.</em></p>



<p>Of course, when discussing AI, there's much more beyond just empowering game characters or voicing them. As part of his reply on CNBC, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick also highlighted that the company is using the technology to create 'efficiencies', which, however, won't reduce the headcount but will instead let them focus on creative tasks.</p>



<p><em>Table stakes are creating more efficiency in development and marketing, and every enterprise is trying to do that. We're trying to do that and we're seeing some good early results in creating efficiencies. By the way, efficiencies is not code for reducing employment, it's code for taking away mundane tasks so people can focus on more interesting, creative tasks. </em></p>



<p>That is, after all, the sentiment behind many other AI statements we covered recently, from <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> to <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ricard Pillosu</a>.
