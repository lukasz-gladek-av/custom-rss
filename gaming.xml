		<p>While ZA/UM is now a very different studio to the one that made <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>, the team that now exists at the studio has revealed Zero Parades, an intriguing spy thriller CRPG.</p>
<p><iframe title="ZERO PARADES - Official Announcement Trailer (Gamescom 2025) #gamescom2025 #gaming #pcgaming" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D4JVY8rR-XQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You’re one of the best spies out there, Hershel Wilk, alias CASCADE, but you’re one that’s haunted by past failures and seek redemption by taking on a new and mysterious assignment. That drops you into a three-way power struggle for control of a new city, going up against international bankers, foreign techno-fascists, psychic doppelgängers, and plenty more.</p>
<p>You’ll fail in your mission, but then you’ll have another chance to right this wrong.</p>
<p>Here’s some Steam blurb:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Become an Anti-Icon</strong>: Play as Hershel – brilliant, relentless, magnetic… and cursed. A former top operant whose touch turns everything to shit. She is as dangerous to her enemies as she is to her friends.</li>
<li><strong>Espionage Reinvented:</strong> Descend into a world of bootleg mind-erasure, failed space programmes, and state-sponsored pop stars. This is espionage stripped of glamour – no parades, no happy endings – at least probably not for you.</li>
<li><strong>Failing Forward:</strong> In the life of an operant, failure is inevitable. Here, it’s another way forward – every misstep opens doors that success would run swiftly by.</li>
<li><strong>A Story-Rich Espionage RPG: </strong>From the studio which brought you <i>Disco Elysium. </i>Blending the psychological depth of a spy novel with surrealist undertones and richly drawn characters.</li>
<li><strong>A Question of Identity: </strong>Who are you when no one is watching? Or, at least, when you *think* no one is? In ZERO PARADES, the answer will define much more than just the assignment. Cope with the terror of reality by giving up parts of yourself and try not to lose your mind in the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Originally released for PC in 2019, Disco Elysium was enhanced and came to consoles in 2021, and a stunning example of narratives within video games. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/14/disco-elysium-the-final-cut-review-ps5-ps4-stadia-pc/">10/10 review of Disco Elysium: The Final Cut</a>, Gamoc said, “The story is absolutely captivating, the world is filled to the brim with detail, and the characters and their motivations are remarkably well thought out. […] Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is a masterwork and you are doing yourself a disservice if you miss it.”</p>

		<p>With the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> – Order of the Giants DLC <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/indiana-jones-the-order-of-giants-dlc-is-coming-out-in-september/">set to launch next month</a>, Bethesda and MachineGames shared a new gameplay and story trailer to dive into what it will entail when it arrives on 4th September.</p>
<p>Oh, and the game is also coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026! Surprise!</p>
<p><iframe title="Launch Trailer – Indiana Jones and the Great Circle™: The Order of Giants" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XD9Q3nIpMqQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The DLC takes us back to Italy, and Rome in particular, to delve into some of the mysteries surrounding the Order of the Giants, starting with a huge helmet that the pope had, and continuing on to translate some ancient messages, suggesting that the mythical giants never died… if they were ever alive?</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is out now across Xbox Series X|S, PC, and PlayStation 5.In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">our review of the main game</a> I said, “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle forges its own, distinctive path as an archeological adventure, excellently capturing the feel of the films with its visuals and performances. There’s a fun new story here as well, wrapped around its blend of exploration, puzzles and pugilism.”</p>

		<p>Capcom shared a new trailer for Onimusha: Way of the Sword, the revival of this classic Japanese action series, set to launch in 2026.</p>

<p>The trailer showcases more of the enemies that you’ll face in Onimusha: Way of the Sword, with Miyamoto Musashi tormented verbally by a mysterious foe as she unleashes new and different enemies at him, including some creepy ones that can stand up again after being totally cut in half. </p>
<p>Thankfully Musashi is one heck of a samurai warrior, Oni Gauntlet on his arm or no, and fights back with incredible flourishes of his sword, multi-blade attacks and more as he delves into the malice and Genma monstrosities that afflict the city of Kyoto.</p>

<p>Sweet!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>During Gamescom Opening Night Live, it's been confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> will launch on the Switch 2 in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Published by Bethesda Softworks and developed by MachineGames, the Xbox-owned release is the first major Switch 2 title from the publisher. We don't have a specific release date yet, but we'll be sure to let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Live the adventure as Indy in a thrilling story full of exploration, immersive action, and intriguing puzzles. As the brilliant archaeologist – famed for his keen intellect, cunning resourcefulness, and trademark humor – you will travel the world in a race against enemy forces to discover the secrets to one of the greatest mysteries of all time.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>- Travel from the halls of Marshall College to the heart of the Vatican, the pyramids of Egypt, the sunken temples of Sukhothai, and beyond. When a break-in in the dead of night ends in a confrontation with a mysterious colossal man, you must set out to discover the world-shattering secret behind the theft of a seemingly unimportant artifact. Forging new alliances and facing familiar enemies, you’ll engage with intriguing characters, use guile and wits to solve ancient riddles, and survive intense set-pieces.</p>
<p>-Indiana’s trademark whip remains at the heart of his gear and can be used to distract, disarm, and attack enemies. But the whip isn’t just a weapon, it’s Indy’s most valuable tool for navigating the environment. Swing over unsuspecting patrols and scale walls as you make your way through a striking world. Combine stealth infiltration, melee combat, and gunplay to combat the enemy threat and unravel the mystery .</p>
<p>- Venture through a dynamic mix of linear, narrative-driven gameplay and open-area maps. Indulge your inner explorer and unearth a world of fascinating secrets, deadly traps and fiendish puzzles, where anything could potentially hide the next piece of the mystery – or snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>TT Games popped up at GamesCom Opening Night Live to reveal <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, an all-new block-based collection starring the caped crusader.</p>
<p>This one is set to arrive on Switch 2 at some point in <strong>2026</strong>, and it looks awesome! Legacy of the Dark Knight will adapt some of Batman's most iconic movie moments, featuring the likes of The Joker, Penguin and Bane (voiced by Matt Berry, no less).</p>
<p>We got a glimpse at a sweet-looking combat system, heard about multiple difficulty options, and laughed a little harder than we probably should have done at some dumb LEGO humour.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_star_wars_the_skywalker_saga">LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a> absolutely slapped when it launched a few years back, so here's hoping that Mr. Vengeance himself can cook up something similar next year.</p>

			<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle made an appearance at Gamescom ONL 2025, with gameplay for its coming Order of the Giants DLC featured. We expected to see that, since <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Xbox already announced</a> that we'd get a new look at Order of the Giants during Gamescom 2025. But what we didn't know, was that Indy's latest adventure is also coming to Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The Order of the Giants DLC will be arriving on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this coming September 4, which Xbox previously revealed during its <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-announced-launches-in-september-2025/">Summer Game Fest presentation</a> this past June, though unfortunately, the Switch 2 version won't be ready in time for that release date. It'll make its way onto Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2026, as no specific release date was announced.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>MachineGames' spin on the whip-cracking adventurer was already an impressive title and technical showcase on the beefiest of PCs and current-gen consoles, but the studio has clearly pushed things to a new level by bringing the game on the go on Switch 2.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what compromises the studio made to make the Switch 2 version possible, and what the team is able to retain from the experience that's possible when you have the best hardware backing the game.</p>



<p>In the meantime, players who've already dug into the base game on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, or PC, can look forward to the Order of the Giants DLC that's arriving in a little more than two weeks time from the time of this writing.</p>

            <p>Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War 4 has been announced during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>.</p>
<p>The Orks are crying out, and it's because Dawn of War 4 is set to release at some point in 2026. The Orks are also crying out in a slightly more thoughtful manner, since the game's coming from German studio King Art Games, rather than original developer Relic.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>King art, the studio behind 1920s alt history RTS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iron-harvest-review">Iron Harvest</a>, are billing this as a return the series' roots. There'll be force growing, base building, squad specialising , and a Sync Kill system to show you gory melee combat details. Dawn of War 2's Last Stand mode returns, alongside AI skirmishes and multiplayer that runs from 1v1 to 3v3.</p>
<p>As for the plot, here's the synopsis: "Set many years after the events of Dawn of War: Dark Crusade, war has returned to the planet Kronus, along with Captain Cyrus, Chief Librarian Jonah Orion, and Warboss Gorgutz and several new commanders as four factions fight for supremacy. Kronus features a number of distinct biomes including the Wasteland, Iceland, Highlands, Hive City &amp; Manufactorum regions."</p>
<p>If you need a refresher as to the last time war dawne, our Fraser wrote the following in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-3-review">his review</a> of Dawn of War 3:</p>
<blockquote>There are moments, many of them, during multiplayer and AI skirmishes, where I’m absolutely certain that Dawn of War 3 is the best game in the series, even with its missteps when it comes to cover and fortifications. I could happily continue rambling on about the brilliant faction design or how I still squeal with glee every time I drop a gargantuan beast of an Elite like Imperial Knight Solaria into a fight – you haven’t lived until you’ve witnessed her impossibly huge guns turning an army of Orks into green-red paste. If you’re only interested in the campaign, however, then you’re unlikely to find as much to get enthused about.
</blockquote>
<p>We'll see whether a fresh studio really can take Dawn of War back to it's, er, dawn of war.</p>

              <p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> is Microsoft’s first release confirmed for Switch 2. The stealth action adventure will hit Nintendo’s handheld hybrid in 2026, but the new DLC will arrive next month on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p> <p>MachineGames’ latest port to a Nintendo platform didn’t get a specific release date, so we have no idea if it’s coming in the first half of 2026 or the holiday season. We also don’t know what it will look like since there was no accompanying gameplay teaser. I guess all those Switch 2 dev kits really did go out late, even to places like Microsoft.</p> <p>But we did get another trailer at Gamescom for the upcoming <em>Order of the Giants</em> DLC expansion coming to <em>Indiana Jones</em>. Also a release date: September 6. Here’s the new footage:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Launch Trailer – Indiana Jones and the Great Circle™: The Order of Giants" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XD9Q3nIpMqQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>It looks neat, although Troy Baker seems to be reverting back to his usual voice a bit. Story expansions are hit-or-miss with single-player games, but <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> is close enough to feeling like a movie that I could see a bite-sized adventure being a nice treat.</p> <p>Microsoft hasn’t yet announced any other ports for Switch 2, including ones that feel obvious like Sea<em> of Thieves</em> or<em> Diablo 4</em>. Hopefully, <em>Indiana Jones</em> means the dam is about to break on all of those, though it seems like we’ll have to wait until next year, and possibly beyond for most of them.</p>

And they brought with them a trailer for season two that is packed with references for <span>fans</span>&nbsp;to go wild over.</p> <p>Here’s the trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-teaser-images-new-vegas-lucky-38-mr-house-lucy-2000618233"><em>Fallout</em> season two</a>, which begins on Amazon Prime on December 17:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Fallout – Season Two Teaser Trailer | Prime Video" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TsP09cZA7o?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>After premiering in April 2024, the <em>Fallout</em> series received rave reviews, lots of award nominations, and big ratings for Amazon, leading directly to a massive increase in the number of people playing old <em>Fallout</em> games. Not surprisingly, following all this success, Amazon quickly announced a second season, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-prime-bethesda-1851421573">which wrapped up filming in May</a>. The highly anticipated new season of&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>&nbsp;arrives on Amazon Prime this December, and&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-trailer-new-vegas-season-3-ghoul-lucy-1851780416">the show has already been picked up for a third season</a>.&nbsp; This new teaser trailer from Gamescom has me, a big <em>Fallout</em> fan, very excited, as it looks to be turning the knob labeled “<em>Fallout</em> Shit” up to 11.</p>

 <p>In this new trailer, we see Las Vegas before it’s bombed and becomes New Vegas, famously seen in Obsidian’s <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. We also see Mr. House’s Lucky 38 casino and his massive office at the top. We also see the man himself, played by Justin Theroux. He and Howard Cooper, aka The Ghoul, seem to have a close relationship. I also spotted plenty of stuff from <em>Fallout</em>: <em>New Vegas</em>, including: Caesar’s Legion, the famous dinosaur statue, a dangerous Deathclaw, and the helpful robot Victor.</p> <p><em>Fallout’s</em> second season premieres on Amazon Prime on December 17, and episodes will air weekly after that.</p>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will make the jump to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026, it was revealed during Gamescom Opening Night Live in Cologne.</p>



<p>First released on Xbox Series X|S and PC in December 2024, Indiana Jones then released on PlayStation 5 back in April as Microsoft’s cross-platform support continued, and it’s now been confirmed that a Nintendo Switch 2 launch is planned.</p>



<p>Confirmation came during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live showcase, where a detailed look at the upcoming DLC, The Order of Giants, was shown, with the big Switch 2 reveal then following.</p>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will be the first major Switch 2 title from Bethesda Softworks and MachineGames, potentially opening the door for future releases on the platform, and will feature all of the excitement and mesmerizing locations that stole the show on other platforms.</p>



<p>Further details on the Switch 2 release will arrive in the coming months and a more precise release date will likely be provided next year. </p>

<p>Fallout, the award-winning Amazon Prime television series, has received an all-new trailer for the upcoming second season during the Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom. </p>



<p>Fans have been patiently waiting for the second series to land since the first dropped in April 2024, and this new trailer has stoked that hype even further.</p>

<p>The second season of Fallout will unravel across the Mojave as we return to New Vegas for the first time since the 2010 Fallout game of the same name. This fan-favorite location has made for an exciting build-up to the second season, as for many, Fallout: New Vegas represents the best of the post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TsP09cZA7o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new trailer</a> that was showcased by Amazon Prime Video during Gamescom:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It was claimed earlier this year that ‘multiple Fallout projects’ are in development outside of the television show, but it hasn’t yet been made clear what they are. The assumption is that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-techland-dying-light-3/">Fallout 3 remaster is incoming</a>, but some fans have theorized that some kind of Fallout 76 current-gen overhaul is almost on the way.</p>



<p>The newest trailer for the Fallout television series shows how nicely it’s shaping up. It’s bigger, bolder, and more ambitious than the first season, and we’ll see the stories of our core trio of characters (Maximus, The Ghoul, and Lucy) unfold in a much more impressive way this time around. That’s for sure.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the second season of Fallout? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Monster Hunter Wilds will get a new monster called Omega Planetes, a four-legged machine boss from Final Fantasy XIV, along with FF14 cosmetics, like Chocobo mounts. This content will arrive as part of Title Update 3 in late September.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0SSf7KG8yw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O0SSf7KG8yw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Meanwhile, Final Fantasy XIV will get content based on Monster Hunter Wilds, featuring the Seikret mount and a boss fight against Arkveld, the flagship monster from Monster Hunter Wilds. It's not clear how in-depth the quest line in FF14 will be, but the FF14 part of the collaboration will arrive in early October. The trailer does show a character investigating dead monsters and riding a Seikret through a desert canyon, so there will likely be a dungeon alongside the boss fight against Arkveld.</p><p>Capcom recently moved up the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-expansion-is-coming-sooner-than-expected-after-suffering-underwhelming-sales/1100-6533593/" data-ref-id="1100-6533593">release of a new end game difficulty level</a> in an effort to expand the endgame content, which has received criticism from fans for lacking depth. Square Enix recently revealed that it is ending support for Final Fantasy XIV on Windows 10, although the game will likely still work on that operating system for the foreseeable future.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Lords of the Fallen 2--technically the third game in the series--takes place one hundred years after the 2023 reboot. The previous game revolved around traveling between the world of the living and the world of the dead. In the sequel, the two dimensions are converging. The debut trailer was shown as a part of <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-games-and-trailers/2900-6888/">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Throughout the trailer, a voiceover intones the necessity of fighting the gods, who were potential allies in the first game. He urges the protagonist, the Lamp Bearer, to use a dark power to bring "retribution" to the heavens. It is unclear whether players will play as the same character from the last game, or which of the original's three endings Lords of the Fallen 2 will enshrine as canon.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer was a pre-rendered cinematic, but it teased boss battles players may encounter in the full game. One such foe is an angel-looking woman with wings made up of multiple arms, like branches on a tree. At the trailer's climax, the Lamp Bearer fights the angel underneath a tower crowned with a gigantic flower.</p><p dir="ltr">The angel decimates him, and he awakens at the same tower, which is now surrounded by giants and encircled by massive vines. This implies that upon death, Lords of the Fallen 2's world will change, becoming darker and more dangerous. But details of how exactly this system will work have yet to be revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">The original Lords of the Fallen received mixed reviews back in 2014. The reboot was a financial success, <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lords-of-the-fallen-is-getting-a-revamped-new-game-plus-option/1100-6518572/">selling over a million copies in its first 10 days of release</a>. Lords of the Fallen 2 was <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lords-of-the-fallen-sequel-announced-but-probably-wont-be-on-steam/1100-6524313/">announced back in 2024</a>. Epic has an exclusive licensing deal for its PC distribution.</p>

<a href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> will be released on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> console next year.
</p>
<p>
The news was revealed at tonight's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> Opening Night Live, along with a look at the forthcoming DLC The Order of Giants coming 4th September - next month!
</p>
<p>
The previously Xbox exclusive game was released on PS5 back in April, and now it will be coming to Nintendo's new console. Everything is an Xbox!

<p>
Presumably the DLC will also be coming to the Switch 2 version, but for now The Order of Giants will be coming to Xbox Series X/S, Steam, and PS5 in September.
</p>
<p>
A new trailer was shown too, with more of the first-person whip-cracking action fans loved about the base game, now set in Rome.

<p>
Of course, it makes sense for the two games to join forces considering they both let you ride a giant yellow chicken. And it's not the first time the series have collaborated: a few years ago a Monster Hunter World crossover added hunts and exclusive armour to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> MMORPG.

		<p>TT Games and Warner Bros. have revealed their next big LEGO game – LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, which is set to launch in 2026 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2 and PC!</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hQAoGj01Rc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is the definitive, essential Batman story, going from origin to legend. Train with the League of Shadows, fight crime in Gotham, face off against the Joker, Penguin, Bane (voiced by Matt Berry!) and plenty more, referencing TV, comics, movies and games, all mushed together in the TT Games way. This latest Lego game looks to build on the legacy of both the previous Lego Batman games and Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.</p>
<p>The combat features powerful attacks, counters, combos in more of an Arkham Asylum way.&nbsp;This game will have difficulty levels for the first time – Dark Knight mode will ramp things up – and you will build a family of Bat-allies.</p>
<p>Oh, and Gotham is a big open world as well to explore how you see fit.</p>

<p>Looking back at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/02/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a>, we said “Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is the most ambitious Lego game yet, and despite the occasional technical mishap it delivers a daring and often delightful romp through the most iconic film franchise of all time.”</p>

		<p>Long-awaited sci-fi horror game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/routine">Routine</a> now has a launch window, and is set to launch in late 2025 for Xbox and Steam, and it will be day one into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROUTINE | Release Window Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hH5ZYM3nCP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Routine is a first person sci-fi horror game set on an abandoned lunar base featuring plenty of retro analogue technology as you go face to face with a terrifying threat.</p>
<p>Here’s a little bit of bullet pointed blurb from Lunar Software:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigate a retro-analogue future</strong> – Roam through contrasting sectors of the Lunar station, from abandoned malls to deteriorating living quarters.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive design and gameplay </strong>– Full body awareness, diegetic audio, and a minimal UI create a gripping and atmospheric experience.</li>
<li><strong>Explore using tools</strong> – The Cosmonaut Assistance Tool (C.A.T.) is vital, and players must use it to access critical terminals, navigate the environment and identify clues.</li>
<li><strong>Survive the unknown </strong>– Run, hide, or attempt to defend against threats, using the C.A.T. as a last resort.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since its first announcement in 2013, Lunar Software has been beavering away for over a decade to flesh out an immersive world to scare the heck out of you. Before a brief check in back in July, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/09/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-re-revealed-with-a-creepy-new-trailer/">the previous update we had for the game was way back in 2022</a>, where a re-reveal trailer featured during Summer Game Fest.</p>

<p>It could actually be good, then!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Atari has announced a brand-new <strong>Bubsy</strong> game – no, really!</p>
<p>In collaboration with developer Fabraz, known for the rather excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/demon_turf">Demon Turf</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bubsy-4d">Bubsy 4D</a> will launch on the Switch and Switch 2. And it actually looks pretty good too! There's no release date at the time of writing, but more information will be coming very soon.</p>
<p>There's even a special outfit available in-game that lets you recreate the old Bubsy games – y'know, if you want. Man, it looks so cool.</p>
<p>Let's check out the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In <em>Bubsy 4D</em>, the Woolies - an aggressive, fabric-stealing alien race from the planet Rayon - are back at it again but this time going straight for the source: stealing Earth's sheep and empowering them with Woolie technology. Things quickly spiral when the sheep revolt, creating a new breed of enemies, the BaaBots, to overthrow their captors and return with a new army to claim back The Golden Fleeces. Now, it’s up to Bubsy and his motley crew of acquaintances to journey through space and steal back the Golden Fleece from the BaaBot’s newly claimed, fleece powered, woolly home planets."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Atari is also releasing a collection of Bubsy games in collaboration with Limited Run Games. This will be launching on 9th September 2025, so could well prove to be the best way to prepare for Bubsy 4D.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-tt-games-gamescom-onl-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-is-the-%E2%80%9Cdefinitive%E2%80%9D-batman-experience-coming-in-2026.1274373/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer Traveler's Tales (also known as TT Games) has announced its latest major LEGO game, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, during Gamescom ONL 2025, which it says is the "<em>definitive</em>" Batman story and experience that will take players through every major aspect of Bruce Wayne's story.</p>



<p>Similar to how <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-biggest-lego-launch-sales/">LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a> took players through every era of Star Wars in LEGO form, <a href="https://legobatmangame.com/">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> will let players explore bits of every era of Batman in an open world Gotham spanning the decades of films, TV shows, games, and comics. You'll even be able to fight crime across Gotham in any version of the Batmobile that you might prefer.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hQAoGj01Rc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>No specific release date was announced for Legacy of the Dark Knight, but we do have a 2026 release window for its arrival on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. There's also no mention of a Nintendo Switch version, making this another new Switch 2 exclusive title for Nintendo players.</p>



<p>One element that seems to be a key difference for Legacy of the Dark Knight compared to previous LEGO games, is that only seven playable characters are confirmed so far. Batman, Jim Gordon, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Catwoman, and Talia al Ghul are the confirmed characters so far, which could mean that this is the first licensed LEGO game that doesn't let you collect and swap between characters, big and small, from a franchise.</p>



<p>That's just speculation, however, based on the game's <a href="https://legobatmangame.com/faq/">FAQ</a>, as we could get further clarification sometime in the future. But it could also very well be the case, as the FAQ also stipulates that Legacy of the Dark Knight will pull together "<em>iconic moments from the Caped Crusader’s 86-year history in film, television, comic books, and games,</em>" but doesn't specify that we'll play through any of those specific stories the way you play through each of the films in the Skywalker Saga.</p>



<p>Regardless, it's still an exciting announcement for LEGO and Batman fans alike, and could potentially be one of the best reveals throughout the entire Gamescom ONL 2025 showcase.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025, CI Games shared the first cinematic trailer for Lords of the Fallen II. The sequel to the 2023 Soulslike game is still planned to launch at some point in 2026 for PC (only on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/deathbringer-58d924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9p2wwhwd5v4v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>. Wishlisting is now available on all those platforms. </p>



<p>Marek Tyminski, CEO of CI Games, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>After selling over 2 million units and welcoming over 5.5 million Lampbearers into Lords of the Fallen, it’s clear our comeback was community-powered. With Lords of the Fallen II, we’re going further. In 2024 we proudly announced our deep commitment to be a player-first studio. The V2.0 update was our promise in action: listen, respond, and deliver. This sequel is built on that same foundation.</em></p>



<p>The Polish publisher has also shared the initial rundown of Lords of the Fallen II features, though admittedly it looks a lot like that of the previous installment, with the exception of the community feedback mention.</p>



<p><em><strong>DUAL WORLDS:<br></strong>● Explore two fully explorable parallel realms, including a deadlier, expanded Umbral.<br><strong>FULL CO-OP PROGRESSION:<br></strong>● Full shared campaign progression in online co-op from day one.<br><strong>PLAYER-FIRST DESIGN:<br></strong>● Developed in direct response to community feedback, including optional PvP and custom game modifiers.<br><strong>VISCERAL COMBAT:<br></strong>● Brutal executions, extreme gore, and an unapologetically mature-rated experience.<br><strong>UNREAL ENGINE 5:<br></strong>● Lords of the Fallen’s signature visual style and tight gameplay upgraded for the next generation.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>There must be a lot more to it if CI Games really hopes to make the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ci-games-lords-of-the-fallen-2-empire-strikes-back-dark-knight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as significant for the franchise as The Empire Strikes Back was for Star Wars</a>. Anyway, to celebrate the announcement, the Lords of the Fallen II team will be live at Gamescom 2025 with its official Tattoo Sanctum, offering attendees a ‘soulslike for the flesh’: free tattoos (permanent and henna) inspired by exclusive new imagery from the franchise. For those unable to attend, a sweepstakes will offer a one-of-a-kind canvas painted by Maxime Taccardi of The Scion, painted in the artist’s own blood - a visceral tribute to the unapologetic gore awaiting players in Lords of the Fallen II.</p>



<p>While the game itself isn't playable at this year's event, we will have the chance to speak with one of the CI Games executives about it. Stay tuned for our interview.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign Reveal Analysis]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-reveal-analysis/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Activision and Treyarch recently invited a select group of journalists and content creators out to their California-based offices to get an early sneak peek at the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. While we did get to go hands-on with the multiplayer, that’s something that Activision has requested that we keep under wraps for the time being.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 comes at a strange time in the series for those that have been following the likes of Mason and Menendez over the fifteen years that the Black Ops series has run. Thematically, it looks like a direct continuation of last year’s Black Ops 6, while narratively, it’s actually a sequel to Black Ops 2. As a quick refresher, Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 took place across a couple of different timelines, both in the mid to late-80’s as well as the current year of 2025. Black Ops 7 takes those threads planted and brings the story up ten years in the future to the year 2035. Treyarch assured that there wouldn’t be any homework required to get into the narrative of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and rather exists as a narrative throughline for longtime fans of the Call of Duty campaigns to appreciate.</p>



<p>Right off the bat, Treyarch has revealed that they want Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 to be a social and connected experience and started off by showing some sneak peek at what they’re working on for a co-op campaign. From start to finish, the entire campaign can be played either solo or co-op with up to four players. During an interview with one of the lead developers, it was confirmed that there would not be any difficulty options this time around; rather, the difficulty would be dictated by the number of players in a given match. There also aren’t any intentions to fill a solo campaign with AI bots and at this stage of development, drop-in and drop-out matchmaking isn’t yet in the cards.</p>



<p>The campaign itself brings together a ragtag team of some of the best of the best in their respective units, with John Eric Bently and Michael Rooker reprising their roles from Black Ops 2 while David Mason is now portrayed by Milo Ventimiglia of Gilmore Girls fame. Leilani “50/50” Tupuola is the resident newcomer of the team, being portrayed by Frankie Adams and representing New Zealand for the first time in the series. This newcomer has a number of bionic augmentations making her a unique member of the squad.</p>


<figure>

				    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
			    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Sharing a few more details on the campaign, Treyarch is talking about how this would be a “mind-bending narrative” connecting Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 7. These include a variety of diverse missions including a number centered around squad leader Mason’s fractured psyche. One of the brief campaign snippets centered around a twisted version of Menendez’s Nicaraguan safehouse with a massive version of Menendez looming overhead while massive machetes rain down on the battlefield.</p>



<p>Once the campaign is complete, players graduate and unlock a new twelfth mission called Endgame. This massive campaign mission unlocks all of Avalon for players to explore with support for up to 32 players in a single match. Using the campaign as a sort of tutorial, Endgame builds upon everything that players learned and utilized, from the new tools and movement to weapon loadouts, to create a tiered, shared experience. Think MWZ’s missions and difficulty tiers but with more permanent progression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To empower players during their “power journey”, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s Endgame lets players pick a single Operator and level up to customize their skills and abilities far beyond anything in the actual campaign. Regrettably, a full squad wipe will reset progress for that given Operator. Treyarch only showed slides of what the progression/status screens look like but from what I could tell, the given Operator was called Striker and had two active abilities to equip. A separate Combat Efficiency stat (this operator was rated at 60). There were three different power upgrades showing health, armor and foot (presumably a mobility stat) that each had three different ranks.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Weapons themselves appeared to have different rarity tiers as well as levels. One of the two weapons equipped was an Exotic tier weapon with a unique ability: all ammo collected into one massive clip. Whether this means that it’s an actual unique weapon in itself, or simply pulling from a list of special weapon perks, is something that I’m waiting to see Treyarch reeal when they get ready to talk more about Endgame.</p>



<p>Lastly, Treyarch ended their talk about the connected campaign for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. For the first time in franchise history, there will be global progression regardless of players going through the campaign, multiplayer, zombies, wargame, et cetera. There will be a dedicated camo track for the co-op campaign as well as the first mastery camos. To keep players want to come back into the campaign (beyond just the Endgame), there will also be seasonal events including daily challenges and reticle changes. Weekly challenges won’t be in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 at launch but are intended to drop alongside the first season.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will launch on November 14th.</p>

<p>The game's set in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avalon">Avalon</a> and stars veteran Black Opser David Mason. It's delivering a bit of futuristic and psychological weirdness alongside the usual war. There's a campaign that you can tackle solo or with up to four-players via co-op. This campaign also has an endgame called Endgame, which is definitely peak videogames.</p>
<p>It's set in 2035, with the likes of Raul Menendez and Emma Kagan, CEO of a tech company dubbed The Guild, looking like they're the baddies. Aside from that, it's got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-been-announced-can-someone-please-explain-the-plot-of-these-games-to-me">the usual co-op, zombies and competitive multiplayer bits</a>.</p>
