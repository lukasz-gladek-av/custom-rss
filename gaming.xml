<p>The game's launch, however, was only the beginning. Following Season 1 which brought back both fan favorites like Andy Bogard and Joe Higashi and iconic characters from the Street Fighter series like Ken and Chun-Li, Season 2 will bring even more iconic characters like Wolfgang Krauser, Blue Mary and Kim Jae Hoon, as well as two mystery characters - one<a href="https://x.com/SNKPofficial/status/2009414900343558604"><strong> teased to be none other than <em>Kenshiro</em> from <em>Hokuto no Ken</em></strong></a> (<em><strong>Fist of the North Star</strong></em>)</p>



<p>Ahead of the Season 2 announcement, we had the chance to speak with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves</em> Producer Shinya Tamaki and Director Hayato Konya to discuss the new character additions, the balance changes coming with a big balance patch launching on January 22 and what's in store for the future.</p>

<p><strong>Wccftech: FATAL Fury: City of the Wolves Season 2 brings back heavyweights like Blue Mary, Kim Jae Hoon, and the legendary Wolfgang Krauser. The latter, in particular, hasn’t been a playable character of the "main" timeline for quite some time. How does his return fit into the game with the presence of Rock Howard and the legacy of Geese?</strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">(Hayato</strong><strong> </strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Konya):</strong> <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">I can't say much now without giving away major spoilers, but this character will be one of the key figures delving into “a certain issue” surrounding Rock and Geese. Please look forward to his release for further details.</em></p>



<p><strong>Wccftech: Wolfgang Krauser is fondly remembered by long-time SNK fans for his iconic Dies Irae music track. Can fans expect a new arrangement of this classic to debut alongside him, or is the sound team exploring a completely new musical direction for his arrival in South Town?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Konya):</strong> <em>This is also something we cannot talk much about at this time, so please look forward to his release.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-the-nightmare-of-south-town"><strong>The Nightmare of South Town</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Wccftech: Including Nightmare Geese as a new character is definitely an interesting choice. Since Rock has spent his life trying to escape his father’s shadow, does Nightmare Geese appear as a literal haunting/vision for Rock Howard, or is he a simple gameplay addition to bring back an iconic character in some way?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Konya):</strong> <em>Since Geese himself has died, he cannot be involved in the main storyline. Therefore, this time he appears in the game solely as the “Nightmare of South Town.” Even after death, we believe he would still be a “nightmare” for those living in South Town.</em></p>



<p><strong>Wccftech: With Jae Hoon joining the roster, the Kim family legacy is now front and centre. How does his playstyle in CotW evolve from his Garou: Mark of the Wolves days, and can we expect any "family reunions" in the future?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Konya):</strong> <em>We wanted Jae Hoon to have a different evolution than his brother. We figured he would carry and refine his father's techniques more accurately, so he will have a distinct playstyle to his MotW version. We hope you look forward to it. If both sons continue to do well, we may even see their father again someday.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-the-monthly-cadence-and-guest-characters">The Monthly Cadence and Guest Characters</h3>



<p><strong>Wccftech: Season 2 will also see the debut of two other mystery characters. Without giving too much away, can you say if the two unannounced challengers in Season 2 follow the trend of "legendary fighters" from SNK's history, or should fans expect more guest characters like Ken and Chun-Li in Season 1?</strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">(Shinya</strong><strong> </strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Tamaki):</strong> <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">We'd like to keep this information a secret for now. We are sure fans will be delighted to see who they are, so please look forward to it.</em></p>



<p><strong>Wccftech: Speaking about guest characters, what is it that would make a character a good fit for FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves? Ken and Chun-Li were designed to feel like their SF6 versions but adapted to the REV system, but for the future, would you be looking for guests that contrast the South Town style, or guests that feel like they’ve always lived there?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Tamaki):</strong> <em>As you said, we think that characters that match the world and themes of Fatal Fury make for the best fit. However, we also want to challenge ourselves in terms of game design and make this a game where you can enjoy various kinds of fighting styles and characters with unique traits. Any character that adds to the world of Fatal Fury by their inclusion, as well as a character that fans would enjoy being added, these are the two things we want to prioritize.</em></p>

<p><strong>Wccftech: Releasing a character every month is a very aggressive pace for a modern 2D fighter. What led to the decision to move to this monthly cadence for Season 2, and how does your development pipeline support a quick turnaround without sacrificing quality? Is a new character every month something that should be expected in future seasons as well?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Tamaki):</strong> <em>Since this is our first Fatal Fury release in 26 years, we heard from a great number of fans that they wanted to use "this character" or "that character." As developers, we wanted to respond to the players' requests as quickly as possible, so we immediately worked to expand our development scope and capacity. As a result, we finally have the resources to be able to add one character per month starting from October 2025. We will work hard to maintain this cadence for as long as possible going forward, aiming to deliver character additions and updates to the players at a rapid pace.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-upcoming-balance-changes">Upcoming Balance Changes</h3>



<p><strong>Wccftech: With the game changing every 30 days as a new fighter joins the roster, how do you expect the competitive landscape to keep up?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Tamaki):</strong> <em>While new characters will be joining the fray, the core gameplay remains unchanged. We hope that players will leverage the skills they've honed thus far to compete and enjoy fighting with these new characters as well.</em></p>



<p><strong>Wccftech: FATAL Fury: City of the Wolves Season 2 will be accompanied by a major system-wide balance patch. What are some of the most notable changes? And what's the philosophy behind all the upcoming balance changes?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Konya):</strong> <em>In Season 1, so-called "Standard" characters stood out a bit too prominently, and we felt like characters with other concepts did not get much opportunity to shine. Starting from Season 2, we want to make adjustments that allow those kinds of characters to thrive as well.</em></p>



<p><strong>Wccftech: It has been mentioned that the update will feature system adjustments based on player feedback. What was the #1 request from the community that you were able to address in this upcoming update?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Tamaki):</strong> <em>This update releasing on 1/22 includes changes in response to the many things fans have been asking for. We believe that the long time fans have been waiting has allowed us to thoroughly refine the game, so please look forward to it and enjoy it.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-the-future-of-the-game">The Future of the Game</h3>



<p><strong>Wccftech: FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves has successfully brought the series back into the global spotlight. As we look past Season 2, what is your long-term vision for the game? Do you see City of the Wolves as a platform that will continue to grow for years to come?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Tamaki):</strong> <em>Thank you for your kind words. As developers, we are extremely happy that we were able to bring an IP as cherished by both us and the fans as Fatal Fury back after 26 years. We are deeply grateful to the fans for the positive messages and feedback as well. This has only made us more determined to continue showing off the appeal of the wonderful world of Fatal Fury to even more players. We will continue to work hard as developers to meet fan expectations, so please look forward to the continued growth of FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks as though Sony has just deleted the entire back catalog of a certain publisher from the PlayStation Store, which means that if you're a PS5 owner, you now have significantly fewer shovelware games to slog through when you're browsing for discounts.</p><p>As spotted by self-proclaimed "trophy hunter" <a href="https://x.com/robthanatos/status/2011487254724952207" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RobThanatos on X</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-wiped-over-1000-shovelware-games-off-the-playstation-store-without-warning-all-from-a-single-developer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), all of publisher ThiGames' titles appear to have been removed from the PSN Store, which amounts to precisely 1,194 titles.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with the work of ThiGames, perhaps some of the studio's game titles will jog your memory; it's responsible for trophy-centric games like <em>The Jumping Food Memory</em>, <em>The Jumping Orange 2</em>, and <em>The Jumping Cheese Maze</em>.

</figure>
<p>As RobThanatos points out, ThiGames enjoyed the distinction of having the fourth highest number of games on the PlayStation Store prior to Sony's cull, beaten out only by similarly low-scope publishers Webnetic and Ratalaika, as well as niche studio eastasiasoft.</p><p>It doesn't look as though games ThiGames has yet to release have been removed, however; at time of writing, the store page for <em>The Jumping Food Memory </em>(which I'm sure will buck the trend and turn out to be an all-timer) is <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009259" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">still up</a>.</p><p>ThiGames' titles are, or at least seem to be, low-effort releases designed to rack up trophies quickly rather than to engage or stimulate. It's often possible to collect all of the trophies in a ThiGames release in a handful of minutes.</p><p>The games are usually incredibly simple in terms of gameplay and visuals, often consisting of a single backdrop accompanied by a familiar and very basic take on an existing genre (assuming the gameplay isn't just, well, jumping, that is).</p>
<p>Whether or not this is part of a wider effort on Sony's part to crack down on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/shovelware-importance-games-industry" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9ec3beae-77dd-466c-9dbd-b14356e65d73" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shovelware</a> on the PlayStation Store remains to be seen, but at the very least, your trophy hunting has just gotten more difficult, it seems.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1406980</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple wasted no time ushering in the new year with a compelling deal on one of its most popular laptops. Just weeks into 2026, the 2025 MacBook Air has already received a notable price drop, making it far more accessible for students, professionals, and everyday users alike. Amazon i<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">s currently offering the M4-powered MacBook Air with 256GB storage for $799, a substantial reduction from its original $999 price tag</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>At just 2.7 pounds, this latest MacBook Air remains an ideal companion for commuters, travelers, and anyone who prefers a lightweight setup without sacrificing capability. The slim chassis hides impressive hardware, including a 10-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU, along with support for as much as 24GB of unified memory. Powered by Apple’s M4 chip, the laptop delivers a major leap in speed – up to twice the performance of the M1 Air and dramatically faster than older Intel-based models (23 times faster to be exact).</p>
<h2>Everyday Performance</h2>
<p>Apple engineered the M4 chip to work seamlessly with its growing suite of Apple Intelligence features. This means smoother multitasking, quicker responses, and improved efficiency across demanding applications. Whether you’re juggling spreadsheets, editing photos and videos, or running multiple apps and browser tabs, the MacBook Air handles it all with ease while staying cool and silent even with its fanless design.</p>
<p>Battery life remains one of the Air’s strongest advantages. With up to 18 hours of use on a single charge, it’s built to last through long workdays or extended study sessions without constantly searching for an outlet.</p>



<p>The upgraded 12MP front-facing camera captures crisp 1080p video, making it a solid choice for remote work, online classes, and video calls. Paired with a three-microphone array, voice clarity is excellent even without additional accessories.</p>
<p>Everyday usability features are well covered. The backlit Magic Keyboard offers a comfortable typing experience in any lighting condition, while Touch ID provides quick and secure access. Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt ports for high-speed data transfers and external displays, MagSafe charging for added safety, and – thankfully – a traditional headphone jack for wired audio fans who refuse to give up their AUX-powered headphones.</p>
<p>For users already invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the MacBook Air integrates effortlessly with other devices. Features like AirDrop, iMessage, and Handoff make switching between an iPhone, iPad, and Mac feel seamless.</p>
<p>Several configurations are currently discounted. The base 256GB model starts at $799, the 512GB version sits at $999. Each of those comes with 16GB of RAM. A higher-end option with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is priced at $1,199. All represent a $200 cut from their original prices and are available in four finishes: sky blue, silver, starlight, and midnight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The countdown to IEM Rio 2026 is well underway, and in the run-up to the event, ESL has unveiled the complete lineup of teams set to compete at the upcoming CS2 spectacle. The tournament kicks off on April 13 and will run for <strong>six days</strong>, with all comers battling for the biggest piece of the $1 million prize pool in Rio de Janeiro.</p>



<p>ESL confirmed the full roster of direct invites sent on January 15, along with the spread of teams selected for the GCQ and ACQ. From these qualifiers, another three teams will surface, two coming from the global bracket and one from the Americas bracket.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-teams-confirmed-for-iem-rio-2026-by-esl">All Teams Confirmed for IEM Rio 2026 by ESL</h2>



<p>The ESL posted a graphic on social media revealing the split of teams invited to IEM Rio 2026. Here’s the full rundown:</p>



<p><strong>Direct Invites</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>PASSION UA</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Team Vitality</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>Spirit</li>



<li>Natus Vincere</li>



<li>MOUZ</li>



<li>Aurora Gaming</li>



<li>B8</li>



<li>Legacy</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>3DMAX</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Global Closed Qualifier Invites</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>PARIVISION</li>



<li>HEROIC</li>

<ul>
<li>Imperial Esports</li>



<li>Fluxo</li>



<li>BESTIA</li>



<li>YNG Sharks</li>
</ul>



<p>Fans noticed a few notable absences, namely from the organizations that were quick to decline their invites: Astralis, NiP, and FlyQuest, for instance. In the Americas Closed Qualifier, PaiN, NRG, and M80 all declined a spot.</p>



<p>There’s more than the face-value price pool to play for at <a href="https://pro.eslgaming.com/tour/2026/01/iem-rio-2026-invited-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IEM Rio</a>, of course. The tournament is one of the main contributors to the ESL Grand Slam, which awards <strong>one organization </strong>$1 million. It’s the most prestigious prize in the Counter-Strike 2 space, and it’s what many of these teams play for.</p>

A job. A plan. Toss those ingredients together, and you’ve got yourself a classic heist—but with a few twists. Your crew members are everyday citizens (from different countries in Africa) with pretty normal careers. The job is to liberate African artifacts from Western museums. And the plan? Well, that’s up to you to create.</p><p><strong>Africanfutur-heist</strong></p><p>Near the end of the 21st century, the political powers that be brokered a Transatlantic Returns Treaty, promising the repatriation of African artifacts from museums. Good old fashioned diplomacy was working—until it wasn’t. An amendment switched up the terms and conditions of which objects were to be returned. Museums, now knowing that only publicly displayed artifacts would be given back, were slowly removing artifacts from public display.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>When life gives you lemons and museums pulling shady moves, it’s time to chuck the lemons back at life and try a new, <a title="Genres > Stealth [107 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a>ier form of diplomacy. You’ve got 70 of these artifacts to (re)loot, all of which exist in real-life and are of huge cultural, historical, and spiritual significance to the people they were taken from.</p><p><strong>Teamwork Makes The Heist Work</strong></p><p>It all starts with a troublesome little brother, who, yeah, gets you into all sorts of messes. But thankfully, as Nomali, you’ll meet more reliable crew members from different African countries. Recruit people from the classic hacker to… your prim and proper grandma? Don’t worry, grandma pulls her weight.</p><p><strong>Case the Joint</strong></p><p>Plan ahead to lay the groundwork for a beautiful masterpiece of an escape. Check the getaway route, fiddle with puzzles and obstacles, and find spots to recruit the help of the right teammates.</p><p><strong>Get In. Get Out.</strong></p><p>Once you’ve set the stage carefully and the artifact is sitting all pretty—looking quite not-stolen, but no worries, you’re gonna fix that ASAP—this is the moment to perform. Plucking an artifact from its resting spot starts the countdown timer, and with Nomali’s flow-based parkour abilities, escape should feel like you’re in the fun, montage part of a heist movie. But if you slacked on the planning phase, you’re gonna pay for it!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Pull Off Heists</strong> – Plan and prepare your escape route by solving puzzles and placing teammates in the right place. When you’re ready, take the artifact and escape with Nomali’s flow-based parkour abilities.</li><li><strong>Recruit a Crew</strong> – Meet and gradually recruit different team members with their unique abilities.</li><li><strong>Explore an Africanfuturist Setting</strong> – With a Hideout based in South Africa, you’ll see parts of Johannesburg imagined in the future.</li><li><strong>Reclaim Real Artifacts</strong> – Recover 70 artifacts that exist in real-life, all of which are of huge cultural, historical, and spiritual significance to the people they were taken from.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Relooted (2026) | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iM311P33398?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/relooted-launches-february-10]]></content:encoded>

<p>Afghani said he refers to himself as "the second guy who's doing Mario," with Martinet forever standing as "<em>the </em>guy."</p><p>"There is such an unbelievable respect for Charles. He is amazing," Afghani said.</p><p>Afghani began his career as Mario with 2023's Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Asked if he now gets recognized for his role, he said it "doesn't happen very often," in part because the job he does is mostly off screen.</p><p>"Nobody thinks about who does the voice of Mario. Ever. Everybody knows who Mario is. But the second you're like, 'He has a voice actor,' it's like, 'Oh, yeah, I guess he must,'" Afghani said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Afghani dispelled the rumor that he previously did narration work for Nintendo Directs in the past. It isn't true, he said. "There's this weird narrative online I was in Nintendo Directs; I narrated Nintendo Directs. I never worked for Nintendo before being Mario," he said.</p>

<p>The three Switch 1 SKUs combine for 46,360, while the PS5 models total in at 46,753 — talk about a close-run contest!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>launched almost a year ago, and since it released, players have been complaining about poor PC performance despite having machines more than capable (theoretically, at least) of handling things. Now, we might know why.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lengthy post</a> on Reddit, user de_Tylmarande outlines an experimental process by which they attempted to glean the reason behind <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' PC performance, which Capcom has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="69cb0344-d686-4265-ba86-2163d899fb4c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">acknowledged and pledged to fix</a> (the performance, not the post).</p><p>To boil the post down, de_Tylmarande essentially noticed that when playing <em>Wilds </em>on their friend's Steam account, which owns all of the available DLC, the frame rate was stable and there were no drops. On their own account, however, de_Tylmarande experienced frequent drops.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The cause of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' poor PC performance may have been solved.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This naturally led the user to conclude that <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' frame drops and PC problems are down to what they call "an insanely crooked and aggressive DLC ownership check function".</p><p>In order to prove their theory, de_Tylmarande created a sort of mod that essentially fools <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>into thinking the player owns all of its associated DLC. The mod doesn't actually unlock any of that DLC; instead, it just tricks the game into passing the check.</p><p>According to de_Tylmarande, once that mod was in place, "performance went through the roof". They stress that they don't recommend trying this solution and don't promote "using mods of this type" in <em>Wilds</em>, but that they did so in order to prove a point.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/comment/nzlrkxg/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">response</a>, a user suggests that this issue might be an example of "good enough for now" code being left in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, then never being fixed, leading to unpredictable problems later down the line. It's entirely possible.</p>
<p>In any case, unless you're looking to create a mod like de_Tylmarande's yourself (which they don't suggest), it's unlikely you'll be able to solve this problem for yourself. Still, it's an interesting thing to ponder.</p><p>The poor PC performance players have reported didn't stop <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0bfff7f-18bd-4b40-b07b-fe8c94d70a1a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">selling like hot cakes</a> in its initial <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">launch window</a>, although sales have since slowed, with Capcom blaming that slowdown not on the PC version, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0c5ff11-5fb9-4929-804b-8a8d4f7adae0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the PS5 release</a>.</p><p>You can check out <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can read our very own Tyler's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4b7be4a2-09a5-4299-a13c-a7bff937e081" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">review of the game here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Here’s Sophie Turner As Lara Croft For The New Tomb Raider Show]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-2000660139</link>
            <guid>1406920</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sophie Turner, best known for her roles as Sansa Stark in <em>Game of Thrones</em> and Jean Grey in<em> X-Men: Dark Phoenix</em>, is the new Lara Croft for the streaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-amazon-sophie-turner-2000623124">adaptation of <em>Tomb Raider</em></a>. Amazon MGM Studios revealed a first look at the actor in costume and, yup, I think she nailed it.</p> <p>Does that mean the show itself will be any good? Who knows. But it should help limit any skepticism about whether Turner is cut out to take over the English archeologist who moonlights as a puzzle-solving treasure hunter. The role was previously played by Angelina Jolie in the early 2000s and later by Alicia Vikander in the 2018 reboot. Here’s the first photo of Turner in costume, which essentially recreates Croft’s look from the 1996 game beat-for-beat:</p>   <p>The show has already started filming but we still don’t know what the live-action adaptation, helmed by <em>Fleabag</em>‘s Phoebe Waller-Bridge, will entail. Jason Isaacs will play Croft’s Uncle, Atlas DeMornay, while Martin Bobb-Semple plays Croft’s side-kick, Zip. Bill Paterson, meanwhile, will play her butler. Celina Imrie is also onboard as a museum curator while Sigourney Weaver plays someone “keen to exploit Lara’s talents,” according to Amazon.</p>

 <p>There’s no release date for the show yet, but given the production schedule I wouldn’t be surprised to see it pop up sometime in 2027. It follows Amazon’s success in spinning another hit game franchise, <em>Fallout</em>, into a streaming hit, and is part of Hollywood’s broader goldrush to exploit gaming IP instead of creating new ideas. It couldn’t be coming at a better time for the franchise, though.</p>

 <p>A reboot of the 1996 game called <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-tomb-raiders-new-lara-croft-2000652781"><em>Tomb Raider Atlantis</em></a> will launch later this year, followed by the next sequel sometime in the years ahead. That game has been in production for a while. The last new entry was <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> back in 2018.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-offloads-mini-5-pro-drone-bundles-now-at-a-record-low-with-rc2-controller-and-three-batteries-2000659926</link>
            <guid>1406917</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been thinking about adding aerial shots to your creative toolkit, the DJI Mini 5 Pro Fly More Combo makes a compelling case for taking the leap. Designed to balance performance with portability and ease of use, this drone <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6316/">bundle is currently available for $1,099 (down from $1,599) which is a sizable 31% reduction from its usual price</a>. That discount alone makes it eye-catching, but the real value lies in how complete the package is for anyone eager to start flying immediately.</p>
<p>Inside the box, you’ll find multiple intelligent flight batteries, a dedicated RC2 controller, a charging hub, and a travel-friendly carrying bag. Whether you’re heading out for a weekend hike or planning a more deliberate filming session, everything you need comes along without added hassle.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6316/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Drone for Every Skill Level</h2>
<p>The DJI Mini 5 Pro’s capability comes from its compact, lightweight body. It’s small enough to toss into a backpack, yet powerful enough to record sharp 4K HDR video at up to 60 frames per second. The camera’s Dual Native ISO helps maintain image quality across a wide range of lighting situations, so footage stays clean and detailed whether you’re filming under bright midday sun or chasing golden-hour shots.</p>
<p>Performance in the air is equally impressive. A long-range video transmission system delivers a smooth HD feed over great distances, while strong wind resistance and a 3-axis mechanical gimbal help ensure stable, shake-free footage. Even when conditions aren’t perfect, the drone remains reliable and controlled.</p>



<p>The included DJI RC2 controller adds to the seamless experience: Its <strong>built-in 5.5-inch HD screen</strong> provides a clear, responsive view of your live feed, removing the need to rely on a smartphone. This makes flying more intuitive and lets you focus on framing the perfect shot rather than juggling devices.</p>
<p>Content creators will also appreciate the drone’s flexibility when it comes to framing. With support for both landscape and vertical shooting, it’s easy to tailor footage for different platforms. From cinematic YouTube videos to vertical clips optimized for Instagram Reels or TikTok, the DJI Mini 5 Pro drone can adapt to how and where you want to share your work.</p>
<p>Extended flight time is another major advantage. With three batteries included, you can spend hours in the air across multiple flights, rather than cutting sessions short. When it’s time to recharge, the two-way charging hub keeps downtime to a minimum.</p>
<p>Add in generous internal storage and fast wireless transfers to your phone, and the DJI Mini 5 Pro Fly More Combo becomes an all-in-one solution for aerial photography. At its current discounted price, it’s a smart investment for beginners and a capable upgrade for experienced pilots.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Prime Video has uncovered our first look at Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, ready and in costume for the upcoming live-action adaptation, the first since 2018’s reboot starring Alicia Vikander.</p>



<p>Fan feedback has been mixed so far, with the Tomb Raider community divided on whether they approve of the casting or not. The team at Prime Video has opted for a classic reimagination of the traditional Lara Croft from the original games, but not everyone is happy.</p>







<h2 id="h-sophie-turner-s-lara-croft-is-dividing-fans">Sophie Turner’s Lara Croft is Dividing Fans</h2>



<p>It was just a few days ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazons-tomb-raider-announces-multiple-castings/">Prime Video uncovered</a> an array of castings for the upcoming live-action Tomb Raider <strong>series</strong>. It has been several months since Sophie Turner was confirmed as playing the iconic lead, but others have since moved into the frame, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sigourney Weaver</li>



<li>Jason Isaacs</li>



<li>Martin Bobb-Semple</li>



<li>Jack Bannon</li>



<li>John Heffernan</li>



<li>Bill Paterson</li>



<li>Paterson Joseph</li>



<li>Sasha Luss</li>



<li>Juliette Motamed</li>



<li>Celia Imrie</li>



<li>August Wittgenstein</li>
</ul>



<p>The more recognizable characters among the roster are the likes of Zip, Atlas, and Winston, all of whom have previously appeared in the decades-old series.</p>



<p>Sophie Turner, who will assume the role of Lara Croft, recently underwent a wardrobe test, appearing in a shot posted on social media earlier today by Prime Video. While the outfit is very much on point, fans aren’t entirely sure if she fits the <strong>look</strong>. In recent months, Turner revealed a physical regime designed to get her in shape to play the adventurous archeologist, but that’s not enough for some.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In the comments under the post, one user wrote, ‘It’s difficult seeing anyone in this role besides Angelina Jolie.’ Another wrote, ‘I don’t see Lara anywhere. Sorry.’</p>



<p>The feedback is mixed but leaning in favor of the general acceptance of Turner’s portrayal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is many fans’ favorite in the series. The seamless blend of traditional AC gameplay and movement was woven beautifully with pillaging and pirate pilates. There have been endless talks about an Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake for an eternity, so here’s the latest on the rumored title.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flags-steam-page-adds-new-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</a> is a special game, and anyone who’s played it can sense this very quickly. You could argue that no other game has perfectly captured the feeling of being an exploring and exterminating pirate assassin. Nostalgia is kicking in even while writing about this—might need a lie down and a pint of grog to comfort the soul.</p>



<p>Before that, here’s a look at Black Flag Remake rumors and leaks.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-getting-a-remake">Is Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Getting A Remake?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It should be a whale of a time. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Insider Gaming can confirm that an Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is happening, and you can start preparing yourself for its inevitable launch.</strong></p>



<p>If you haven’t been following Insider Gaming’s coverage, you have missed out on a wild adventure so far. The first confirmation that an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake was in development</a> started in January 2024. A Tom Henderson exclusive then pulled back the curtain on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-further-details-on-the-assassins-creed-roadmap-and-what-games-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Roadmap, and what games to expect</a> over the next few years.</p>



<p>It revealed that the Black Flag Remake was happening. These suspicions grew stronger after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft reuploaded Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Soundtracks</a> in January 2026, </p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-remake-coming-out">When Is Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake Coming Out?</h2>



<p><strong>Insider Gaming exclusively confirmed that the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is coming out before March 31, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Given that it’s January 2026, you should start getting excited, if you aren’t already! The exclusive story said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is set to launch before March 31</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/33qBiRpCj1Z9Ib5bbfbg5r/d4ab539ca9edd1fa28ebc0aec5b1af27/Ubisoft_H1_FY26_Slideshow_vFinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft H1 FY26 EARNINGS</a> from November 21, 2025, mentioned several games for 2026, with one game listed as an “Unannounced Title.” This is expected to be the Black Flag Remake.</p>



<p>There’s still no exact launch date, but it’s getting closer than a pirate is to water after reaching the end of the plank.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-resynced">What Is Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced?</h2>



<p><strong>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced is reportedly the new title for the Black Flag Remake.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone has been referring to a reimagining of the fourth mainline game as the ‘Black Flag Remake’ for a while. Ubisoft has seemingly mooted this with the appearance of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-appears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced on the PEGI Ratings site</a>.</p>



<p>As long as it keeps ‘Assassin’s Creed Black Flag’ in the name, it could add ‘Reimagined Pirate Paradise’ on the end, and everyone would still buy it!</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-amp-leaks">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake Rumors &amp; Leaks</h2>



<p><strong>Some of the biggest Black Flag leaks and rumors include suggestions that the game will be more RPG-Heavy than its original incarnation.</strong></p>



<p>Surprisingly, we haven’t heard too many inner details about the actual gameplay, more its release window. Leaks have indicated that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-new-details-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remake is more RPG-Heavy</a>: “Similar to Origins and Shadows.”</p>



<p>Resynced will allegedly also get rid of the modern-day aspects that many dislike about Assassin’s Creed.</p>



<p>Have you heard anything else about AC Black Flag Resynced? If so, head on over to the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> to share your findings.</p>

For months, Re-Logic has teased the release of the next update, Terraria 1.4.5. Now, the release date is set for later this month.</p><p>On <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-1-4-5-the-launch-date-revealed-at-last.145833/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site</a> for Terraria, Re-Logic announced that Terraria 1.4.5 will launch on January 27. The studio noted that the latest delay was caused because it needed to, "resubmit a few things, which pushed us back a bit further than expected."</p><p>Re-Logic hasn't shared a full list of the new features or improvements coming with the latest update, but it has teased a few during the game's monthly news updates. As an example, villagers will no longer need a house in order to show up in the game. However, they will ask the player to build them a house if there isn't one already.</p><p>One of the most intriguing additions to Terraria 1.4.5 is the RC Car, which was inspired by the Kwad Racer Drone. With the car, players can race around Terraria worlds and climb up backwalls. The racetracks will be customizable, and Re-Logic has invited players to "share them with us when the time comes."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4635633-terraria.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635633" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4635633-terraria.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635633"></a><figcaption>Promo art for Terraria.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4635633-terraria.jpg"></figure><p>Last summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/terraria-is-invades-palworld-later-this-month/1100-6532584/" data-ref-id="1100-6532584">a collaboration with Palworld</a> brought Terraria content into that game. Terraria 1.4.5 will return the favor by adding Palworld content to Terraria. The only confirmed Pal at the moment is Digtoise, who can help players when mining. However, there will be other Pals coming.</p><p>Re-Logic has also noted that nearly 900 bugs will be fixed with Terraria 1.4.5, as well as the "countless little things ... that go into each update." More details will follow later this month when the update arrives on January 27.</p>

            <p>Amazon has released the first official image of Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, ahead of the release of its Tomb Raider TV series.</p>
<p>The wardrobe check image, which you can see yourself below, shows Turner in an outfit very reminiscent of classic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a>. She's got the pistols, the shorts, everything you'd expect from a (hopefully) faithful adaptation of the video game series.</p>

<p>Set to release on Amazon Prime, the show hasn't got an official release date as of writing. We do, however, know about various casting decisions for the show ahead of a proper trailer release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Celia Imrie, Jason Isaacs, Sagourney Weaver and more have been confirmed for various roles</a> alongside the Game of Thrones star.</p><p>We also know that the show will inter-connect with the narrative present in the Tomb Raider games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-adaptation-will-reinvent-the-franchise-and-interconnect-with-the-games">rather than being a standalone project or a continuation of the Angelina Jolie movies</a>. This tidbit comes from Story Kitchen, a production company working on the series.</p>

            <p>Are you excited for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Xbox Series X/S? If you haven't already tried out the demo to see how it'll run on both platforms, then a new update from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> might get you even more hyped for the adventures of Cloud and co. on non-PlayStation and PC platforms. The publisher has announced that next Thursday, 22nd January, 2026, a patch for the PS5 and PC versions will launch that will update existing versions of the game will all the bells and whistles coming to the new platform versions of the game. Per <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/2011740264772305213">a tweet</a> from the company, this new patch introduces "Streamlined Progression, including the ability to keep HP and MP topped up", and the option to "always hit for 9,999 damage". Boosters include the option to toggle HP full, MP full, Limit gauge full, and maximum damage dealt - all of which can be turned on and off individually or as a set.</p>
<p>If you wanted to blast through the story again to enjoy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-final-fantasy-7-interview-part-3-hamaguchi">all the differences</a> from the original game before the launch of Part 3 (which, I imagine, we'll get <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-story-completed-producer-very-satisfied-as-development-continues-without-delay">an update about</a> sooner rather than later), this will make a replay pretty effortless. It remains to be seen whether these 'boosters' (as similar mechanics are called in older remasters in the Final Fantasy canon) will affect trophy unlocks on the PS5 version - if they don't, well, it'll make Platinum clean-ups easier for those of us that care about that kind of thing.</p>
<p>"I feel that the way people enjoy content has become more flexible these days, as we see with video streaming platforms, and that people also want the same thing from games, with options to tailor the experience based on the time they have and their levels of interest," said director Naoki Hamaguchi in a previous message about these updates. "I have also had personal experiences where I wanted to play something with the limited time I have but gave up because of the time it takes to level up characters or traverse the game.</p>
<p>"That’s exactly why I think that the Streamlined Progression feature is very effective - to give players smooth access to the story."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remakes-progression-helping-boosts-arent-exclusive-to-switch-2-and-xbox-will-also-arrive-via-patch-for-ps5-and-pc">We already knew</a> that this update was coming to the PS5/PC versions of the game, we just didn't know when. It's nice that Square Enix is ensuring parity with the new versions of the title, and not just leaving pre-existing customers to linger in anticipation as Switch and Xbox users get all the fun new bells and whistles.</p><p>Square Enix has confirmed the whole trilogy will be coming to Xbox and Switch 2, as well as PlayStation 5 and PC. So if you wanted to start your journey into Midgar with a bang, the publisher has you covered. Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has hinted that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-hints-at-possible-switch-2-version">the latest title in the series may also be headed to Switch2</a> soon.</p>

<p>Marching our way next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We are just one week away from the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> on Switch 2, and Koei Tecmo has blessed us with an all-new gameplay trailer, giving a thorough rundown of how things look on the hybrid console.</p>
<p>The above three-minute overview is only available in Japanese at the time of writing (we will sub in an English version when it crops up), but it's the gameplay that we're really interested in here, and there's a boatload of it.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo previously announced that Origins will <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/dynasty-warriors-origins-will-run-at-a-fixed-30fps-on-switch-2">run at a "fixed 30fps</a> on Switch 2 to prioritise a stable experience with the desired 1,000+ characters on screen, and the above trailer showcases exactly that. That's not to knock it, mind you. The battles look suitably epic, with a whole host of different fighting styles to choose from and a decent amount of variety in the opponents, it seems.</p>
<p>The trailer also gives us a peek at each character's skill tree, unlockable moves and weapon options, so expect a lot of the series' signature customisation to be on display right from the jump.</p>
<p>Origins arrives on Switch 2 on <strong>22nd January</strong>, the very same day that the 'Visions of the Four Heroes' DLC drops its new weapons and story arcs. Gosh, what a busy start to 2026!</p>

<p>While exploring the Ossuary Depths, you'll come across some of <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>Season 6's new enemies, the Ossirans, and they're not big fans of dwarves encroaching on their home, as you can probably guess.</p><p>New enemy types include the Scrab, which will fly at you in swarms, as well as the lurking Pit Jaw, which will leap up from the ground in order to snap unsuspecting dwarves up in its jaws.</p><p>You might well have to contend with these enemies when you're taking on the new Heavy Extraction mission type, which will see you and your squad locating Resinite Mass in order to flag it for extraction.</p><p>You can check out the new narrated trailer for <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>Season 6, which shows off some of these new features (plus lots more), right here.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-ron-perlman-s3-intro-sandwhich-war-2000660136</link>
            <guid>1406872</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ron Perlman has been in every<a href="https://kotaku.com/how-a-dark-time-traveling-fantasy-game-became-the-origi-1845870322"><em> Fallout</em> game</a> but he’s never played them. He seems to barely even remember narrating the now iconic line “War. War never changes,” when the first game launched back in 1997. He says he was paid basically nothing and never bothered to find out what the game, which would spawn one of the biggest franchises, was about.</p> <p>“I’m not a gamer,” Perlman said in a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/m5iSCL4o61w?si=nYsivF6kTSkD4y34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link">Joe Vulpis Podcast</a> interview (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/ron-perlman-says-he-did-the-fallout-intro-for-usd40-and-a-sandwich-hes-never-played-it-and-hes-not-interested-in-trying-the-whole-fallout-thing-is-a-mystery-to-me/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>). “I wouldn’t know how to put a game—I wouldn’t know which game goes into which piece of hardware. I’ve never played any of the games. The whole <em>Fallout</em> thing is a mystery to me.”</p>

 <p>The Hellboy actor has had character roles in some of the games but is most known for narrating the openings in which he outlines the geopolitical rivalries that precipitated a mass nuclear war. “In 2077, the storm of world war had come again,” he says at the beginning of <em>Fallout 1</em>. “In two brief hours, most of the planet was reduced to cinders. And from the ashes of nuclear devastation, a new civilization would struggle to arise.”</p>

 <p>While the lines have stuck in fans’ heads for years, Perlman doesn’t appear to have ever given them a second thought. “They invited me to do the very first Fallout back in the ’90s, I think,” he said on the podcast. “They gave me $40 and a sandwich. And a year and a half later, I get a call. ‘Hey, you remember Fallout?’ ‘No.'”</p>

 <p><em>Fallout</em> is now not just one of the biggest game series around but also one of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-series-season-two-reviews-prime-video-2000653876">most popular TV shows on streaming</a> thanks to the Amazon Prime adaptation. “I didn’t see that coming,” Perlman notes. He hasn’t appeared in the show yet, and there’s no indication that he will, but it would be pretty cool. Season 3 starts filming later this year so there’s plenty of time to make it happen.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-drops-prices-on-iconic-millennium-falcon-sets-now-one-of-the-cheapest-in-the-star-wars-line-2000659923</link>
            <guid>1406869</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="705">There’s a reason LEGO has remained relevant for generations. Few brands can appeal equally to children discovering creativity for the first time and adults rediscovering it decades later. Opening a LEGO box feels like an invitation to slow down: the soft rattle of pieces, the clean instruction book, and the promise that something meaningful will emerge from a pile of plastic bricks. Forget everything out there that’s causing you stress. Just sit down and <em>build</em>. Personally, I love to just pop on a podcast and let the time slip by as I put a set together, piece by piece.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="705">Few vehicles in film history carry the same instant recognition as the Millennium Falcon Star Wars set. The legendary ship that carried heroes across the galaxy and legendarily made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs. Right now, that legend is more affordable than usual: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon set is currently discounted by 20%, dropping from $85 to $67</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="705">Built for Display</h2>
<p data-start="1407" data-end="1915">Unlike play-focused sets built for constant handling, this LEGO Millennium Falcon is designed primarily for display. Mounted on the included display stand at a subtle angle, it gives the impression of movement, as if it’s mid-turn in the vacuum of space. Its dimensions—just over five inches tall, about nine and a half inches long, and roughly seven and a half inches wide—make it ideal for a desk, bookshelf, or display cabinet. It commands attention without overwhelming the space.</p>


<p data-start="1917" data-end="2399">The set is made up of 921 pieces. LEGO captures the Millennium Falcon’s signature exterior while also sneaking in interior references fans will appreciate. Because of the scale, characters aren’t represented by traditional minifigures, but by abstract stacked elements that still convey the idea of the crew aboard. Small details, like the holographic dejarik chess table, serve as thoughtful callbacks that reward close inspection.</p>
<p data-start="2401" data-end="2931" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The set commemorates the 25th anniversary of LEGO Star Wars, a collaboration that began in 1999 with the release of <em data-start="2570" data-end="2590">The Phantom Menace</em>. From those early X-Wings and Landspeeders, the partnership has expanded into one of LEGO’s most successful and enduring lines. Through all of that growth, the Millennium Falcon has remained central—an enduring symbol of adventure, creativity, nostalgia, and $68 that’s just burning a whole in your wallet. With its current discount, there may be no better time to bring that symbol home.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/runescape-rs25-project-most-ambitious-evolution/</link>
            <guid>1406866</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new press release, the team at Jagex has confirmed that this year, which marks the 25th anniversary of <strong>RuneScape</strong>, will be the biggest yet in the game’s quarter-century on the market. It was promised that more investment and content development will be rolled out in 2026 than ever before, making for an ambitious roadmap for RuneScape fans everywhere.</p>



<p>The ‘RS25’ programme sets the stage for ‘the most ambitious evolution in RuneScape history.’ The pipeline includes the RuneFest event in the United Kingdom, an OSRS LAN event, better creator commitments, and a ‘reborn RuneScape.’</p>







<h2 id="h-runescape-is-evolving-more-than-ever-in-2026">RuneScape is Evolving More Than Ever in 2026</h2>



<p>RuneScape is turning 25 this year, and that’s not a milestone that many active games have ever managed to celebrate. As an MMORPG, RuneScape was part of the pioneering effort that eventually led to live-service games – titles that evolved over time and constantly provided fresh content and updates to players.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/runescape-membership-charge-tiers-online/">an entirely smooth journey</a> getting here, but the milestone year has finally arrived, and Jagex has a wealth of plans for 2026.</p>



<p>In October, RuneFest 2026 will be held in Birmingham, England, featuring live reveals, developer sessions, and ‘unforgettable community moments.’ RuneScape is taking to the stage in the US with the Deadman All-Stars Live production, and later in the year, a creator-backed LAN event will be held (location pending).</p>



<p>An all-new press release revealed what’s coming this year to the game ecosystem itself</p>



<blockquote>
<p>RuneScape will enter a new chapter with a comprehensive rejuvenation rooted in integrity, visual renewal, and a renewed focus on what makes the game special. Alongside a long-requested Player Avatar refresh and meaningful visual upgrades,&nbsp;and major improvements to player support,&nbsp;all designed to better serve the community at the heart of RuneScape.</p>



<p>This new era will also see the removal of RuneScape’s microtransaction system, Treasure Hunter, following the community vote in November 2025, marking a major step forward in player-first design and transparency.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-shadow-drops-runescape-dragonwilds-in-early-access/">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a> will also expand through 2026 after a successful launch last year.</p>



<p>Jagex was <strong>also </strong>promoting <a href="http://www.runescape.com/25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive merchandise line</a> produced to celebrate the substantial company milestone. As the year unravels, more merchandise will be released across the line.</p>



<p>In a statement, the CEO of Jagex, Jon Bellamy, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>It’s incredible to think a quarter century has passed since&nbsp;RuneScape’s&nbsp;beginnings as a Java-based browser game</em>. <em>Today we’re speaking to the largest and most active&nbsp;RuneScape&nbsp;community in our history, and this milestone is as much theirs as it is ours.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team at Jagex uploaded an 11-minute video looking back at the last 25 years of RuneScape history, which you can see below:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>This year promises to be absolutely insane for RuneScape fans. The game has had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-confirms-layoffs-pauses-key-runescape-project/">a few bumps in the road</a> in the last few years, but the community seems eager to receive what amounts to a bounty of content through 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new report, NVIDIA has stopped production of the RTX 5070 Ti GPU, and the 5060 Ti 16GB will soon follow. </p>



<p>The growth of AI has led to global memory shortages, impacting even the most prominent manufacturers. We were recently told that NVIDIA doesn’t plan to announce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-isnt-announcing-a-new-gpu-at-ces-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any new GPUs at CES 2026</a>. Now, another report has revealed that they might be halting production of one of their RTX 50 Series GPUs. </p>







<h2 id="h-nvidia-to-halt-production-of-rtx-5070-ti-and-5060-ti-16gb">NVIDIA to Halt Production of RTX 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB </h2>



<p>A recent YouTube video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hardware Unboxed</a> (thanks <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-reportedly-says-rtx-5070-ti-is-no-longer-being-produced-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-to-follow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>) suggests that NVIDIA is halting its production of the RTX 5070 Ti graphics cards. This information&nbsp;was provided by ASUS, NVIDIA’s largest add-in board (AIB) partner, who stated that the RTX 5070 Ti model has been “essentially killed off” and is now in an “end of life status.” ASUS has no plans to produce more 5070 Ti models, meaning that what is currently available in stores will be the last stock of this model offered by the company. <span>This information <span>aligns with an earlier report stating that NVIDIA will&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-cutting-rtx-50-series-production-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span><span>cut</span> RTX 50 series producti</span>on</a>&nbsp;in 2026. </p>



<p>NVIDIA’s RTX 5070 Ti isn’t the only model facing supply issues; the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB has also experienced a significant reduction in availability, effectively leading to its discontinuation. ASUS has reportedly confirmed that this model has been designated as “end of life” and will no longer be produced. Currently, retailers are only able to purchase the 8GB versions, including the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, in bulk. These shortages have resulted in increased prices for the models that remain available in stores.</p>

Additionally, <span>NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang called the constant negativity surrounding the AI industry “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-ceo-says-ai-doomer-narrative-is-hurtful/" target="_blank">extremely hurtfu</a></span>l.” What are your thoughts on NVIDIA halting production of RTX 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB models?
