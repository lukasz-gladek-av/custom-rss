            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The premium headphone market overflows with active noise cancellation options from Sony, Apple, Sennheiser, and countless others, but <strong>Bose is still the brand that essentially invented consumer ANC</strong> and continues to push the technology forward. The <em>QuietComfort Ultra</em> is the top of the line from Bose and marries its most advanced noise cancellation with class-leading spatial audio capabilities that few competitors can match. Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/">has dropped the price from $429 down to $329, the all-time low for Bose’s best headphones</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Modes That Adapt to Your Environment</h2>
<p>Bose QuietComfort Ultra has three different listening modes that redefine the way you interact with the world around you: <strong>Quiet Mode</strong> with full noise cancellation, puts you in a personal bubble of quiet that rejects airplane engines, traffic noise and chatty coworkers. All of this occurs via a series of outward-facing microphones that detect ambient noise and inward-facing processing that generates inverse sound waves to nullify noise. <strong>Aware Mode</strong> turns the tables, piping environmental sound back in through the headphones so you can hear announcements, conversations, or oncoming traffic without ever having to take your headphones off. <strong>Immersion Mode</strong> melds maximum noise cancelation with Bose Immersive Audio-their spatial audio technology that envelops your head with three-dimensional space.</p>
<p><em>CustomTune</em> technology tailors the sound profile to your ears: When you first don the headphones, they play a brief tone and measure how sound reflects off of your unique ear shape. It then <strong>adjusts frequency response to compensate for how your ears naturally emphasize</strong> or diminish certain frequencies. Two people listening to the same headphones will hear slightly different tuning optimized for their individual anatomy, ensuring that you get the most accurate sound reproduction possible.</p>



<p>The microphone system stands out for good reason: in practice, it really does deliver clear phone calls. It’s<strong> powered by six microphones that collaborate to lock in your voice and filter out background noise</strong>, wind and more. You can take calls from a busy street or a windy park and the person on the other end hears you clearly without competing noise.</p>



<p>Comfort is essential when you are wearing headphones for hours on end: The <strong>ear cushions employ soft, conforming foam</strong> that doesn’t develop pressure points, and the headband evenly distributes weight around your head. Materials feel high-quality with a refined finish; professional enough to use in work settings. The<strong> 254-gram weight puts these headphones right in the middle of premium over-ear headphones</strong>, light enough to comfortably wear but substantial enough to feel well-built.</p>
<p>With noise cancellation on, you can get up to <strong>24 hours of battery life</strong> which means multiple days of use between charges. Toggling on Immersion Mode with spatial audio reduces that to 18 hours, still likely more than enough for a week’s listenings for most people. A 15-minute charge gets you 2.5 hours of playback, which is enough to top off at lunchtime and make it through the afternoon.</p>
<p>For $329, you’ll get tech worth upwards of $400, backed by decades of expertise from Bose itself.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-backs-this-anker-macbook-pro-charger-and-its-5-times-cheaper-on-amazon-than-its-official-site-2000641232</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-backs-this-anker-macbook-pro-charger-and-it%E2%80%99s-5-times-cheaper-on-amazon-than-its-official-site.1343950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buying a charger directly from Apple is like paying a luxury price for basic functionality. A 70W USB-C power adapter from Apple’s official store costs $59 and if you want a USB-C cable to go along with it, you’re adding another $19 to $29 depending on the length. That’s close to $90 before tax for slower charging speeds than what this Anker charger delivers.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5341/">Anker option packs 100W of power and includes a 5-foot cable, all for just $21 during this limited-time deal</a>, down from the usual $27. This isn’t some sketchy third-party accessory either: it’s from Anker, a brand that’s become synonymous with reliable charging gear and officially available in Apple Stores too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5341/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Matches Your MacBook’s Appetite</h2>
<p>The 100W output on this charger means you’re getting enough juice to fast-charge even the most power-hungry MacBooks. Apple’s 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Max chip reaches 100% battery in just 1 hour and 20 minutes with this charger and matches the performance of Apple’s 140W charger in most charging scenarios. The difference comes down to the power delivery protocols: both chargers support USB Power Delivery 3.0, which intelligently negotiates the right amount of power for your device.</p>
<p>When you plug in a device, Anker’s PowerIQ 3.0 technology automatically detects what that is and adjusts the power output accordingly. Plug in your iPhone, and it will pass on the appropriate 20W for fast charging. Swap for a Samsung Galaxy S25 and it will push full power the phone can handle. Connect a Dell XPS or HP Spectre laptop, and it will negotiate the optimal charging speed. That makes this single charger compatible with a wide array of devices, replacing multiple other chargers and helping to cut down on the cable mess in your bag. It<strong> comes with a 5-foot USB-C-to-USB-C cable which supports a full 100W power transfer</strong>, meaning you do not need to buy a separate high-wattage-compatible cable.</p>



<p>Standard chargers jut out awkwardly in bags and catch on clothes and scratching other items. This Anker charger folds flat, creating a smooth profile that slides easily into laptop sleeves or even jacket pockets. The compact size measures roughly 2.5 inches on each side and about an inch thick, <strong>taking up less space than Apple’s 96W brick and significantly smaller than their 140W charger</strong>.</p>



<p>ActiveShield technology runs 24/7 and <strong>performs more than 3 million temperature checks daily</strong> on the charger. The moment it starts running hot from extended use or environmental elements, it automatically adjusts power output to cool things down. That prevents overheating damage to both the charger and your devices, with a considerable extension of their life span. The system is completed by protection against overcharging, short circuits, and power surges for increased peace of mind when leaving devices plugged in overnight or during long work sessions.</p>
<p>Apple wants $59 for a slower 70W charger that doesn’t include any cable. Their 96W charger will set you back $79 without cable as well. This Anker setup gives you more power than either one, throws in a quality cable, and costs $21. You could get backups for home and office at this price and still come out spending less than one Apple charger.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-thinkpad-with-ryzen-7-chip-priced-like-a-mid-range-laptop-and-it%E2%80%99s-not-a-refurb.1343941/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The ThinkPad has been the go-to business laptop for decades and for good reason: from CEOs to engineers, pros swear by them. You need a machine that can handle back-to-back video calls, crunch spreadsheets without lag, run multiple applications at once and still have juice for the commute home. The <strong>Lenovo ThinkPad E16 G2</strong> delivers all of that and more and packs premium specs into a proven design.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5340/">has dropped the price from $1,299 down to just $899, which marks an all-time low for this powerhouse laptop</a>. This isn’t some refurbished unit or stripped-down configuration: you’re getting a brand-new machine <strong>with 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a Ryzen 7 processor</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5340/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Business-Grade Performance</h2>
<p>At the heart of this laptop is an <strong>AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS processor which boasts 8 cores and 16 threads</strong> to tackle your everyday tasks with much ease. With a base clock of 3.2GHz that boosts up to 4.75GHz when needed, this chip doesn’t break a sweat with demanding workloads. Run AutoCAD while streaming a training video and responding to Slack messages? No problem. The processor includes 4MB of L2 cache and 16MB of L3 cache which means frequently accessed data stays close to the CPU for faster retrieval.</p>
<p>The 32GB of DDR5 RAM gives you enough headroom to keep dozens of browser tabs open, work across multiple documents and run virtual machines if your job requires it. <strong>DDR5 is the latest memory standard</strong>&nbsp;and offers faster data transfer rates than DDR4 and better power efficiency. Match this with a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD, and you have storage that’s fast enough to <strong>boot Windows 11 Pro in seconds</strong> and load large files almost instantly. The terabyte lets you store years of documents, presentations, and project files at your fingertips without being forced to resort to external drives or constant cloud uploads.</p>



<p>The <strong>16-inch display uses a WUXGA resolution of 1920×1200</strong>, which, in turn, provides more vertical space than the standard Full HD screens. The extra height you get when reviewing a long document or working with spreadsheets amounts to fewer scrolls, which in turn means better productivity. The IPS panel displays consistent colors from a variety of viewing angles, while the 300 nits of brightness make it possible to work well even in bright office environments or near windows. Integrated AMD Radeon 680M graphics handle everyday visual tasks and can even manage light gaming or basic video editing if you need a break.</p>



<p>Security features run deep on this ThinkPad: The fingerprint reader built into the power button uses biometric authentication for quick login while keeping unauthorized users out. The TPM 2.0 chip encrypts sensitive data and prevents the system from booting if anyone tampers with the hardware. A physical privacy shutter covers the 1080p webcam when you’re not using it, eliminating concerns about unauthorized viewing.</p>
<p>Connectivity covers all the bases with a <strong>mix of USB-A and USB-C ports supporting up to 10Gbps</strong>. Two USB-C ports support Power Delivery 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.4, so you can charge the laptop and connect an external monitor via the same port. The HDMI 2.1 port supports 4K display at 60Hz, perfect for presentations or doing a dual-monitor setup at your desk.</p>
<p>At $899 for early Black Friday, you’re getting a laptop that would normally cost over $1,200.</p>

              <p>You don’t have to stick to basic, boring white bulbs anymore and you definitely don’t need to change the entire wiring in your home to add smarter lighting. <em>Govee</em> makes the upgrade easy with its wide range of smart bulbs, and we just spotted a solid pair going for less on Amazon.</p>
<p>Currently, you can grab a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5338/">2 pack of Govee LED Smart Light Bulbs for just $19, which is a little over $9 per bulb</a>. The only thing to note is that this deal is currently <strong>exclusive to Prime members</strong>. If you already have Prime, you’re good to go. If not, you might want to consider signing up, especially with the holiday season coming up.</p>
<p>Amazon usually rolls out some of its biggest discounts for Prime users during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The retailer also offers a 7-day free trial, which gives you access to the deal (and free shipping) without any immediate commitment. After the trial, it’s going to run you around $15 a month, but you’re likely going to make that money back quickly through exclusive discounts and free shipping if you order often!</p>

<h2>Millions of Colors to Choose From</h2>
<p>For less than $20, you’re getting a pair of smart light bulbs that are easy to install and can be controlled remotely via Govee Home App or smart assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant. Each bulb offers a <strong>brightness of up to 1000 lumens</strong>&nbsp;which is equivalent to a traditional 75W bulb. You can adjust the brightness from 1 to 100%, plus choose from over 16 million colors. These are also tunable between warm white and cool daylight (2700K to 6500K), so you can shift the vibe of your space from focused to relaxed within seconds.</p>



<p>The Govee Home app gives you access to up to 54 scene modes for your Wi-Fi light bulbs, and you can even create a fun lighting schedule for your day. Maybe go for a brighter setting during the day, and slowly wind down with a cozy, warm light; the options are endless.</p>
<p>There’s also a music sync feature that lets the bulbs change colors based on sound detected by your phone’s microphone. Just keep in mind that you’ll need a stable 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection to get started, and these are not compatible with smart switches.</p>
<p>Want more bulbs? The 4-pack and 8-pack bundles are also on sale for $39 and $79.</p>

                <p>There are a lot of questions about the future of Xbox as a brand, when games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a> and even its signature shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-700149">Halo</a>, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696">coming to PlayStation 5</a>. Microsoft is reportedly working on the next generation of Xbox, but the outlook doesn't look promising. However, Xbox's perceived decline doesn't mean that consoles are dead, according a prominent video game analyst.</p><p>Rhys Elliott's <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/octobers-top-playstation-games-by" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Alinea Insight newsletter</a> has shared the estimated sales for PlayStation 5 games in October 2025, and the two big winners were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26/" data-ref-id="5000-686587">EA Sports FC 26</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a>, with 3.2 million, 3 million, and 2.7 million in sales, respectively. The trio's nearly combined 9 million in sales led Elliott to remark, "AAA games, live services, and single-player alike, are still thriving on console. The 'CoNsOlE iS DeAd' narrative is getting annoying. Xbox as a console is dying, yes. But let's not extrapolate that too far, eh?"</p><p>Publishing Xbox games on PlayStation 5 has already paid dividends for Microsoft. Several of Microsoft's formerly exclusive titles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-ps5-sales-charts-but-another-game-reigned-supreme/2900-6827/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6827">dominated the PlayStation sales charts</a> earlier this year.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> both placed in the top 10, at fourth and seventh, respectively. That's thanks in part to a continuous flow of new content via Minecraft expansions and GTA Online. Additionally, EA Sports took three of the top 10 slots between FC 26, FC 25, and Madden NFL 26. Take-Two's NBA 2K26 took the fifth slot with 564,000 copies sold for the month.</p><p>Alinea Insight's top 10 best-selling PS5 games for October 2025 and their estimated sales are reproduced below.</p><ol><li>Battlefield 6 - 3.2 million</li><li>EA Sports FC 26 - 3.0 million</li><li>Ghost of Yotei - 2.7 million</li><li>Minecraft - 635,000</li><li>NBA 2K26 - 564,000</li><li>EA FC 25 - 350,000</li><li>Grand Theft Auto 5 - 338,000</li><li>EA Madden NFL 26 - 261,000</li><li>Little Nightmares 3 - 245,000</li><li>Digimon Story: Time Stranger - 241,000</li></ol>

              <p>Sure, you can use your trackpad or a basic office mouse to get through most of your day, but if you’re looking for solid speeds and better accuracy, a responsive mouse can make a lot of difference. And thankfully, you don’t need to spend a fortune to upgrade.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon has the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4265/">Logitech G305 Lightspeed wireless gaming mouse on sale for $29, which is 40% off its regular $49 price</a>. The deal applies to all color options, including black, blue, lilac, mint, and white. The retailer hasn’t specified when the deal will end, but it likely won’t stick around for long. If you’ve had your eye on it, now’s a good time to grab one before the price shoots back up or the stock expires!</p>

<h2>Impressive Responsiveness for Fast-Paced Games</h2>
<p>There’s nothing too flashy about the design, which is a good thing. Having multiple options to choose from means you can pick the one that suits your aesthetics the best.

It’s also quite lightweight, so you won’t feel like you’re dragging a brick across.</p>

All-in-all, this deal offers an easy way to upgrade your gaming or creative setup without paying the full $50 for this ultra-fast mouse.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-clears-out-its-color-floor-lamp-now-cheaper-than-a-budget-lamp-on-amazon-2000641217</link>

              <p>There’s just something magical about how the right lighting can completely turn a room around – turn a cold corner into a cozy reading nook or make your living space seem like it’s pulled from a design magazine. Good lighting doesn’t just brighten things up: it sets the mood, creates atmosphere and, honestly, just makes you want to spend more time in your own home. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/">Usually $99, Amazon has slashed the price of the Govee RGBIC floor lamp to just $69</a>, which happens to be an all-time low for this <strong>#1 bestselling floor lamp</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Make Your Home Smarter</h2>
<p>The Govee floor lamp packs some seriously impressive tech into its sleek black design: W<strong>ith 1000 lumens of brightness</strong>, this lamp delivers enough light to properly illuminate a bedroom or living room without needing multiple fixtures. That’s <strong>roughly equivalent to a 75-watt incandescent bulb</strong> but with infinitely more flexibility. The RGBIC technology is where things get interesting: unlike basic RGB lamps that display one color at a time, <strong>RGBIC allows multiple colors to appear simultaneously across different sections of the lamp</strong>.</p>
<p>The lamp is integrated perfectly with Alexa for complete voice control. Forgot to turn off the lamp while getting into bed? Just ask Alexa to do that. Want to dim the lights for movie night without getting up from the couch? Voice commands, of course! The Govee Home app <strong>gives you access to more than 16 million color combinations</strong> which sounds kind of excessive until you realize just how regularly you’ll actually adjust the settings to suit different occasions. Dinner party? Warm amber tones.</p>



<p>Another feature that makes this more than just a simple lamp is the music sync: It <strong>pulses in real time to whatever you’re listening to</strong>, changing colors to go with the beat. Throw on some upbeat music, and it’s an instant dance party. This works via the app’s microphone detection, so nothing too complicated in terms of setup-just turn on music sync mode and let it do its thing. It’s great for entertaining small groups or just adding an element of fun to your solo dance sessions.</p>
<p>Attention should also be turned to the design itself: This is a<strong> corner lamp which means it’s specifically shaped to tuck into those awkward spaces</strong> that most furniture can’t fill properly. The tall and slender profile takes up very little floor space while maximizing vertical lighting coverage. <strong>About 62 inches tall</strong>, it reaches high enough to cast light across an entire room rather than just illuminating a small radius around its base.</p>



<p>Setup takes minutes, not hours: Plug it in, download the Govee Home app, connect it to your WiFi and you’re ready to start customizing. The app contains dozens of <strong>preset scenes</strong> designed by Govee’s team—things like “Ocean,” “Sunset,” and “Aurora”—so you don’t have to spend time creating custom scenes if you’d rather just pick something that works. But if you do want to get creative,<strong> DIY mode lets you tap into specific colors</strong> for different segments of the lamp and save your creations for later use.</p>
<p>At $69, you’re getting smart home integration, music reactivity, millions of color options, and enough brightness to actually function as primary lighting – all for $30 less than usual.</p>

The aptly named <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim: Daggerheart</em> aims to adapt the award-winning campaign to Darrington Press' fantasy TTRPG. It was fully funded in just 13 minutes.</p>

<h2>The <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim: Daggerheart</em> Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the official campaign page, <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim: Daggerheart</em> will bring every faction, intrigue, and horror of the original campaign to Darrington Press' <em>Daggerheart</em> system.</p>

Said experience is a sandbox-style campaign designed for characters at levels 1-10.</p>

<p>For enterprising GMs, the <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim: Daggerheart</em> campaign will include official mechanics for the game's contaminations, mutations, and anomalies. This is because the titular Drakkenheim setting is a wasteland ravaged by an eldritch storm of otherworldly magic. These can be used as intended in this campaign, or can be adapted into your own home game of <em>Daggerheart</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To learn more about <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6d78830c-46d2-4911-8370-fd1532625bb8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/dungeon-dudes-talk-dungeons-of-drakkenheim-on-dd-beyond-what-to-expect-and" rel="nofollow">Dungeons of Drakkenheim check out our interview with the Dungeon Dudes</a> from last year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of these mechanics is the new Contaminated Domain cards. As your characters' contamination rises, they lose equal levels of Hope, a vital resource in <em>Daggerheart</em>. The trade-off is access to new card abilities, which you must give the GM Fear to use. Fear a GM can use to make the next challenge more harrowing.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim: Daggerheart</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Digital for $30:</strong> A PDF of the campaign guide, character sheets, and a set of miniature STLs</li>
	<li><strong>Core Book for $60:</strong> Everything in the Digital tier, a physical campaign book, a poster set, and a set of resin miniatures</li>
	<li><strong>Digital Deluxe for $70:</strong> Everything from the Digital tier, digital card deck, digital GM cheat sheets, and VTT access on Demiplane and Roll20</li>
	<li><strong>Core Set for $170:</strong> Everything from the Core Book and Digital Deluxe tier, a physical GM Screen, a set of resin dice, a card deck, and an STL file for a Fear Tracker</li>
	<li><strong>Deluxe Set for $295:</strong> Everything from the Core Set tier, a physical Special Edition campaign book, a premium dice tray, and a unique set of gemstone dice</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim: Daggerheart</em> campaign has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$123,612, more than six times its initial funding goal. The campaign ends on November 28..</span></span></p>

As part of an update that’s currently on the Steam Deck’s Beta and Preview channels, the handheld can “complete all active downloads in a new display-off low-power mode before going to sleep,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1675200%2Fview%2F771930569635267984" rel="sponsored">Valve says</a>.</p><p>I’m glad this change is in the works; I download a lot of games and updates on my Steam Deck and I have often wished that I didn’t have to leave the display on while doing so. <em>The Verge</em> asked Valve about this two years ago when the Steam Deck OLED launched, and the company seemed to think Deck was good enough without it.</p><p>“We burn a substantial amount of power when you’re downloading,” hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat said at the time, suggesting to us that players might not want to accidentally leave a hot Steam Deck in their bag if they mistakenly think it’s asleep. Valve’s solution announced today seems to solve some of those concerns.</p><p>With the update installed, when you press the power button while your Deck is downloading something, you’ll see a new dialog that asks if you want to keep downloading but have the screen off. If you choose Continue, your Deck will enter the low-power mode. “While in this mode, if you press a button or move Steam Deck, a new status screen will be shown with download progress,” Valve says. “From here you can fully wake Steam Deck or let it continue downloading with the screen off.”</p><p>The feature is on by default when your Steam Deck is plugged in. You can also choose to enable it while running on battery in settings, though if your Steam Deck falls below 20 percent battery, your device will go into full sleep mode.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/813864/valve-steam-deck-screen-download-games-low-power-screen-off]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Star Wars fans, it’s a great time to bring some important pieces of the galaxy far, far away into your own space. LEGO introduced its 25th Anniversary Star Wars collection to celebrate some of the most iconic ships in the saga, and if you’ve ever wanted your very own Millennium Falcon model, now is a great time to grab one at a discounted rate.</p>
<p>Amazon has dropped the price <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">of LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon to $67, which is 20% off its regular $84 price</a>. It’s part of the brand’s special anniversary lineup, and the level of detail here is impressive. Such exclusive sets don’t really stay on sale for long, so it’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will also enjoy free shipping on their orders.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Build Your Own Starship Collection</h2>
<p>This collectible build-and-display model lets you build a mid-scale brick recreation of one of the most iconic ships, and comes with 921 pieces in total. It hits that sweet spot; not too massive, but not so simple that you’re done before you’ve even settled in. LEGO packs it with details like the cockpit, satellite dish, and dual cannons. Even better, there’s a buildable stand to place the ship on. It includes a nameplate and a special 25th Anniversary LEGO Star Wars brick. You can even position the Falcon at a dynamic angle for a more realistic, mid-flight look.</p>



<p>The set also fits nicely into the Starship collection by LEGO, so you can always add more ships down the line if you’re planning to build out a full display. Putting it together won’t be too complicated, as it comes with a handy instruction book that takes you step by step through the entire build. The instruction book is quite detailed on its own, but if you need extra help, you can also use the LEGO Builder app.</p>
<p>Once completed, the Millennium Falcon measures just over 5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide. Place it on your bookshelf or your desk – it’s sure to impress anyone who sees it.</p>
<p>Just note that there’s no telling how long the discount will last, so it’s best to get your orders in soon.</p>

                <p>Roguelite is one of the hottest subgenres in gaming right now. From Balatro to Drop Duchy, developers have integrated cyclical mechanics into all sorts of other genres. Independent studios eSolu and Team Mojo Games are adding another game to the subgenre with Odds Chronicles.</p><p>Odds Chronicles combines grid-based combat, a roguelite run structure, and dice mechanics to create its overall package. Each roll of the dice will give your team different resources, including attributes like strength and magic.</p><p>Dice-based roguelites and roguelikes, including standouts like Dicey Dungeons, have been around for some time, but new takes on rolling the dice are welcome. Bringing dice mechanics into a turn-based grid tactics game is a nice way to build off the SOCOM-like percentages that decide whether or not you'll land your attacks.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLu87b8jN58" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MLu87b8jN58" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We don't have much to go on besides the reveal trailer, but the gameplay and visuals look polished enough to make Odds Chronicles stand out among a sea of other roguelites. The tactical roguelite will launch on Steam and Epic Games Store in 2026, with versions for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X|S arriving later.</p>

This quest is relatively straightforward in execution, but finding the precise spot where the cache is located might prove a bit tricky--especially in the midst of chaotic battles with the ARC and other raiders who may be working on the same quest.</p><p>When you're ready to complete Market Correction, you can follow the steps below to round up the cache at Marano Station and be one step closer to finishing up Tian Wen's expectations for you.</p><h2>Where to find the cache at Marano Station in Arc Raiders</h2><p>Market Correction takes place in the Buried City map. You won't need to extract to complete the quest, so feel free to load in using a Free Loadout if you're worried you might not make it back alive.</p><p>Your destination is Marano Station, which is located on the northwestern side of the map in the Outskirts area. This whole side of the map is filled with debris and walls for cover, so you can sneak your way into Marano Station without too many worries.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596469-arcraiders_20251103203704.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596469" data-ratio="0.56110434429557" data-width="2463" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596469-arcraiders_20251103203704.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596469"></a><figcaption>Marano Station is located in the northwestern corner of Buried City.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596469-arcraiders_20251103203704.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive, you'll be looking for a set of canisters against a wall at the station.

The Northern Station beside the nearby Library is likely to be your best bet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is due out on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in just ten days from the time of this writing, on November 14, 2025. Now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-launches-game-ready-driver-black-ops-7-ffvii-rebirth-adds-frame-generation/">graphics card drivers are already being pushed ahead</a> of its arrival, Activision has already put out a launch trailer for the game, and more importantly, has finally put out a PC specs chart, including a small word on the specs for handheld PCs.</p>



<p>The new trailer is mostly a cinematic look at the various modes you get in Black Ops 7, with action shots of the campaign, the multiplayer, and zombies.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Launch Trailer (PC Features Spotlight)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Ry41LBsSuQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The PC specs are the more intriguing part of today's reveal, if only because they're not too demanding. Here's the minimum specs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10 64 Bit (latest update)</li>



<li><strong>CPU:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Ryzen 5 1400 or Intel Core i5-6600</li>



<li><strong>RAM:</strong>&nbsp;8 GB</li>



<li><strong>Video Card:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Radeon RX 470 or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 / 1060 or Intel Arc A580</li>



<li><strong>Video Memory:</strong>&nbsp;3 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong>&nbsp;SSD with 115 GB&nbsp;available space at launch</li>
</ul>



<p>The recommended specs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 11 64 Bit (latest update)</li>



<li><strong>CPU:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Ryzen 5 1600X or Intel Core i7-6700K</li>



<li><strong>RAM:</strong>&nbsp;12 GB</li>



<li><strong>Video Card:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or Intel Arc B580</li>



<li><strong>Video Memory:</strong>&nbsp;8 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong>&nbsp;SSD with 115 GB&nbsp;available space at launch</li>
</ul>



<p>And the specs for players that want to play at 4K:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 11 64 Bit (latest update)</li>



<li><strong>CPU:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Ryzen 5 5600X or Intel Core i7-10700K</li>



<li><strong>RAM:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB</li>



<li><strong>Video Card:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Radeon RX 9070XT or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 / 5070</li>



<li><strong>Video Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong>&nbsp;SSD with 115 GB&nbsp;available space at launch</li>
</ul>



<p>Here's the full specs chart:</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 PC specs. Image credit: Activision</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The most unfortunate part of this specs chart is how little is said about PC handheld optimization. On the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/ca/en/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-pc-trailer-specs-preloading-handheld-systems">Call of Duty blog</a>, Activision writes, "<em></em><em>Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;ships fully tuned for supported PC handhelds, including the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. The developers enhanced UI legibility, scaled every screen for smaller displays, and optimized the game to deliver smooth performance without sacrificing image quality. With native control support, it’s easy to drop in and start playing right away."</p>



<p>That's nice to hear but it lacks any real specifications about how the game will run on PC handhelds, like the recently released ROG Xbox Ally X (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">which you can check out our review for here</a>). Hopefully, we'll get a better sense of how it runs ahead of launch, though, with how close we are to that, it seems PC handheld users will either get a great experience on launch, or the lack of details here is a sign of poor performance to come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This year <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/box-office-demon-slayer-infinity-castle-biggest-anime-opening-1236516498/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle</em> </a>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/chainsaw-man-movie-reze-arc-box-office-weekend-premiere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em></a> played spoiler at the box office in their respective opening weekends (for the pocket-watching pundits among us), aweing moviegoers with the indescribable spark of magic animation. Anime has legs and is worth taking seriously as a new direction in cinema. Instead of addressing the 2D elephant of a lesson in the face, Hollywood said, “You know what the world really needs? More live-action anime films.”</p><p>According to an exclusive report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/chloe-zhao-manga-kodansha-studios-1236605962/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a> (on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kodansha.us/post/3m4qpg6tpu32x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manga day</a>, no less), Chloé Zhao, two-time Oscar winner behind<em> Nomadland</em> and Marvel’s <em>Eternals</em>, and Nicholas Gonda are teaming up with manga publisher <a href="https://aftermath.site/heres-the-dumb-shit-you-have-to-put-up-with-to-read-manga-these-days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kodansha</a> to head up a global studio called Kodansha Studios. Kodansha Studios, in turn, will exist for the express purpose of creating “premium, live action movies and television series” based on manga from Kodansha. To break this down in comic book movie terms, Kodansha is pulling a DC Studios by having Zhao and Gonda become their <a href="https://gizmodo.com/james-gunn-head-of-dc-movies-and-tv-warner-bros-1849701460" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Gunn and Peter Safran</a>, guiding a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/report-david-zaslav-pushed-back-on-ta-nahesi-coates-black-superman-movie-for-being-too-woke-2000628090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new era of live-action anime films</a> to a cinematic golden age. All the while, ensuring quality control, fostering healthy communication between international directors and manga creators, and developing solid scripts to bring their work to light. Hopefully, this will make the phrase “live-action anime film” less of a punchline than it has been over the past decade by utilizing Kodansha's manga catalog.&nbsp;</p><p>On paper, all of it sounds lovely, set against the haphazard wild west of <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-one-piece-yu-yu-hakusho-anime-live-action-netfl-1850050620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">random-ass live-action Hollywood adaptations</a> that have seen the light of day and are looming menacingly over the horizon. But it's hard not to reflexively recoil when the Deadline piece namedrops “beloved manga” like Katsuhiro Otomo’s <em>Akira</em>,<em> </em>and go, “God dammit, they’re gonna try doing it again.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Impact of Akira: The Film that Changed Everything" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IqVoEpRIaKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>If there is any anime that could be considered Hollywood’s Moby Dick, it is <em>Akira</em>. Still, Kodansha Studios' mere existence essentially shows that, despite decades of false starts, studio reshuffles, and directorial ghosting—such as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/warner-bros-gives-up-on-akira-remake-but-hollywood-wont-2000621686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warner Bros. shelving its version</a> in the early 2000s, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/jordan-peele-nope-akira-adaption-references-film-1850048374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Peele</a> politely declining, and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/taika-waititi-still-plans-on-directing-akira-eventuall-1839207999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taika Waititi</a> eventually withdrawing after years of development hell—<em>Akira</em> remains Hollywood’s promised-yet-elusive cash cow. With Kodansha Studios declaring its raison d’être as “premium live-action projects” (whatever that means), the thought that <em>Akira </em>might be their flagship effort feels like creative ambition and more like comedic arrogance. Should <em>Akira </em>prove to be the hill Kodansha Studios chose to die on, with the promise of guaranteed success because it’s popular, it’s hard not to stifle a laugh at the thought of it still attempting to see the light of day.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="RARE // MAKING OF AKIRA DOCUMENTARY FROM 1988 // ENGLISH SUBS" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BXsar5rpgwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Tokyo Movie Shinsha’s 1988 <a href="https://gizmodo.com/akira-35-year-retrospective-impact-1850645834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Akira</em></a> isn’t just a sci-fi anime film. It’s a miracle. A once-in-history convergence built on unheard-of budget, artistic labor, and technical muscle that animated over 160,000 cels and hand-painted matte backgrounds with the kind of obsessive artistry that <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2020/6/8/akira-anime-film-producer-corrects-30-year-fact-on-how-much-the-groundbreaking-film-cost-to-make?srsltid=AfmBOorrcZSOtdh698GQTcySSmgOi-xMhlmUSUnrM1vhjt7qmmXVFb0E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no studio today could bankroll</a>. The film isn’t just looked back on as lightning in a bottle but as a global flag-planting moment that declared anime as a cutting-edge art form worth taking seriously. Threatening to recapture it in live action isn’t just misguided—it verges on being creatively bankrupt. Undeterred by taste, history, hubris, or the sheer impossibility of doing it justice.&nbsp;</p><p>To quote YouTuber Cosmonaut Marcus in his succinctly titled video, <a href="https://youtu.be/f9I-s2UwxZk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why I Hate Live-Action Anime Adaptations</a>, “If you agree to adapt an anime into a live-action TV show or movie for Hollywood, then it means that you are already disrespecting the source material because in any great animated work, the beauty goes beyond the story or the characters, usually it's good because it's animated.”&nbsp;</p><p>While I’m <a href="https://aftermath.site/bet-kakegurui-netflix-live-action-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bit of a sicko</a> who likes some live-action adaptations on their own merits, I agree with the latter half of Marcus’ take. Roughly 90 percent of why anime fans like the medium is the moving drawings. So reading this news in concert with Sony, through its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/sonys-potential-kadokawa-acquisition-could-tighten-its-grip-on-anime-and-manga-2000526376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fucked up homunculus merger with Kadokawa</a>, also plans to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/anime-movies/sony-is-stepping-up-its-plans-for-more-live-action-movie-adaptations-of-anime-and-manga-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ramp up its live-action efforts</a>, despite their direct financial success from <em>Demon Slayer</em> and <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, has me both fucking exasperated and side-eyeing Kodansha Studios playing follow the leader.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tokyo Movie Shinsha</span></figcaption></figure><p>It’s not like Kodansha hasn’t had successes with already-made anime adaptations of its works; they're special because they're animated beautifully, filling in the gaps in manga panel artistry for anime fans without losing their artistry. And Kodansha’s library has proven to yield some of the most memorable anime films, like <em>Weathering With</em> <em>You </em>and <em>A Silent Voice</em>—<em>anime</em> films being the operative word.&nbsp;</p><p>Playing devil's advocate, there are exceptions to the rule of live action adaptations not being an entire crapshoot, but mainly as a reflection in fans' eyes in retrospect as cult classic hits with the likes of Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt-led<em> </em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/all-you-need-is-kill-anime-movie-trailer-edge-of-tomorrow-warner-bros-2000575528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Live Die Repeat</em></a> and The Wachowskis’ <em>Speed Racer</em> (pound for pound <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwh9ETdhrf4&amp;t=2980s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best live action anime film of all time</a>). There’s even been pretty decent live-action ventures in the past, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-loved-no-really-about-alita-battle-angel-1832758443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Alita Battle Angel</em></a>, and that Netflix adaptation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLfE-WiHAWU&amp;pp=ygUdbGFzdCBzYW11cmFpIHN0YW5kaW5nIG5ldGZsaXjSBwkJAwoBhyohjO8%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Last Samurai Standing</em></a> looks promising. But for every success, there’s also monumental failures from leveraging Kodansha’s catalogue for live-action works—your Scarlett Johansson-led <a href="https://www.wyomingnewspapers.org/?a=d&amp;d=WYWPN20170501-01.1.7&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=-------en-20-WYWPN-1--img-txIN%7CtxCO%7CtxTA-isaiah+colbert+ghost+in+the+shell-------0------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ghost in the Shell</em></a>.</p><p>Should Zhao and Gonda prove masterful international directors and original mangaka matchmakers, bringing underappreciated gems into the mainstream with “premium” live-action projects for works like all power to them. Works less likely to make folks reflexively throw their arms up like hearing “live action <a href="https://kotaku.com/my-hero-academia-netflix-live-action-anime-bnha-movie-1849883927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>My Hero Academia</em></a> or live action <a href="https://gizmodo.com/naruto-live-action-film-lionsgate-1851047617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Naruto</em></a>,” not helping themselves by going for big-spectacle, fantasy-laden shonen hits with an even larger margin for error, for the disrespect Marcus mentioned earlier, to bring it to live action and look shit. If the first of their projects is <em>Akira</em>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gachiakuta-doesnt-just-redefine-shonen-anime-it-anoints-itself-as-the-next-big-thing-2000622249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gachiakuta</em></a><em>,</em> <em>Fire Punch</em>, or <em>Shangra La Frontier</em>, because they’re popular fantastical works, then all good will for Kodansha Studios is lost.</p><p>If Kodansha Studios instead invests in showcasing its creative skills through greenlighting live-action series and films based on more realistic sleeper hits in seinen and shojo genres, like <em>Princess Jellyfish</em>, <em>Blue Period</em>,<em> Hajime no Ippo</em>, or (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/vinland-saga-creator-makoto-yukimura-looks-back-on-writing-his-pacifist-viking-epic-2000664303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gulp</a>) <em>Vinland Saga,</em> then, and only then, can it flirt with its strength as a studio capable of delivering on its promises for all its so-called premium projects. Do that, and I can have faith in prospective Kodansha Studio live-action adaptations of series like <em>Knights of Sidonia</em>, <em>Land of the Lustrous</em>, <em>To Your Eternity</em>, <em>Tower Dungeon</em>, and be less gun-shy about them possibly tackling <em>Akira</em>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7"><h3>I Owe My Workday To Criterion 24/7</h3></a><p>If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5"><h3>How Am I Supposed To Review Europa Universalis V</h3></a><p>There is simply too much video game here, and it's always in motion</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-halo-white-house-trump-vance"><h3>And Also, Who Even Cares About Halo And Lord Of The Rings These Days</h3></a><p>"All of these things do have a feeling of dragging and resuscitating a corpse"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/kodansha-studios-akira-anime-live-ation-chloe-zhao-nicolas-gonda]]></content:encoded>

And while the Arduboy FX included enough storage to hold 200 preloaded games, the new FX-C expands that to <a href="https://community.arduboy.com/c/games/35">accommodate 300 titles</a>, making the open source handheld even more accessible for those who just want to use it to play games, and not dive into developing their own.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/813661/arduboy-fx-c-handheld-console-arduino-usb-c-multiplayer]]></content:encoded>

It’s a solid lineup of titles, representing a wide variety of genres. That means there’s something for everyone, and some off-the-beaten-path games you might not normally buy, but now you get them without having to pay anywhere near full price. Here’s the full list of games included in the November 2025 Humble Choice, with blurbs from the press release.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Total War Warhammer III</strong>: A grand-scale strategy game where fantasy armies battle daemonic forces in the Realm of Chaos.</li><li><strong>Another Crab's Treasure</strong>: A Soulslike adventure where a hermit crab fights enemies using trash as makeshift shells.</li><li><strong>Pharaoh: A New Era</strong>: A 4K remake of the classic city-builder where you manage resources, appease gods, and build magnificent monuments in Ancient Egypt.</li><li><strong>Etrian Odyssey HD</strong>: A first-person dungeon crawler focused on creating a party and mapping a dangerous labyrinth.</li><li><strong>No More Heroes 3</strong>: A stylish hack-and-slash game where an assassin fights alien superheroes in over-the-top battles.</li><li><strong>Synergy</strong>: A sci-fi city-builder about building a sustainable human settlement on a harsh alien planet.</li><li><strong>Spin Hero</strong>: A roguelike RPG where combat and progression are determined by spinning a slot machine.</li><li><strong>Paleo Pines</strong>: A cozy farming sim where you run a ranch, explore an island, and befriend dinosaurs.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest game in here is probably the strategy game Total War: Warhammer III, which we gave a 9/10 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/total-war-warhammer-3-review">review</a>. It’s a huge blockbuster PC game with many dozens of potential hours of play time. Another Crab’s Treasure is a surprisingly accessible Soulslike game that got an 8/10 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/another-crabs-treasure-review">review</a>. And Etrian Odyssey HD is a personal favorite, a remaster of a Nintendo DS dungeon crawler that has you draw the map as you explore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyone interested in relaxing farm sims can try out Paleo Pines, while No More Heroes 3 offers fast-paced action. There’s plenty here to try, and any one of these games is worth the $14.99 asking price all on its own. Getting the whole bundle for that price is a killer deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As always with Humble Choice, a membership gets you a month of IGN Plus as an added bonus, as well as access to more than 50 DRM-free games in the Humble Vault.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>While we're still waiting on a proper update in the legal battle between Nintendo and Pocketpair regarding Nintendo suing Pocketpair over Palworld and its alleged infringement on Nintendo patents, we do have an update on some of the patents in question, thanks to <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/">Games Fray</a>, who has been reporting in-depth analysis on the case as it develops.</p>



<p>Spotted by Games Fray, the US Patent Office, specifically the director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), John A. Squires, has initiated a re-examination of Nintendo's patent number <a href="https://archive.org/details/12403397">12,403,397</a>. You might not recognize that patent by its number, so to give you a refresh, it's the one regarding summoning characters and making them battle, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-new-patent-should-not-have-happened-says-lawyer-palworld/">the one that IP and patent lawyer Kirk Sigmon said "<em>should not have happened, full stop</em>."</a></p>



<p>The patent being re-examined, especially in this case where Squires has kicked off the re-examination himself, is "<em>rare</em>," according to Games Fray, and this re-examination could result in the patent being revoked. It's possible that the patent is upheld, but with how uncommon this step is from the USPTO, that could already be a sign of trouble for Nintendo.</p>



<p>As Games Fray speculates, it could be that the public attention this case is getting has helped move it up the priority docket, with Squires examining it more closely to initiate the re-examination in the first place, but for now, we'll have to see if the re-examination bears any fruit.</p>



<p>Regardless, the fact that the USPTO is looking even more closely at Nintendo's patents likely spells more trouble for Nintendo's case against Pocketpair. It was already trying tactics that Games Fray <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">described as a "<em>hail mary</em>."</a> This case is far from over; there's still a lot that needs to play out, but more and more it is looking like Palworld maker Pocketpair will be able to come out the other side of this with a win.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[14 Essential Tips For Getting Started In Arc Raiders]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/14-essential-tips-for-getting-started-in-arc-raiders.1343779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> came out last week and folks have been pouring into the servers–in some cases overwhelming them. And as players immerse themselves in the PvPvE extraction shooter, it’s developing a reputation as a well-made game that poses a number of interesting and unpredictable challenges as you fight to stay alive, hoard piles of resources, and craft your way to loadout supremacy.</p> <p>There’s no way around it: <i>Arc Raiders</i> expects a serious investment of your time and a willingness to suffer some pretty humiliating and often random losses that will set you back in your efforts to accumulate good weaponry and gear.</p> <p>Having spent about 50 hours in the game myself, I’ve found it to be one of the best online shooters I’ve ever played, and I’ve also learned a thing or two about surviving out there amidst hostile robots and sinister players looking to get the better of me. My runs have mostly been solo, but much of what I’ve learned still applies to rolling out with a group.</p>

 <p>So here are 14 of the best tips I can give to those getting started in <i>Arc Raiders</i>.</p> <h2>You can trade Free Loadout Augments for Looting Augments</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641193" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641193"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641193">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This tip is a two-parter: First, don’t sleep on the <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Free_Loadout_Augment">Free Loadout</a>. When choosing to go out on a run, you can either build a loadout from the gear you’ve collected and crafted, or choose the Free loadout which always includes one main weapon, ammo for it, some bandages, a shield recharger, and any number of other utility items or grenades. It’s a handy way to get back out there without risking your good stuff.</p>

 <p>These items are free, so the only thing you really lose on a failed run with these is your time (and maybe a fragment of your sanity). But if you do manage to extract with them, hey, that’s free gear you didn’t have to craft (and you can always break it down for parts).</p>

 <p>But perhaps the most important thing about the Free Loadout Augment is <b>you can trade a Free Augment for a </b><a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Looting_Mk._1"><b>Looting Mk. 1 Augment</b></a><b> from Lance in the Traders tab.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>This has become my default approach to any run that ended in failure: Go back out with a Free Loadout, return home with it and trade it for a Loot one and either go out and get more loot <i>or</i> recycle the Looting augment I just purchased if I already have enough or have better Augments to use.</p>

 <p>Free Loadouts are an efficient way to keep the crafting supplies flowing.</p> <h2>You can roll after a fall to cancel out fall damage</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641192">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For a relatively realistic game, <i>Arc Raiders </i>is generous with how long you can sprint and how far you can fall before you take damage. But missing a jump or taking a fall can hurt and isn’t ideal when you’re fleeing a pursuit from an enemy player or Arc. Turns out, <b>hitting dodge right when your feet touch the ground will let you roll to cancel out the damage from falling</b>.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905"><i>Arc Raiders</i>: The Sickest, Silliest, and Most Spectacular Moments From The Game So Far</a></p> <p>The timing is tricky but there is a skill in the Mobility tree that can make this easier. Also, it seems like some heights are too far to recover from–so don’t expect to leap off the tower in Spaceport and roll your way out of damage. You can, as of now anyway, manage to use <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ompomw/has_anyone_survived_a_tower_freefall_like_this/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905">an exploit to grab onto a ledge to cancel out such a fall</a>–and falls from far lesser heights.</p>

 <h2>Rubber parts are pretty important</h2> <p>In my 50 hours of playing <i>Arc Raiders</i> (mostly on solo runs), one particular crafting part has remained perpetually low in stock: <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Rubber_Parts">Rubber Parts</a>.</p> <p>I suspect part of this is due to just how often Rubber Parts are used. For example, to upgrade, build, and repair many guns and gun parts, you’ll either need both <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Metal_Parts">Metal</a> and Rubber Parts or you’ll need to <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Mechanical_Components">craft Mechanical Components</a>, which requires Metal and Rubber.</p> <p>Rubber Parts can be salvaged or recycled from a number of different sources (Scrappy will also give you some after every run). But you can also find them in Mechanical, Industrial, or Technological loot sources. You can spot ideal locations with the matching icon (a gear for Mechanical, building for Industrial, and circuit board for Technological) by looking at the map both before you go out for a run and while you’re on the map.</p>

 <p>I heartily recommend going on several runs to stock up on Rubber Parts.</p> <h2>The Practice Range is essential</h2> <p>While you’ll play through the briefest of tutorials when you first start <i>Arc Raiders</i>, in my experience, it’s not enough to get a feel for the movement of your character and the behavior of its various guns, especially as you mod them with various attachments.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641196" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641196"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641196">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Going out on a run with a weapon you’ve never used before isn’t wise and will likely get you killed. Enter the practice range, which lets you go into a small map (with a few secrets of its own tucked away) to practice your parkour skills and try out different guns. You can literally swap out various gun attachments in real time to get a sense of what they do. For example, I’ve learned that I greatly prefer the Muzzle Break attachment over the Compensator by trying it out in the safety of the Practice Range.</p>

 <p>There are also two achievements you can earn by going to the practice range and using four different guns, so there’s that.</p> <h2>For mouse and keyboard users: Rebind your dodge roll</h2> <p>Rolling out of the way of incoming fire from players or Arc is essential to surviving in <i>Arc Raiders</i> and, in my experience, the default binding of Left Alt for rolling isn’t ideal. This is a function that you need to be able to access quickly under pressure while maintaining your hold on WASD.</p> <p>I’ve chosen to break out my keyboard that has a split spacebar for backspace and forward space side-by-side for this reason. I mapped dodge to backspace and set left space as jump and I’m digging it so far.</p> <p>But if you have a normal keyboard, I recommend mapping sprint to caps lock (toggle, if you wish), and freeing up your shift key to roll. Mapping your dodge roll to a mouse button is also a good move. Whatever mapping you decide on, though, just make sure you can accentuate WASD while rolling without too many weird, cramp-prone finger movements. Thank me after you’ve survived getting swarmed by Hornets.</p>

 <p>Also, Embark Studios, why are there not double or triple bindings in this game? Come on!</p> <h2>The birds will give you away (as well as other noisy things)</h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> has phenomenal sound design–easily some of the best I’ve ever heard in a video game. But it’s not just an audio treat. You likely already know that running around, rummaging through stuff, and cracking open various caches is <b>loud</b> (you can invest in skills to make your activities quieter though). On top of that, various buildings are outfitted with security cameras and metal detectors that set off alarms. Watch out for these while also keeping your ears open for other people tripping them.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879#comments">I Asked <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Design Director If Camping Makes Me A Bad Person</a></p> <p>But also beware of <i>the birds.&nbsp;</i></p> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ design director <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879#comments">Virgil Watkins mentioned these feathered loudmouths</a> in our discussion about the fairness of various hiding places in the maps, and it’s clear they can easily give you away even while you’re slowly walking through forests and other natural habitats. But like all the other sound traps, you can use this to your advantage. Listen and look for flocks of birds taking spontaneous flight near you. It usually means someone is nearby.</p>

 <h2>You can ask people to follow you</h2> <p>There are two emote wheels in <i>Arc Raiders</i>; one lets you ping a variety of locations with information such as “I heard something here,” “avoid that,” or, a very useful one, “group up over there.” By default, these emotes are only heard by your squad, but you can toggle on the fly to make it heard to all Raiders.</p> <p>The “group up” emote seems to have a secret second mode. If you look down at the ground and select it, your character will say “Follow me” or “Group up on me.” This is very useful if you want to take the lead with some randos, or even those in your party.</p>

 <h2>Recycling is tricky</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641183" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641183"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641183">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> lets you break down various items in two ways: Salvaging and Recycling. Salvaging is done while you’re out in the field, while Recycling is done in your inventory when you’re out of a game. Recycling will always net you more resources than Salvaging, so unless you need to Salvage to get a specific item or you need to clear up space in your bag while out in the field, try to wait until you extract before you start breaking things down.</p> <p>However, the language used for some objects is a little vague. Take <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Toaster">Toasters</a>, for instance. You’ll find these objects scattered around the world and you can break them down into Plastic Parts and Wires if you recycle them. The description reads “Can be recycled into crafting materials.” That might make you think that the only thing a Toaster is good for is being immediately recycled.</p>

 <p>But hold your horses. Many objects with descriptions that read “Can be recycled into crafting materials” can also be used in upgrading your various workshops. Toasters, for example, are needed to upgrade your Refiner.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641184" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641184"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641184">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I recommend tracking resources for your workshop upgrades. Once you construct a new workshop, tab over to “Level Up” and click on the tracking button. This will label any instance of the items required with an eye symbol so you’ll know it’s needed and, thus, you’ll be less likely to accidentally break it down.</p> <h2>Full bag? GTFO</h2> <p>At most, you’ll be given about 30 minutes to do your thing on a map. Sometimes you’ll spawn with less time than that. And I’ve learned in my 50 hours that time needlessly spent in the game can be seriously costly. I’ve had full bags of loot, only to get intrigued by a specific location that ends up leading to a Clusterfuck™ that gets me murdered, seeing me lose all the stuff I’d found.</p> <p>Even the most basic of parts, such as Metal Parts and those Rubber Parts I told you about, are essential to keep in stock. So while you might have a bag full of stuff that doesn’t feel valuable, it all adds up to something you’re looking to craft or sell for credits. But you can’t do any of that if you died and lost it all.</p>

 <p>A full bag, regardless of how much time is left, means it’s time to leave–and extracting can be a whole quest full of dangers and surprises in and of itself. A good loadout is built on a path made up of small victories.</p> <h2>Planning a route is essential</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641182" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641182"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641182">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I realized this essential tactic pretty late in my time with <i>Arc Raiders</i>. At one point I dropped into a map with an inconvenient loadout and was about to extract, but I realized that this was actually a great opportunity to scope out the path to an objective I had a quest for.</p> <p>So I took the opportunity to do some reconnaissance, observing the various paths I could take if I was better equipped, and what threats were likely to happen. And wouldn’t you know it, I came across one of the death-delivering Sentinel turrets along the way. I was pretty glad in that moment to not be carrying a ton of things I’d rather not lose to an unexpected threat.</p> <p>Enemy AI is rather spontaneous in this game. They don’t show up in the same place on every run and their behavior (which in some instances was <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879#comments">developed using machine learning</a>) is very unpredictable and disturbingly smart.</p>

 <p>So if you’ve got an important quest or have a key to a particularly good loot spot, spend a run just examining potential routes and escape plans. Grab a Free Loadout to do this so an unpredictable death isn’t as costly.</p> <h2>Dam Battlegrounds is spicy</h2> <p>This next tip might evolve over time, but in my experience, Dam Battlegrounds, which is the first map you gain access to, is more prone to bouts of PvP. I suspect part of this is because the map is home to the newest folks coming into the game and just getting their bearings and experiencing the flow of its PvPvE action.</p> <p>Other maps unlock after you’ve made enough progress doing things on Dam Battlegrounds, and that’s where a lot of folks are out trying to loot for good shit or are just questing after investing some time into the game, and thus their loadout; they’re probably less likely to risk that progress.</p> <p>So just have your radar up for shenanigans every time you head out to Dam Battlegrounds. People are antsy over there.</p>

 <h2>People are nicer than you think</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641180" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641180"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641180">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This tip can result in your death. Hate to say it, but in a PvPvE game, unless someone is in your party, they can pose a potential risk to you. But! I’m finding that folks in <i>Arc Raiders</i> are a bit nicer than I experienced during the Server Slam, especially on maps other than Dam Battlegrounds.</p> <p>When going into a building, while I don’t do it every time, when I suspect someone’s around, I will usually use the emote wheel to shout out a “Hello” followed by a “Don’t Shoot!” I have been surprised just how often randos will reply with a “Don’t Shoot,” often followed by a holstering of their weapon.</p> <p>This kind of dynamic is part of the unique, prisoner’s-dilemma social game at work in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. Holstering a gun seems to have become a universal way to signal you’re not going to shoot someone, so return the gesture if you see someone putting their gun away.</p> <p>Or betray them. I dunno. Be a bad person. You’ll get what’s coming to you eventually if you turn evil.</p> <h2>Go nuts with gadgets</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641179" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641179"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641179">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Maybe the inner-<i>Siege</i> fanatic in me is at work here, but once I realized I can craft items to seal doors, erect barricades, and set up traps, oh, how I realized what a devastating saboteur I can be in this game.</p> <p>I’ve sealed up entire rooms while I loot, hunkered down in some buildings to hunt Arc through windows, usually while running solo, covering my ass with traps and gadgets. Some gadgets are harmless, like <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Noisemaker">the Noisemaker</a>. Others range from nonlethal, like the <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Jolt_Mine">Jolt Mine</a>, to lethal, like <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Explosive_Mine">the Explosive Mine</a>.</p> <p>At the time of this writing, with <i>Arc Raiders</i> less than a week old, I haven’t seen many people use gadgets to booby-trap areas. I’ve also surprised many a wandering Raider with a well-placed trap or two. Folks are less likely to sneak up on you if you’ve established a perimeter of fun toys for them to encounter.</p> <h2>Snitches can be your best friend (especially while running solo)</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641178" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641178"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641178">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Snitch">Snitches</a> are often a pain, as they’ll summon Arc to your location if they spot you. But they can be <i>your</i> pain to inflict on others. Lately I’ve gotten into the habit of keeping my eyes peeled for one, even if they’re at a great distance. Typically, shooting at one will draw them over to you.</p> <p>This is a great way to lose pursuant enemy Raiders. Call over a Snitch by getting its attention and it will either summon Wasps or Hornets, which will target you as well as your unfriendly Raider enemies, or just prove a helpful distraction by giving your foes another problem besides you. This can help you make a clean getaway or prove a helpful distraction that lets you fall back and help Arc kill your enemies.</p> <hr> <p>As <i>Arc Raiders</i> matures, I’m sure I’ll find more helpful things to share. For now, however, these tips should help you break down what is arguably a very complex and hardcore game. Mastery over its various systems and unpredictable gameplay is well worth the experience and the struggles of failure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here’s some unexpected but much-appreciated news: <a href="https://kotaku.com/there-was-nearly-a-sequel-to-space-jam-about-skateboard-1831528293#:~:text=This%20fateful%20meeting,in%20%24230%20million.">Brendan Fraser</a> and Rachel Weisz are reportedly in talks to star in a new <em>Mummy</em> film from Radio Silence, the team behind<em> Ready or Not</em>, <em>Scream</em> (2022), and 2023’s<em> Scream VI.</em> And it could be a direct sequel to the second film.</p> <p>On November 4, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/new-mummy-movie-brendan-fraser-rachel-weisz-1236418031/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> reported</a> that it had heard from sources that Fraser and Weisz are currently in talks with Universal to return to the franchise that started back in 1999 with the blockbuster action-adventure movie <em>The Mummy, </em>an action-oriented remake of the studio’s original 1930s horror movie. &nbsp;The outlet reports that Radio Silence is producing and directing the movie. The duo, made up of filmmakers Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, found success with 2019’s <em>Ready Or Not</em> and helped revitalize the <em>Scream</em> franchise in 2022.&nbsp; Sean Daniel, who helped produce the OG <em>Mummy</em> movies, is also on board.</p>

 <p>Details on the new movie are still under wraps (get it?), but a source told<em> The Hollywood Reporter</em> that the yet-to-be-confirmed new <em>Mummy</em> movie isn’t a reboot, but instead a sequel that would possibly “disregard” the events of the third film, which hit theaters in 2008, moved the franchise into China, and controversially recast Weisz’s character. The outlet reports that David Coggeshall is behind the new <em>Mummy’s</em> screenplay.</p>

  <p>After 1999’s fantastic <em>Mummy</em>, Universal followed it up with two sequels. The equally fun sequel arrived in 2001 and was also a box office hit. <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-mummy-tomb-of-the-dragon-emperor">But the franchise stalled before returning seven years later</a> and flopping with critics, though that film still brought in over $400 million.</p> <p>In 2017, Universal rebooted<em> The Mummy</em> with Tom Cruise as part of the studio’s<em> Dark Universe</em> project. While it earned about the same as the third <em>Mummy</em> movie, it cost significantly more and was attached to a failed cinematic universe that never took off. So it makes sense that Universal, wanting to cash in on this oddly reliable franchise, is looking to bring back the two charismatic stars who launched the whole thing in 1999. Let’s just hope it all works out and we get one more fun mummy-filled adventure with Fraser and Weisz.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> is an extraction shooter that takes place in a punishing world featuring robotic enemies that can destroy you for making one wrong move. When you add in the threat of other players who might want to kill you and take your loot, too, you really need to make sure you're prepared to fight at all times. But there's a bit more to the game than just survival, as there are also a variety of quests to complete that can provide you with resources that will help you on your journey through Speranza. Below, we've listed out every quest you can undertake in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Arc Raiders missions list</h2><p>There are currently 63 quests in Arc Raiders, though more will be added with future updates. As of right now, you can expect to spend dozens of hours completing these quests, which task you with finding spots on the map to interact with, looting unique resources to return safely to someone in Speranza, or defeating specific enemy types.</p>

<p>Every quest is accepted by speaking to Traders in Speranza, and they'll need to be turned in after completion to receive any rewards. Additionally, some quests will be locked behind progression, so you'll need to keep pushing through your currently accepted tasks to continue unlocking new quests to tackle. If you're struggling to complete any of them, you may want to recruit a pal (or stranger) to watch your back.</p><p>Here is every quest currently available in Arc Raiders roughly in the order you'll see them unlock, though the order can change a little bit based on which quests you're completing before or after others.</p><ol><li>Picking Up the Pieces</li><li>Clearer Skies</li><li>Trash Into Treasure</li><li>Off the Radar</li><li>A Bad Feeling</li><li>The Right Tool</li><li>Hatch Repairs</li><li>Safe Passage</li><li>Down to Earth</li><li>The Trifecta</li><li>A Better Use</li><li>What Goes Around</li><li>Sparks Fly</li><li>Greasing Her Palms</li><li>A First Foothold</li><li>Dormant Barons</li><li>Mixed Signals</li><li>What We Left Behind</li><li>Doctor's Orders</li><li>Medical Merchandise</li><li>A Reveal in Ruins</li><li>Broken Monument</li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-marked-for-death-quest-guide/1100-6535927/" data-ref-id="1100-6535927">Marked for Death</a></li><li>Straight Record</li><li>A Lay of the Land</li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-market-correction-quest-guide/1100-6535925/" data-ref-id="1100-6535925">Market Correction</a></li><li>Keeping the Memory</li><li>Reduced to Rubble</li><li>With a Trace</li><li>Eyes on the Prize</li><li>Echoes of Victory Ridge</li><li>Industrial Espionage</li><li>Unexpected Initiative</li><li>A Symbol of Unification</li><li>Celeste's Journals</li><li>Back on Top</li><li>The Major's Footlocker</li><li>Out of the Shadows</li><li>Eyes in the Sky</li><li>Our Presence Up There</li><li>Communication Hideout</li><li>After Rain Comes</li><li>A Balanced Harvest</li><li>Untended Garden</li><li>The Root of the Matter</li><li>Water Troubles</li><li>Into the Fray</li><li>Source of the Contamination</li><li>Switching the Supply</li><li>A Warm Place to Rest</li><li>Prescriptions of the Past</li><li>Power Out</li><li>Lost in Transmission</li><li>Flickering Threat</li><li>Bees!</li><li>Espresso</li><li>Life of a Pharmacist</li><li>Tribute to Toledo</li><li>Digging Up Dirt</li><li>Turnabout</li><li>Building a Library</li><li>A New Type of Plant</li><li>Armored Transports</li></ol><p>For more on Arc Raiders, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/field-depot-locations-in-arc-raiders/1100-6535902/" data-ref-id="1100-6535902">All Field Depot Locations</a> and don't forget to use our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-tips-15-things-to-know-before-you-play/1100-6535635/" data-ref-id="1100-6535635">Arc Raiders tips</a>.</p>
