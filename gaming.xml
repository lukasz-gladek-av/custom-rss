<p>The Switch 2 Edition includes 4K and 120fps modes</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Inti Creates is kicking off the new year with the announcement of <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/gunvolt-chronicles-luminous-avenger-ix-1plus2-dual-collection">Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX 1+2 Dual Collection</a></strong> for the Switch 2, Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>This "director's cut" will arrive on <strong>9th July 2026</strong> and comes loaded with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gunvolt_chronicles_luminous_avenger_ix">Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gunvolt_chronicles_luminous_avenger_ix_2">Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX 2</a>. On top of this, it will include all of the DLC!</p>
<p>There will also be some new content in the 2D action games, including "Endless Battle" mode, where you'll take on a never-ending challenge and face off against an "onslaught" of random bosses. Inti Creates is even going to the extent of making some balance updates to upgrade the gameplay, making it sharper and more accessible than before.</p>
<p>Perhaps, most notably, the Switch 2 Edition of the game will be able to swap between a "high resolution (4K) display mode" and "high performance (120fps) mode". So you can expect a silky smooth and super sharp experience.</p>
<p>Physical releases have also been confirmed in Japan (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/gunvolt-chronicles-luminous-avenger-ix-12-dual-collection-announced-for-ps5-switch-2-switch-and-pc">thanks for the heads up, Gematsu</a>).

<h2 id="block-e2995432-719e-4ed6-8fad-a1db37670203">How To Play Strands</h2>



<p id="block-da980997-0420-4527-946e-b66c49bf3d07">Strands is a daily word search that challenges you to find words with a common theme. There’s also a Spanagram that reveals the deeper theme behind the words.</p>



<ul id="block-d0bea02d-4b9f-4991-b9db-3b35778ff3bf">
<li>Words that are three letters and under do not count.</li>



<li>Words that reveal the correct theme appear in blue.</li>



<li>The Spanagram turns yellow when found.</li>



<li>Finding three words that don’t fit the theme will reveal a hint to help you find the proper words.</li>
</ul>



<p id="block-5e597b53-af1c-4c06-a00c-6c5a4694e9e0">The goal is to string together as many words as possible. Every letter on the grid gets used! Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a popular online trend.</p>



<p id="block-cd7aaa7f-9491-4ad0-b994-72d0102c5bed">Strands can only be played on the New York Times website. You can also play on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NYT Games app.</a></p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/bandai-namco-might-have-accidentally-revealed-its-new-dragon-ball-game</link>
            <guid>1445554</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">

<p>You guessed it...</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Last month, Bandai Namco announced a new Dragon Ball project titled "<strong>Age 1000</strong>" which is currently set to arrive in 2027.</p>
<p>Fans already had multiple theories about what this new project might actually be, and in an update, it seems it's arguably the most obvious one! Bandai Namco's official Southeast Asia YouTube channel recently added the Age 1000 trailer to a new playlist titled... "<strong>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 3</strong>".</p>
<p>It was spotted by many Dragon Ball fans before the same Bandai Namco YouTube account removed it. As highlighted on social media, it's even got the same artwork revealed alongside "Age 1000".</p>

<p>Of course, Bandai Namco hasn't confirmed Age 1000 is Xenoverse 3 just yet and the official game title was intended to be revealed at a later date, so it's probably best to treat this as a rumour for now until it's officially announced.</p>
<p>According to last month's announcement, this is a "brand-new" Dragon Ball world featuring "never-before seen" characters by series creator Akira Toriyama, who passed away in 2024. It's been in development for "about 6 to 7 years now including the initial concept phase" and more details will be shared at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 in April.</p>
<p>Although no platforms have been announced for this new title, Bandai Namco previously released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_xenoverse_2">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a> on the Switch.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved communication stability during online play.</li>
<li>There was a problem in the Checklist where the number of events, machines, riders, etc. would not be counted correctly in applicable tasks. This has been fixed so that even if the issue has already occurred, players can restore counts to the correct number by restarting the game.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Checklist where rewards for completing all the tasks for Air Ride, Top Ride, City Trial, and Road Trip could not be obtained.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Checklist where the task “Hit 2 riders with Kaboombs in a single race” would not be considered accomplished in an online match, even if conditions were met.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where multiples of the same legendary-machine parts would sometimes appear during online matches in City Trial.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Air Ride course Cyberion Highway where riders would sometimes go off course after getting off the grind rails and be unable to return to the course.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, by performing a Quick Spin on a grind rail just before a specific rider’s Special would end, the Special would not end.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Air Ride course Crystalline Fissure where riders could go at abnormally fast speeds when jumping out of the ground of the half-pipe using the Drill Copy Ability.</li>
<li>There was a problem with Taranza where spider silk could be produced even when in a frozen state from something like a rival’s Freeze Copy Ability, so the frozen state could be quickly lifted. This issue has been fixed so that Taranza cannot produce silk when frozen.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where headwear was not reflected when riders were randomized in Local Play.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, if a player-controlled Scarfy was near when a Transform Star placed in a garage transforms, Scarfy could end up entering angry state.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Air Ride course Checker Knights where the appearance effects of the jump ramps that appear and disappear were sometimes out of alignment with their actual position.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with Transform Star where it would sometimes not accelerate if a Boost Dash was performed when a mode switch finished.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where certain Copy Abilities wouldn’t work properly after Scarfy’s angry state ended while the Copy Abilities were activated.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the thumbnails for My Machines would, in rare instances, be incorrect.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in City Trial where items would sometimes not appear when destroying crystals in the underground area with Knuckle Joe’s automatic attack.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Free Run where, after recording a Personal Best with Transform Star (star mode or bike mode), the Best Run data could not be loaded when trying to start a race in a different mode from the one in which the Personal Best was recorded in.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where online-events records could sometimes be used as a reference value for the “High Score” search condition in Spectate.
<ul>
<li>Since records that could not be produced in normal play were sometimes used as a reference value, all reference values for “High Score” have been initialized in this latest update.</li>
<li>“High Score” search results will temporarily not be displayed until players race with and on the corresponding machines/courses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the game would stop progressing if the course was randomized during a Top Ride Series in a paddock.</li>
<li>Made several other miscellaneous gameplay fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>A tiny patch addressing "several issues"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has already released an update for the Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> this year, and it has now rolled out another one. So, if you like staying on top of your game updates, consider this a PSA and get downloading!</p>
<p>This new update follows on from Version 3.1.0 (which added Polish as a supported language) and bumps the latest build of the game up to <strong>Version 3.2.0</strong>. According to Nintendo's official patch notes, this patch addresses "several issues" to "improve the gameplay experience".</p>
<p>If we find out what exactly has been adjusted behind the scenes after this latest update, we'll be sure to let you know. Based on the information provided, it's just ironing out some issues.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Donkey Kong Bananza was followed by the paid DLC <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a> in September last year. This DLC includes special in-game events, where you unlock statues to display on DK Island, and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/donkey-kong-bananzas-next-dlc-in-game-event-starts-today">latest event has just wrapped</a>.</p>
<p>There's also a demo for Donkey Kong Bananza available on the eShop, so if you haven't already tried it out, this is a great way to jump in. In some other Switch 2 update news, Nintendo has released a new patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> this week.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“I’m Committed to Xbox, Starting With the Console”: Xbox’s New CEO Promises “Return to Xbox” and New Hardware Info “Soon”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-new-ceo-committed-to-xbox-starting-with-console-new-hardware-info-soon/</link>
            <guid>1445524</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p id="h-">Last Friday, the video game industry changed forever with the reveal that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/"><strong>Phil Spencer</strong> would be retiring</a> as the chief executive officer of <strong>Microsoft's</strong> gaming division, leaving the company he had spent <strong>38 years with</strong>, while spending the last decade at the forefront of the <strong>Xbox </strong>brand. His replacement started yesterday. <strong>Asha Sharma</strong>, formerly the CEO of Microsoft's <strong>CoreAI</strong> division, was placed at the head of <strong>Xbox</strong> after joining Microsoft in 2024.</p>



<p>Sharma's opening message to players has been all about how she wants to bring about "<em>the return of Xbox</em>," and in a new interview with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty">Windows Central</a>, she reaffirms that commitment and tries to explain more of what she means. She also drops another hint towards when we'll hear about new Xbox hardware, though it's nothing more than saying we'll learn more about the company's hardware plans "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>For me, the spirit of 'Return to Xbox'</em> <em>is about returning to the spirit that the team was founded on. It's that spirit of surprise, it's the spirit of building something nobody else was willing to try - I've heard 'renegade,' 'rebellion,' and 'fun,' used. That's what I was thinking about when I wrote that</em>," Sharma explains.</p>



<p>Sharma continued by explaining she understands that people have "<em>thousands of dollars</em>" and "<em>25 years of themselves</em>" into the Xbox platform. She adds, "<em>I want to make sure everybody knows <strong>I'm committed to Xbox, starting with the console</strong></em>," before also saying that as the world continues to evolve, Xbox will "<em>keep meeting players where they are</em>" and "<em>invest in <strong>reducing the artificial divide between different types of devices</strong>."</em> She also says she believes Xbox "<em>starts with its fans</em>."</p>



<p>She also provides some insight into the question of whether we'll start seeing Xbox have more exclusive titles, and it seems like, at least for the short term, nothing about Xbox's plan to put its games on all platforms, even if they are timed console exclusives on Xbox, will change.</p>



<p>"<em>I am committed to 'returning to Xbox,' and that starts with the console, that starts with hardware. You will hear more about that soon, we'll have some announcements coming up. You will see us collectively investing here. We also know that there <strong>are a lot of players who aren't on console or our hardware, and I want to deliver great games to them too.</strong></em> <em>I need to learn more about what that can look like, what decisions were made, what we need to do going forward, and <strong>I want a little bit of time and space to do that."</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Matt Booty</strong>, as the new chief content officer, chimed in to say that the studio's system is "<em>fully built around being first-party</em>. <em><strong>We're not built to just be a publisher</strong>,</em>" which feels like a pointed statement, considering how it has seemed like Xbox would lean into just being a publisher with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reports-a-9-overall-drop-in-xbox-revenue-for-q2-fy26-hardware-down-32/"><strong>consistent decline in hardware revenue</strong></a> recently and a heavier focus on its software and services. "<em>We're committed to being a first-party games publisher in partnership with our first-party platform team,</em>" Booty adds.</p>



<p>On the point of Xbox's struggles, Sharma concludes her comments by saying she will use her experience and the leaders around her to grow the business and "<em>make sure that we have an incredible next 25 years.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em><strong>I will listen, I will learn, I will communicate what we're seeing, and what we're doing. I think from here, the work is proof over promise</strong>. Matt and I are in it, every hour of every day of every night, I am <strong>fully in this thing</strong>. This team has brought it back before, and <strong>I'm here to help us do it again</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Ultimately, Sharma's words are nothing more than that right now. They are words from someone who has everything to prove. Her statement that "<em>the work is proof over promise</em>" going forward is probably the most genuine comment she makes in the whole interview, because that's exactly right. These are just promises yet to be fulfilled right now.</p>



<p>One thing's for sure, she's definitely doing her best to try and combat those who might agree with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-founder-thinks-new-xbox-ceo-will-sunset-division-ai-business/">Xbox founder <strong>Seamus Blackley</strong>,</a> who believes her role is that of "<em><strong>a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night</strong>.</em>"</p>



<p>We'll see where things stand once Sharma has spent some serious time in the role.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Xbox CEO On Company Strategy: “The Plan’s The Plan Until It’s Not The Plan”]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asha-sharma-xbox-future-plans-roadmap-2000673378</link>
            <guid>1445515</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In her introduction email to Xbox employees, Asha Sharma, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">new CEO of Microsoft Gaming</a> and former president of Microsoft’s CoreAI, promised a return to Xbox. This, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nothing-about-the-big-xbox-shakeup-makes-sense-2000672914">among many other things</a> about the announcement, raised some questions, with perhaps the most relevant being, “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/phil-spencer-asha-sharma-microsoft-xbox-options-whats-next/">What does that even mean?</a>”</p> <p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty"><em>Windows Central</em></a> sat down with Sharma and new CCO Matt Booty to ask just that. Instead of clarifying her plans, Sharma offered vaguely positive-sounding platitudes that amounted to little of substance. “For me, the spirit of ‘Return to Xbox’ is about returning to the spirit that the team was founded on,” Sharma said. “It’s that spirit of surprise, it’s the spirit of building something nobody else was willing to try—I’ve heard ‘renegade,’ ‘rebellion,’ and ‘fun’ used. That’s what I was thinking about when I wrote that.”</p>

 <p>Sharma did, at least, acknowledge that she has a lot of work to do before making any big decisions, but it’s bizarre that Microsoft would just set her loose for interviews when she admits she still has so much to learn about Xbox. When asked about Xbox getting rid of game exclusives and whether or not that policy might be revised, she said, “Right now, I need to learn, candidly. About the ‘why’ of these decisions, what we were optimizing for, and what the data says about the Xbox strategy today. That’s the honest answer. I’m looking at lifetime value, not just what happened in a previous moment, or in short term efficiencies and things like that. The plan’s the plan until it’s not the plan.”</p> <p>On the subject of AI, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087">Sharma reiterated</a> that she wouldn’t “flood [the Xbox] ecosystem with slop,” and said she stands by what she wrote in her introduction email. Booty jumped in with further clarification, adding, “We’ve got no pressure from Microsoft, there are no directives on AI coming down.”</p>

 <p>Overall, the interview is light on concrete details about Sharma’s vision for Xbox. As she said, “I think from here, the work is proof over promise.” We’ll just have to wait and see what that work actually looks like.</p>

Information about playable pianos and beard cosmetics was all there, but what they also found was that the studio behind the massively popular multiplayer game had upped the crafting requirements for one of its most iconic tools: the Wolfpack.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/24/arc-raiders-wolfpack-requirements-1771970287801.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Wolfpack now requires one Rocketeer Driver to craft. Image captured in-game by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As outlined in Shrouded Sky’s accompanying patch notes, the Wolfpack, a throwable equipment that showers Arc enemies with homing explosives, now requires one Rocketeer Driver to craft. Now, players will need the component, as well as two Arc motion cores and an explosive compound, to make just one Wolfpack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The changes fall in line with a series of new adjustments to resource requirements, which see Arc components also added to the recipes for the Deadline mine, Trailblazer, Showstopper, and Vita Spray. It’s the Wolfpack tweak that has Raiders up in arms, though, mostly because Rocketeer Drivers are infamously rare and hard to collect. The most consistent way to find one of these epic items is to kill a Rocketeer – a task that currently takes two Wolfpacks to accomplish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rditsw/hot_take_wolfpacks_were_too_easy_to_craft_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some believe the change is understandable considering the previous recipe asked relatively little from players</a>, much of the community online has already started voicing their concerns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Let me just kill a rocketeer to get 1 wolfpack that can half kill another rocketeer,” one Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdd2f7/comment/o746rwv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teased</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t even want the blueprint anymore,” another player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74jteq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First time I’ve said this but if they keep going in this direction people will stop playing,” a X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/gmanskiyoutube/status/2026377384056725559?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>. “It’s hard enough to gather some of these resources.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Doesn’t quite add up <a href="https://t.co/1KLOMIWnQe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1KLOMIWnQe</a></p>— ARC Central (@TheARCcentral) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheARCcentral/status/2026389327081578664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 24, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The grenade can’t lock on to other players but can tear through hordes of small Arc, making it one of the best PvE tools Raiders have at their disposal. It can also quickly dismantle the armor featured on large Arc, such as the Matriarch, Queen, Leaper, and Bastion, but it’s the math asking players for two Wolfpacks to kill one Rocketeer that has fans questioning Embark's judgement. While showing concern about how update 1.17.0 asks players to work harder for crafting materials, some have started chiming in with their own recommendations for how to fix the issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If rocketeers start consistently dropping more than 1x driver, we can talk,” one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74eo6f/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They need to up the drop odds on drivers,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74ffry/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>. “Right now you’re lucky if you get two. Make two the base with higher odds of 3+. Otherwise wolfpacks will basically just be used when looted on the map.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some players are asking for more rewarding Rocketeer loot and reduced requirements for the Wolfpack, but others are still exploring all Shrouded Sky has to offer. The February update launched today, focusing on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embark-shows-off-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-with-first-look-at-two-new-threatsand-beards"><u>map changes for Dam Battlegrounds and the new Firefly and Comet Arc threats</u></a> as its latest additions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund shared more about how the studio plans to continue building on Arc Raiders in the months ahead during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> earlier this month.

That's a headline suggesting it's going to provide the exact answers everyone has been looking for: why is Phil Spencer retiring now, what's gone wrong inside Xbox over the last few years, why did his apparent successor Sarah Bond leave the company entirely, and why the hell did Microsoft appoint<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeffgerstmann.com/post/3mfdtqu5wjk2x?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>a natalist AI-loving weirdo</u></a> as the head of their video games division?</p><figure><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Inside Microsoft’s big Xbox leadership shake-up</p><p>Microsoft has a new gaming CEO</p><p><span>The Verge</span><span>Tom Warren</span></p></div></a></figure><p>Instead we get a story that spends its first half taking shots at the departed Bond, as "more than a dozen current and former Microsoft employees" line up to criticise her efforts at the company, particularly her role in the disastrous "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>This Is An Xbox</u></a>" marketing campaign. It then spends its back end airing internal misgivings about Asha Sharma, which is hardly unique since <em>everyone </em>has misgivings about her.</p><p>Microsoft is an enormous company. Xbox itself is a huge division, and loads of people are and have been responsible for everything that happens there, from the boss on down. When you consider that Xbox has been in terminal decline since the moment the Xbox One was revealed over 15 years ago, a sequence of interwoven events and trends that are the result of countless people's missteps and ineptitude, it sure seems weird to dedicate so much time in the story to the legacy of a single Black woman.</p><p>Unless, of course, you recognise the story for what it is: a chance to vent about Bond, orchestrated not by Warren (who is simply serving as the messenger here), but by every source inside Xbox who was so willing to speak to The Verge so soon after the events of last week. Gamers may not be entirely familiar with this kind of story, but if you're a sports fan, you'll know them all too well.</p><p>Here's a recent example of what I'm talking about: last year<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/12/tottenham-confirm-appointment-thomas-frank-new-manager?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Tottenham announced the signing of former Brentford boss Thomas Frank to be the club's new manager</u></a>, and they couldn't speak highly enough of him. Even as Spurs struggled through 2025 and into 2026, sliding ever closer to the relegation zone,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6891062/2025/12/15/thomas-frank-tottenham-future-lewis/?source=bsky_uk"> <u>club leadership publicly supported him</u></a>. Then, when results became untenable and the board finally decided it was time to sack him, well. Suddenly a deluge of stories hit the major sports papers, all purporting to explain just why Frank had been so terrible and why getting rid of him was such a great move, like<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1r1vgjo/one_source_told_telegraph_sport_on_thomas_frank/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>this pathetic expose in The Telegraph</u></a>, claiming Frank's "bizarre obsession" with rivals Arsenal "sealed his fate".</p><p>Spurs are a club that, one hilarious trophy win last season aside, have been on the slide for years now. Ownership has been useless, the board even more so. Their transfer dealings have been poor, meaning no matter how many players they sign or how many managers they go through, they've found themselves having slipped from regular Champions League contenders just a few years ago to<a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11675/13511026/tottenham-relegation-from-premier-league-a-real-possibility-after-north-london-derby-thrashing-by-arsenal?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>facing the serious threat of relegation from the Premier League</u></a>. The problems at Spurs run far deeper, and have been going on much longer, than the tenure of Thomas Frank.</p><p>Yet the second he was out the door, along came those stories, each claiming to have the inside scoop, to satisfy everyone's desire for scapegoats and answers, when all they were really doing was providing a chance for disgruntled insiders to air some dirty laundry, and for a failing institution to take advantage of the media to lay some blame at the feet of someone who was already out the door, instead of at their own.</p><p>I've little doubt there was frustration inside Xbox at Bond's tenure, and I've <em>no </em>doubt that folks are concerned about the new boss. But for the sources in the story to be so focused on Bond while sparing Spencer or anyone else tells you more about what's been happening behind the scenes at Xbox than the contents of the piece ever could.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-spider-man-universe-reboot-venom-morbius-kraven-2000673365</link>
            <guid>1445467</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tom Rothman, CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group, told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RIBjgm-DdY"><em>The Town with Matt Belloni</em></a> that Sony’s Spider-Man Universe isn’t dead, but it is, as Belloni put it, getting a “fresh reboot” with “new people.” This comes after the box-office and critical bombs of <em>Morbius</em>, <em>Madame Web</em>, and <em>Kraven the Hunter </em>over the last three years.</p> <p>The backlash to <em>Morbius</em> and <em>Madame Web</em> alone was enough for <a href="https://kotaku.com/kraven-the-hunter-spiderman-jc-chandor-1851707831"><em>Kraven the Hunter</em> director J.C. Chandor to plead before the film’s release</a>, “People have got to give us a chance and come out and support this film, and literally try to wash away some of the other stuff that’s happened. Give our film a chance.” But <em>Kraven</em> turned out to be just as bad as the others. Even the most successful films of the bunch, <em>Venom</em>, <em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/venom-last-dance-knull-explained-spider-man-marvel-1851647953"><em>Venom: The Last Dance</em></a>, have been embraced more for their unintentional camp than their actual quality.</p>

 <p>The reboot strategy is one that Sony has tried before with their Marvel characters, and it didn’t go particularly well last time. After producing three well-regarded Spider-Man movies directed by Sam Raimi between 2002 and 2007, the studio brought Marc Webb on to helm a reboot series in 2012. Only two out of the planned three movies were ever made. After that, Sony collaborated with Disney to bring Spider-Man into the massively successful Marvel Cinematic Universe, even though Sony owns the film rights to the character. It was, as Belloni said in the interview, “kind of a tail-between-the-legs moment to have to go to Disney and say, ‘Listen, we kind of ran this into the ground, we need you to bring this back.'”</p> <p>Rothman disputed Belloni’s accounting of how the Disney deal went down, arguing that the MCU crossover has been hugely successful for Sony, but it’s hard to ignore the evidence that Sony has struggled to figure out how to make a good comic book movie on its own. Rothman didn’t share any other details about what a rebooted SSU might look like.</p>

            <p>
Earlier this month, Discord said that they'd be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-roll-out-global-age-verification-system-including-an-age-inference-model-that-runs-in-the-background">rolling out a global age verification system</a> to which everyone and their mother responded by saying "thank you," except they didn't say thank. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/good-news-uk-discord-users-were-part-of-a-peter-thiel-linked-data-collection-experiment">A little bit later on</a>, they also shared word of an experiment being run in relation to this new system and policy that involved an identity detection firm backed by a fund directed by Palantir chairman Peter Thiel called Persona, which apparently potentially stored any ID documentation you submitted to them for up to seven days. Now, after more and more pushback, Discord have put out a statement that still probably doesn't say what you wish it would.
</p>
<p>
For starters, the <a href="https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing">statement</a> said that the chat service "should have provided more detail about our intentions and how the process works," and acknowledged that the age verification system didn't land particularly very well, though the buck stopped short of actually apologising. In fact, the post goes on to explain that Discord still plan to go ahead with introducing this system, but again stressed that "90% of users will never need to verify their age to continue using Discord exactly as they do today."
</p>
<p>
They explain, "This is powered in part by our internal safety systems, which can already make an age determination for many adult users without any user action. We'll publish the methodology behind this in a technical blog post before we launch globally." For the remaining 10%, you will apparently be given options "designed to tell us only your age and never your identity." These include more verification options like doing so by submitting credit card options, though more alternatives will also be added.
</p>
<p>
It's also important to note that Discord say the test they ran with Persona was only "limited," and that after conducting it they've opted to not work with them after all, saying that "all data was deleted after completing verification. We’ve set a new bar for any partner offering facial age estimation, including that it must be performed entirely on-device, meaning your biometric data never leaves your phone. Persona did not meet that bar." Discord also committed to "full transparency on vendors" it works with, though ultimately, none of this is really the point, as people mostly just don't want to have to submit any kind of sensitive details at all just to talk about a bit of smut and the like with their friends.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of this, the global rollout of Discord's age verification system has been delayed to the latter half of 2026, so you've still got a while to mull over it all. What a polava.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-now-pve-first-tactical-shooter/</link>
            <guid>1445434</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/madfinger-games/" id="2643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MADFINGER Games</a> continues to evolve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gray-zone-warfare/" id="1330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gray Zone Warfare</a> in a strong and sensible direction. The open-world tactical shooter has undergone more than a few changes in recent history, and it’s becoming increasingly impressive with each new drop.</p>



<p>Recently, the team made an update to the game’s identity on Steam, including a term in the product description that’s not seen too often in the tactical shooter space. Gray Zone Warfare, the sumptuous sandbox shooter, is now ‘PvE-first’.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-does-pve-first-mean-for-gray-zone-warfare">What Does PvE-First Mean for Gray Zone Warfare?</h2>



<p>Once upon a time, Gray Zone Warfare was described as an extraction shooter, with a twist. Players could run into and out of the game world, unbound by any kind of timer-based limitations, and explore the diverse, lush setting of Lamang at will. It bore classic trademarks of the extraction genre, but it was so much more than that.</p>



<p>That concept was recognized by MADFINGER <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-no-longer-extraction-shooter-label/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a pivot last year</a>, with the team officially dubbing Gray Zone Warfare a tactical MMOFPS. It was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’re not heading back to base nearly as often. Tasks can be turned in from the field. Your time is spent moving from COP to COP, POI to POI. The world encourages staying out longer, discovering more, encountering more PvP—and staying immersed.</p>



<p>You’re not jumping in and out of isolated raids. You’re living in this world. It’s a tactical MMOFPS. It’s persistent. It’s dangerous. It’s accessible—whether you’re new or a seasoned vet.</p>



<p>It might look like an extraction shooter on the surface, but it’s something different. Something of its own. That’s what makes it special.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>However,</strong> things have changed again, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2479810/Gray_Zone_Warfare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gray Zone Warfare</a> has a whole new identity:</p>



<h3 id="h-high-stakes-pve-first-open-world-tactical-shooter">High-Stakes PvE-First Open-World Tactical Shooter</h3>



<p>It’s a brilliant way to label everything the game offers in one sweep. It has the high-stakes mentality of an extraction shooter, the PvE-first focus that the developers are keen to flesh out, the open-world sandbox elements, and, above all else, it’s a <strong>tactical first-person shooter</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s borderline milsim, mixed in with survival mechanics.</p>



<p>The PvE-first element, as we’ve learned, is a concept that the studio’s CEO and Co-Founder, Marek Rabas, is keen to remain heavy on. There are some ‘amazing moments and stories’ to pull from the PvP world, and that’s not going anywhere in Gray Zone (and will be expanded on in due course), but the PvE push is now front and centre in this game.</p>



<p>In recent months, we’ve seen many more shooters lean more into the concept of PvE.</p>



<p>For instance, Escape from Tarkov is a couple of years deep into running a mirrored PvE platform that accommodates thousands of users. Elsewhere, ARC Raiders players never stop debating the potential for a PvE mode to surface in <strong>that </strong>extraction adventure title.</p>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare <strong>perfectly </strong>suits a PvE operating model, and it does little to take away from the game’s inherent challenge and risk profile. There’s every opportunity for you to run into an opposing faction and get into a firefight, but much of that tension is now centered entirely around AI enemies.</p>



<p>It’s very worth pointing out that, since the beginning, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pve-in-gray-zone-warfare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gray Zone’s ‘Joint Operations’</a> mode has facilitated 100% PvE combat…</p>







<p>Do you think it’s a win for Gray Zone’s developers to be focusing on PvE? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Avowed Doesn’t Have A Typical Romance Mechanic, But That Makes Its Romantic Moments Hit Even Harder]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/avowed-romance-mechanic-rpg-kai-2000673362</link>
            <guid>1445404</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In the lead-up to the February 2025 release of action RPG </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525"><i><span>Avowed</span></i></a><span>, developer Obsidian Entertainment warned players not to expect any romance in the game. “We are building thoughtful relationships with our companion characters,” game director Carrie Patel told </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidian-explains-why-avowed-wont-let-you-romance-your-companions"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> a full year before its release. “Ultimately, I personally am a fan of making [romance] an option, but I feel like if you’re going to do it, you really, really have to commit and make sure that you’re giving all to fulfilling that in a way that feels both true to the character, but also creates an engaging player experience. So not something we’re doing for </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, but I wouldn’t say never.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This didn’t come as much of a surprise; though there have been sporadic dalliances with romance in Obsidian’s back catalogue, most notably in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-of-eternity-ii-the-kotaku-review-1826397542"><i><span>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</span></i></a><span>, the company has largely eschewed the mechanic, even as it grew in popularity in both the genre and the industry as a whole. So it was a welcome surprise when it turned out that there was, in fact, romance in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>—but not in the way players would have expected.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> handles romance very differently from most other Western RPGs, and if players went into the game expecting the genre-typical smorgasbord of horny, fuckable party companions, they would have been sorely disappointed. Instead, there’s just one romance in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, and it’s composed of only a handful of lines of dialogue and a brief mention in the epilogue. The storyline is more about the romanceable character’s emotional growth and development than their physical attraction to the player character. </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> takes a mechanic that can often feel tacked-on and makes it an integral part of the story. It does exactly what Patel said a good video game romance should—and it’s a breath of fresh air compared to genre norms.</span></p> <h2><strong>How most Western RPGs handle romance</strong></h2> <p><span>We have one-time Western RPG powerhouse BioWare to thank for pioneering romance mechanics in the genre. The studio first introduced romanceable companions in 2000’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-ii-is-still-one-of-the-greatest-rpgs-ever-1278311582"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate II: Shadows of Amn</span></i></a><span>, and further refined their house style with the </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> franchises. A “BioWare-style RPG” has become shorthand for a particular type of game that emphasizes player choice through customizable blank-slate player characters, dialogue options, and branching storylines, and features a large cast of attractive NPCs who you can recruit to join your party and eventually romance.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>That “blank slate” approach to romance in RPGs eventually became the de-facto standard industrywide, with games like CD Projekt’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-the-kotaku-review-1845946628"><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i></a><span> and Larian Studios’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a><span> carrying on the tradition. The benefit of that approach is that it can be genuinely fun to blow off steam in between high-risk missions by exchanging witty, flirty banter with a hot companion. But there are drawbacks to that method, too. As Patel explained to </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-arent-there-romances-in-avowed-obsidian-explains"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a><span>, “The more you introduce romance as a mechanic, and the more that you build systems around it, and metrics, and ways for players to bolster and measure their affinity and affection level with other characters, the more it becomes something people engage with as a system rather than as a relationship.” Building an intimate relationship gets boiled down to completing a sidequest checklist, and it can make what should come across as a genuine connection between two characters feel hollow instead. So while BioWare-style RPGs have become known for their inclusion of romance mechanics, it’s pretty rare that the storylines that result from those mechanics actually feel romantic.</span></p>

 <h2><strong>What makes <i>Avowed</i> different</strong></h2> <p><span>In </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> you build your own custom character, an envoy from the Aedyran Empire sent to the lawless Living Lands to investigate rumors of a plague known as the Dreamscourge. In the Living Lands, you recruit four NPCs for your adventuring party, of which you can bring two at a time to explore with you.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>So far, so BioWare. But the companion chats at camp in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> never take a turn for the romantic. In most similar RPGs, a conversation between the player character and one of their companions about training together would probably be laced with innuendo—in fact, a story about how Turians train and prepare for battle is what leads into Garrus’ famous “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlZtNtzmZeY"><span>reach and flexibility</span></a><span>” line from </span><i><span>Mass Effect 2</span></i><span>. However, during an early conversation about training in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> between the protagonist and one of their companions, your responses are all focused on what you’d like to improve—learning how to take more damage, strike harder, or a little bit of everything. There’s no hamfisted flirting to be found.</span></p>

 <p><span>As Patel told </span><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/avowed-interview-2024"><i><span>Windows Central</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>’s companions are “characters who are really tied to the central story [of the game].” The first of those companions you encounter is Kai (voiced by Brandon Keener, who also voiced Garrus in the </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> series), an aumauan mercenary carrying a lot of baggage from a lifetime of running away. He was a deserter from the Rauatai Navy; he left his subsequent home, Thirdborn, six years ago and never returned, though he’s cagey on the details of his departure. He’s also got some unfinished business with Tama, the deceased leader of his former mercenary squad, that he’s hesitant to talk about. His backstory, which he slowly reveals to you over a series of contemplative fireside chats, is integral to the plot. It’s also a romance.</span></p> <p><span>Over the course of the game, as Kai opens up about Tama, you can help guide him to the realization that Tama was in love with him—and he was also in love with Tama. Though it’s obvious to the player that, before his death, Tama tried to subtly express his feelings to Kai (there’s a full-on oil painting of Kai in Tama’s house, for fuck’s sake), Kai was too oblivious to pick up on his hints. When the game’s main story eventually takes the party to Thirdborn, it forces Kai to confront why he left and never returned: He walked away from Tama when he was on his deathbed, promising to return quickly, but he never did, because he couldn’t stand the thought of watching Tama die.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s only after you help Kai deal with that trauma that something approaching a romance mechanic kicks in. You can tell Kai that you have feelings for him, though, in typical Kai fashion, you need to fully spell it out for him before he understands what you mean—his obliviousness still runs strong, and you get a good sense of how infuriating it must have been for Tama over the years. Kai’s response to your confession ties back into his personal growth; he tells you that he never thought he’d be able to feel close to someone again after losing Tama, and eventually adds, “If you want to be with me after everything you’ve seen—and if you still feel that way once we’ve finished our journey…I want that, too.” And that’s it. There’s no sex scene, not even an embrace or a kiss. Just a quiet acknowledgement that, because Kai was able to deal with his trauma, he’s ready to move on.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>If you choose to romance Kai, you get a short bit of exposition in the epilogue that reflects that as well. “But the most unexpected boon of Kai’s adventures is the romance that blossoms with the envoy. He’d thought his chance at love died with Tama, but after the envoy helped him accept that loss, he realized he’d found another chance with someone who saw him, knew him, and loved him as he was. He wouldn’t let this one pass him by,” it says.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking to </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span>, Patel explained the hidden romance option. “There’s nothing that says ‘hey this is a thing that can happen’—there’s no system that’s going to track your status with them—but if you’re doing the kinds of things that you would do if you were interested in this character, you’ll probably come across the option by the end of the game. And it should feel natural, organic, and surprising,” she said. By removing the “mechanic” part of the romance mechanic, tying it to Kai’s emotional growth, and making it less about the NPC as a vehicle for pure fantasy indulgence, </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> does something truly unexpected: It incorporates romance in a BioWare-style RPG in a way that’s actually romantic.</span></p>

            <p>
I think on the offset, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/looking-for-fael">Looking for Fael</a> isn't a difficult game to pitch, but perhaps one that takes a second to get to grips with. You play as, well, not Fael, but his roommate, who, as you may have guessed, is looking for Fael after receiving a strange voicemail message where he says he is somehow lost in your apartment. What follows is then a reality bending <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game where the world itself is a puzzle, but also you have to play a spin (pun intended) on the objectively best game ever made, Tetris.
</p>
<p>
A thing to note about Looking for Fael is that it is a game that wants you to take notes. It suggests as such before its demo kicks off, and you quickly find that that will be the case, given that your first task is figuring out the code to your post box (though, memory will likely save you at this stage). Upon opening this box, you are greeted with an off-brand Game Boy, a Game Leaf in this instance, which you can then dock in at various points to play games of sort-of Tetris.
</p>
<p>
By this I mean you have a set list of blocks that you push out from pre-determined sides of the screen, which then have to fall on particular points to complete the puzzle. After doing this a handful of times, a doohicky lights up and you light up some squares and bam, what was the hallway outside of your apartment is now also your apartment, but different, stranger, covered in greenery. You catch a glimpse of the outside world, and where a vaguely European city was before is now simply an endless sky.
</p>
<p>
You complete a couple more Tetris puzzles, each steadily increasing in difficulty, requiring you to use that part of your brain that helps you pack your suitcase again after you bought way too much stuff in that once in a lifetime trip to Japan, and you bend reality to enter yet another apartment. And more and more puzzles within the world itself pop up, varying in nature and complexity, like one where you have to pause various documentaries about stick insects at just the right time.
</p><p>
Quite quickly Looking for Fael called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witness">The Witness</a> to mind, albeit without the obvious baggage attached to that one. It's a sort of escape room of a game, one where you really need to love both Tetris and potentially obtuse puzzles with equal intensity. I don't know if I can bring that intensity, but I'm certainly quite curious about the full thing.
</p>
<p>
It's filled with such lovely art too, various boxes of faux Gundam strewn about the place, one room which has a mixture of fan art of literally Samus Aran, Aerith Gainsborough, Goku, and more alongside fictitious posters and comics that I desperately wish were real. Completely unrelated to this, I found a lot of joy in seeing European plug sockets. How often do you see those in games! Silly, I know, but it tickled me in just the right way.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the demo for Looking for Fael is available as part of this season's Steam Next Fest, so you can have a gander, or just wishlist it, on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521170/Looking_For_Fael/">here</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/charity-steam-pc-games-bundle-best-deal-2026-fps-cultic-selaco-boltgun-2000673339</link>
            <guid>1445344</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new digital charity bundle available for the next two weeks includes some fantastic boomer shooters like <em>Selaco, Cultic, </em>and <em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun. </em>And the whole bundle costs just $17.</p> <p>Over the last few years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/boomer-shooter-retro-fps-dusk-ion-fury-prodeus-1851144571">we’ve seen an influx of retro-inspired first-person shooters</a>, often referred to online as boomer shooters. Not all of them are great. Some are downright terrible. I know, I’ve played a lot of them. Sure, they all include shotguns and fast-moving action. But not all of them feature tight combat and satisfying gunplay. Don’t worry, though, because <a href="https://www.digiphile.co/collections/boomer-shooter-blueprint">Digiphile’s new charity boomer shooter Steam bundle, which is available until March 10</a>, contains only certified bangers.</p> <p>Here’s the full list of what’s in the bundle:</p> <ul> <li><em>Selaco</em></li> <li><em>I Am Your Beast</em></li> <li><em>Mullet Madjack</em></li> <li><em>Beyond Citadel</em></li> <li><em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em></li> <li><em>Incision</em></li> <li><em>Cultic</em></li> </ul> <p>All of this for just $17 is wild. You could pick any two of these games and they would be worth that price. But all seven for less than $20 is one of the best deals I’ve seen in a long time. Here are a few of my favorites from this bundle and what I had to say about them previously.</p>

 <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/selaco-gzdoom-engine-fps-steam-review-early-access-1851513067"><em>Selaco</em></a>, a boomer shooter built using the bones of <em>Doom</em></strong><em> – “Selaco </em>is a more polished, well-made, and fun FPS than some AAA shooters I’ve played in recent years developed by massive teams using modern engines and big budgets. And this thing is technically in early access! In fact, I bet as you play&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>you’ll quickly forget all about its&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>origins as you run around its large, hand-crafted campaign maps filled with different enemies, puzzles, and loads of secrets.”</li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40000-40k-boltgun-review-retro-fps-shooter-1850466690"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em></a>, a gory retro shooter with modern ideas</strong> – “<em>Boltgun&nbsp;</em>is crunchy and retro in all the right ways, with sliders letting you make the game more or less pixelated or modern-looking. You can, for example, turn off some of the fancier lighting effects and lower the resolution to create a very early ‘90s shooter feel, or turn all that stuff up and get something that looks more like a late-PS1-era shooter.”</li> <li><strong><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mullet-madjack-anime-fps-roguelike-hades-review-steam-1851475865">Mullet Madjack</a>,</em> an FPS all about killing rich robots</strong> – “In 2024, billionaires and AI have become some of our biggest enemies. So it’s nice to have&nbsp;<em>Mullet Madjack</em>, a game that lets me mow down a bunch of rich-robot assholes using assault rifles and shotguns. It’s even better that the game is one of 2024’s best, thanks to its solid world-building, awesome visuals, and incredibly fast action. The future might suck, but at least it’ll be fun!”</li> </ul> <p>So yeah, great bundle of games. <a href="https://www.digiphile.co/collections/boomer-shooter-blueprint">And the charity that this bundle is supporting</a> is all about helping protect whales and dolphins. Get some great boomer shooters and save a few whales? What more could you ask for?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>You might think holding playtests or server slams or betas or whatever technical term you want to call "a chance to play a game before it's officially out" for multiple games in the same weekend is a strange idea... I agree, but that's exactly what PlayStation is doing this weekend with two of its upcoming first-party games. Specifically, Bungie is launching a server slam this weekend for Marathon, starting at 10 a.m. PT on Thursday, February 26, and ending on Monday, March 2, at 10 a.m. PT, while Guerrilla Games is holding a closed playtest for Horizon Hunters Gathering starting Friday, February 27, and running through Sunday, March 1.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the third-person action co-op gameplay of Horizon Hunter is quite a bit different from the first-person extraction co-op gameplay of Marathon, but at the end of the day, these are two first-party multiplayer games and it seems a bit odd to pit them against each other in the same weekend like this.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWwXSb7dlnQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWwXSb7dlnQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Considering <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/19/marathon-launches-in-early-march">Marathon launches March 5</a>, it makes sense to have a server slam the final weekend before its release – it gives Bungie the chance to test its servers and players the opportunity to see if the Destiny studio's vivid and mysterious take on the extraction shooter genre is for them. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/05/guerrilla-games-reveals-its-cooperative-horizon-multiplayer-game-horizon-hunters">With Horizon Hunters Gathering having only just been announced earlier this month</a>, with no release date in sight, it's strange to land on the same weekend for a playtest as Bungie's server slam. Alas, that's what's happening, so you, the player, have the opportunity to try out two first-party games for free this weekend.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bungie's Marathon Server Slam Details</h3>

<p>As for what to expect in this weekend's Marathon server slam, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam) with crossplay and cross-save enabled. This server slam is what Bungie is calling an open preview, which means anyone can try it out, unlike Guerrilla Games' closed playtest for Horizon Hunters Gathering (more on that in a bit).&nbsp;</p><p>If you play Marathon this weekend, you have the chance to earn the following in-game rewards, and each reward earned will transfer into the full game if you pick it up:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Complete the first mission to unlock the Standard Arrival Cache, which includes the following:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Standard implants (6x)</li><li>Standard Runner shell cores (4x)</li><li>Standard weapon chip mods (4x)</li><li>Weapons: Overrun and Hardline</li></ul><p><strong>Reach Runner Level 10 to unlock the Enhanced Arrival Cache (Green), which includes the following:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Enhanced implants (6x)</li><li>Enhanced Runner shell cores (2x for each shell, 12x total)</li><li>Enhanced weapon chip mods (4x)</li><li>Weapons: Enhanced Magnum and Enhanced Hardline</li></ul><p><strong>Reach Runner Level 30 to unlock the Deluxe Arrival Cache (Blue), which includes the following:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Deluxe and Enhanced implants (3x each, 6x total)</li><li>Deluxe and Enhanced Runner shell cores (1x for each shell, 12x total)</li><li>Deluxe and Enhanced weapon chip mods (2x each, 4x total)</li><li>Weapons: Deluxe Magnum and Enhanced Volley Rifle</li><li>Backpack: Enhanced Base Backpack</li></ul><p>Bungie says the emblem, player banner, and loot rewards will be waiting for you when Marathon launches. As for what you'll actually be doing, you can "infil" into two zones – Perimeter and Dire Marsh – as well as take on contracts for five factions in the Marathon universe. You can also try out five of the six Runner shells that will be available at launch.</p><p>When the game launches (and when Season 1 goes live), two more zones to infil into – Outpost and Cryo Archive – will be available, along with the sixth Runner shell. Plus, full progression for all six of the game's factions will go live, as will Ranked Mode and "other secrets and surprises."&nbsp;</p><p>The Marathon server slam begins on Thursday, February 26, at 10 a.m. PT, and ends on Monday, March 2, at 10 a.m. PT.</p><h3>Guerrilla Games' Horizon Hunters Gathering Closed Playtest</h3>

<p>Unlike Bungie's Marathon server slam, the Horizon Hunters Gathering closed playtest will not be open to everyone – you must sign up for PlayStation's beta test program <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/beta-program-at-playstation/">here</a> and hope you are selected to participate.&nbsp;</p><p>While the Horizon Hunters Gathering playtest begins on Friday, February 27, it will only be playable for North American players from 4 p.m. PT to 7 p.m. PT, and from 7 p.m. CET to 10 p.m. CET for EU players on that day, as well as Saturday, February 28, and Sunday, March 1. It will be available for selected players on both PlayStation 5 and PC (via Steam), and will only support the English language.&nbsp;</p><p>In this closed playtest, three playable hunters – Axle, Rem, and Sun – will be available to try out within two game modes: Machine Incursion (Normal and Hard) and Cauldron Descent (Normal). The playtest will be set within one explorable environment, which is Colorado Springs, and will feature access to The Gathering, which Guerrilla Games calls a shared social space with campsite customization.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike the Marathon server slam, there won't be any rewards to earn from this playtest, which makes sense considering we have no idea when Horizon Hunters Gathering is launching.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Nonetheless, that's everything you need to know about upcoming opportunities to play Marathon and Horizon Hunters Gathering this weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/05/guerrilla-games-reveals-its-cooperative-horizon-multiplayer-game-horizon-hunters">check out the Horizon Hunters Gathering reveal trailer</a>, and then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/19/marathon-launches-in-early-march">check out the Marathon release date trailer</a> after that.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you hoping to hop into either of these games this weekend? Let us know in the comments below!</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/24/you-can-play-two-upcoming-playstation-first-party-games-early-this-weekend]]></content:encoded>
