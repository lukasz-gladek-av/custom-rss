<p>Before we get into this week's What Are You Playing, let's recap the major news from the past seven days. The biggie was a tasty slice of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> info from a new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-bananas-interview-with-the-developers-of-donkey-kong-bananza">IGN</a> interview, where we learnt the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananzas-director-and-producer-have-been-confirmed">director and producer</a>, its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-like-mario-kart-world-was-initially-planned-for-switch-1">Switch 1 origins</a>, and how the team got its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dk-bananza-devs-needed-to-know-more-about-donkey-kong-so-they-went-to-miyamoto">DK inspiration</a>. Only one week to go!</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it was revealed that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-will-discontinue-switch-game-vouchers-entirely-in-2026">Switch Game Voucher scheme</a> will be wrapping up next year, we interrogated everyone's experiences with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-how-are-your-download-speeds-on-switch-2">Switch 2 download speeds</a>, shared our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/three-laps-two-players-one-vegas-jumpsuit-10-things-wed-love-to-see-added-to-mario-kart-world">wishes</a>, and witnessed the birth of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/crocs-launching-first-ever-collaboration-with-animal-crossing-out-next-month">Animal Crossing X Crocs collaboration</a> (insert cheers/boos here).</p>

<p>Now then, let's have a look at what everyone's up to this weekend.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:184756,184745 @ 1752314430 -->
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>It’s all about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> this weekend. A few caveats aside, playing this collection was like that moment when Anton Ego tastes the ratatouille and is mentally transported back to his childhood. Wonderful stuff.</p>
<p>I’m keen to play a bit more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a>. Most of the time, when I’m done reviewing a game, it kinda just gets left on the dusty, digital shelf never to be played again, but there’s something about this game that keeps bringing me back. Have a good one, folks!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'm on a retro buzz this weekend. I've still got the Wii set up after a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/rock_band">Rock Band</a> bender I went on a few months back, and I've been meaning to blast through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/batman_the_brave_and_the_bold">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a> with the kids. With the DC vibes in the air at the moment, it seems like a perfect time. I also want to show them GameCube <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/donkey_kong_jungle_beat">Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</a> with the bongos, and once they're in bed, I've got half a mind to fire up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/sin_and_punishment_star_successor">Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor</a>, a game I picked up in the last few years but didn't get around to playing properly.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>By the time you're reading this, folks, I'll be trekking up through the gorgeous hills and paths of the Isle of Skye. Not the most relaxing holiday, but maybe the most beautiful? I'll report back in a few weeks.</p>
<p>So, not much game time! But on the train rides from London, Edinburgh, and back to the south, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> is my trusty friend. Will I ever play anything else again? Well... you know what's coming next week. Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Felix Sanchez, Video Producer</h2>
<p>This weekend, I intend to finish <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/phoenix_wright_ace_attorney_trials_and_tribulations">Ace Attorney: Trials and Tribulations</a>! I'm at the last case, so I'm excited to see how it all wraps up after some brilliant cases in this third game.</p>
<p>I'm also probably gonna be playing some Mario Kart World, and practising some of the courses in time trials with my brother. And if I'm really feeling it, I'll free roam a bit around in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, which has piqued my interest with the Switch 2 edition.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still cracking on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, polishing off a few more Moons before my mind goes bananas next week, and it is <em>still</em> wonderful. It's been eight years, but I still have a little giggle every time I see Mario take control of a photo-realistic dinosaur, and I don't think I'll ever stop.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'd like to squeeze in a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon</a> to relive some of my PSP days and remind myself why it's taken me the best part of 20 years to get those damn chants out of my head.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Kamurochō is on fire as I step into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> Chapter 13. However, I made the silly mistake of making an avatar for the 30 fps World Tour mode in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>. I was not expecting to be so hooked on this mode and will continue Chapter 8 as a mix-and-match of special moves and clothing accessories. The throwback lore of the series is delicious, I’ve even found a Final Fight arcade in an alley and fought Retsu from the original Street Fighter!</p>
<p>Super happy to be wrong about the western eShop availability of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_super_dimension_fortress_macross_ii">Arcade Archives Super Dimension Fortress MACROSS II</a>, which will ensure my arcade stick will see action over the weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/robocop_rogue_city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a> is also super fun! I'll make sure to make some progress on that front as well, before everything inevitably goes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a> next week.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend I'm playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wilmot_works_it_out">Wilmot Works It Out</a>. I do like it when I have one VERY DRAMATIC game with EXTREMELY HIGH STAKES and another one that's more like "this frog needs to make a cup of tea!" Wilmot Works It Out was fantastic for calming my nerves on a plane journey after one cancellation and three delays, whereas Hundred Line is the second-slowest burn game I've played (after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_in_fata_morgana_dreams_of_the_revenants_edition">House in Fata Morgana</a>). It has a lot of lulls in-between story beats. But that's okay! I think it's about to blow up big time, anyway...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a new report, the Need for Speed franchise may have been shelved by Electronic Arts. The news comes from a rather unlikely place, albeit theoretically trustworthy all the same. </p>



<p>Matthew Everingham, one of the contributors to the website <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speedhunters</a>, relayed the following message <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DL8zRnrTSwl/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Instagram</a>:</p>



<p><em>Speedhunters is on ice. EA shelved Need For Speed, and that means no more funding for the site.</em></p>



<p><em>Grateful for everything — the trips, the stories, the lifelong mates. I'm still shooting, just shifting gears into more video.</em></p>



<p>For those unfamiliar with Speedhunters, it is 'an international collective of photographers, writers and drivers with a shared passion for uncovering the world's most exciting car culture stories.' It was seemingly funded by Electronic Arts, for some reason, and it hasn't been updated in over three months, with the last post now dated April 8, 2025.</p>



<p>Truth be told, this probably doesn't come as a complete shock to Need for Speed fans. The series has gone through a series of middling releases, especially between 2015 and 2019, where the three games made 'solo' by Ghost Games all flopped. 2022's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/need-for-speed-unbound/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Need for Speed Unbound</a> was co-developed by Criterion Games and Codemasters and fared much better, but still didn't produce good enough sales to warrant a sequel, it seems. </p>



<p>Last we heard, in September 2023, Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/criterion-games-added-to-ea-entertainment-to-work-on-next-battlefield-and-new-need-for-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved</a> Criterion Games to the EA Entertainment group so that they could work on the next Battlefield as well as a new entry in the racing game franchise. It's possible that the project wasn't coming along well, or perhaps EA simply decided that they should focus solely on Battlefield 6, where <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they are helping with both single player and multiplayer content</a>.</p>



<p>After all, Need for Speed doesn't really compare with Battlefield in terms of relevance to Electronic Arts; to give you an idea, the publisher is <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apparently hoping to reach 100 million players for Battlefield 6</a> somehow. A lofty task, but not completely impossible should the game turn out to be a massive success, whereas racing games are way more niche - even the most successful in recent years, Forza Horizon 5, 'only' reached 45 million so far, and that's counting Game Pass players as well.</p>



<p>In other Need for Speed news, EA has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-endings-need-for-speed-rivals-online-support-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Rivals, the 2013 game co-developed by Criterion and Ghost, will end its online support on October 7, 2025.</p>

<p>Launching in Japan this month</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ef273953df9f5/ys-x-proud-nordics.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nihon Falcom, NIS America</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2's packing a lot more horsepower than the original system, and as a result, a lot of games and series can now ship with higher resolutions and improved performance. With this in mind, the upcoming release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> will apparently support up to 120fps on Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<p>This information comes from Japanese outlet <a href="https://s.inside-games.jp/article/2025/07/11/169368.html">Inside Games (via RPG Site)</a>, with the source reporting there'll be a special mode to prioritise performance, where players can apparently experience "smoother movements" thanks to the higher frame rate. The default performance is said to be 60fps.</p>
<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics is scheduled to launch on the Switch in Japan at the end of this month and is an "upgraded version" of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_x_nordics">Ys X: Nordics</a> including new story, settings and more. If we hear any significant updates or anything about a local release, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>This follows the release of Ys X: Nordics locally last October on the Switch, with a demo also available on the eShop.</p>

<p>Explore a vast underground world—by smashing your way through it!</p>
<p>Bash through just about anything with the raw power of Donkey Kong! Crash through walls, carve tunnels with your fists, punch straight down into the ground, and even tear off chunks of terrain to swing around and throw in groundbreaking exploration—the more you smash, the more areas open up for you to move through.</p>
<p>Join DK and his companion, Pauline, as they delve deep underground—and discover that this subterranean world is a lot more than it seems on the surface. Uncover a variety of environments such as arid canyons, lush forests, and frigid tundra as you peel back the world’s layers!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s an old idea that second efforts generally aren’t as good as the first. It’s called the sophomore slump, and there are a dozen reasons for it. Sophomore students don't care as much as freshmen; bands have less time to write, practice, and record a second album than the “breakout” hit they worked on for years before anyone knew who they were; athletes who have exceptional rookie years regress to the mean; and so on. There’s no denying the power of new car smell. I think part of the reason College Football 25 popped off as hard as it did (and trust me if you’re unsure: it <em>popped off</em>) was it’d been more than a decade since NCAA 14 and people really, <em>really </em>wanted a new game based on college football. It didn’t hurt that it was also a good game, but the yearly “it’s the same game as last year” fatigue of the sports genre hadn’t set in yet. That makes College Football 26 the real test.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll be honest, reader: I haven’t had a ton of time with this sequel yet (I've been busy finishing up my review of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mecha-break-review"><u>Mecha Break</u></a>, which I thought was pretty great), so these impressions are going to be pretty light. One of the things I’m interested in as I play more is how this car handles after we’ve put some miles on her, and if it falls into the same slump so many games, bands, and students have hit before it. But while that remains to be seen, I’m having a pretty good time so far. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of that is College Football 26 is built on a really firm foundation. College Football 25 was a good game, and it still has that infectious spirit and sense of tradition that made it a nice change of pace from the more straight-laced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-review">Madden</a>. From what I’ve seen, College Football 26 builds on that in good ways. One of the things I’m appreciating most is the Trophy Room, which tracks the real world trophies you’ll accumulate across your entire career, no matter what mode you’re in. It’s cool to see stuff like the Heisman Trophy, the Unitas Golden Arm Award, and the Orange Bowl Trophy collected in one place, and be able to learn about them, too. There’s a lot of history to college football, and I appreciate that EA has tried to capture that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, most of my time has been spent sneaking Quick Play games in where I can, so I haven’t really dug into College Football’s major modes too much yet (something I plan to remedy this weekend), but I have noticed some on-the-field stuff that makes me happy. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Better defenders can now make plays average ones can’t.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The little change I’m happiest about is to how defenders play the football when it’s in the air. If you’ve played College Football or Madden in the last few years, you’ve probably been intercepted (or had one of your defenders intercept) a pass that they can’t see without turning around. They’ve essentially got eyes in the back of their heads, and it could be very frustrating. EA has said they’ve changed that, and in my testing, it’s proven true. Now a defender has to see the ball to pick it off, and you’ll notice defenders turning their heads (or not) before the ball arrives. If they don’t, however, it doesn’t mean that defender can’t make a play on the ball. They can still swat it. It’s a good change because it’s two-fold: you now actually have a reason to swat the ball down instead of going for the pick every time, and better defenders can now make plays average ones can’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also a big fan of dynamic subs and custom zones for defenders. The former allows you to swap players on the field and not just on the playcall screen (thank <em>God</em>), though you may have to wait a play for the substitution to take effect, and the latter is the defensive version of last year’s custom stems for routes on offense. I enjoy the defensive game more than the offensive one, so being able to set where I want my zones to be on the field in real-time and not in a menu is welcome. I’m enjoying playing around with this stuff, and I imagine I’ll be using it quite a bit.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Football Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that I have the time to really dig into College Football 26, I am excited to see all the new additions to Road to Glory, where I’m really looking forward to being able to play my high school career, as well as all the new bells and whistles in Dynasty, which is where I imagine I’ll be spending most of my time. But the on-field stuff is where it counts. I can’t say yet if EA has avoided the sophomore slump with College Football 26, but I’m going into this year optimistic, and that’s not nothing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-26-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>Speaking to Bloomberg, co-director (and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/danganronpa_decadence">Danganronpa</a> creator) Kazutaka Kodaka has revealed the title is "selling pretty well" at this point, and although no figures are attached, he goes on to mention how he no longer sees "bankruptcy as a serious future" for the team.

<p>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy made its debut in April and is currently a Switch console exclusive, with the title also available on Valve's Steam service for PC. The developer has already spoken about how it has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-hundred-line-director-has-insanely-ambitious-ideas-for-the-game">some ridiculously ambitious ideas</a> for the game going forward, but it was all riding on the success of its launch.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy">we reviewed The Hundred Line here</a> on Nintendo Life, we called it an "excellent" tactical RPG with a well-written and compelling story, as well as strong and strategic gameplay, an attractive art style, and passionate voice work. So, if you're a fan of this kind of experience, it's well worth a look.</p>

Since last week, Cleveland and Krafton have been taking shots at one another in statements to the public, with the founder and his peers now filing a lawsuit against the company that bought their studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The escalation began on July 10, 2025 with a statement from Krafton addressed to the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> player community where the company accused Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill of "abandoning the responsibilities" involved with developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">"Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as game dame director and technical director...but both declined to do so," the company wrote.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pretty-girl-horse-racing-game-%E2%80%98uma-musume%E2%80%99-is-engrossing-and-weird-as-hell.1241937/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of my favorite things to do is explain niche gaming things to my befuddled husband. It’s the trade-off for listening to him talk about the Dodgers—while I love watching baseball the minutia of trades and injuries is hard for me to wrap my head around. So, late this week, as he was putting away leftovers from dinner I said to him: the game is about training pretty anime girls as race horses, but they’re also pop stars, so after they win a race they have to put on a concert. He gave me a look of deep love, and said, “that’s nice honey.”</p><p><em>Uma Musume</em> is a four year old mobile game that very recently was released in English, with a PC port on Steam. I remember when the game came out because I remember the trailer for the anime, which, frankly, looked like total dogshit.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Uma Musume Pretty Derby - | PV | 2018" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mjZ_nqn4-LU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>What do I know, though. Four years later, the <em>Uma Musume</em> anime has three seasons and a spin off. At the time of its release, the mobile gacha game <em>Love Live</em> was extremely popular, and the <em>Uma Musume</em> mobile game takes a lot of cues from it. Similar to <em>Love Live</em>, the main goal of the game is to level up your favorite anime-girl-horse-hybrid, which are called uma musume in the game. You do this by having them run through a set list of races in Career mode, with the player choosing which skills to train them in, and earning Perks that give them special abilities. Each time you play Career mode, you are able to choose two uma musume to be their “legacy,” allowing your character to inherit skills and perks from these characters. In short, you are breeding horse girls to create even better horse girls, so that they can achieve their dream of winning races and performing a concert literally right after.</p><p>All of this makes for surprisingly compelling gaming. Like <em>Princess Maker 2</em> and <em>Long Live The Queen</em>, or even dating sims like <em>Tokimeki Memorial</em>, micromanaging the way you raise your uma musume in order to get the best stats and perks becomes a logic puzzle to untangle. How do you manage her stress levels and energy so that you can get the most out of each and every day? And then, how do you create good legacies, so that each time you replay the game you can take your favorite uma musume even farther?</p><p>But I don’t think the gameplay is the reason for the game’s sudden popularity. It makes a surprisingly entertaining game to stream. The streamer Northernlion is usually credited with bringing the game to Twitch—I am watching his ruthlessly min-max his uma musume as I write this, and there are nearly 30,000 viewers in the category on Twitch. It makes for fun viewing because the races that your uma musume runs are actually viewable, and they have a dynamic announcer that narrates the race. There’s also just enough randomness in the game that the outcome of a race feels unpredictable. I have had moments where I was sure my uma musume was going to lose, only for her Perks to kick in at the last minute, giving her a last minute edge. It’s popularity on Twitch has led to Ludwig (from video games) organizing a tournament with streamers like Northernlion to race their best uma musume against each other.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="🐎ULTIMATE HORSE GIRL TOURNAMENT👧UMA MUSUME: PRETTY DERBY🐎FT. friends👧" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeb828RHOoU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The fandom that has cropped up around this game is also pretty entertaining, especially once you dig into the inherent silliness of the premise. Most recently, players have learned that fan favorite uma musume Gold Ship is based on <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/the-anime-horse-girl-whos-terrorizing-gacha-players-in-umamusume-is-based-on-a-real-chaotic-racing-horse-who-once-instantly-obliterated-12-billion-yen-in-betting-losses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an actual extremely violent race horse</a>. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get my husband into this game, but I enjoy the facial expression he makes when I explain it to him over dinner, and then politely listen as he talks to me about the status of the Dodgers’ various pitchers.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-disability-pride-last-of-us-forza"><h3>Why Disability Journalism In Games Needs To Evolve Beyond Marketing</h3></a><p>"We’ve conditioned ourselves to believe that we’re all one big happy family"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/outlier-best-mens-pants-indestructible-pants"><h3>All My Pants Are From Outlier Because They Appear To Live Forever</h3></a><p>Outlier makes pants that will survive the abuse of several presidential administrations.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/plushie-lawsuit-emotional-support-chicken-nuggets-what-do-you-meme"><h3>Plushie Maker Suing Over ‘Emotional Support Chicken Nuggets’</h3></a><p>It’s a pretty standard copyright and trademark infringement case, despite being about stuffed chicken nuggets.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Another new expansion for The Sims 4 has arrived, and Enchanted by Nature shakes up EA's long-running life sim in some big ways. That includes the introduction of a brand-new Fairy occult type, new methods for living off the land instead of in a house, and--most relevant to this article--an entirely new way for your Sims to get sick, called Ailments.</p><p dir="ltr">Where the standard illnesses in The Sims 4 don't pop up that often and are easily cured with generic medicine, Ailments are a whole new category of affliction that require specific cures--or help from a magical being with the ability to fix Ailments. Fortunately, Ailments are more annoying than dangerous--they really aren't severe enough to kill a Sim on their own--but their effects can be so disruptive that it's usually better to deal with them sooner than later.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_Ailments_work">How Ailments work</a><ul><li><a href="#What_to_do_when_your_Sim_has_an_Ailment">What to do when your Sim has an Ailment</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Crafting_your_own_Ailment_cures">Crafting your own Ailment cures</a></li><li><a href="#List_of_ailments">List of ailments</a></li></ul></div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4530514-thesims4solvingailmentsandwhatnot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530514" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4530514-thesims4solvingailmentsandwhatnot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530514"></a><figcaption>A Sim with an Ailment is usually easy to spot, since some symptoms will be visible on their skin.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4530514-thesims4solvingailmentsandwhatnot.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_Ailments_work">How Ailments work</h2><p dir="ltr">Ailments are contagious illnesses that can be caused by catching them from another Sim, being afflicted with one by a Fairy, or by being emotionally out of balance. The contagion factor is real, as hanging out in the same place as an infected Sim has a very good chance of giving your Sim an infection, too. And it's not just direct contact that'll get you--as with real illnesses, interacting with stuff that a sick person has touched can get your Sim sick too.</p><p dir="ltr">Likewise, being out of balance emotionally--this is indicated by the new balance meter in the Simology tab--makes it likely that your Sim will simply develop an Ailment without any extra help, but it also makes your Sim more vulnerable to catching something from another Sim. Likewise, being <em>in</em> balance fortifies your Sim against catching an Ailment naturally or from another Sim. Think of the emotional balance meter as a measure of your Sim's immune system.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="What_to_do_when_your_Sim_has_an_Ailment">What to do when your Sim has an Ailment</h3><p dir="ltr">There are several different ways that you can deal with your Sim's Ailment when they catch something. The first is to do nothing and let the Ailment run its course. While that may sound silly on its face, some of the ailments <em>do</em> have positive side effects--like Luck Magnet, which makes the infected Sim lucky by stealing luck from the other Sims around them. Gnome Lure, likewise, causes sentient garden gnomes to spawn like during Harvestfest. While I normally really don't like the gnomes, they've got a whole new use in the Enchanted by Nature expansion--Fairy Sims can enchant them with Fairy Dust to bring them to life.</p><p dir="ltr">So if you think the upside of the Ailment is worth the trouble, you can let it play itself out. Otherwise, there are four methods for ending an ailment immediately, all of which are relatively simple:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Use your phone to visit a naturopath, who will cure your Sim for 1,500 Simoleons</li><li dir="ltr">Ask any fairy to cure the Ailment--though fairies <em>cannot</em> cure <em>themselves</em> through magic.</li><li dir="ltr">"Manifest" a cure by visiting Moondrop Spring in the Everdew neighborhood of Innisgreen</li><li dir="ltr">Make your own cure at an apothecary table</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Crafting_your_own_Ailment_cures">Crafting your own Ailment cures</h2><p dir="ltr">Crafting Ailment cures is a relatively easy process because they require only common ingredients that you can find without much difficulty, That's because Ailment cures are the first things your Sim learns to create when they learn the apothecary skill--the Ailment cures require level 1 or 2, so there's no grind involved. Which is a very good thing because even though Fairies can magically cure <em>other</em> Sims, they can't do that with Ailments that they themselves are afflicted with.</p><p dir="ltr">To gain the apothecary skill, a Sim just need to use any apothecary table to "Study Apothecary Cures," and then after a moment they'll be able to craft some Ailment cures--and since the rest only require skill level 2, it'll take just a few more moments of messing around with the apothecary table before your Sim can craft the rest of them.</p><p dir="ltr">And since these cures are low-level recipes, their ingredients are incredibly easy to find by casually foraging anywhere by clicking on any patch of grass in any Sims 4 world, or by purchasing the ingredients using the option on the apothecary table. None of the ingredients are expensive, so buying them shouldn't be a problem for folks who want to get right to it.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="List_of_ailments">List of ailments</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Burning Passion:</strong> Makes the infected Sim very flirty, and also very likely to occasionally burn nearby objects</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Creation Impulse:</strong> Gives a Dazed moodlet, while also making the infected Sim better at crafting things.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Emotional Void:</strong> Dampens the infected Sim's emotions, and will also passively do the same to any nearby Sims.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Gnome Lure:</strong> Makes gnomes spawn near the infected Sim</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Greenie Meanie:</strong> Makes the infected Sim simultaneously very good at gardening and very cranky.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Luck Magnet:</strong> Makes the infected Sim lucky at the expense of those around them.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Simoleon Fever:</strong> Makes the infected Sim cough up money.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Sonic Sinuses:</strong> Their sneezes are so powerful that they occasionally break things, but the Sim has improved handiness and can fix things easier.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Green Ronin Publishing is in a serious legal debacle. The tabletop developer of <em>Mutants and Masterminds</em> is caught in a dire scenario regarding its distributor, Diamond Comic, filing for bankruptcy. One that can lead to hundreds of thousands of dollars lost, and the company potentially closing its doors for good.</p>

<h2>The Green Ronin Publishing Legal Defense Fund</h2>

<p>Green Ronin Publishing's co-owners Nicole Lindroos and Troy Hewitt aptly explain their situation in a recently opened <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-green-ronin-in-critical-legal-defense" rel="nofollow">GoFundMe page</a>. Earlier this year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/parent-company-of-alliance-game-distributors-files-for-bankruptcy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Diamond Comic Distributors</a> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which has severely impacted over 100 independent publishers, including Alliance Game Publishers and Green Ronin.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/green-ronin-publishing-mutants-and-masterminds-artwork.jpg?itok=rTBAhV3p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/green-ronin-publishing-mutants-and-masterminds-artwork.jpg?itok=-9QQB9Ql 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>According to Green Ronin Publishing, Diamond is attempting to use a legal technicality to claim ownership of millions of dollars' worth of consigned inventory. Inventory that can be liquidated to pay off Diamond Comic Distributors' debt. The problem is that among that consigned inventory is unpaid product that Green Ronin owns.</p>

<p>This has resulted in several major issues for the company. First, it means hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of tabletop products they own may get sold without their input. Second, since Diamond Comic was the company's main book distributor, it will vastly slow down the printing of their latest TTRPG books, <em>The Fifth Season</em> and <em>The Expanse RPG</em>. For a modest tabletop company, those are two major blows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The banks are stopping at nothing to wring every last dollar out of Diamond - including taking several hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Green Ronin product to sell in order to pay Diamond’s debts - but they can't do that, and we've got a legal agreement that says as much. Now, we just need to secure a law firm to represent us in the courts.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The current goal of Green Ronin's GoFundMe page is $28,000. The funds will go towards covering escalating legal fees for fighting Diamond's claim in bankruptcy court. These fees will include attorney retainers, court filing fees, and pursuing every avenue to recover and protect Green Ronin's assets.&nbsp;</p>

Too Kyo Games was founded in 2017 after Kodaka and co-founder Kotaro Uchikoshi left Spike Chunsoft following the success of the <em>Danganronpa </em>and <em>Zero Escape </em>franchises. In the years since, Too Kyo Games has released several projects that captured the individual leads’ creative styles, but <em>The Hundred Line </em>certainly feels like more of a melding of the minds than anything else the company has put out. It has <em>Danganronpa</em>’s signature school life social sim elements, and then its second half reveals an elaborate, multi-route branching storyline that can lead to one of 100 endings like a power-boosted <em>Zero Escape</em>. For such a small team, it was a wildly ambitious project, and that’s why it took five long years of development and some financial favors to finish. Now, Kodaka says that the game is selling “pretty well,” and he doesn’t see bankruptcy “as a serious future” for the company.</p><p>So now what? Too Kyo Games has put out its dream game and it’s doing well. Never one to shy away from his ambitions, Kodaka says he wants to extend <em>The Hundred Line</em>’s life for another decade by adding new storylines with patches and expansions, almost like a live-service game.</p><p>“I tried to aim this game to be like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> or <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em>,” Kodaka told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “I want it to be the open world of ‘scenario’ games.”</p><p><em>The Hundred Line </em>starts out with a pretty standard visual novel structure. You play as a squad of high school students forced to defend an academy from alien invaders in an effort to protect a weapon hidden within its walls—the key to humanity’s survival—for 100 days. After those three months and change are up, some other stuff we won’t spoil goes down that puts the game on wildly divergent paths, with each route helmed by different writers. As a result, every path is markedly different than the others, though there is one route that unveils the game’s whole truth if you know how to find it. Each of these routes has multiple endings, some of which are obviously “conclusions” while others read like “bad ends.” Given the buck-wild directions some of these routes go, it doesn’t seem like much is off-limits in terms of genre and tone for <em>The Hundred Line</em>. So if the studio pulls from a rotating stable of writers, I can see the game staying fresh for several years. Now that Too Kyo Games is in a better position to support its latest release, it feels safe to hope for the game’s future, as well as the studio’s. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-too-kyo-bankrupt-1851786150]]></content:encoded>

Assembling an entirely Acceleration-focused kart and driver can be a detriment in races with longer stretches of road. Someone with a higher Speed stat will pass you eventually.</p><p>There is a lot of nuance as to what karts and characters are the model pairing for each track, if not the best overall combo. Acceleration is arguably the ideal kart stat for most players, but it all comes down to preference. Some might feel better with a Speed build or one that’s more balanced. Always go with what feels the best and most rewarding. If your dream is to conquer every 150cc set of races with Cataquack and the Lobster Roller, more power to you.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-best-vehicles-online-150cc-1851786067]]></content:encoded>

Now, as an adult, summers don't quite hit the same. Whether it's the weight of the world bearing down on me or the severe lack of couch co-op games, I'm not sure. But, every once in a while, a special game comes around that brings me back to that feeling of pure joy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Split Fiction, the follow-up from It Takes Two developer Hazelight Studios, launched earlier this year and features another amazing co-op adventure designed specifically for two players. Despite being only a few months old, the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game are already discounted to just $35 during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-2025-sale-top-deals-live">Prime Day</a>.

Split Fiction is shaping up to be another instant classic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like its predecessor, Split Fiction is a split-screen experience designed for two players that can be played locally or online. It even includes a Friend Pass so you and a buddy only need to purchase a single copy in order to play together. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game features plenty of memorable moments and requires you to carefully coordinate with your partner to solve puzzles as you alternate between sci-fi and fantasy worlds. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">Our reviewer gave it a 9</a>, saying "Split Fiction is so good at wanting to be played it’s hard to <em>stop </em>playing. It simply doesn’t stay the same long enough for it to ever become boring." In fact, it's already on our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-video-games-of-2025-so-far">best games of 2025</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to save even more on PS5 games, we've rounded up the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-prime-day-ps5-games-on-sale-at-amazon">best Prime Day PS5 deals</a> available right now, so make sure to stock up before the sale is over.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Should I play It Takes Two first?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the similarities between the two games, Split Fiction is a completely new experience featuring a brand-new story and characters. So, if you never got around to It Takes Two, you don't have to worry about missing anything by jumping straight into Split Fiction. Although, there are quite a few nods and inside jokes for players who have played the previous game.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Shop the lowest prices this Prime Day</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matthew Adler has written for IGN since 2019 covering all things gaming, tech, tabletop games, and more.

This week, it kicked things off with an introduction to Vex, a new Siren who taps into her deadly abilities at a fairly stressful, and very unfortunate, time.</p><p dir="ltr">In a gameplay overview, we get a taste for how Vex will differ from other Sirens from the Borderlands games. Sirens are a special (and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">very fun</a>) kind of being in the series that are able to tap into psychic abilities and are marked by glowing tattoos. Vex is much the same, but uses her newfound powers to provide her with a squad of minions.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Vex the Siren | Official Gameplay Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Vex stands apart from previous playable Sirens by focusing heavily on minions that she can summon, transforming her role into a kind of necromancer/pet class. One of her skill trees entirely focuses on a large alien cat familiar called Trouble, which Vex can summon and teleport around the battlefield. Many of the additional skills and modifiers on the tree augment Trouble's capabilities in battle, allowing them to soak up more damage, taunt enemies, or even explode.</p><p dir="ltr">As a Siren, Vex possesses many other abilities too, including one that allows her to send out a blast of phase energy, sprout some gnarly-looking wings, conjure a little orb/turret, and blast enemies with a projectile from her free hand, all in one fell swoop. For her final of three Siren action skills, Vex can summon copies of herself to do long-range DPS or project a psychic reaper that gets up close to enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">For the curious, you can already sneak a peek at Vex's <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/game-info/vault-hunters/vex/" rel="nofollow ">full skill trees</a> and get a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJDE_Jn2K5I&amp;ab_channel=Borderlands">deeper look at some of her skills</a>. You know, just in case you want to start prepping your builds for launch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzgZvUMgtSs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BzgZvUMgtSs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Gearbox released an animated short called Purple Friday that fills in some of the blanks regarding Vex's backstory. In true Borderlands fashion, the short, which comes in at just over three minutes, is exceptionally bloody and chock full of gags. In it, Vex works a retail job at the series' equivalent of a big-box store when she taps into her Siren powers. Along the way, she falls for a cute guy, is threatened by a customer, and even manages to sneak in what appears to be a joke at Borderlands 3's expense in the middle of the gory affair.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a fun little peek at Borderlands 4's world, and there appears to be more of it on the horizon.

This wasn’t a surprise for anyone who had been paying attention, but for those who weren’t, it was a shock that the game hadn’t already been shut down years ago. <em>Anthem </em>was a tragedy of errors.

Knowing the end is coming, I booted up <em>Anthem </em>again for the first time in six years. I had hoped that with time and distance, I would be able to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/so-long-anthem-see-ya-in-the-skies-2000623943&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/so-long-anthem-see-ya-in-the-skies-2000623943">appreciate the game for what it was</a></span>. I wasn’t as down on <em>Anthem </em>as others back in the day, and even thought there was potential hidden under the live-service glut. Now, half a decade later, and having seen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767">Electronic Arts desecrate BioWare</a></span> in the years that followed, I think I resent <em>Anthem </em>as a destructive detour more than I did back then. But even the worst games don’t deserve to be obliterated.</p><p>In 2019, I tried to see the good in <em>Anthem</em>. I recognized it for what it was: a trend-chasing game likely demanded from on high by a publisher looking for its next live-service hit. It didn’t matter if it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569">pulling resources</a></span> from the types of games BioWare was historically known for or if it was diametrically opposed to what made the studio such a powerhouse in the western RPG landscape. Loot shooters and forever games were the current hotness, and expertise and legacy weren’t as important as the trend of the moment. But in the margins, I saw flashes of BioWare’s best-in-class character writing, and by god, its flying mechanics still feel pretty incredible in 2025. But now that EA and BioWare are shutting the game down, what once felt like a studio trying to make the best of a bad situation just feels like a cynical attempt at fitting a square peg into a round hole.</p><p><em>Anthem </em>is the quintessential “made by committee” video game. It looks like the kind of thing you see a kid playing in the background of a TV show that is just descriptive enough to read as a video game but not distinct enough to have any discernible personality of its own. Everything about it feels like it’s meant to depersonalize you in favor of a spotlighting faceless, ugly suit of armor called a Javelin. You can’t customize your freelancer’s appearance, the character doesn’t even have a name, and the preset faces you choose will show up in-game fewer times than you can count on one hand. Its binary dialogue choices feel specifically written to have no impact, rather than even attempting to emulate the illusion of choice like the rest of BioWare’s catalog. </p><p>The only real expression you get is in the colors and designs you slap on your Javelin, and even the sleekest among them are some ugly clunkers that no amount of customization can beautify. You can change up your emotes, but they’re the same handful every other player has. In many of their other releases, against all odds, BioWare has excelled in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607">handing players a higher level of authorship</a></span> than they usually receive in big-budget games. <em>Anthem</em>, meanwhile, doesn’t just feel like a pivot away from player expression; it feels like it was actively trying to stifle it at any chance it could. In 2019, I had some hope that BioWare would course-correct this in future updates, but now that those aren’t coming, what remains of <em>Anthem</em> feels creatively sterile, both for players and BioWare.</p><figure id="" data-id="0d0c49f37a7a440f474423a45101c30b" data-recommend-id="image://0d0c49f37a7a440f474423a45101c30b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Choosing the freelancer preset." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Choosing the freelancer preset." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0d0c49f37a7a440f474423a45101c30b" data-recommend-id="image://0d0c49f37a7a440f474423a45101c30b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Choosing the freelancer preset." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you’re not flying around in your Javelin, most of <em>Anthem </em>takes place in a vaguely sci-fi fantasy fortress called Fort Tarsis. Here is where some of BioWare’s strengths show, with characters who provide tantalizing glimpses into a world that feels otherwise underdeveloped. Owen, the player’s sprightly assistant who eventually betrays you, could have been a classic BioWare character in a game that afforded its relationships the same depth as its other work. But because <em>Anthem </em>can only gesture at the acclaimed BioWare house style, characters mostly talk <em>at</em> the player, rather than to them. Meeting <em>Anthem</em>’s cast feels voyeuristic, with its first-person perspective and lackluster dialogue options emulating something like Disney’s theme parks that have a character set up in one designated area for you to interact with briefly as you pass through. Ironically enough, that feels appropriate given that a lot of Fort Tarsis feels like an abandoned theme park. Walking through rooms that were once meant to facilitate repeatable quests is haunting, given that there aren’t other players to help you play through them.</p><p>As much as playing <em>Anthem </em>feels like looking into a void, flying through its non-descript environments still fucking rules. The flight controls feel incredible. The Javelins you can pick from are each huge, clunky monstrosities, but <em>Anthem </em>manages to make them feel weighty and light on their feet at the same time. Flight in video games is easy to get wrong because it can often either feel too slow to be useful or it can be so floaty that it can be hard to maintain control and precision. <em>Anthem</em> hits the perfect sweet spot. It’s kind of wild that the internet spent so long clowning on BioWare for <em>Anthem</em>’s misguided live-service aspirations and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/people-are-ripping-apart-mass-effect-andromedas-animati-1793334047&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/people-are-ripping-apart-mass-effect-andromedas-animati-1793334047"><em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>’s animations</a></span> that we glossed over how the studio had become a real force to be reckoned with on the action combat front. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347">is rightfully divisive</a></span>, but it received a lot of praise for its tight, fluid combat. <em>Anthem </em>is a dry as hell game emulating trends it was years late to, but you won’t find a better Iron Man simulator on the market. That’s including the actual <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/iron-man-vr-the-kotaku-review-1844238508&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/iron-man-vr-the-kotaku-review-1844238508"><em>Iron Man VR</em> game</a></span>. Well, that’s actually your only option now, because <em>Anthem </em>isn’t actually on the market anymore. The game<em> </em>has been delisted from every online store, and physical copies are going to stop working in January.</p><figure id="" data-id="c42dd5be12d1cee150b605df9532ec6e" data-recommend-id="image://c42dd5be12d1cee150b605df9532ec6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Anthem screenshot showing the player set their expedition to Private." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Anthem screenshot showing the player set their expedition to Private." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c42dd5be12d1cee150b605df9532ec6e" data-recommend-id="image://c42dd5be12d1cee150b605df9532ec6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Anthem screenshot showing the player set their expedition to Private." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I played through the early hours of <em>Anthem</em>, I had almost forgotten it was supposed to be a multiplayer game. There were hints, such as the way mission objectives were spread across large areas encouraging teams of players to split up to find them, but I was having a decent enough time handling the game myself that it wasn’t until the haunting “matchmaking” icon showed up when I tried to start a mission, only to get no answer from other players, that I forgot <em>this </em>is why <em>Anthem </em>is going away forever.</p><p>In EA’s announcement blog, there’s a Q&amp;A section that says the reason <em>Anthem </em>is shutting down and will be unplayable after January is that the game was “designed to be an online-only title, so once the servers go offline, the game will no longer be playable.” Meanwhile, here I am, holding my own in battles which, yes, were obviously meant to be experienced by multiple players at once, but are still perfectly serviceable to play alone. But putting in the effort under the hood to make <em>Anthem </em>a single-player game someone could still experience after next January would require work that EA and BioWare don’t seem willing to do. No one at the studio has been working on <em>Anthem</em>, and EA even confirms in the post that flipping the switch in January won’t result in any layoffs. So if no one’s working on it at all right now, why would they devote the resources to rebalancing the game for offline play so it isn’t dropped into a black hole?</p><p>One of the frequent refrains in <em>Anthem </em>is that freelancers are “strong alone, stronger together.” At the time, this tagline felt like a desperate plea to BioWare fans who had grown accustomed to the team’s solitary RPGs that they weren’t being left behind in this uncharacteristic pivot. <em>Anthem </em>is a game you can play with others, but if you persist, you can play it by yourself, too, right? Well, not anymore.</p><figure id="" data-id="4807cbc9368f163859de14a2c3cf67f1" data-recommend-id="image://4807cbc9368f163859de14a2c3cf67f1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Javelin with the Mass Effect N7 logo on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Javelin with the Mass Effect N7 logo on it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4807cbc9368f163859de14a2c3cf67f1" data-recommend-id="image://4807cbc9368f163859de14a2c3cf67f1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Javelin with the Mass Effect N7 logo on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Shutting down <em>Anthem </em>is probably the right business decision. If I can’t even find players when the game is in its final months, that probably means that not enough people are roaming around Fort Tarsis to justify the cost of keeping the game online. That being said, it also feels like one last deluded assertion that the game couldn’t have been anything other than what it was. It’s an act that asserts <em>Anthem </em>was always intended to be exclusively a multiplayer experience, an assertion that the game itself insists wasn’t the case time and time again. Finishing the scant story content that exists in <em>Anthem</em>, the start of what was meant to be a years-long endeavor, feels like scrambling through a series of unfinished design documents, with vague ideas written in big red letters that it doesn’t feel like BioWare or EA really had thought about much. But even given the slapdash approach here, EA destroying <em>Anthem</em> while also scattering the studio’s foundational talent to the winds marks the latest instance of cultural vandalism this company has committed on BioWare’s history.</p><p>Whatever BioWare was planning was killed before it got out the door, and now all we have is a time capsule of corporate hubris, and we won’t even have that for much longer. <em>Anthem </em>had such a blind confidence in “the demands of the market” that it forgot to consider whether following them was worthwhile. Nobody knew where <em>Anthem </em>was going. After years of work, the upheaval of a studio’s storied legacy, and years of horror stories to go with it, it turns out the only place <em>Anthem </em>went was absolutely nowhere.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136]]></content:encoded>

The Forgotten Wisdom affix, which grants bonus XP, has also been adjusted to make it so XP motes dropped by enemies will now split experience between party members instead of only granting experience to the player who picked it up. Additionally, the maximum number of motes that can spawn in a dungeon has significantly increased, while the frequency has been slightly reduced. Each mote grants more XP as well, though motes will no longer spawn from monsters summoned by other monsters or in Horadric Strongrooms.</p><p dir="ltr">Other areas that will now have increased rewards include tiers of The Pit above tier 70, which will now grant additional Artificer's Stones on completion. Legion events will also reward more salvage materials and Forgotten Souls when completed on Torment difficulties. Arcana, a new seasonal component used to modify Horadric spells, are also now picked up automatically.</p><p dir="ltr">As for class balance changes, there are a few buffs for each class, with Barbarian receiving the most adjustments. Barbarian abilities like Hammer of the Ancients, Double Swing, Upheaval, and even Whirlwind are getting some significant buffs. Necromancer, alternatively, received the fewest changes, with only a 25% increase to the golem-damage sacrifice bonus from the Hulking Monstrosity passive.</p><p dir="ltr">You can read the full patch notes below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s been an undercurrent of opinion, ever since <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> took audiences by surprise earlier this year, that the approach taken by the turn-based fantasy RPG is the cure for everything that ails <em>Final Fantasy</em>. It delivers an old-school take on the genre that’s much less flawed than both<em> Final Fantasy XVI </em>and <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth,</em> garnering rave reviews, GOTY buzz, and impressive sales for a first-time studio. <em>Final Fantasy</em> fans have been jealous. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196411,197544" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Jesus, I see what you’ve done for<em> Clair Obscur </em>and I want that for us,” you can almost hear them pleading. There’s been a search for what the Square Enix franchise, which Sandfall Interactive’s <em>Clair Obscur </em>was inspired by, can learn from the new kid on the block. For some long-time fans, one of the takeaways has been that the Japanese series should return to its roots as a turn-based game. <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>producer Naoki Yoshida was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked about that at Anime Expo 2025</a></span>.</p><p>“With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system,” he responded. “That doesn’t take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game’s systems around it.”</p><p>Yoshida  continued, “This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel. It’s not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it’s going to become more action-based. [I’m] not necessarily going to be on <em>Final Fantasy 17</em>, so we also don’t want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like<em> 17</em> or even <em>18</em>. We don’t want to put them on a rail.”</p><p>The answer helped elucidate all of the considerations that go into designing a sequel. You can’t just pick things from a list and start sticking them together. Each element, from the graphical style to the type of story being told to the gameplay mechanics, needs to compliment one another and act in harmony. Ideally, each thing might flow organically into the next, making each new decision feel like a natural consequence of the last rather than something being arbitrarily inserted to please fans or shareholders. </p><p>Something I think a lot of the conversations lording <em>Clair Obscur</em> over <em>Final Fantasy</em>’s head miss are that combat isn’t where the latter has faltered in recent years. <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>’s arcade-like real-time action is flashy, precise, and incredibly satisfying. The only real shortcomings were that it didn’t dive deeper into some of the underlying systems—more Eikon ability synergies, elemental damage, more varied equipment options—and it wasn’t hard enough . Each of those is easily iterated on in a sequel, as the series has done throughout its history. </p><p><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> offers an even bigger rebuttal to the turn-based question in my mind because that’s essentially still what it is. <em>Final Fantasy</em> combat has long operated on a continuum between static and real-time, going back to the series’ introduction of the ATB system to let enemies act independent of player decision-making. This is why Square Enix often refers to<em> Rebirth</em> as a command combat system. While you can move around in battles and positioning is important, the most important tasks are all automated by the characters themselves and carried out by selecting them from a menu. There are dodges, parries, synergies, summons, and all the rest, but at its core it’s already working off the same logic as <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s combat system, and in much more robust ways. </p><p>It’s perfectly fine if fans just want a new<em> Final Fantasy</em> that marries expensive graphics with a traditional turn-based system, though there are no shortage of other RPGs out there, including many from Square Enix itself, that already cater to those classic sensibilities. But the combat itself is far from the weakest part of the modern entries in the franchise. What’s actually holding it back, without a doubt, are the stories. I’m not going to relitigate every turn in each of the sprawling adventures release over the last decade. I’d argue <em>Final Fantasy</em> storytelling has been on the decline since the end of the PS2 generation with <em>FFXII</em>, a still-stellar game for plenty of other reasons. <em>Rebirth </em>and <em>FFXVI</em> both had glaring issues, though. </p><p><em>Rebirth</em> is a world-class game in so many ways, from the cinematic presentation to the maximalist open-world design, but it bungles many of the original source material’s most important moments without providing interesting new interpretations, tensions, or epiphanies in return. The Gold Saucer section is a perfect encapsulation. The theme park is beautifully and entertainingly recreated and chock full of fun distractions. But Barret’s backstory of having his YIMBY idealism exploited by Shinra to turn his hometown into a Mako-harvesting dump gets short shrift and feels hollowed out. His encounter with Dyne, the friend whose life he accidentally ruined, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1e295v7/what_the_fuck_did_they_do_to_dyne_in_rebirth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1e295v7/what_the_fuck_did_they_do_to_dyne_in_rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is overshadowed by a cartoony infusion of clear-cut moralism</a></span>. It was one of many narrative misfires up and through <em>Rebirth</em>’s bizarre ending. </p><p><em>FFXVI</em> faltered even more frequently. For every great character moment between Clive, Joshua, and Cid, there was something in the larger narrative about geopolitical rivalries and enslaved magic users that was either straight-up dumb or borderline offensive. It never quite grapples with the stakes of its grim worldbuilding before eventually ditching it all for some old-school <em>Final Fantasy</em> guy-in-the-sky deus ex machina shit that undermines everything players had previously become so emotionally invested in. I say this with complete love for the game as a whole, which I am currently playing a second time, but <em>FFXVI</em> lives up to its <em>Game of Thrones</em> influences with a third act that’s every bit as disappointing as the end of the HBO series. </p><p>My take away from<em> Clair Obscur, </em>then, is not that RPGs need to be turn-based to find love again, but that <em>even</em> a turn-based RPG can win over modern audiences if the story, acting, and presentation are all top notch. There is no reason the next <em>Final Fantasy</em> can’t do all of those things on top of harnessing the franchise’s current combat systems. For everyone else, well, <em>Dragon Quest XII</em> shouldn’t be that far away. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-turn-based-combat-clair-obscur-ff16-1851786128]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> players have been waiting patiently all season for the chance to unlock the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-cel-shaded-superman-looks-incredible/1100-6532550/" data-ref-id="1100-6532550">first obtainable Superman skin in four years</a>, and Friday was supposed to be the day. But the folks at Epic have apparently goofed something up, and most of the new Superman cosmetics, including both versions of the skin, are locked for everyone regardless of whether they own the battle pass.</p><p>Players can unlock the free items--a loading screen, a cape, and a pickaxe--but everything else in Superman's set is stuck. Players who level up enough to unlock some of the items report seeing the normal "you just unlocked these items" splash screen after returning to the lobby, but then the skin, glider, and other items that require the battle pass don't actually appear in the locker.</p><p>Reddit has been inundated with complaints about this--the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1lx9yqy/i_dont_think_hes_from_dc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">front</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1lx7wgz/this_superman_parachute_looksstrange_to_me/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">page</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1lx74vg/so_even_after_i_had_gotten_the_glider_it_doesnt/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">of</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1lxa7jn/i_leveled_up_and_claimed_the_skin_but_nothing_but/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/hot/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FortniteBR subreddit</a> is covered in posts about this topic. Despite how widespread the issue appears to be--I'm also experiencing this phenomenon myself--Epic has not yet publicly acknowledged the problem on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">@FortniteStatus</a>, though there is a page about in <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_Fortnite/c-Fortnite_Gameplay/why-did-i-not-receive-superman-rewards-in-fortnite-after-unlocking-them-a000095274?lang=en-US&amp;sessionInvalidated=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Epic's self-service support portal</a>. It's possible the lack of a public response is due to Epic's summer break, when most of the company's employees are on vacation--Friday being the final business day of the break. [<strong>Update: </strong>Epic has now <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1943747417863590259" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">acknowledged</a> the problem, though it hasn't offered a timeline for a fix.]</p><p>It remains a frustrating turn of events for fans, particularly for those who have been waiting years for a chance at a new Superman skin. The old Superman skin is permanently locked to the Chapter 2 Season 7 battle pass, released in 2021, and so this is the first time newer players have had the opportunity to get a Superman skin.</p><p>Alongside the new Superman skin, Epic released a pair of other characters from the new film in the item shop on Thursday, though the much-requested Lex Luthor was not among them. Instead, we got skins for the villainous Engineer, and the scene-stealing Mister Terrific, and both of them will be available in the shop until July 24.</p><p>Cosmetics aren't the only exciting aspect of Fortnite's newest collaboration with DC. Epic added on Friday a new Superman mythic item to Battle Royale and Zero Build, which allows one person per match to turn into a fully powered Superman who can fly around and melt folks with his heat vision. And after next week's major patch, Superman's Fortress of Solitude will be added to the island as well.</p>
