            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> has been out for a little over a week now, and our good friends over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAp4jrKkp9w">Digital Foundry</a> have been busy diving into the nitty-gritty to deliver a technical analysis of the pink puffball's latest adventure.</p>
<p>Right from the jump, DF states that Air Riders "nails" the fundamentals, with super fun racing, <strong>Smash Bros.</strong> vibes, and super detailed new tracks.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, the lighting is the game's first win, utilising Nvidia's RTXGI to light dynamic objects and keep the characters looking super smooth. Sure, this pushes ray-traced lighting to the side in favour of more simplistic light maps, but the entire performance benefits as a consequence. The finer details might not be the finest you've ever seen if you stop and look at them in isolation, but, as Digital Foundry repeatedly points out, Air Riders isn't a game where you'll be doing a lot of stopping.</p>
<p>Engine-wise, the game runs in a new 'SOL-AVES' engine. While DF notes that we'll likely see far more impressive uses of it in the future, the engine produces something visually unique with a strong performance — not a bad start, then!</p>
<p>Onto resolution, and it seems that Air Riders is <em>mostly</em> running at 1080p in docked mode, with some shots occasionally going north of that — particularly in Top Ride mode, where you may be looking at 1440p. In handheld, DF found that things often sat at 900p, but they registered anything from 720p-1080p.</p>
<p>HDR implementation, on the flip side, is "exceptionally bad", with only the machines' particle effects seeming to make the most of the increased brightness. Everything else appears "washed out and dim" when using HDR, resulting in something that ends up looking "unnatural and borderline broken". <em>Yikes</em>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, performance fares much better. While there is no 120Hz option, the game delivers a "pretty much stable" 60fps, only occasionally dropping the odd frame (somewhat more frequently in City Trial mode). Three and four-player split screen aims for 60, but often ends up slightly lower, with City Trial, again, being the worst-hit mode at between 40-50fps — so, very admirable, but not quite there.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">our review</a>, we called Kirby Air Riders "a chaotic and frenzied racer, there's no doubt, but it's got depth for those who wish to learn and plenty of competition to be had both online and at harder difficulties for diehards". You'll find our full thoughts, as well as those from Digital Foundry's shiny new site, by following the links below.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-4-2000647084</link>
            <guid>1367149</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The biggest shopping event of the year is almost here, and you know what that means; saving big on items that rarely go on sale. It’s especially a great time to treat yourself to some Apple products, since we’re spotting iPads, audio gear, and even MacBooks dropping to their lowest ever prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">One of the best discounts live right now is the Apple AirPods 4 with ANC marked down to just $99.99.</a> These typically retail for $179, so you’re saving a whopping nearly $80 on the pair. These have dipped to around $130 during past sales, but $99.99 is the lowest we’ve seen them go in a long time. Even crazier? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">The non-ANC AirPods 4 are nearly 50% off at just 69, which is an insane deal for the latest model.&nbsp;</a>The deal is open to all shoppers, whether you have a Prime subscription or not.</p>
<p>It’s best to get your orders in fast, as we’re not expecting the deal to stick around for long.</p>

<h2>Adaptive Noise Cancelation for an Immersive Experience</h2>
<p>Apple unveiled its AirPods 4 last year, after redesigning the pair for exceptional all-day comfort and greater stability. The redefined contour makes for a better fit, while the shorter stem keeps the frame minimal. The build is responsive, meaning you can just press the earbuds to control music and manage calls.</p>
<p>The pair is packed with Apple’s powerful H2 chip to unlock an immersive, rich audio experience with two modes; Active Noise Cancelation and Transparency. ANC blocks background noise and chatter, letting you vibe to your favorite songs or listen to podcasts without distractions. It’s great for noisy, chaotic public places where you just can’t seem to focus on what’s playing. Putting the buds on will disconnect you from the outside world, making it feel like you’re in a quiet room even when you’re packed into a subway.</p>
<p>Transparency mode does the opposite. It lets some ambient sound in, so that you can stay aware of what’s happening around while still enjoying high-quality audio. It’s better for public settings where you don’t want to miss when someone tries to interact. Even better, there’s Conversation Awareness that automatically lowers the volume of what’s playing when someone talks to you. You won’t have to awkwardly take the earbuds out just to hear the other person properly.</p>
<p>Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is supported, too. It places audio all around you for a 3D experience, letting you enjoy your favorite movies and TV shows better.</p>



<p>Voice/video calls get a boost with Voice Isolation, a feature that reduces background noise while clarifying yours. Catch up with friends on the go, or hop on meetings in a cafe without having to repeat yourself or constantly apologizing for the background noise. It plays nicely with Siri, so you can use the voice assistant for hands-free convenience throughout the day. Just say “Hey Siri”, and ask it to play music, make calls, or check your schedule. It’s helpful when you’re behind the wheel and don’t want to take your attention off the road, or even when both your hands are busy typing and picking up the phone would break your flow.</p>
<p>On a single charge, AirPods 4 give you around 5 hours of listening in the standard mode, while up to 4 hours with ANC on. Drop them back into the charging case, and your total extends to 30 hours. The pair is also IP54-rated dust, sweat, and water resistant. Intense workouts in the gym or a few splashes here and there won’t affect the functionality.</p>
<p>All things considered, AirPods 4 are some of the best wireless earbuds out there. You’re getting impressive sound, two listening modes, and a reliable battery life, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">all for just $99.99 (ANC)</a> and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">$69 (without ANC) right now.</a></p>

And a lot of people have bought into that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think anyone expected this because it's a small game.

This, it's stated, is the same group responsible for all of Remedy's other trademarks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The obvious conclusion here is that Control: Resonant will be the title of Remedy's upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-2">Control sequel</a>, which the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-announces-control-2-for-playstation-5-xbox-series-and-pc">developer first announced for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S back in 2022</a>.

			<p>As a known lover of card games, it wasn’t especially surprising that Cross Blitz really appealed to me back <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/29/cross-blitz-early-access-review-hearthstone-with-the-heart-of-a-lion/">when I first tried its Early Access launch</a>. Two whole years later, does it still feel as good now that it’s fully released? To put it simply, yes.</p>
<p>Look, we’re all busy people, I’m not going to lead you on, so if that’s all you wanted to know, then you’re done here, but do feel free to leave the page open for a few minutes to help our metrics, and maybe open a couple of other articles too. Thanks!</p>
<p><iframe title="Cross Blitz | Launch trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0twc6R34RMc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Cross Blitz is an RPG deckbuilder with multiple modes and multiple stories to play through as campaigns, thanks to its cast of different characters. Each of these characters have their own starting decks, and different potential build options as you progress as well. You’re bound to find a character or two you love the most, but at the end of the day, I think they’re all very well-designed and a lot of fun. It’s incredibly cool to nip around maps getting not only upgrades, but also more story about them all as well.</p>


<p>Along with that though, there’s also a roguelike mode, and it’s what can give Cross Blitz a near unlimited lifespan, whether you’ve finished the stories and find yourself wanting a bit more, or just want to snack on the gameplay and aren’t in the mood for reading. Yes, reading is very good for all of us, but some of us get four hours sleep, work too much, and just wanna demolish some enemies, you know?</p>
<p>One thing that didn’t quite hit me in with the Early Access release is just how much Cross Blitz feels like a really polished Game Boy Advance game. I think it’s the visual style mostly, but the whole vibe could easily have been from 20 years ago, and I mean that as a truly gargantuan compliment. Cross Blitz just feels like it’s laser-focused on its core gameplay and deck-building, doing a lot without wasting excess tech on stuff it doesn’t need. It masters mechanics to allow you to min-max, and it wants you to do so to push through some of the hardest battles as well.</p>

<p>Cross Blitz is an even better game now as it has even more to do, which is usually how these things go. The full release brings with it a new story campaign, which is in a similar vein to what’s come before, and it remains a lot of fun. The result is a more complete experience with even more cards and mechanics to mes around with, and just so much variety. It feels like you’re getting into the weeds with a really good TCG, but you don’t need to pay for all of it.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Cross Blitz is a beautifully made deck builder that feels not only incredibly inventive, but also mechanically dense, and just very satisfying to sink into. On top of that, the looks are exceptionally charming, the music is good, and the vibes are just on point. If you love a good deckbuilder, then you’ll love this, but the campaign modes also mean that this could be the one that grabs you if you’ve only ever bounced off of others due to the roguelike focus.	</p></div>

            <p>The Let it Die sequel - Let it Die: Inferno - which is coming out next week (4th December), seems to have been built using a considerable amount of generative AI.</p>
<p>Let it Die: Inferno is the somewhat surprising sequel to Suda51 studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-is-grasshoppers-refreshingly-different-return-to-form">Grasshopper's quirky 2016 action game Let it Die</a>, which mixed action and base infiltration and asymmetric multiplayer to novel effect. There was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battle-royale-deathverse-let-it-die-dev-to-temporarily-suspend-the-game-just-four-months-after-launch">a purely multiplayer follow-up called Deathverse, which flopped</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576150/LET_IT_DIE_INFERNO/">The Let it Die: Inferno Steam page</a> now discloses: "AI-generated content has been used and then edited by our team for certain parts of the in-game voices, music, and graphics." This content apparently includes background signboard textures, records illustrations, infocast videos and voices and music.</p>
<p>To what degree each of those parts of the game uses AI, we don't know, but the areas outlined - art, video, voice and music - are large areas, so the game's AI use could be substantial.</p>

<p>Inferno was only announced to the world a couple of months ago, during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-playstations-latest-state-of-play-showcase">a September PlayStation State of Play</a>, so it hasn't had much of a marketing campaign. Perhaps that suggests a project sped to release, which is, of course, something AI could help achieve.</p>
<p>Grasshopper isn't involved with the sequel, which is entirely developed by Supertrick Games, co-developer of the original game. And the core of the game has shifted slightly to PvEvP, meaning real-time multiplayer will be a thing here.</p>
<p>Were it not for Steam's AI disclosure policy, we likely wouldn't have known about AI use in Inferno until people bought and played it, and noticed it, and reports spread around. In that regard, it's a helpful tool for shoppers, should they care. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">there are people who think AI disclosures aren't necessary, such as Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney</a>, who believes AI use will be so commonplace there's "no sense" in making every game disclose how it's been used. Does it affect your buying decision?</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/28/creative-aurvana-ace-3-wireless-earbuds-review/</link>
            <guid>1367116</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The name Creative means a great deal in gaming and audio circles. Known as the creator of the Soundblaster range of PC audio cards, their range has expanded to include audio products of all kinds, from the excellent Creative Pebble series of speakers through to gaming headphones with SXFI technology. The Creative Aurvana Ace 3 is the newest edition of their ANC-equipped true wireless earbuds, offering a cost-effective alternative to Apple’s AirPods Pro 3 and the Galaxy Buds Pro 3.</p>
<p>The Aurvana Ace 3 are stem-style true wireless earbuds, available in an eye-catching translucent purple colourway, that’s matched through the charging case and each earbud. There is something quite retro about their look, with a mid-noughties vibe that brings an unexpected wave of nostalgia with it. When it’s paired with the silver band running down each stem, they’re certainly unique-looking, but if you’re hoping for a more understated option, this isn’t it.</p>



<p>They feel light in the hand, which diminishes that premium sensation, but it does mean that you can easily wear them for hours without any fatigue. The earbuds are rated for 7 hours, which is an hour less than the AirPods Pro 3 but an hour more than the AirPods Pro 2, with a total of 26 hours of playback with the charging case, all of which played out pretty effectively in our testing.</p>
<p>The charging case lid hinge is a little flimsy, but the body of the case itself feels solid and is the perfect size for chucking in your pocket. It also includes wireless charging, which is a very welcome inclusion. At half the price of their top-end rivals, it’s a good start for the Aurvana Ace 3.</p>

<p>The audio pairing and setup is a little more convoluted than its core competitors, though, as there’s a suite of features to set up to make the most of the Ace 3. The Creative app handles nearly everything here, but you also need the separate SXFi app, which seems unnecessary.</p>
<p>First, and perhaps most importantly, you use Mimi sound personalisation to create a listening profile. This involves a short hearing test – best done in a quiet space – and the results then tailor the output to your own ears. It’s a stark difference, particularly factoring in my 40+ year old hearing, and the years of damage I’ve done to them by, well, listening to headphones that I’ve turned up too loud.</p>
<p>After that, you can choose your EQ presets to tailor the audio to your personal taste, or delve deeper into a custom EQ setup. Even if you’re not clued up about audio, frequencies and kHz, it’s all easy enough to mess around with in search of the roght sound.</p>

<p>The Aurvana Ace sound very good indeed, even without any tuning. Part of that is the ability to utilise the best audio codecs out there, translating LDAC, AptX Lossless and AptX Adaptive into a seamless listening experience. The Ace 3 are equipped with Snapdragon Sound, so if your Android device meets the right specification, not only will you benefit from the high resolution audio, you’ll experience fewer connection issues, and benefit from exceptionally low latency, making your mobile gaming just that bit more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Putting them to the test with some of my favourite tracks, I was immediately surprised by just how detailed the audio was from the Ace 3. Billy Eilish’s No Time To Die sounded suitably epic, with her vocals sounding so precise that it felt as though she was singing directly to me.</p>
<p>Changing tack, the brutal cacaphony of Pupil Slicer’s Heather was delivered in spades, losing none of its venom on its way into your ears. It’s always incredibly satisfying to hear new elements in songs, and the Ace 3s combined technologies make that a certainty. The dual xMEMS drivers here certainly help with audio separation, and bass response in particular is fantastic, being rounded and full, without becoming overwhelming.</p>
<p>The hybrid ANC proved moderately effective at blocking out background noise, though it is a clear step behind the Airpods Pro 3 and Bose Quietcomfort Ultra, and on a windy walk to work, they struggled against the wind quite a bit. Still, at this price point, it’s effective enough, and with the quality of the audio itself being so high, I don’t think anyone will be too disappointed with their performance.</p>

<p>As with many less expensive earbuds, the touch controls aren’t quite as reliable as their more expensive brethren. The Aurvana Ace 3 does keep things pretty simple, and there’s only one touch point on the main body of each earbud, rather than a panel or squeezable section. That does make changing the volume less efficient, requiring a long press on each earbud to move the volume up and down, and if you’re running that’s a real pain, but it does work, once you’ve adapted to it.</p>
<p>Phone call quality is good, possibly helped by the ability to use Snapdragon Sound via the connection to my Honor Magic V5, and family members confirmed that my voice was clear and easy to hear during calls. It helps to wrap up a compelling package from Creative, and if you’re looking for an excellent-sounding pair of earbuds at a mid-range pricepoint, you’d be hard pressed to find better.</p>
<p>The Aurvana Ace 3 are amongst the easiest earbuds to live with in this price bracket, and though their RRP is £140, you can currently snag them for a slightly bonkers £90 via the Creative website. The Nothing Ear (3) are also worth considering, currently coming in at £139.99, though they have worse battery life than the Ace 3 and are noticeably heavier too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Bloober Team announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/exclusive-bloober-team-is-bringing-layers-of-fear-to-switch-2-next-month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Nintendo Life</a> that Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition is launching soon on the Nintendo Switch 2. The hybrid handheld/home console platform will receive the first-person horror game on December 19, priced at $39.99. </p>



<p>According to the official info, this version of the game will support High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays as well as ray tracing. This will make it part of the highly restricted club of Nintendo Switch 2 games that actually leverage the hardware's capabilities for ray tracing; for example, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-runs-30-fps-nvidia-dlss-baked-gi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to drop ray traced global illumination in the Nintendo Switch 2 edition of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> in favor of baked global illumination for performance reasons.</p>



<p>Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition also features platform-specific improvements, like native motion controls, touch-screen gameplay, and Joy-Con integration. This edition includes all of the Layers of Fear games and DLCs released so far, bringing together the intertwined stories of the three main characters (the Painter, the Actor, and the Writer), each consumed by their devotion to art.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/layers-of-fear-now-truly-finished/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a> of the PC version, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>



<p><em>They say an artist's work is never truly done, but with Layers of Fear, Bloober Team and Anshar Studios have completed the Master Opus started back in 2016. With superb Unreal Engine 5 powered visuals, improved writing and some new gameplay mechanics, these journeys into the darkest recesses of the human mind have never been so immersive, although some issues prevent Layers of Fear from being an absolute masterpiece.</em></p>

            <p>Later today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> fan film For Liberty will premiere for the whole of Super Earth to watch. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film will reach almost an hour in length, longer than any other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> fan project made to date.</p>
<p>The fan film is not officially endorsed or made in partnership with Sony or Arrowhead, but it has proven exhilarating to the Helldivers community. As of writing, the latest trailer has accrued almost 300,000 views in just over a month.</p>
<p>The film itself is animated in the Helldivers style, following the experiences of some brave soldiers of Super Earth as they navigate the treacherous galaxy the popular third-person shooter takes place in. It's also fully voice acted, with six actors lending their talents to the project.</p>

<p>One of them - Kevin Lauer - spoke to Eurogamer about For Liberty earlier this week. A previous actor on Plot Coalition's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> series, he is a relatively new fan of the Helldivers series. However, having dived in to better learn about his role and the background for the film, Lauer quickly learned the ins-and-outs of Helldivers quirkiness and its general appeal.</p><p>"I didn't play Helldivers until it launched on Xbox earlier this year, so at first I was guided by the director," Lauer stated. "Then when I played the game I was like: 'oh, that makes sense, I understand that reference now!'</p>
<p>"I would say it is pretty accurate. It's not as humorous as some people think. There are three trailers: one's very liberty, democratic. Another is quite solemn and dark, and the last trailer is in the middle ground. It does have that humour, and there are a lot of things in there I think a lot of fans will recognise. This is made by fans of Helldivers, and I think that will definitely show through."</p>
<p>Lauer plays the Veteran, a stand-in for the community idealised 'John Helldiver' who represents what it means to fight for Super Earth. According to Lauer, the community reception to the project has been exceptionally positive.</p>
<p>Lauer explained: "I've been doing content creation for a while so I'm used to negative comments, but there have been so few. People are excited, or they're asking how long the film is (laughs). But it's been very well received, and as far as I know in terms of fan projects there's been nothing to this scale."</p><p>According to Lauer, even Arrowhead is hosting its own watch party today upon the film's release. He stated: "After the first trailer in February or March, they reached out and they thought it was really cool. I heard there's going to be a watch party for it at Arrowhead, and I think it's really cool that the developers are so engaged with the community."</p>
<p>All of this is fun, but it begs the question: why is Helldivers 2 so ripe for such fan projects. For Liberty may be the largest fan film released, but it's far from the only creative work made in the world of Helldivers. What about the game and its players attracts such passion? For Lauer, the answer is clear.</p>
<p>"One thing I've learned as a new fan is everyone is in on the joke, everyone is 'brainwashed'," Lauer concludes. "If one of my friends in-game is like, that's a dumb thing, I'll shoot him in the head because it's like, don't question democracy. Don't do that, and they'll do it to me! I think it's just a fun simple game, personally I feel there's a need for cooperative games, and it just works. It's nice, it's crazy, and you can just be ridiculous! It's goofy and it plays well."</p><p>

Helldivers 2 continues riding high off its initial popularity, keeping its dedicated fan base engaged with constant updates and an ongoing Galactic War on numerous fronts. One of its biggest strengths is allowing players to tell their own stories, something Helldivers 2 director Johan Pilestadt said in a GDC talk on the game's development. You can read more about Helldivers 2, as well as how developers find continous success in the brutal live service market, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-on-earth-do-you-find-lasting-meaningful-success-with-a-live-service-game-developers-answer-the-billion-dollar-question">in Eurogamer's longform deep dive on the topic from earlier this month</a>.

            <p>A trademark for Control Resonant has been applied for in Europe by a law firm who've represented <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> developers Remedy on numerous previous occasions. This application's been lodged not long before The Game Awards and is to permit the phrase to be used in relation to games, but at the moment it's still a mystery what exact sort of Control-related thing it refers to.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019282647">trademark</a>, spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-trademark-control-resonant-unearthed-ahead-tga">MP1ST</a>, was applied for yesterday - November 27th - through the European Union's Intellectual Property Office. If granted, the mark would allow Control Resonant to be used by the new holders in relation to video game software and hardware, as well as "audio, video and multimedia production" (something that covers the likes of TV series and films). Some likely merch-related bits including clothing, lanyards, printed books, and posters are also part of it.</p>
<p>The trademark doesn't list Remedy's name directly, but it has been filed by the Finnish branch of a law firm called Nordia. A search on Nordia's website shows they've <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-announces-the-result-of-the-share-issue/">acted on Remedy's behalf</a> numerous times in the recent past, including <a href="https://nordialaw.com/case-listing/">advising on the company's stock exchange listing</a> and <a href="https://nordialaw.com/case-remedys-contract-negotiation-with-annapurna/">helping negotiate</a> the partnership Remedy shook hands on with Annapurna Pictures in 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a>'s development's been underway for a little while, so there's a chance this trademark could be related to that. However, the fact the listing covers TV and film adaptations, something Annapurna got permission to pursue with both Control and Alan Wake in that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-partner-with-annapurna-to-co-finance-control-2-and-explore-control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-film-adaptations">partnership deal from last year</a>, means that this listing could also be about something along those lines. Either way, you'd expect there to be plenty of merch to buy, so that aspect doesn't help point in either direction.</p><p>Beyond that, there's not much to be read into Control Resonant as a potential name, at least from where I'm sitting. Resonant almost certainly has something to do with the resonance, that being what the Federal Bureau of Control dub the strange energy which powers all of the game's paranatural weirdness. All that really tells us is that this Control thing will be a Control thing. Breaking news. You heard it here first.</p>
<p>For now, we'll just have to sit tight and see when Remedy whip out an explanation or reveal for this trademarked thing. Maybe hold off on buying a new lanyard until they do.</p>

            <p>A trademark for something known as Control: Resonant has been registered in Europe, leading many to speculate developer Remedy has something up its sleeve for The Game Awards next month.</p>
<p>The trademark itself was spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-trademark-control-resonant-unearthed-ahead-tga">MP1st</a>, with the publication noting it has been classified under tags such as video game services, miscellaneous products and the production of entertainment in the form of TV series and cinematographic films.</p>

<p>While Control developer Remedy is not mentioned in the trademark's registration, Nordia Attorneys at Law is. This is the same firm Remedy has used for its previous trademarks.</p>
<p>As for what the end product could actually be, Remedy has already announced a Control sequel. There is also a Control-flavoured film or TV <em>something</em> in the pipeline. In 2024, Annapurna announced it had partnered with Remedy to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-and-control-film-and-television-rights-acquired-by-annapurna">develop and produce film, TV and audiovisual projects based on the studio's Alan Wake and Control franchises</a>.</p>

<p>Control's sequel was first announced back in 2022, with the developer simply stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-officially-announces-sequel-to-control">it would be an "unexpected journey"</a>. In the time since, the developer has kept most details under wraps, although in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production-control-2-features-in-playable-form">August of last year it stated "important" Control 2 features were now in "playable form"</a>. The following November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-remedy-confirms">Remedy then confirmed the sequel will be an action-RPG</a>. A teaser for the sequel was also, perhaps, tucked away in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-tease-lies-in-alan-wake-2s-lake-house-dlc-fans-say">its Alan Wake 2 DLC</a>, The Lake House.</p><p>With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">The Game Awards 2025 just a couple of weeks away</a>, it seems that if Remedy has something more to share about Control: Resonant soon, that will be the time to do it. What do you hope Remedy is working on here?</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Remedy news, earlier this year the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/big-change-at-alan-wake-studio-remedy-as-ceo-steps-down-following-failure-of-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak">studio's CEO Tero Virtala stepped down from his position at the company</a>. While Remedy's announcement did not indicate a reason for Virtala's departure after 11 years at the company, it followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreaks-weak-sales-persist-despite-improved-player-and-sales-metrics-says-remedy-ceo">profit warning to investors</a> "due to weak sales" of the studio's multiplayer Control spin-off, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, modder xoxor4d released the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod that <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-look-path-traced-gta-4-rtx-remix-test-build/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we previously reported on</a>. This public build even comes with a simple installer, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/gta4-rtx/releases/tag/1.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, making it relatively easy for users to install it.</p>



<p>Xoxor4d shared a detailed changelog of improvements over the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod test build that was released last month. You can find it below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Added a basic installer</li>



<li>Removed alpha blending on some emissive surfaces that were not supposed to be alpha-blended</li>



<li>Night emissives now turn off during the day</li>



<li>Map markers can now be shown/hidden based on the time of day or the current weather</li>



<li>Added a button to teleport yourself to a map marker</li>



<li>Added a FreeCam mode and added a new Utilities tab to the imgui menu</li>



<li>Reduced the default emissive intensity of some surfaces</li>



<li>Fixed an issue that broke the remix debug views</li>



<li>No longer using timecycle temperature because it was not related to color tuning - now using a hardcoded value + reduced influence</li>



<li>Added a special remix replacement to the first apartment</li>
</ul>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Remix Runtime</em></p>
</blockquote>



<ul>
<li>Added raindrops/splashes to wet world surfaces (disabled by default for pedestrians and vehicles because of varying UV scales, which makes raindrops really large on some cars and really small on others)</li>



<li>Added "puddle logic" to the global wetness code to break up the mirror-like surfaces</li>



<li>The <code>Ignore Lights</code> category can be used to disable the <code>WorldUI</code> texture tag that is automatically set on some emissive surfaces. This allows one to set custom emissive masks and tweaks via a remix replacement while keeping the dynamic intensity adjustment by the game</li>
</ul>



<p>The highlight of the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod is obviously that it injects path tracing into Rockstar's 2008 classic game. The result is a massive visual improvement, as you can see in the featured image and in the additional comparison screenshot below.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GTA-4-RTX-Remix-Mod-PT-Comparison-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: MxBenchmark PC (YouTube)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>That said, path tracing, like in any other PC game (and perhaps even more so in a mod that is not as well optimized as a full game for obvious reasons), is rather heavy on performance. As shown <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-4-path-tracing-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the MxBenchmark PC comparison video</a>, even NVIDIA's expensive GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card cannot run the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod at 60 frames per second without the help of DLSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>Modder xoxor4d did have a couple of tips for those who may struggle with performance, though. Those who experience heavy stuttering can try to launch the mod using the included 'LaunchWithProcessorAffinity_2Cores_GTA4.bat' file. This will allocate two cores to GTA4 and the remaining cores to Remix. Another option is splitting your CPU cores 50/50 with NVIDIA RTX Remix; to do that, use the '_LaunchWithProcessorAffinity_Half_GTA4__Half_Remix.bat' file.</p>



<p>The path tracing settings can also be lowered a bit. Just like in every RTX Remix game, you can open the menu by pressing Alt + X. In the Graphics Settings Menu, switch to the Graphics tab and then adjust various quality settings in the Graphics Preset dropdown as needed.</p>



<p>Another tweak that might help performance (though it will also make leaves more blocky) is increasing the Tree Alpha Cutout Value. To do that, open the CompMod menu by pressing F4 and open the Rendering Related Settings container under the Game Settings tab.</p>



<p>Lastly, you can of course still tweak the quality and distance sliders in the regular Grand Theft Auto 4 graphics options. Keeping in mind that higher values will reach your CPU bottleneck earlier, the modder recommends starting with 50 for view distance and 30 for quality and adjusting from there. When making this adjustment, xoxor4d warned that the first launch might cause problems, but a second attempt should resolve the issue.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod can help Grand Theft Auto fans cope with the additional time they'll have to wait until the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, which was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a> from the previous date of May 26, 2026 to November 19, 2026. Rumors suggest Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-switch-2-explored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may even be trying to make the game run on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, though even if that's happening, it would likely be launched at a later date.</p>

                <p>After previously working with Bandai Namco's studio in Singapore on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splatoon-3/" data-ref-id="5000-527230">Splatoon 3</a>, Nintendo has revealed that a deal has been struck to bring that developer in-house.</p><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">made the announcement</a> online, which notes that it will own 80% of Bandai Namco Studios Singapore by April 2026 per its agreement with Bandai Namco. The remaining 20% the Singapore studio will be purchased at a later date, "once the subsidiary's operations have stabilized."</p><p>The new name of the studio will be Nintendo Studios Singapore. Nintendo also noted that the studio was chosen for acquisition because it "has an ongoing business relationship with Nintendo" and the publisher wanted to "strengthen" its internal development structure.</p><p>Bandai Namco Studios Singapore's collaborations with Nintendo included Mario Sports Superstars and New Pokemon Snap. It's also rumored to have been involved with Bandai Namco's version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" data-ref-id="5000-465595">Metroid Prime 4</a>, before the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/" data-ref-id="1100-6464593">completely redeveloped by Retro Studios</a> in 2019.</p><p>This deal doesn't appear to mean Bandai Namco is putting itself up for sale. Earlier this year, Bandai Namco struck <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-463-million-in-elden-ring-publisher-bandai-namco-as-part-of-strategic-partnership/1100-6533400/" data-ref-id="1100-6533400">a $463 million deal with Sony</a> for approximately 2.5% of the company. Bandai Namco retains some of the biggest franchises in gaming, including Elden Ring, Tekken, and Pac-Man. However, the company has disclosed that a former employee allegedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-former-bandai-namco-employee-allegedly-embezzled-so-much-money-execs-had-to-take-a-pay-cut/1100-6533562/" data-ref-id="1100-6533562">embezzled so much money from Bandai Namco</a> that its executives have taken a pay cut.</p>

This is not going to go well. As you’d expect, pandemonium ensues when the lights go off. The race has just begun and it’s already a mess. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this is Project Motor Racing in a nutshell right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On paper, Project Motor Racing is precisely the sort of racing game I want to play. It has a great selection of cars, a number of which are thoroughly underrepresented in modern racers. It’s also not crippled with free-to-play chicanery or subject to a monthly subscription, and its focus <em>isn’t</em> primarily multiplayer. All of this is high-octane music to my ears. In practice, however, Project Motor Racing simply hasn’t worked out, and I’ve totally bounced off it in its current state thanks to AI that essentially ignores your presence on track, a hopelessly uneven penalty system that serves only to frustrate and ruin your races, and its array of bugs and peculiar physics quirks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Motor Racing arrives as a spiritual successor to Slightly Mad Studios’ now-defunct Project CARS series, which failed to survive the Codemasters acquisition of Slightly Mad (and the subsequent EA purchase of Codemasters). There may be some different logos on the loading screen, sure, but developer Straight4 Studios is basically a rebirthed Slightly Mad after someone hit the VIN with an angle grinder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps more specifically, it’s attempting to pick up where Project CARS 2 left off – brushing aside the bafflingly casual reinvention of the series in Project CARS 3. If you need a comparison to chew on, it’s a little like how Jaws 4 ignores the events of Jaws 3D. Unfortunately, just like Jaws 4, things get real fishy, real fast.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Superficial Intelligence</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, Project Motor Racing’s single-player set up has a good base and I do like how malleable it initially is, with three starting budget figures that give us the flexibility to approach the career mode however we choose. That is, you can select to begin with just enough cash to scrape into the entry-level categories, or a wallet big enough to buy any car on offer and head straight to the top classes. It’s smart that it has these options. There are actually slots to have three separate careers on the go simultaneously, so it’s possible to experiment with multiple approaches (or, in my instance, for my sons to dabble with their own career saves without messing around with mine – an underrated addition to any racing game).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I do like how malleable it initially is, with three starting budget figures that give us the flexibility to approach the career mode however we choose.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Your in-game payouts can also be tweaked to fit your playstyle. For instance, you can opt to keep things simple and take a flat payout per event, or you can mix it up and take bonuses for winning only – or even have your damage repair bills covered in return for a steady portion of your event takings. This is an equally smart way of slinging out credits to us, regardless of how differently you or I may plan to go about our racing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The management component plateaus here, though, since there are no other meaningful aspects to it. There’s no in-game way of creating a custom team appearance for the cars you buy and race, or applying sponsor logos. In this regard, don’t expect anything like, say, the recently released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nascar-25-review">NASCAR 25</a>. Support for mods is a much-touted feature of Project Motor Racing on both PC and console – and I have no doubt that many recognisable liveries will be convincingly recreated and available via user-created mods – but mods feel unlikely to fill this specific gap. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you have a team and a car, the campaign mode becomes a simple matter of selecting a championship or event, paying the entry fee, and competing. At this point, the overall objective is really that of any real-life race driver – spend your work days at high speed on 18 world-famous race tracks and do your best to win (or, failing that, not send your team bankrupt). This approach works for me. Or, at least, it would have, if Project Motor Racing had not been so bafflingly irritating to race in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The racing is frustratingly close to being entirely decent, but it’s currently completely undermined by its aggressively oblivious AI and its brazenly unfair penalty system – both of which are so annoying I have no desire to keep playing at the moment.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The racing is frustratingly close to being entirely decent, but it’s currently completely undermined by its aggressively oblivious AI and its brazenly unfair penalty system.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The big problem with the AI is that they regularly drive like you’re not on track. I’m not just talking about them coming across on you when you only have a slight overlap and probably got optimistic sticking your nose there in the first place (although they <em>will </em>do that, and watching the replays exposes that they’ll do so by sometimes clipping through your front end like you’re a ghost). I’m talking about the absolute argy-bargey that occurs when you’re right alongside them and they want to carry on sticking to the racing line like freight trains, so they thump into you with zero regard for your existence. It certainly doesn’t help that it currently features no radar or proximity indicators for the cars around you, and no spotter either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On PS5, the single-player opponent count is actually limited to just 15 (crossplay multiplayer allows up to 32). Frankly, 15 isn’t near enough for a racing sim of this type but, considering the way they drive, I guess I don’t know that I’d want any more of these lunatics out there right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s be clear, my favourite real-world racing categories are old school Super Touring and V8 Supercars, so I am unequivocally all for elbows-out, panel-punishing racing in my games, too – but this just takes the piss. Project Motor Racing’s AI regularly reminds me more of classic Gran Turismo, where the AI racers always felt exponentially heavier and generally incapable of being affected by the player’s car. To experiment, I’ve cannoned into the back of opponents for no result. They just carry on cornering without losing a position, while I’m parked in the gravel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issue is compounded by a ruinously strict track limit penalty system that will just nuke your whole race for zero reason. Get bumped off track by the AI? That’ll be a two-second penalty for breaching track limits. It doesn’t matter that it wasn’t your fault, and it doesn’t matter that you’ll have already likely lost time because of it. If you have the opponent strength slider set at just the right level to have your times toe-to-toe with the AI, two seconds can be a lifetime. It just immediately ruins races. It’s a real buzzkill to be in the groove, lapping consistently with the pack a bit spread out, and thinking, “You know what? This actually feels pretty good right now” – then, bam; tiny moment, dud penalty.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Get bumped off track by the AI? That’ll be a two-second penalty for breaching track limits.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For comparison, Assetto Corsa Competizione also dishes out penalties, but only if it detects an advantage. If you’re forced off track – or if your ego writes a cheque your tyres can’t cash and you grab a bit of impromptu dirt on a corner exit – ACC won’t penalise you if you didn’t <em>benefit </em>from the off-track excursion. Project Motor Racing is the exact opposite, whacking you with penalties for tiny mistakes that have <em>already </em>cost you time. Hell, they don’t even have to be tiny; you can spin, get overtaken by the whole field, and <em>still </em>be slapped with a two-second penalty the moment you rejoin. I wasn’t cheating; I was <em>crashing</em>. Confusingly, I had better luck <em>actually </em>cheating, because the penalty system allowed me to blast straight ahead at T1 on Project Motor Racing’s off-brand version of Monza, pay my dues by slowing to 60km/h, and immediately go from 16th to 1st. This is repeatable, too – and sometimes I actually didn’t get penalised at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At any rate, it’s thanks to the penalty system I certainly have no interest playing the career on “authentic” difficulty, which locks the opponent strength at 100 and does not allow race restarts. This might be a problem if trophies are important to you, because a horde of them are tied up behind completing the career on “authentic”. Authentic mode is optional, but Project Motor Racing would do well to remember we’re not <em>all </em>as quick as real racing drivers when we play video games. That’s <em>why </em>I play video games. For now, any time I get pinged unfairly in my current career I typically just hit the pause menu and try again. I just need to hope that everyone is facing the right way when we restart. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>A Storm is Coming</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Motor Racing’s weaknesses on track are annoying considering how much I like its current garage, and doubly so considering how excited I was to learn that Australian touring cars from two separate eras of the Supercars series are planned to arrive as DLC later next year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Motor Racing features over 70 cars, and I admire the distilled approach of focusing strictly on racing models. Ferrari and McLaren appear to have turned down a seat at the table for now – which does create some hefty holes in the categories it focuses on – but it’s particularly neat to see some of the old GT and N-GT cars that rarely get much love in contemporary racing games. For instance, I’ve always had a soft spot for the Lister Storm and its 7.0l V12. After all, there ain’t no replacement for displacement.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The cars look nice in the menu screens, but they’re not as glamorous out on track. In action, it’s actually quite washed out, and it absolutely does not look a generation newer than the excellent Project CARS 2. Damage is underwhelming, as is the rain. There are a lot of layers to the sound, which does capture a good deal of the raw, mechanical noises of a race car – although broadly speaking there’s room for improvement, and I’d love the engine notes to be a little thicker and throatier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of how the cars handle, however, I’m tugged in two directions – literally, in this instance. There’s really nothing more important to a race sim than the handling, and I have to say there are some car and track combos in Project Motor Racing where I’ve felt very satisfied with the overall feel on a wheel (the only PlayStation wheel I have is the Thrustmaster T-GT II, which isn’t a direct-drive wheel, but is about as good as belt-driven wheels get in terms of force feedback). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, in a GT3 car like the Audi R8 or the Ford Mustang at Mount Panorama, I can lap clean and the cars feel compliant beneath me. Am I as quick as a real GT3 driver? Not at all, and I’m probably underdriving the cars by some margin – but it does all feel quite intuitive to me at the speed I race. The buzz from kerbs is strong, and the sensation of weight fluctuating is impressively pronounced – like everything lightening up for a beat as you barrel over a crest and your car becoming heavier and stickier as you scoot from the end of a slope. This is a big factor on a track with such profound elevation changes, like Bathurst. The disparity in performance on a cold tyre versus a warm tyre is also huge in Project Motor Racing, and the very real necessity to drive the first lap or so more delicately is also a satisfying enough challenge here.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been far less confident in other cars, however. The hypercars are the worst culprits. They just want me dead. Obviously I’m not a professional racing driver, and I’m not going to speak to you like I am – or act like I know exactly what’s going on beneath the surface of something like Project Motor Racing when it comes to simulating a Le Mans prototype. The hypercars, however, are undriveable out of the box – even on a wheel. They pull left and right, they slip, slide, and scrub – and there’s just zero feeling of the immense downforce I expected. For clarity, we’re talking about cars that produce four times as much downforce as they do drag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, on gamepad, the news is worse. It’s just way too twitchy to be a satisfying sim on a standard controller – especially when the tiniest erroneous flick of a stick can mean a nonsense penalty. I tried dialling down the sensitivity of the steering, but it really had little effect. Cars (especially the prototypes) get so unsettled when steering from left to right on a gamepad I just can’t really recommend picking up Project Motor Racing if that’s exclusively the way you plan to play it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/project-motor-racing-review]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="ab13495c29960"><a title="Call of Duty" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ab13495c29960/call-of-duty.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Activision, Microsoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been a while since we heard anything about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_ghosts">Call of Duty</a> series returning to Nintendo platforms, and now following the recent release of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_7"><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</strong></a> on <em>other</em> platforms earlier this month, there has reportedly been some signs of life.</p>
<p>According to Insider Gaming, a new job listing from Sledgehammer Games - seeking a "Senior Technical Artist" - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4347622051/">has surfaced on LinkedIn</a>, and in the 'Bonus XP' section of the application, the team notes how it would appreciate someone with "AAA mobile or Switch experience".</p><div><figure data-videoid="SLvDnhHkJZk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSLvDnhHkJZk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3938bdrxuzwp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Although Sledgehammer only provided support on the latest Call of Duty title, it has previously taken the reins for major titles such as <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_modern_warfare_3"><strong>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This small discovery follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/yes-call-of-duty-is-still-on-the-way-to-nintendo-hardware">an update earlier this year in June 2025</a>, with a report at the time suggesting Microsoft and Nintendo still had plans to announce <em>something</em> related to this series in the future.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Nintendo originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/microsoft-enters-10-year-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo">entered a 10-year commitment</a> to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms in 2022, with the deal becoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/02/microsofts-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-is-now-legally-binding">legally binding in 2023</a>. This was followed by Microsoft being given the all-clear on the Activision Blizzard acquisition in the same year.</p>
<p>According to a previous story, Sledgehammer Games is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sledgehammer-games-office/">rumoured to be releasing its next Call of Duty</a> title in 2027.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-technical-rundown-detailed-by-ubisoft</link>
            <guid>1367008</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="1c4b88860f604"><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c4b88860f604/assassins-creed-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is out for the Switch 2 next week, and ahead of launch, Ubisoft has published a "deep dive" on its website about the technical aspects of this port. Here's the summary:</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h3 id="frame-rate">Frame Rate</h3>
<p>Firstly, in both docked and handheld modes, the frame rate will target 30 fps. The resolution was not included here.</p>
<h3 id="adapting-to-switch-2">Adapting to Switch 2</h3>
<p>As for adapting the title to Nintendo's new system, the team says it has done <em>a lot</em> of "code-level work" to optimise and adapt the game architecture. This includes "modifying game assets to streamline certain technical aspects of the quality" without compromising the overall player experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Behind the scenes, we've worked a lot to make the world run smoothly and remain visually stunning and dynamic... For example, we're using the same cloud and cloth simulation systems, but we've optimized certain elements for the ARM processor and downscaled simulation data where needed to reduce GPU load, all while preserving visual fidelity."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the Switch 2 supports Ray-Traced Global Illumination, the team has opted to use its solid baked Global Illumination system (which it also uses for "low-spec PC setups and Xbox Series S versions" of games), citing "RAM memory reasons" as the main decision behind this. It apparently allows the developers to preserve the overall experience as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="optimisation">Optimisation</h3>
<p>In terms of optimisation – Level of Detail (LOD), draw distances, texture resolution and element loading were all "carefully adjusted to maintain performance without compromising the world's depth", with the environmental richness of the world still "largely intact". However, NPC counts have been reduced in highly populated areas to maintain "smooth gameplay".</p>
<h3 id="dlss">DLSS</h3>
<p>DLSS has also been utilised, resulting in a "sharper image, with more accurate colors, improved textures, and fewer visual anomalies". Performance is described as being "smoother, offering higher FPS through upscaling, better fluidity, and reduced latency".</p>
<h3 id="handheld-and-docked-experience">Handheld and Docked experience</h3>
<p>The same post goes into more detail about each mode on Switch 2 – explaining how handheld mode is GPU-limited, with adjustments to image quality, draw distance and LOD settings to prioritise performance. And in docked, players can expect HDR support. VRR is also leveraged in handheld, offering "smoother gameplay".</p>
<p>One feat, in particular, is how "the lower framerate limit for VRR is typically 40 fps, but Assassin's Creed Shadows runs at 30 fps on Switch 2" and the team "didn't want to compromise on that aspect" so it built a "dedicated algorithm that keeps VRR enabled even at 30 fps" to ensure the experience remains as "fluid and responsive as possible".</p>
<h3 id="switch-2-specific-features">Switch 2-specific features</h3>
<p>Last but not least are some Switch 2-specific features including touch screen navigation for menus and maps. Nintendo players can also expect this version to include "all post-launch content" excluding the "Claws of Awaji expansion" due out in 2026. Cross-progression is supported as well via Ubisoft Connect, so you can continue your adventure across platforms.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Control Resonant Trademark Discovered Ahead of The Game Awards]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/control-resonant-trademark-remedy-the-game-awards-2025/</link>
            <guid>1366993</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A possible trademark registration from Remedy may hint at a new Control project. Furthermore, its timing is coincidentally near <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>, set to go live on December 11th.</p>



<p>The Control series is a fairly new series, starting in 2019. The first sci-fi mind-bending title follows new Director, Jesse Faden, as she travels the mysterious Oldest House. When it released, Remedy Entertainment and the game were praised immensely, receiving multiple year-end awards and nominations. While not a direct sequel, the multiplayer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-still-underperforming-remedy-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC: Firebreak </a>does take place in the Oldest House and ties into Control. The series is connected to the wider world of Remedy, including Alan Wake and it’s sequel’s DLC. However, a new trademark may hint at an even bigger expansion to the universe, if done by Remedy.</p>







<h2 id="h-a-new-control-project-may-be-in-the-works-at-remedy-trademark-hints">A New Control Project May Be In The Works at Remedy, Trademark Hints</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A trademark for CONTROL Resonant was filed by Remedy today ahead of The Game Awards on the EUIPO site.</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the European Union Intellectual Property Office website, the title <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019282647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“CONTROL Resonant”</a> has been filed for trademark. In addition, it’s been done by Nordia Attorneys at Law LTD. Interestingly enough, Remedy Entertainment uses those lawyers, making it seem like this is, indeed, a new Control title.</p>



<p>However, it’s important to note that Remedy has not announced a new title or project for Control, so take it with a grain of salt for the time being. As to what it could be, there are a few different ways. The most obvious is a sequel to the 2019 original, possibly continuing Jesse Faden’s narrative. However, Remedy has stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-partner-annapurna-control-alan-wake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s been exploring film and TV</a>, so maybe Control: Resonant is a TV series.</p>



<p>Of course, the timing is rather convenient, as The Game Awards 2025 are just around the corner on December 11th. Remedy is no stranger to the Geoff Keighley-hosted show, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2023-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a> and Control had huge presences there, both as nominees/winners and reveals. Sam Lake, the face of the studio, is a frequent presenter at the awards and it wouldn’t be surprising if the company decides to reveal Control Resonant, if true. Either way, it’s more Control and fans are sure to enjoy that.</p>

<p>Nintendo continues to promote its latest game releases with new events in its mobile runner <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, and next up is a collaboration with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>.</p>
<p>This event is already underway and like previous events, you'll be able to unlock themed statues. For this particular one, this includes statues for Bee Mario, Rosalina and Balloon Yoshi. During this event, one course will be open a day for free.</p>
<p>Here's a look at each of these statues, with the event scheduled to run from now until <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="2992fd063fde2"><a title="Super Mario Run" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2992fd063fde2/super-mario-run.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows previous Super Mario Run events for games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brother Ship</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Wonder</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo released Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 on the Switch last month. If you haven't already played it, we can confirm it's still out of this world, even if the entire package comes at a high price:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There’s no question about it: Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2 are two of the most sublime games ever created. With gameplay that subverts expectations and scenarios that wouldn’t be possible if not for the creative freedom of the cosmos, they represent the Mario series at its absolute best. They look better than ever, boast small yet welcome additions, and expand upon the narrative with new storybook pages...These games command a high price on Switch, to be sure, but you’ll be playing them for the rest of your life."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-quietly-ditches-ipad-air-pride-on-amazon-own-site-still-pretends-nothing-changed-2000648171</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple maintains its tradition of avoiding Black Friday deals on their own retail website while quietly liquidating inventory through Amazon with more generous discounts than previous years.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/"> At $449, down from $599, this 11-inc 128GB/WiFi iPad Air (M3 chip) joins Apple discounting</a> spanning MacBooks, AirPods, Apple Watches, and iPads. The only product category notably absent from Amazon’s Black Friday Apple selection remains the iPhone 17 series, which still hasn’t launched on Amazon’s platform despite being available through carriers and Apple directly. This 25% discount on the<strong> iPad Air represents a record-low price</strong> for Apple’s mainstream tablet that balances capability with accessibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3760/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Between the Basic iPad and the Pro Models</h2>
<p>The basic iPad costs about $329 and comes with an A14 chip from the previous generation and a standard Retina display, and it’s for people who want a cheap device for browsing and basic productivity. The <strong>M3 chip in the iPad Air gives it a lot more processing power</strong> because it has desktop-class architecture that can handle demanding games and creative applications that would be too much for the basic model. The <strong>Liquid Retina display with P3 wide color and True Tone is better</strong> than the basic iPad’s display because it has more colors, better viewing angles, and adaptive white balance.</p>



<p>The iPad Pro positioned above the Air commands $800+ through M4 chip, mini-LED ProMotion displays reaching 120Hz and Face ID replacing Touch ID. Professional photographers, video editors, and digital artists justify Pro pricing through workflow advantages including ProRes video recording, LiDAR scanning, and reference-quality displays. <strong>But most users find the Air’s M3 chip provides more than adequate performance</strong> for typical tablet workflows and the $350+ savings compared to iPad Pro base models enables purchasing Magic Keyboard or Apple Pencil accessories for instance.</p>
<p>The M3 chip made for Apple Intelligence has an <strong>8-core CPU and a 10-core GPU architecture</strong> that makes it almost as powerful as a desktop computer. When you edit videos in iMovie or LumaFusion, the effects happen in real time and the timeline scrubbing is smooth.</p>



<p>The <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display has a resolution of 2360 x 1640 at 264 PPI</strong> which makes individual pixels impossible to see. The P3 wide color gamut shows more colors than the standard sRGB display, and it makes colors that look washed out on other displays stand out more in photos and videos. The ultralow reflectivity coating keeps the screen visible outside where glossy screens wash out completely. The True Tone technology <strong>changes the white balance based on the lighting around you</strong> to make it easier on your eyes when you use it for a long time.</p>
<p>Stage Manager is one of the features of iPadOS that makes real work possible: It <strong>lets you create resizable and overlapping app windows</strong> like those on desktop operating systems instead of forcing you to switch between apps in full screen. Support for external displays makes the workspace bigger by adding monitors, and Scribble turns handwriting into text wherever you can type.</p>
<p>At $449, the iPad Air 11-inch is the best value for money iPad you can get during Black Friday. If you need tablet computing with good performance, this record-low price makes Apple’s mainstream iPad accessible without compromise.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-gave-up-on-fire-10-inch-hd-tablet-own-hardware-burned-with-zero-margin-2000648193</link>
            <guid>1366969</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The <strong>Fire HD 10</strong> packs a 10.1-inch Full HD display, octa-core processor with 3GB RAM and 13-hour battery life into a package that <strong>costs seven times less than entry-level iPads</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/">At $69, down from $139, this tablet has become the #1 bestseller across Amazon’s entire computers and tablets category</a> while hitting a record-low price that makes it cheaper than many restaurant dinners. Amazon removes profit margins on own-brand hardware during Black Friday to drive Alexa and Fire OS adoption. The <strong>50% discount transforms tablets</strong> from considered purchases into impulse buys that justify owning multiple units for different family members.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD Display That Works</h2>
<p>The <strong>10.1-inch screen has a resolution of 1920 x 1080</strong> which means that Netflix, Disney+, and YouTube look clear instead of blurry. Text stays clear while you read instead of making your eyes hurt by being fuzzy. Rich colors make photos, videos, and games come to life with levels of saturation that are as good as those of tablets that cost a lot more.</p>



<p>With an octa-core processor and 3GB of RAM, <strong>this Fire HD 10 is 25% faster than previous generations</strong>. It can handle web browsing with multiple tabs, video streaming, and casual gaming without any lag. Kids use educational apps, parents watch cooking videos, and students read textbooks, and the tablet’s performance is always responsive, so it never feels like a limitation.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery lasts for 13 hours which is enough for a few hours of streaming</strong> and browsing each day. This means you can go on weekend trips, long flights, or full days without worrying about running out of battery. The 32GB of base storage is enough for basic apps, downloaded videos, ebook librarie, and photos, so you don’t have to add more right away. The <strong>microSD slot can hold up to 1TB of extra storage</strong> for growing content libraries.</p>
<p>Parents can also set up <em>Amazon Kids</em> parental controls to make tablets safe for kids by filtering content, setting time limits, and choosing educational content. With easy-to-use controls, parents can limit access to apps and videos that are appropriate for their child’s age and stop them from making purchases or seeing inappropriate content.</p>
<p>At $69, this is the lowest price Amazon has ever offered on its own brand on Black Friday. The combination of real Full HD quality, real performance improvements, and incredible durability at half the already-low retail price makes it a better deal than any other iPad competitor. The fact that this is the #1 best-selling item on all computers and tablets shows that buyers know a great deal when they see one.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-stuck-with-too-many-airpods-pro-3-now-selling-newest-earbuds-at-all-time-low-to-clear-stock-2000648166</link>
            <guid>1366960</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This year marks a turning point in Apple’s historically rigid pricing strategy where discounts remained rare and controlled. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">At $219, down from $249, the AirPods Pro 3 that launched just months ago join Apple’s unprecedented Black Friday selloff</a> happening exclusively on Amazon rather than through official channels.</p>
<p>The entire AirPods lineup received aggressive discounting including the <strong>AirPods Max at $399</strong>, <strong>AirPods 4 with ANC at $99</strong>, <strong>standard AirPods 4 at $69</strong>, and these flagship Pro 3 models. Apple appears determined to clear inventory quickly but discreetly through Amazon’s platform rather than diluting brand perception on their own website where premium pricing remains intact.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Live Translation That Lets You Talk to Anyone</h2>
<p>With<strong> the real-time translation feature</strong>, you can talk to people who don’t speak English face-to-face. The earbuds translate speech right away and show the text on your paired iPhone: Ordering food, asking for directions or doing business in a foreign language is less scary when AI can help with these things. The feature works for <strong>phone calls as well and translates both sides of conversations in real time</strong> for international calls with coworkers, family or business contacts who don’t speak your language.</p>



<p>The <strong>heart rate sensor turns AirPods from simple audio devices into health monitoring tools</strong> that can keep track of heart health metrics during workouts without the need for chest straps or wrist-worn devices. The optical sensors measure blood flow through the ear canals and send heart rate data to Apple Health so you can keep track of your fitness in real time.<strong> Runners can see their heart rate zones</strong> in real time while they train without having to wear an Apple Watch.</p>
<p>The <strong>hearing aid feature is a huge step forward</strong> in accessibility because FDA-approved hearing aids can now work through regular earbuds instead of expensive medical devices. The feature runs built-in tests to figure out your hearing profile, then boosts certain frequencies where you have hearing loss while keeping the sound quality natural. People with mild to moderate hearing loss can get help with everyday tasks without the stigma or cost of traditional hearing aids, which can cost thousands of dollars.</p>



<p><strong>Active noise cancellation works better</strong> now because the processing has been improved to sample background noise and make anti-phase sound waves that are more accurate. The noise of airplanes, people talking in the office and traffic all fade away into silence and let you fully concentrate on music, podcasts or work without any outside noise. The <strong>adaptive transparency mode</strong> lets in background noise when you need it for conversations or to be aware of your surroundings – and it changes automatically based on how loud the noise is around you.</p>
<p>With dynamic head tracking, <strong>Spatial Audio makes three-dimensional soundstages</strong> where sounds seem to come from certain places in space around you. Directional audio cues that put dialogue in the center of the screen and sound effects that pan left and right make movies and shows more immersive than flat stereo can. More and more music producers are using spatial audio which means that artists mix tracks specifically for this format to make immersive experiences where instruments are in different places.</p>
<p>If you want Apple’s most advanced earbuds, this record-low price represents the best value available.</p>
