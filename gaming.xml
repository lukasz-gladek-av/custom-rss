Nintendo has formally revoked the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-review-a-lot-more-of-the-brilliant-same">Splatoon 3</a> World Championship 2024 winning team's title after racist messages sent by several of its members surfaced online.
</p>
<p>
This year's Splatoon 3 World Championship was held in April, with six teams competing for the crown. North American team Jackpot was eventually named the winner, but the four-person group became embroiled in controversy this June, after Discord and social media chats showing some of its members engaging in racist behaviour began <a href="https://x.com/adaptability_/status/1800558539934773269">circulating on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
And now, roughly six weeks later, Nintendo has officially rescinded Jackpot's winning title, albeit without explicitly specifying the reason behind its decision.

<p>
"It has come to our attention," the company <a href="https://x.com/NintendoVS/status/1815794010583146887">wrote on social media</a>, "that certain members of team Jackpot, the team that recently won the Splatoon 3 World Championship, acted in a manner that is not in line with our Community Guidelines while playing the Splatoon 3 game. As a result, team Jackpot's win will be considered vacated, and the team will not receive trophies associated with the event."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo additionally notes the Splashtag banner currently commemorating Jackpot's win in Splatoon 3 will be "adjusted" in a future update. "Nintendo cares deeply about our player and our community," it adds, "and we take our responsibility to uphold our Community Guidelines seriously."
</p>
<p>
This year's Splatoon 3 World Championship was initially due to be held during January's Nintendo Live 2024, but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-live-2024-tokyo-event-cancelled-after-threats-to-staff">event was cancelled</a> to "ensure the safety of our customers" after Nintendo received a message threatening to "kill the people at the venue".
</p>
<p>
In April, a 27-year-old man was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-death-threats-suspect-charged-by-japanese-police">charged</a> with sending the message - one of 39 death threats he's said to have sent to Nintendo via the company's online inquiry form.

According to <a href="https://x.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1815817188286009617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon's Nicole Carpenter</a>, the layoffs affect 36 workers. <em>[Disclosure: IGN Entertainment and publishing label Humble Games operate under separate divisions of the same parent company, Ziff Davis. Charity bundle platform Humble Bundle remains a subsidiary of IGN Entertainment.]</em></p><p>The announcement was part of a statement from Humble Games, which was published on Linkedin in the wake of <a href="https://x.com/Emilee3D/status/1815803781629505985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several workers confirming their layoffs on social media</a>. The statement emphasized "the goal of ensuring the stability and support of our developers and ongoing projects" while saying that the restructuring does not impact Humble Bundle.</p><blockquote>In these challenging economic times for indie game publishing, Humble Games has made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations. This decision was not made lightly; it involved much deliberation and careful thought, with the goal of ensuring the stability and support of our developers and ongoing projects. Additionally, the restructuring of operations at Humble Games will have no impact on operations at Humble Bundle.<p>We are acutely aware of the profound impact this decision has on our team members at Humble Games and deeply empathize with everyone affected. Our team's contributions have been world-class and invaluable, supporting the launch of our games since we started publishing in 2017. We are committed to navigating this transition with as much empathy and understanding as possible.</p><p>Supporting our development partners and assisting former team members remains our top priority. We are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for everyone involved. Thank you for your support and compassion during this challenging period. It is deeply appreciated.</p></blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Reached separately for comment, a Ziff Davis representative shared the statement posted above and said that the company is "not shutting down but is undergoing restructuring," and that "all past and ongoing projects and upcoming releases are not affected and will continue to be supported and published by Humble Games." The representative said they could not comment on the number of staff affected or remaining.</p><p>Humble Games is an indie publishing label with a portfolio including Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus, Signalis and Stray Gods.

"Thank you so much for working so hard on so many amazing games.

It was later discovered that Crowdstrike, a large cybersecurity company, had pushed out an update that was borked and broke everything for hours. And as is common on the internet these days, people began joking about it and making up stories, some of which went viral. For example, a lot of people still think the Las Vegas Sphere crashed during the Crowdstrike event.

The article, and others since, lay the blame squarely on the airline’s aging software—SkySolver and Crew Web Access. In the article, it’s mentioned that these programs look like they were designed in Windows 95. </p><p>Since then, people have been spouting off the incorrect notion that Southwest is using Windows 95, which was then backed up by a viral tweet and some outlets running with the story. </p><p>But there appears to be no evidence that Southwest is actually still using Windows 3.1. Sure, the software they are using to plan flights and manage their employees looks old and has apparently been around since 2007 or so. That’s true, and scary. But no, Southwest didn’t avoid the Windows Crash because they use an operating system from 1992. As for why Southwest mostly avoided the chaos of July 19?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jon-hamm-is-starring-in-and-co-producing-dungeons-dragons-thriller-podcast-dungeon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> podcast is in production. It is not an actual play like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-never-stop-blowing-up-pulls-cast-of-mall-employees-into-vhs-to-live" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dimension20</em></a>, nor is it one discussing lore and game mechanics. It is called <em>Dungeon Masters</em>, a scripted drama based around an infamous event of the fantasy tabletop RPG. It already has a star and a co-producer: the Emmy-winning actor Jon Hamm.</p>

<p>According to an exclusive report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/jon-hamm-star-podcast-series-dungeon-masters-dragons-1236018719/">Deadline</a>, Hamm has been set to star and executive produce the Dungeon Masters podcast. Hamm is a prolific talent in both film and TV. His roles include Edgar Wright's <em>Baby Driver</em>, and the Amazon Video adaptation of <em>Good Omens</em>. His most iconic role by far is as ad executive Don Draper in the historical drama, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804503/"><em>Mad Men</em></a>.</p>

Dear dives into the behind-the-curtain world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> while investigating the disappearance of Michigan State student Dallas Egbert. Egbert supposedly disappeared in the school's steam tunnels while enacting D&amp;D in real-life.</p>
<p>Jon Hamm isn't the only star power attached to <em>Dungeon Masters</em>. Wil Wheaton has been attached as the voice of <em>D&amp;D</em> co-creator Gary Gygax. Additional names include Felicia Day, Emily Axford, and Anjali Bhimani.</p>
<p>Those familiar with the history of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> may recall this infamous case. It became fertile ground for the Satanic Panic, an era of moral outrage for the fantasy TTRPG in the 1980s. As the name implies, it lead to various activist groups claiming the game was promoting the practice of magic and satanism.</p>

The book, which was largely based on the Egbert case, depicts a sensationalist story of a group of college students who play a fantasy TTRPG. It ends with one of the leads completely losing their grip on reality. It received a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084314/">film adaptation</a> in 1982 starring Tom Hanks.</p>
<p><em>Dungeon Masters</em> is the result of one journalist's research into <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. It was created, written, and directed by David Kushner, author of several game-related works like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Dungeon-Master-Gygax-Creation/dp/1568585594" rel="sponsored"><em>Rise of the Dungeon Master: Gary Gygax and the Creation of D&amp;D</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jacked-Outlaw-Story-Grand-Theft/dp/1455130338" rel="sponsored"><em>Jacked: The Outlaw Story of Grand Theft Auto</em></a>.</p>
<p>Kushner is producing the show alongside Hamm, QCode and Temple Hill Entertainment. The podcast will debut on August 12.</p>

            <p>Humble Games, the publishing division of digital storefront Humble Bundle, says it has "made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations" amid reports it has laid off all staff, but insists it is "not shutting down".
</p>
<p>
Humble Games was formed in 2017, and has gone on to publish a significant number of acclaimed titles, including Stray Gods, Signalis, Slay the Spire, A Hat in Time, and Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2021, Unpacking.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, however, several Humble Games employees took to social media with reports of layoffs at the company. "At 9AM this morning," business development manager Nicola Kwan <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221563370863280128/">wrote</a> in a post on LinkedIn, "36 employees of Humble Games were told that we were being let go and that the company is shutting down".
</p>
<p>
"Another year, another lay off!," Humble Bundle senior QA Emilee Kieffer added in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221568858485092352/">separate post</a>. "Today is mine and my entire team's last day at Humble Games."
</p>
<p>
In response to those initial claims, a Humble Games spokesperson has now confirmed "restructuring" at the company, but insists it is "not shutting down" and that its upcoming releases - which includes Monaco 2 and Wizard of Legend 2 - won't be affected. The spokesperson added they "cannot currently comment on staffing numbers at this time" when asked how many employees had been impacted by layoffs. Today's news follows an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-latest-to-announce-layoffs">unspecified number of job cuts</a> at Humble Games last November.
</p>
<p>
"In these challenging economic times for indie game publishing, Humble Games has made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations," the company wrote in a statement provided to Eurogamer. "This decision was not made lightly; it involved much deliberation and careful thought, with the goal of ensuring the stability and support of our developers and ongoing projects. Additionally, the restructuring of operations at Humble Games will have no impact on operations at Humble Bundle."
</p>
<p>
"We are acutely aware of the profound impact this decision has on our team members at Humble Games and deeply empathise with everyone affected," it continued. "Our team's contributions have been world-class and invaluable, supporting the launch of our games since we started publishing in 2017. We are committed to navigating this transition with as much empathy and understanding as possible."
</p>
<p>
"Supporting our development partners and assisting former team members remains our top priority," Humble Games concluded in its statement. "We are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for everyone involved. Thank you for your support and compassion during this challenging period. It is deeply appreciated."
</p>
<p>
Humble Bundle, alongside Humble Games, was purchased by Ziff Davis in October 2017 and has operated under subsidiary IGN Entertainment since then. Eurogamer and its sister sites. including Rock Paper Shotgun and GamesIndustry.biz, have been part of IGN Entertainment since May, when Ziff Davis <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-has-a-new-parent-company">acquired Gamer Network</a> from former owner Reedpop.
</p>
<p>
2024 continues to be a devastating year for games industry employees, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">over 10,000 people having lost their jobs</a> so far. That's compared to the 10,500 games industry workers who were laid off across the entirety of 2023.

Whereas the modern entries in the series have largely cut loading screens, <em>Yakuza 0 </em>feels segmented by how many there are. The Dragon engine, which powers most of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s games since <em>Yakuza 6</em>, is defined by smoothness and seamlessness. Running animations in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269"><em>Infinite Wealth</em></a></span><em> </em>look and feel fluid, but in <em>Yakuza 0 </em>they are stiff and a little janky. If Ichiban’s movement in the latest games could be defined as <em>flowing</em>, I’d reckon that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fathers-day-video-game-dads-daddies-joel-kratos-bowser-1851541054/slides/6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fathers-day-video-game-dads-daddies-joel-kratos-bowser-1851541054/slides/6">Kiryu</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-ishin-goro-majima-sexy-sega-1850050279&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-ishin-goro-majima-sexy-sega-1850050279">Majima</a></span>’s movement in <em>0 </em>could be called <em>jagged</em>.<br></p><p>And yet I can’t get enough of it.</p><p>I <em>love </em>the friction in every second of <em>Yakuza 0 </em>so far, and it goes beyond the aforementioned jank. It is great to be able to save your game anywhere in the later titles, but I love the feeling of having to walk my ass over to a phone booth in order to save in <em>Yakuza 0</em>. It leads me on so many adventures, and I’ve encountered so many characters and substories already just by trying to find a save point. Then I get strung along on a fun little journey with some screwball plot and quirky characters that usually ends in a fun but ridiculous fight.</p><p>Some of these encounters haven’t gone in my favor! I was hesitant to jump into the earlier <em>Like a Dragon </em>games largely due to the fact that I didn’t really enjoy <em>Judgment</em>’s brawler gameplay, and I’m glad to report that I’m pretty bad at <em>Yakuza 0</em>, as I expected. And after barely escaping some street scrap, I found that Kiryu couldn’t sprint, let alone walk upright. Instead, he limped along in whatever direction I prodded him, and slowly but surely, we made it to a nearby fast-food joint where Kiryu could eat and recuperate his health. He walked out of that place like a new man. He just like me.</p><p>In both instances, <em>Yakuza 0 </em>makes the friction work for itself. It is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-games-real-world-gta-yakuza-animal-crossing-sims-1850176394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-games-real-world-gta-yakuza-animal-crossing-sims-1850176394">game built upon everyday hurdles</a></span>, and clearing them is not only conducive to how it doles out stories, but allows for moments that make the character feel tangible, and incentivizes me to dig into <em>Yakuza 0</em>’s features. And that isn’t all of it! You get winded after sprinting for too long, meaning you can’t just run from every fight, which is good because you need the money that literally files out of enemies whose faces you maim in order to level up and buy anything. On its surface, these mechanics seem oddly limiting, but it only takes a few hours to learn that these are master strokes from developers executing at a high level. These blemishes are actually masterfully disguised designs.</p><p>These elements are absent in later games, which admittedly have made up for some of these sacrifices with other qualities that similarly deepen the environments and the characters, though I can’t say it entirely works for me. For example, there are no longer loading screens separating indoor and outdoor environments, thanks to the Dragon engine’s ability to render both seamlessly. This does make <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-yakuzas-city-changes-from-game-to-game-1821884988&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-yakuzas-city-changes-from-game-to-game-1821884988">Kamurocho feel like more than just set dressing</a></span>, and suggests a literal interiority that goes a long way toward player immersion. <em>Infinite Wealth </em>encourages players to try out combinations of food and drinks at various restaurants in order to apply greater buffs and unlock dialogues between multiple party members around the dinner table. However, the former feels more like a technical showcase than anything, and the latter feels like a largely skippable detour. They only serve you if you look for something deeper within them.</p><p>By contrast, <em>Yakuza 0 </em>feels like it’s intentionally shuttling me from diverse experience to experience, and has been greater for it. Everywhere I look, there’s a subtly deep mechanic or feature or quirk of animation and art that gives <em>Yakuza 0 </em>a texture that’s absent from the more sanitized games that have come after it. I love how fluid <em>Infinite Wealth </em>feels, but I’d love it even more if future <em>Like a Dragon </em>games could find a place for that friction.</p><p>It’s not like the change in engine has robbed the series of a voice and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/like-dragon-infinite-wealth-demo-yakuza-sicko-snap-1851071387&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/like-dragon-infinite-wealth-demo-yakuza-sicko-snap-1851071387">personality</a></span>, or even the ability to do things like this. <em>Yakuza 6 </em>largely brought many of these quirks forward, and Kiryu would not only get gassed after running for a long while, but he’d even trip over smaller elements of the world. You could get <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6JNtAGdvc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6JNtAGdvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shot in a fight</a></span>, sending Kiryu hurtling over a railing and tumbling into water, where he’d immediately drown. In <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, which transformed the series into a turn-based RPG, your turn could be interrupted by enemies in your path. These might be points of frustration to some, but they are also cool touches that personify a game, and lead to little stories we get to tell ourselves or tuck away to remember! Nowadays, any hurdle in a modern <em>Like a Dragon </em>game is either cleared by an auto-mount mechanic or just acts as an invisible wall you need to get around. It’s <em>too </em>clean.</p><p>The difference is pronounced enough that it now retroactively feels like there’s this dissonance between the hard-hitting stories of the later <em>Like a Dragon </em>games and their actual feeling.

Founded as a spinoff of charity bundle site Humble Bundle, Humble Games currently answers to Ziff Davis directly and has published over 50 games since it's launch including hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/slay-spire" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Slay the Spire"><em>Slay the Spire</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/void-bastards-review-comic-genius" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Void Bastards Review"><em>Void Bastards</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/unpacking" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Unpacking"><em>Unpacking</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/temtem" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Temtem"><em>Temtem</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/signalis" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Signalis"><em>Signalis</em></a>.</p>
<p>Reports began emerging this afternoon on Linked In as people posted they had been laid off, with eventually a clearer picture emerging that the publisher was under going major changes, and that 36 people had been laid off. According to Nicola Kwan who was part of Business Development at Humble Games, the team was informed at 9 AM this morning that they were being let go and the company was shutting down.</p>
<p>While early reports had placed it that Humble Games was being shut down, an official statement from Humble Games shared the following:</p>

<p>Nicola was far from the only Humble Games employee posting on LinkedIn or other social media about their job loss, or the closure of the publisher.

<p>Ava Kris Tyson has announced she will be leaving the Mr Beast team following a recent slew of allegations pertaining to grooming an inappropriate behavior.</p>



<p>Taking to Twitter, of which Ava has recently deleted of her past posts, she said, “I would like to apologize for any of my past behavior or comments if it hurt or offended anyone. It was not my intent. Seeing recent events we’ve mutually decided it’s best I permanently step away from all things MrBeast and social media to focus on my family and mental health.”</p>



<p>In the past couple of days, Aca Kris Tyson has faced numerous allegations of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ava-kris-tyson-predator-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grooming and sending inappropriate sexual messages to a minor</a>.</p>



<p>Mr Beast, or anyone from his team, has yet to officially comment on the allegations and Ava Kris Tyson’s departure from the team.</p>



<p>Countless streamers, content creators, and other personalities have since voiced their opinions on the situation. Popular streamer <a href="https://x.com/pokimanelol/status/1815787489778655664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokimane said</a>, “I don’t know all the details regarding the ava situation but i wanna make it clear: any inappropriate behavior towards minors is unacceptable, regardless of who you are.”</p>



<p>As the days continue, more and more accusations and allegations continue to be released about Ava Kris Tyson. However, one of the original accusations was that Ava Kris Tyson was sending inappropriate messages to a 13-year-old. Since then, though, that person has said that these accusations are “massive lies and twisting the truth.”</p>

While it used to be revenue from sales of boxed copies at GameStop and Walmart, it’s now overwhelmingly from sales of digital downloads on console storefronts. Publishers like Electronic Arts don’t even make most of their money from game sales at all, but rather from “recurring revenue,” AKA microtransactions in online multiplayer and free-to-play games like <em>Madden</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>.</p><p>“Back then before the PlayStation 4 was released, you’d be lucky to get five to 10 percent of digital sales for a AAA game,” Daniel Ahmad, director of research and insights at Niko Partners, told <em>Kotaku</em> in an interview. “Today, depending on the title, you know, it can be as high as 80 percent but it could also be as low as 40 percent.” He noted that while the average breakdowns overwhelmingly favor digital downloads (with platforms like PlayStation reporting annual digital revenue splits over 70 percent), it can still vary a lot on a case-by-case basis.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/annual/2023/annual_2023_01.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/annual/2023/annual_2023_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In its annual report this year</a></span>, Capcom revealed that roughly 89 percent of the games it sells are digital copies. It expects that number to reach close to 94 percent in 2024.

Do I think physical sales might get lower over time? Sure, but will it ever completely go away? I don’t think so.”<br></p><p>Aggregate data can sometimes obscure small but substantial wrinkles in popular trends. While it’s true that physical games have become a niche market in the broader gaming landscape, a shift accelerated by the pandemic, Early also pointed out that even a small slice of a big pie can mean a lot of money. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamesindustrybiz-presents-the-year-in-number-2023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamesindustrybiz-presents-the-year-in-number-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a<em> GamesIndustry.biz</em> infographic</a></span> using Newzoo data, only 17 percent of console gaming revenue in 2023 was from boxed games, but that still came out to $9.5 billion.

But the difference is even more stark when you compare breakdowns of physical sales to digital sales for games that have retail copies. Based on his estimates, Switch owners bought physical copies over digital 60 percent of the time in the first quarter of 2024.</p><p>“When it comes to digital sales as a whole it’s absolutely massive,” Ahmad said more generally. “But if we look at just the physical versus digital split for games that are released physically, then yes, it’s lower than that 70 percent number and two, it definitely skews higher for AAA and first-party games, especially during the holiday season, where gifting is a notable part of it.”</p><p>And even as some big games like<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> and <em>Alan Wake II</em> have initially skipped physical copies at launch, smaller games and indie releases that were previously digital-only are partnering with companies like Limited Run Games to get physical editions printed and into the hands of their hardcore fans. “I think there’s always going to be a demand for physical media,” Limited Run CEO Josh Fairhurst told<em> Kotaku</em> in a recent interview. “We see that with music, things were starting to feel like it was going to go all digital, and then vinyl kind of exploded, because people were starting to see kind of the downsides of digital purchasing not actually owning the music.”</p><p>He said the audience for that is definitely the biggest on Switch and smallest on Xbox, estimating that for every Xbox version of a physical game Limited Run sells, two are purchased on PlayStation and 10 are bought on Nintendo’s platform. In addition to the physical connection fans feel to the products going back to the NES and PS1 days, he thinks fears about the lack of digital preservation also drive physical collecting.</p><p>“I think that’s kind of going to happen more and more as time marches on and more services end up shutting down for whatever reason, because there’s always going to be something newer, bigger, better coming out that will eventually out mode, whatever the current popular model of distribution is,” Fairhurst said. “I think people are going to get frustrated when they see their digital purchases evaporate.”</p><p>That’s not necessarily the case as much for Xbox, where a majority of console sales this generation have already been for the disc-less Series S and millions are subscribed to the Netflix-style rental service Game Pass. Fans now routinely share photos online of almost all-digital Xbox sections at stores like Target and Best Buy where cards with download codes have replaced plastic game cases. Big first-party releases like <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em> have skipped physical editions, and earlier this year a number of physical editions of small games by third-party publishers appeared to be canceled. Meanwhile, leaked plans pointed to Microsoft at one point working on a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-all-digital-disc-drive-leak-game-pass-1850857060&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-all-digital-disc-drive-leak-game-pass-1850857060">discless mid-gen refresh for the Series X</a></span>.</p><p>Earlier this year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer told <em>Game File</em> the company wasn’t planning to abandon physical media. “I will say our strategy does not hinge on people moving all-digital,” he said. “And getting rid of physical, that’s not a strategic thing for us.” But analysts all think Xbox will be the first console to ditch discs entirely. Circana analyst Mat Piscatella <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1804933759537700886&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1804933759537700886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted earlier this year</a></span> that he expected Microsoft to go all-digital soon, with Sony following the one after that, and Nintendo having at least two more hardware generations with physical media.</p><p>“Physical, as long as there’s disk drives on the console, is never going to go fully away, there’ll always be demand for it, as long as it’s part of the console package,” Ahmad said. “But if, for example, Xbox decides to exclude a disc drive next generation, like we saw with the all digital Series X, they’re unlikely to see a negative material impact on earnings given how niche physical sales are on the platform today.”</p><p>And even when companies continue to support physical formats, the advantages of them are continuing to erode. Where discs and cartridges used to be plug-and-play, they now need to install on the console and often require massive day-one updates. It might be weeks or months before important bugs are fixed or highly requested gameplay features get added in post-launch patches. “With that in mind, a lot of people will say ‘I’ll just get the digital version’,” Ahmad said. “It’s just the same thing, but more convenient.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/summer-road-trip-fortnite-rocket-league/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rocket Racing is reintroducing Inferno Island, with players being able to participate in Casual Racing, a new game mode. This allows players to take part in the Rocket Racing event without high stakes and have a relaxing time. Along with this update comes five brand-new Epic-made tracks, with two additional tracks created by 404 Creative.</p>
<p>The Casual Racing around Inferno Island has a hand-crafted playlist where players of all skill levels can mingle and participate in races together without worrying about trying to come first or with the pressure of it affecting your rank. These races are also a great way to ease yourself into the game before you start participating in ranked games.</p>
<p>Rank resets are coming, with the new ranks being based on your final ranking during the season. At the time of writing, players can now begin to participate in quests and challenges across <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-cursed-sails-event-now-live/">Fortnite</a> and Rocket League in the Summer Road Trip to work their way up to unlocking the Tesla Cybertruck.</p>
<p>For those playing Fortnite and planning on taking the Tesla Cybertruck for a spin, you'll have to complete quests to get the Tesla Cybertruck bundle and the Summer Road Trip <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/unlock-the-cybertruck-in-fortnite-by-goin-on-a-summer-road-trip-with-the-squad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive Baja Off-Road Decal for the Tesla Cybertruck</a>.</p>
<p>From July 23 through to July 31, there will be unique quests and challenges to complete daily. Nine quests must be completed, but you will have until August 3 to complete them all to unlock the rewards. By completing the quests for the Summer Road Trip event in Fortnite, you'll gain access to rewards such as the Underworld Camo Wrap, Sun Sign Back Bling, and Beast Mode Cybertruck Boost.</p>
<p>For those getting stuck into <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/unlock-the-cybertruck-on-a-rocket-league-summer-road-trip">Rocket League</a>, there are three challenges players need to participate in to unlock the Tesla Cybertruck bundle for themselves. Challenge one begins on July 23 and finishes on August 6. Challenge two starts on July 26 and finishes on August 6. Finally, the third challenge begins on July 31 and finishes on August 6.</p>
<p>If you decide to participate in the Rocket League Summer Road Trip, you can unlock a multitude of decals for your brand-new Tesla Cybertruck. In addition, if you miss out on the event, you can purchase the decals from the item shop for a limited time between August 7 and August 21, except for the Baja Off-Road Decal. The challenges for both games are relatively simple, with most of them asking you to participate in a certain number of games or earn a specific amount of XP.</p>
<p>The Baja Off-Road Decal is exclusively earned by completing the Summer Road Trip event in Fortnite or Rocket League.</p>
