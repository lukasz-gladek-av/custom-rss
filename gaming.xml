            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163463/netflix-most-viewed-tv-movies-2023<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="NxcGlP">In the wake of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23893273/wga-hollywood-writers-strike-tv-movie-contract-explained">WGA union contract negotiation</a> last fall, which demanded greater transparency over what was getting watched on streaming services, the typically secretive Netflix opted to start sharing viewership numbers on a regular basis. “This has been on a continuum for several years,” co-CEO Ted Sarandos told <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/netflix-biannual-viewership-data-report-licensed-content-1235834922/">Variety</a> last December, suggesting the streamer’s first ever “What We Watched” engagement report was just its way of playing catch up and not at all about being held accountable by the industry. <em>Sure, Jan</em>, etc.</p>
<p id="YKKQ4j">The initial report revealed just how essential licensed TV and movies remained to a platform that was <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/netflix-spending-budget-originals-licensing-content-shows-streaming/">proudly spending oodles</a> on original content. The story to be found in the <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-the-second-half-of-2023">second report</a> issued on Thursday, which breaks down viewership and streaming hours in both film and television categories from July through December 2023, is more about the surprises: things one might assume were blockbuster hits for the streamer were more like modest wins, while less obvious projects apparently scored big. Also, Gal Gadot is a Netflix star.</p>
<p id="gAeTpD">Did you see <em>Heart of Stone</em> when it dropped last August? Slick action movie starring Gadot as super spy [checks] Rachel Stone? Not a movie that comes up a lot in conversation. (For what it’s worth, we dug it well enough <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23824292/heart-stone-gal-gadot-netflix-movie-locations-stunts">thanks to some fairly savvy stunts</a>.) But despite its lack of cultural footprint, the latest from the studio and star that brought you <em>Red Notice</em> was a pretty notable hit for Netflix; according to the engagement report, 109.6 million people viewed the movie in the first five months on the platform. That outranks movies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23989691/netflix-leo-adam-sandler-animated-movie-vs-vijay-tamil-musical"><em>Leo</em></a>, the down-the-middle kid’s flick starring Adam Sandler, David Fincher’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23860173/the-killer-review-david-fincher-netflix-thriller-michael-fassbender"><em>The Killer</em></a>, and even the holiday-timed platform release of <em>Super Mario</em>. Oh, and 27 million people also caught up with <em>Red Notice — </em>the <em>Heart of Stone</em> effect is real!!</p>
<p id="RIKdSE">There was an even bigger winner for Netflix as far as movie output is concerned: the apocalyptic chamber drama <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23992542/netflix-leave-the-world-behind-review"><em>Leave the World Behind</em></a>, starring Julia Roberts and Mahershala Ali, which garnered 121 million views without an action movie price tag. Both <em>Leave the World Behind</em> and <em>Heart of Stone</em> trounced what was supposed to be Netflix’s giant holiday blockbuster, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24001958/rebel-moon-part-one-child-of-fire-review-zack-snyder-star-wars"><em>Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire</em></a>, which rounded out at 57.8 million. While Zack Snyder’s movie might see a bump in the next round of number-crunching thanks to the recent sequel, it’s not a <em>great</em> look to be dominated by 2017’s <em>The Boss Baby</em> in the charts.</p>
<p id="n9f3Pp">On the TV side, no one series was able to eclipse the hit movies based on pure viewership, but there do appear to be winners. Unlike Netflix’s previous live-action anime experiment, <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, viewers actually showed up for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23852346/one-piece-live-action-netflix-adaptation"><em>One Piece</em></a>, which clocked 541.9 million hours of view time in its first season (against 71.6 million views). Compare that to <em>The Witcher</em> season 3, a marquee series that appears to have struggled with only 363.8 million hours (and 47.9 million views). Netflix’s TV chart also saw wins from non-fiction and international programming — with Korean series making up nine percent of the total viewership across the entire platform. </p>
<p id="L3ZjkM">There are tons of wild stats in the engagement report and plenty of conclusions to be made as the streaming industry enters its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24135254/rebel-moon-2-scargiver-review">cost-cutting, bundle-chasing, corporate-strategy-shake-up era</a>. You can read the entire report on <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-the-second-half-of-2023">Netflix’s corporate site</a>. </p>

  <p id="s7WsXi">Hunter Schafer is an actor from <em>Euphoria</em> and <em>The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em>, and she’s also a model. <a href="https://www.vogue.de/artikel/hunter-schafer-coverstory-interview">A recent shoot for Vogue Magazine</a> depicts Schafer in a variety of gorgeous outfits, but one accessory in general has drawn the collective attention of gamers everywhere: the Nintendo Switch. One photo depicts Schafer lounging on the floor, resting between her couch and a coffee table held up by a cherub. She’s gazing off into the distance with a Switch in her hands.</p>
<p id="RZ0jzK">This raised immediate questions from concerned citizens. The Switch is in portable mode; she needs to be looking at it in order to enjoy some gaming. Is it possible that Schafer was thinking of the Wii U? What could lead to such an apparent oversight?</p>

<p id="aBzM6U">Some gamers were quick to come to Schafer’s defense, pointing out that they play the same way. Who among us hasn’t wound up on the couch, watching TV while playing the Switch, eventually tumbling to the ground while in the depths of a gamer fugue?</p>

<p id="n4iEFj">Other fans were just enthused to see Schafer participating in gaming at all. Some suggested that she could play Princess Zelda in an upcoming project.

<p id="B0Gylf">Personally, I find Schafer’s gaming posture to be entirely authentic. I’ve found myself in all sorts of awkward positions while playing the Switch, and I’ve certainly been in similar situations. Sometimes, you’re playing <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> and listening to a video essay, only glancing up when the narration indicates there’s an important visual. </p>
<p id="nS2XWg">Alternatively, perhaps Schafer is employing the pro-gamer move of looking away from the Switch during a long loading screen. I certainly have employed a similar tactic so I don’t have to see my own face, unflatteringly reflected back in the Switch’s black screen. Whatever the case, I hope we see more gaming-themed props in Vogue shoots in the future. I feel like there’s a lot of possibility there, and the reaction to Schafer’s shoot shows that gamers are invested in a console’s role in the high fashion industry. </p>

He is presumably talking to Cayde-6, a character who was killed off in 2018’s Forsaken expansion and with whom Zavala had a close relationship (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-nathan-fillion-cayde-6-alive-1850472259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-nathan-fillion-cayde-6-alive-1850472259">who is returning and will be voiced, once again, by Nathan Fillion</a></span>).

Over the course of some months though, Zavala’s role in the story diminished, and players understood before long that they’d probably heard the last of Reddick’s posthumous work. Beginning with <em>The Final Shape</em>, David is taking over the role, and though he has a commanding voice and certainly has the gravitas, Reddick’s unique take on the character he originated will be missed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/mario-64-sm64-speedrun-record-button-challenge-wii-1851497252<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How many hours would you stand around in <em>Super Mario 64</em> waiting to do something that’s never been done before? Five? Ten? A whole day? A speedrunner who goes by Marbler recently clocked in over 80 hours with the Nintendo classic to be the first ever player to beat it without pressing the jump button even once. This incredible feat required meticulous planning and waiting several days for a platform to slowly rise.</p><p>Video game speedruns are known for their wild glitches and the harrowing dedication of the players behind them, but few rise to the level of complexity and diligence required to complete them as <em>Super Mario 64</em>’s “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-man-who-does-the-impossible-in-super-mario-64-1656869221&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-man-who-does-the-impossible-in-super-mario-64-1656869221">A Button Challenges</a></span>,” which see players aim to complete the game (or specific stages) with as few presses of the jump button as possible. Jumping is integral to the design of the game’s 3D levels and the hunt for its collectible stars, so naturally speedrunners have long wondered how few jumps they could get away with and still complete the game.</p><p>The history of the challenge <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXbJe-rUNP8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXbJe-rUNP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dates back decades and is full of incremental discoveries and improvements</a></span>. While there are specific strategies developed for various stars and particular sections of the game, much of the difficulty revolves around the precise use of Mario’s other inputs, including the B button mid-air dive, to maneuver through intricate levels. Marbler completed a two A button press run of <em>Mario 64</em> last fall and has worked with the rest of the community to eliminate those two presses and achieve a true zero-jump, 70-star run.</p><p>On the original Nintendo 64 version of the game, speedrunners have gotten down to a single full A button press, which includes half-presses that get rounded down. But on the Wii Virtual Console version, thanks to some idiosyncrasies of its tech, zero is possible, though it requires going after some harder stars like red coin one for Big Boo’s Haunt. Often, speedrunners use software to map out what’s theoretically possible in a game before trying to enact it themselves. That wasn’t an option for Marbler’s zero-button-press run in <em>Super Mario 64</em>. This makes his latest run even more remarkable; it was performed in real-time by a human before it was ever simulated by a machine.</p><p>“The significance of [this run] is pretty big in my opinion, at least for the ‘A Button Challenge’ (ABC),” he told <em>Kotaku</em> in a Discord interview. “There hasn’t even been a tool-assisted-speedrun (TAS) made of a zero A press run of the full game because the standards for TASes in the <em>Super Mario 64 </em>community is that it must be able to play back on console. Wii Virtual Console has a plethora of issues that make this pretty much impossible for all but the shortest of TASes.”</p><p>There are two pivotal moments in the zero-A-press run. The first comes in the Fire Sea, a section of the game where players collect red coins in a lava pit on their way to the second of three Bowser encounters. Normally, players must use moving platforms to jump onto a green pole to climb to the next section. Navigating the obstacle course without jumping takes an incredibly long time but is possible <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-mario-64-trick-that-takes-three-days-to-complete-1826576332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-mario-64-trick-that-takes-three-days-to-complete-1826576332">thanks to how the Wii does math</a></span>.</p><p>That’s because every time the console converts a double value to a float value it truncates the extra bits, “effectively rounding such calculations towards 0,” Marbler explained. “[This] means the platforms (which use a double to float calculation for a sine wave oscillation) will slowly tend towards the center of the level,” he said. “After 78 hours, they’re high enough to bypass the pole entirely.”</p><p>That section would take even longer–roughly eight whole days–if not for another trick Marbler uses called “vertical speed conversion.” Making Mario land in certain ways lets him conserve momentum which can then be used later to get launched upwards. “I set the console to run and forget about it for 6 hours, then I return to it and touch the lava, which gives Mario a crazy amount of vertical speed, and land from it immediately to conserve it,” he said. “From there, I move forward by only punching until Mario is right at the edge of the platform, and let it run for another 72 hours.” Once he returns, he’s able to clip through the wall to get where he needs to go.</p><p>The second make-or-break moment comes near the very end when facing Bowser for the final time in the sky. It’s less about patience and more about precise execution. Players have to ascend a long maze of platforms which is normally impossible to do without jumping. A trick called the Chuckya drop, however, makes it possible to bypass the hardest section of the level without a single A button press. Further painstaking refinements to the strategy made it possible for Marbler to do the entire thing in real time.</p><p>The Chuckya is a purple enemy with red gloves that picks Mario up and throws him in semi-random directions when he gets close. But it’s possible to manipulate the enemy into throwing Mario exactly where he needs to go, it’s just very hard and was only theoretical until Marbler pulled it off. The speedrunner could write a fifteen-page academic journal article on how the trick works. I’ll try to break it down as straightforwardly as possible.<br></p><p>As Marbler explained, most enemies in <em>Super Mario 64</em> has a certain amount of logic programmed into it to avoid walking off ledges. That logic goes out the window if the Chuckya is in the air. The enemy also bounces when it falls. By getting the Chuckya to walk down a slope, the game essentially treats it like it’s falling and bounces it just slightly so that the game also thinks it’s in the air. When in the right spot, the Chuckya can toss Mario exactly where he needs to go. Actually setting that scenario up is much more complicated, especially since it’s entirely out of view during the whole process.</p><p>Normally, the Chuckya will chase Mario until he moves behind it, at which point it stops, waits, and then turns back toward Mario. To manipulate this behavior, Marbler relies on <em>Super Mario 64</em>'s very short draw distance. Once the Chuckya is just beyond the limits of what the game will render, it goes into a state of “limited updating functionality.” It continues “going through the motions of the chase” but won’t actually move or be subject to gravity. This allows players to get the Chuckya to fall off the ledge, freeze it in place, turn him in the right direction, reactivate the chase, and get him to where he needs to go to make the speedrun’s most important maneuver possible.<br></p><p>The final piece of the Chuckya puzzle is the 1/32 chance of being thrown in the right direction. Not leaving anything to chance, Marbler can manipulate this part of the enemy’s behavior as well. The enemy has a failsafe built in where it will die if it reaches an out of bounds part of the map. Before that happens, it will turn for 15 frames to try and get back on track. Using this reflex to his advantage, Marbler can make sure the Chuckya doesn’t throw Mario until there’s a floor in front of it.</p><p>“This brings the chance of a successful throw up to 16/32, and in addition to this, the place it lands it just so happens that there are two extra angles that work to keep Mario alive, for a grand total of an 18/32 (56.25%) chance of success on the throw,” he told <em>Kotaku</em>. “Not ideal to have RNG at the end of such a difficult trick, but a hell of a lot better than a 3% chance.”</p><p>The final run clocked in at 86 hours and 48 and a half minutes. That’s over three days total but just nine hours of actual gameplay, a drop in the bucket compared to how much time Marbler said he spent practicing. “If I had to guess, I’d say practice by itself was probably somewhere in the 150-200 hour range, with research and strat development coming in somewhere around 50-100 hours.”</p><p>For everyone watching live, it was more than worth it. Viewers began spamming the chat with “I WAS HERE” after Marbler successfully pulled off the Chuckya Drop Throw. By then it was clear they were watching history unfold before their eyes. “Dude it’s done,” he said during the stream once the credits started rolling. His next goal? Start practicing for the full 120-star challenge.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A gorgeous color palette, lovingly crafted characters and environments that look like an arts-and-crafts project, and an almost tangible feel to the visible fold lines on the screen are wonderful to behold.

And that’s the game—well-designed puzzles in a beautiful art style packaged into a roughly seven-hour experience that doesn’t overstay its welcome. It’s as simple as that, and while there are some shallow elements to the game, it nails the most important part of enjoyable puzzle design.<br></p><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,196805,195301" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>The big selling point of <em>Paper Trail</em> is its unique approach to puzzles. The game takes place in a 2D world viewed from above that you navigate through from screen to screen a la a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-link-past-pc-port-emulator-reverse-engineered-1850057475&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-link-past-pc-port-emulator-reverse-engineered-1850057475">classic <em>Zelda </em>title</a></span>. But here the path is always impeded by a broken bridge, missing platforms, or some other obstacle. To overcome these obstacles, you can fold the pieces of the screen in on itself. Imagine each screen is a collection of flat paper pieces and that your job is to make <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-the-origami-king-the-kotaku-review-1844379684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-the-origami-king-the-kotaku-review-1844379684">origami</a></span> out of them. </p><figure id="" data-id="efe65e4f4d89081e869207510f947a74" data-recommend-id="image://efe65e4f4d89081e869207510f947a74" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman rolls a boulder across a folded screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman rolls a boulder across a folded screen" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Newfangled Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="efe65e4f4d89081e869207510f947a74" data-recommend-id="image://efe65e4f4d89081e869207510f947a74" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman rolls a boulder across a folded screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>By folding the screen at its corners and edges, you’re able to reveal the underside of the map and connect it in ways that let you progress forward. That starts simple, with puzzles just requiring you to fix a single path, but<em> Paper Trail</em> slowly adds new twists to the formula. Later levels introduce mechanics such as boulders that hold paper down and platforms that can swivel. Each new addition forces you to think a little more about how everything in the game works together to solve a puzzle.<br></p><p>The narrative push behind the puzzles comes in the form of the plucky protagonist Paige, a girl leaving home to live a life of academia. Her studies revolve around physics concepts like folding space, the skill that lets her manipulate the world and solve the game’s puzzles. <em>Paper Trail</em> regularly tries to put the narrative in the forefront in the form of short storybook sections that require you to fold through scenes, but the story is pretty shallow and doesn’t add to the experience. If anything, those moments are just a distraction from the main event. </p><figure id="" data-id="65a2f8332bffe7629bb650ae1cd6ee92" data-recommend-id="image://65a2f8332bffe7629bb650ae1cd6ee92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman stands in a swamp next to two kids in a boat" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman stands in a swamp next to two kids in a boat" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Newfangled Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65a2f8332bffe7629bb650ae1cd6ee92" data-recommend-id="image://65a2f8332bffe7629bb650ae1cd6ee92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman stands in a swamp next to two kids in a boat" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That creates an imbalance that could be a problem for some players. If you come to<em> Paper Trail </em>expecting a fun puzzle game intercut with an interesting narrative, you’ll be disappointed. This is a puzzle gauntlet. Every single screen you pass through is just another challenge. Solve one and another awaits ad infinitum. It’s akin to the equally delightful but relentless <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/dungeons-of-dreadrock&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/dungeons-of-dreadrock"><em>Dungeons of Dreadrock</em></a></span>, which is itself a marathon of puzzles with no rest.<br></p><p>I personally don’t have a problem with that, and find the challenge of solving one puzzle after another to be what makes<em> Paper Trail </em>enjoyable. But even I have to take it in short bursts. If anything is going to pull you through this game, it’s not the narrative or the world, but rather your own desire to complete these challenges and experience the satisfaction they bring. Even the gorgeous art style might not be enough for some, but for those who do find joy in the endless folding screens of<em> Paper Trail</em>, it is the cherry on top. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fragbite Group, a Swedish-based corporation, <a href="https://fragbitegroup.com/mfn_news_en/fragbite-group-declares-subsidiary-fall-damage-studio-bankrupt/?lang=en">has filed for bankruptcy</a> for its development studio Fall Damage. The $3.63 million filing comes months after Fragbite acquired Fall Damage in October 2023 for $1.86 million.</p>



<p>The reasoning for the bankruptcy, Fragbite says, is due to not being able to find a publisher for Fall Damage’s 4v4 shooter Alara Prime. The game was set to be free-to-play and release in 2024.</p>



<p>“Since the fall of 2023, Fall Damage has had multiple dialogues with potential partners regarding the publishing of the game ALARA Prime,” Fragbite said. “This process has been extensive, involving many counterparts, and despite receiving very positive feedback on the game’s quality and potential, the subsidiary has not yet been able to fully complete it within the necessary timeframe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This has led to an unsustainable financial situation.”</p>



<p>There has been no mention as if there will be any layoffs because of the declaration. However, Fragbite says that it and its other subsidiaries will continue business as usual. Development of Alara Prime will also continue and is “on schedule”.</p>



<p>Lastly, discussions about finding a publisher for the game remain ongoing.</p>



<p>Fall Damage was formed in 2017 by former DICE developers Markus Nyström, Dan Vaderlind, Mikael Kalms, and Anders Gyllenberg.</p>

<p data-characters="208" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Admiral Bobbery is on his last legs in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> </em>Chapter 5. His final wish is to taste that sweet, sweet (I assume) Chuckola Cola. This starts a quest that can be somewhat confusing.</p> <p data-characters="153" data-current-count="153" data-injectable="false">He’ll tell you that his own stash of the drink probably washed up with the rest of the ship. This should take you back to the crew’s camp and Flavio.</p> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">Talk to Flavio, and he’ll admit to having the Chuckola Cola but will refuse to give it up unless you bring him a tropical fruit. You probably wouldn’t be here if you already found this, so let’s proceed with the assumption that you haven’t.</p>
 <p data-characters="40" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false">What Flavio is looking for is a coconut.</p> <figure data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-a-coconut-in-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door" data-injectable="false">Where to find a coconut in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</h2> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true">The tricky part of finding a coconut in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> is that the camera won’t cooperate. To get one, you’ll need to go back to the suspension bridge where you saw the crewmates (including Admiral Bobbery) getting attacked by ghosts.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">It doesn’t really show it, but on either side of the bridge, if you walk toward the camera, you’ll drop down onto a platform. You’ll find a couple of gaps over water that are too wide for Mario to cross on his own. You’ll need to partner up with Yoshi and use their flutter jump to cross safely. You’ll make it to a pipe which will spit you out in the background.</p> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">You’ll find yourself on another island on the backdrop. There’s a single palm tree there. Walk up and hit it with your hammer. It will drop the two coconuts. Grab them, then head back to Flavio.</p>
 <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="199" data-injectable="false">Flavio will complain about your gauche choice of fruit (fun fact: coconuts are actually considered a fruit) but will hand over the Chuckola Cola. Take this back to Bobbery, to fulfill his final wish.</p> <p data-characters="136" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">Spoiler alert: Bobbery won’t actually die. This is a Mario game. He’ll simply fall asleep. Wake him up, and he’ll join your party.</p> <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="false">Here’s an interesting fact: While the drink you fetch is called Chuckola Cola and is a reference to the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi </em>games, it’s actually not intended to be that. In the Japanese version, it’s referred to as “Vintage Red,” which would suggest it’s a wine. This wasn’t changed in the Switch port and still remains as Chuckola Cola.</p>

  <p id="BjUw3I">Warhammer Skulls is an annual convention that focuses on announcements and updates for the various video games under the Warhammer umbrella. There’s a surprising variety of video games in this catalog, especially since Warhammer refers to both the fantasy and sci-fi settings of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, Age of Sigmar, and Warhammer 40K. While some fun Easter eggs and crossovers were announced, the event also featured some pretty hefty announcements. Here are the five biggest news stories out of this year’s Warhammer Skulls.</p>

<p id="giujzs"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23989600/rogue-trader-warhammer-40k-crpg-combat-characters-impressions"><em>Rogue Trader</em></a> is a massive CRPG, and while it had its fair share of bugs and balance issues, developer Owlcat Games has spent the time since launch ironing those wrinkles out. A new 15-hour campaign is on the way, integrated with the main story. The expansion, called Void Shadows, largely takes place on the the von Valancius war-ship. </p>
<p id="FmYsXF">Players can meet (and possibly romance) Death Cult assassin Kibellah, coordinate with new high-level officers, build a new hangar for void combat, and uncover a xenos conspiracy aboard their ship. Owlcat also announced that <em>Rogue Trader</em> will now be supported on Steam Deck, which makes playing through this massive game much easier — or much more mobile.</p>

<p id="wXYvoA"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus </em>is a solid, if somewhat underappreciated XCOM-style strategy game. Today, Kasedo Games and Bulwark studios announced that there will be a sequel, <em>Mechanicus 2, </em>for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X. While the first game only let players take the role of the tech priests of the machine cult known as the Adeptus Mechanicus, the sequel allows players to take the side of the ancient machines known as Necrons.</p>
<p id="NB1gLK"><em>Mechanicus 2</em> will have multiple campaigns, taking place around the awakening of a Necron tomb world. The player’s choices determine the ultimate outcome of the war, with <a href="https://www.blacklibrary.com/">Black Library</a> writer Ben Counter helming the narrative. While this sequel was unexpected, it’s certainly a pleasant surprise.</p>
<h3 id="73VZMF"><strong>Darktide and Vermintide 2 are both getting updates</strong></h3>

<p id="xTiNUS"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23484765/warhammer-40k-darktide-review-release-date-left-4-dead-classes-pc-xbox-series-x"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</em></a> takes place in the bowels of a hive city, pitting rejects pulled straight from jail against the endless tides of the disease god’s minions. The next update will arrive on June 25, and it’s called Secrets of the Machine God. The update includes new weapons and a new mission, where players explore an abandoned Mechanicus research station.</p>
<p id="BtBJAx">The update will also include a new event called Hestia’s Decollation Crusade. Players will be asked to eliminate the generals commanding swarms of heretics, in exchange for in-game currencies.</p>
<p id="t74B9z">For those who prefer squashing rats in a fantasy setting, Fatshark’s other co-op horde shooter game is also getting an update. <em>Vermintide 2</em> will receive a quality-of-life update with lots of changes: a new loadout system, changes to Chaos Wastes and the Winds of Magic, weekly expeditions, updates to the Chest of Trials, 30 new boons, and more.</p>
<p id="qSQxc1"><em>Vermintide 2 </em>is also launching an in-game event that will run from May 23 to June 9, during which players can earn time-limited rewards. Fatshark is debuting the first playable boss on test servers, which are charmingly called Returning Alpha Test — or RAT. Players who are interested in trying out the Bile Troll boss fight can join those test servers between May 30 and June 9.</p>

<p id="3feJ9A">Focus Entertainment and Saber Interactive shared a new trailer showing off the multiplayer modes available in <em>Space Marine 2</em>, which is currently set to be released on Sept. 9. Players can tackle the campaign as a team in the three-player co-op mode, allowing their friends to take the role of Titus’ supplementary Ultramarines.</p>
<p id="mitRAg">The PvP game mode from the first <em>Space Marine</em> is set to return as well, with three 6v6 game types called Annihilation, Seize Ground, and Capture and Control. The co-op elements of the game will have classes; for instance, the stealthy Sniper has a camo cloak, whereas the tanky Bulwark uses a combat shield on the front lines. There are also some fun customization options, allowing players to make their own custom chapter of Space Marines.</p>

<p id="qIRvSA"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em> is a charming, bloody boomer shooter that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23733394/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review-sternguard-veteran">I enjoyed more than I expected</a>, and Auroch Digital has now revealed a new expansion to the game. Forges of Corruption includes new environments, enemies, and weapons. Players can pick up a new edition of <em>Boltgun</em> that includes the Forges of Corruption content, or they can buy the DLC separately. Forges of Corruption will launch on June 18, along with a free horde mode update, a navigation guide to prevent players from getting lost, and various bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements. </p>

Getting insight into how these characters see Senua and their world is a really great way to understand the different nuances and emotional contours of this game. </p><p>Astridr, the solitary and fiercely protective leader Senua encounters in the Bardarvik chapter, for example, talks a bit about her family in a way that helps shine more of a light on who she is. Of course she does talk to Senua a bit about her life before things took a turn for the worse, but hearing it from her directly through narration fleshes her story out even more. </p><p>As I’ve been playing with the “Others” narration on (which you can either choose at the start of a new game or at any time in the game’s audio settings following completion of the narrative), I’ve almost come to wonder if <em>this</em> is the way <em>Senua’s Saga</em> ought to have been. True, the main narrator establishes a nice sense of cohesion with the first game, but given how much the Furies—the voices Senua hears in her mind—add to the regular gameplay, and essentially narrate and comment on what’s going on, hearing other characters really makes the experience a little more narratively dynamic. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-saga-steam-deck-pc-graphics-black-dots-1851491857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-saga-steam-deck-pc-graphics-black-dots-1851491857">How To Make The Most Of <em>Hellblade II</em>’s Graphics On PC</a></span></p><p>Also, if you discover all of the “loresingr” unlockables, you’ll unlock Druth, Senua’s spiritual companion from 2017’s <em>Senua’s Sacrifice</em>. </p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning shows a crossed-out eye." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning shows a crossed-out eye." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h12231"><a id=""></a><em>Senua’s Saga</em> is a dense narrative that becomes more clear the second time through</h2><p>A lot happens in <em>Senua’s Saga</em>. And upon my second playthrough, particularly during the opening brawl with Thorgestr, I was struck by what Senua sees in him and eventually decides to do following the fight—especially the similarities between how this fight ends and how the final boss fight of the game concludes. Flash forward to the walk to Freyslaug, and there were lines that stood out to me more this time around. Here’s one in particular: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Thorgestr</strong>: Do you see these graves? This is how we honor our dead. There will be no one to bury you. </p><p><strong>Senua</strong>: You haven’t honored these graves. What happened?</p><p><strong>Thorgestr</strong>: I told you…Draugar. They won’t just kill you. It is far worse. It is what they do after. They…You still have a chance to save your life if you stop now.</p><p><strong>Senua</strong>: Is it my life you’re trying to save?</p></blockquote><p>This exchange happens after Thorgestr says how much he wishes Senua would’ve drowned when the ships crashed and how he plans to kill her after he gets free from her. Yet, here she is highlighting the fact that there is some part of him that is concerned for her own safety, speaking to his humanity that is buried under his blind devotion to his father and myopic perspectives. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ninja-theory-hellblade-new-game-greenlit-microsoft-1851490677&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-theory-hellblade-new-game-greenlit-microsoft-1851490677"><em>Hellblade 2 </em>Studio Reportedly Already Working On Its Next Game</a></span></p><p>So much of <em>Senua’s Saga</em> is about changes in perspective, different ways of seeing “reality,” that a line like this, given where the story goes, bears so much weight. There are many other examples like this in <em>Saga</em> that, for me anyway, become more apparent upon a second playthrough.</p><h2 id="h12232"><a id=""></a>If you haven’t already, consider using subtitles on subsequent playthroughs</h2><figure id="" data-id="c0be778fe09e63e1c9a01e7f8cf97fc4" data-recommend-id="image://c0be778fe09e63e1c9a01e7f8cf97fc4" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An animated gif shows Thorgestr warning Senua about a nearby village while the voices she hears tell her to keep going." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An animated gif shows Thorgestr warning Senua about a nearby village while the voices she hears tell her to keep going." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0be778fe09e63e1c9a01e7f8cf97fc4" data-recommend-id="image://c0be778fe09e63e1c9a01e7f8cf97fc4" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An animated gif shows Thorgestr warning Senua about a nearby village while the voices she hears tell her to keep going." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On my second playthrough, I’ve found subtitles to be a pretty effective way of focusing on what individual characters say to one another. Senua’s “Furies” interject constantly, which does get distracting.I think that’s the point, but having actual lines of dialogue to read (the Furies’ lines are displayed on the appropriate sides of the screen to emulate the experience of hearing them on either side of you) can help you focus a bit on exchanges like the one highlighted above. </p><hr><p><br><em>Senua’s Saga</em> is a journey of complex emotions and events, many of which take on new tones and meaning upon revisiting. Whether you’re up for playing <em>Hellblade II</em> again immediately after hitting the credits, or after letting it exist in your mind for a while, the second time around is certainly worth the effort if you’re looking to soak up all that this game has to offer.   </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft’s free-to-play title XDefiant achieved 1 million unique players within two and a half hours of its launch, sources have told Insider Gaming. At one point, half a million concurrent players were logged in to the game on launch day. Admittedly, that’s a lot of players who had to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-servers-plagued-with-problems-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wait in the menu due to server issues</a>. However, the problems were resolved around eight to ten hours after launch. </p>



<p>The milestone makes XDefiant Ubisoft’s fastest-ever game to reach 1 million unique players.</p>



<p>The numbers don’t end there, either. At the time of writing (48 hours after launch), the game has just over 3 million unique players and around 300,000 concurrent players across all platforms. </p>



<div><p>It’s difficult to gauge just how successful that makes XDefiant, but for context, Respawn Entertainment’s hugely popular Apex Legends, which was released in 2019 on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, amassed 1 million unique players in eight hours and 2.5 million within 24 hours.</p><p>Granted, the game is free to play, and its success will not depend on player numbers but on the revenue it generates from its Battle Pass and in-game cosmetics. The Battle Pass is competitively priced compared to other titles on the market, but in-game cosmetic prices are on the steep side, which is a sentiment that has been expressed by the community as a whole online. For example, one bundle named the ‘Phantoms Prototype’ will set you back 2900 X coins, which will set you back around $30 for four cosmetic items… Ouch.</p></div>



<p>As for where the game is now, Ubisoft is happy, and the game is well on its way to surpassing all of its internal milestones in terms of player numbers. However, whether or not the game can retain those players and make them spend their hard-earned money remains to be seen.</p>

                <p>Just like in previous seasons and new expansions, big changes are coming to several of Destiny 2's Exotic armor pieces in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-release-date-new-exotics-and-everything-we-know/1100-6517377/" data-ref-id="1100-6517377">The Final Shape</a>. Bungie has outlined plans to adjust 19 Exotics across all Guardian classes, bringing them up to date with the game's current state and preparing them for the new Prismatic subclass when The Final Shape launches.</p><p><a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/tfs-armor-tuning-preview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bungie says</a> it has focused on updating Exotic armor and armor mods to reference a player's equipped Super element instead of a specific subclass, allowing those effects to work more smoothly with Prismatic. This in turn will allow their effects to function on Prismatic without changing their behavior on the original subclass. Some of the changes outlined below are very good, with Khepri's Horn, Mantle of Battle Harmony, and Triton Vice being the big winners here.</p>

      </div>
<p>The sad news is that some of the other Exotics are getting a nerf, and you'll probably recognize them for being very popular in Destiny 2, especially in high-level content. Cenotaph and Sunbracers are being hit particularly hard here because Warlocks can never catch a break in Destiny 2, especially after this week dropped a bombshell on players who specialize in popping <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-will-make-one-of-the-most-impactful-balance-changes-in-years/1100-6523652/" data-ref-id="1100-6523652">Well of Radiance</a> Supers for their fireteam.</p><p>In the Exotic weapons department, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-divinity-gun-is-getting-nerfed-in-the-final-shape/1100-6523497/" data-ref-id="1100-6523497">Divinity is also being significantly adjusted</a> in a big round of weapons fine-tuning for the expansion. On the bright side, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-resurrects-your-very-first-gun-as-a-new-exotic/1100-6523471/" data-ref-id="1100-6523471">the very first gun you ever used in Destiny 2</a> is getting its second Exotic overhaul. You can see the full list of changes below, which will come into effect after The Final Shape launches on June 4.</p><h2><strong>Hunter</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307325-prism-hunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307325" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307325-prism-hunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307325"></a><figcaption>Expect Triton Vice to be very popular with Hunters in The Final Shape.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307325-prism-hunter.jpg"></figure><p><strong>Triton Vice</strong></p><p>This Exotic will be a lot more flexible, as Bungie is tweaking it so that it'll no longer require a Glaive that matches your subclass to trigger its extra detonations. Glaive projectile final blows will always trigger a detonation matching your weapon's damage type, even if the Glaive does not match the equipped subclass. Additionally, the surrounded effect provided by Triton Vice while wielding a Glaive now lingers for five seconds even when you're not surrounded by enemies.</p><p><strong>Dragon’s Shadow</strong></p><p>When you use Ensnaring Slam or the new Ascension Arc aspect, this will trigger the effect of Dragon's Shadow.</p><p><strong>Foetracer</strong></p><p>The Exotic Hunter helmet now grants the bonus damage it inflicts on a target to your weapons, and the damage type matches that of the ability used to harm your target. Bungie says Prismatic will apply a variety of different damage elements with your abilities, which in turn allows Foetracer to buff multiple different weapon damage types.</p><p><strong>The Sixth Coyote</strong></p><p>Inspired by the Warlock's Claws of Ahamkara Exotic gauntlets, The Sixth Coyote will create Orbs of Power from final blows after you use your class ability.</p><p><strong>Renewal Grasps </strong></p><p>This armor has been updated to grant the new Frost Armor from the Stasis subclass. By entering your Duskfield Grenade volume, you or your allies gain a stack of Frost Armor, and additional stacks will be generated every 0.9 seconds.</p><p><strong>Star-Eater Scales</strong></p><p>Bungie is adjusting Star-Eater Scales to balance the effort required to gain its powerful effects, given how it easy it is to currently create orbs of power. You'll need six orbs of power to gain its maximum benefits--up from four--and the increased Super energy gained per orb of power when the Golden Gun is equipped has been reduced by 75%.</p><h2><strong>Titan</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307326-prism-titan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307326-prism-titan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307326"></a><figcaption>Titan players are getting some of the best Exotic tweaks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307326-prism-titan.jpg"></figure><p><strong>Ursa Furiosa</strong></p><p>These furry gauntlets are being fine-tuned to improve the new Void Aspect Unbreakable. They'll provide increased movement speed and Super energy while guarding with Unbreakable attached.</p><p><strong>Eternal Warrior</strong></p><p>This Exotic helmet no longer requires an Arc subclass for Arc final blows to gain its escalating weapon damage bonus. Bungie says this allows it to synergize with Prismatic builds more easily, and the bonuses for the Fists of Havoc Super will remain unchanged.</p><p><strong>Armamentarium</strong></p><p>A plain Exotic that simply granted a second grenade charge, Armamentarium will also create orbs of power from grenade final blows after The Final Shape launches.</p><p><strong>Khepri’s Horn</strong></p><p>Bungie thought that Khepri's Horn felt underwhelming in many situations, so the potency of its Solar blast effect has been increased. In PvE, this damage has been increased by 100%, it'll apply Scorch stacks every time it hits a target, and it'll greatly from the Ember of Eruption and Ember of Ashes Fragments.</p><p><strong>Heart of Inmost Light</strong></p><p>Mechanically, Heart of Inmost Light will remain the same, but on a functional level, it'll be a lot more user-friendly. The Exotic armor will now display a consolidated status effect icon in the HUD, instead of the lines of text it currently floods the screen with.</p><p><strong>Synthoceps</strong></p><p>To reinforce the idea that Synthoceps works best when you're surrounded, Bungie will reduce the amount of time that the Bionic Enhancements effect lingers after you're no longer being surrounded, from eight seconds to five seconds.</p><p><strong>Severance Enclosure</strong></p><p>Because this is seen as a "particularly noisy Exotic" by Bungie, the plan here is to reduce the explosive effects by requiring a line of sight to damage enemies. The knockback intensity will also be reduced and enemies will be launched vertically by this Exotic.</p><h2><strong>Warlock</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307327-prism-warlock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307327-prism-warlock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307327"></a><figcaption>Not too many Warlock Exotics are being changed for now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307327-prism-warlock.jpg"></figure><p><strong>Mantle of Battle Harmony</strong></p><p>Good news! This Exotic armor will grant more Super energy for defeating powerful enemies and the cooldown on granting Super energy has been removed.</p><p><strong>Ballidorse Wrathweavers</strong></p><p>This will be updated to grant the new Frost Armor effect when you activate your Rift, and activating Winter's Wrath shatter attack grants nearby allies the maximum amount of stacks of Frost Armor. When your Winter's Wrath ends, you gain maximum stacks of Frost Armor.</p><p><strong>Secant Filaments</strong></p><p>Empowering Rift will reset your Devour buff duration back to 11 seconds when you enter it.</p><p><strong>Verity’s Brow</strong></p><p>A big change here is that this Exotic now requires final blows with a weapon matching your grenade's damage type, instead of needing to match your equipped subclass. Theoretically, this will work better when you use your Prismatic subclass.</p><p><strong>Sunbracers</strong></p><p>The Michael Bay of Exotics, Sunbracers will still allow you to do crowd control, but its explosive firepower is being toned down slightly. Solar grenade duration is being halved to two seconds and the grenade recharge rate will allow for a maximum of four grenade charges, down from five.</p><p><strong>Cenotaph Mask</strong></p><p>Because this funky helmet generates far more Heavy ammo than is "healthy" for the sandbox, Bungie is making a few nerfs to this Exotic. Multiple players using Cenotaph Mask will no longer trigger its effect when they use a single enemy as a target and Cenotaph's target-lock visual marker will be hidden for the Exotic's wearer. The mark will only appear to the wearer’s allies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/23/tmnt-mutants-unleashed-collectors-edition-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Earlier this year, <i>Game Informer&nbsp;</i>revealed the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/03/05/exclusive-first-details-and-screenshots-of-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">exclusive first details</a> and screenshots of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game set after the events of 2023 film,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem</em>. Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector's Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.</p>

<p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector's box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector's Edition will set you back $200.</p>

</article><p>Oddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector's Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you're not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you're in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.</p>

<p data-characters="266" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Focus Entertainment and Auroch Digital <a href="https://youtu.be/QFXyo_yKM1I?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have announced</a> that there’s a (paid) DLC expansion incoming for 2023’s <em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em>. <em>Forges of Corruption</em> will feature new enemies, weapons, and environments, and it’s coming June 18, 2024 to PC and Consoles.</p> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false"><em>Warhammer 40K: Boltgun</em> was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-warhammer-40000-boltgun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty far off</a> from being my favorite game of 2023. In particular, my biggest issue with it was its confusing and weak level design. However, it still left a big impact on me. Its weapon sound effects are incredible and being a big, stompy-legged war machine felt great. Despite all its problems, I still felt the need to recommend it.</p> <figure data-current-count="662" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun - Forges of Corruption Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFXyo_yKM1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">In fact, I’m definitely interested in this DLC. Beyond giving the developers a chance at highlighting the gameplay with some (hopefully) better level design, I’m excited to see whatever new weapons get thrown our way. To be specific, they’re adding the Multi-Melta and Missile Launcher. <em>Boltgun</em> didn’t have a missile launcher already? I can’t remember. I suppose the eponymous Boltgun is technically a rocket launcher already, as explained to me by a reader.</p>
 <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">The <em>Forges of Corruption</em> campaign will take us back to Graia, which is a bit of a shame since I’d rather see something that isn’t just one big industrial planet. The new enemies you’ll be facing are the Helbrute and the Terminator.</p> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">On top of but separate from the upcoming DLC, Auroch Digital is also adding a horde mode. A staple of the modern FPS, horde mode has you facing off against endless waves of enemies. The horde mode will be free to all players, whether they purchase the DLC or not.</p>
 <p data-characters="143" data-current-count="143" data-injectable="false"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun </em>is available for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. <em>Forges of Corruption</em> releases on June 18, 2024.</p>

        <p>And it's assembled a team to do it.</p>

            <p>
The Sims 4 is getting on a bit these days, and, as regular players will know, the whole thing - which includes over 70 bits of DLC piled onto the base game over the last 10 years - is starting to feel a bit creaky. And that's something EA has finally acknowledged, confirming it's now assembled a team specifically to tackle the 'frustrating' technical issues amassed over time.
</p>
<p>
EA made the proclamation in a <a href="https://x.com/TheSims/status/1793661216319308202">statement shared on social media</a>, telling the community, "We know that technical issues with The Sims 4 have interrupted your gameplay over time and we recognise that this has caused you much frustration."
</p>
<p>
"Today we can share that we have assembled a team to invest in the core game experience," it continued, "including tackling your reported concerns." EA says its new taskforce will result in more fixes arriving at a greater frequency, with the first of these patches due later this month.

<p>
Some of the fixes in May's patch are detailed on EA's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/laundry-list-may-23-2024">Sims 4 "laundry list" page</a> and cover the base game and various expansions. In classic Sims fashion, there are some real eyebrow-raisers here - including fixes to prevent Sims autonomously wanting to buy mini goats and fixes to prevent teens from flirting with household members - and EA says to expect further improvements not detailed.
</p>
<p>
"Our goal is to fix more reported concerns, both big and small, over the next six months and beyond to check off more boxes on our Laundry List," it adds. "This is our first release, with others following roughly every two months."
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4 community is, of course, delighted EA to hear is finally pledging to put a greater focus on bugfixing, and especially delighted it's only taken the publisher ten years to get around to it. As noted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/">game's subreddit</a>, at least one of the bugs on EA's laundry list has been loitering around for nearly eight years, so, you know, it'll be nice to get that one sorted.
</p>
<p>
That said, The Sims 4's endless cascade of DLC continues this summer - EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-getting-ready-for-a-summer-of-sexy-updates-starting-with-swimsuits">recently announced a "summer of love"</a> featuring a "flirtatious expansion and two kit packs - so it's unlikely the bugs are going to stop piling up anytime soon. Especially seeing as The Sims 4's free-to-play successor - currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-gets-another-airing-as-ea-shares-more-early-development-experiments">being referred to as Project: Rene</a> - still seems some way off.

			<p>We’ve known for a while that <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a> would feature campaign co-op, but today during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o5XfWlxkMQ&amp;ab_channel=Warhammer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer Skulls showcase</a>, a number of other multiplayer modes were revealed. These include the new “Operations” mode, a 3-player session-based co-op experience, and “Eternal War” a 6v6 PvP throwdown. These extra multiplayer modes will feature six classes, which you can upgrade and customize. Check out the new Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 trailer, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Multiplayer Modes Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cS22JKUVrzU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It certainly seems like Saber Interactive isn’t scrimping on Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 content, between the main co-op campaign and the additional multiplayer modes. Here’s a bit more detail about Operations mode and PvP…</p>
<p><em>“Old and new fans are in for a multiplayer treat! In addition to bringing back Space Marine’s iconic battle against the Chaos Space Marines in three 6v6 PvP modes (Annihilation, Seize Ground, and Capture &amp; Control), Space Marine 2 features an all-new co-op mode, letting you slay xenos with up to 2 friends in 3-player “Operations Mode.” Each PvE and PvP mode lets players choose between 6 available classes, ranging from the unflinching Bulwark and his Combat Shield to the stealthy Sniper and his Camo Cloak.</em></p>
<p><em>Players will also be able to customise their Space Marines, from helm to greaves, with a wide selection of colours, heraldry decals, pauldrons, gauntlets, and more! The Season Pass will grant them even more cosmetics, while new content like missions, enemies, and weapons will be available to all players through regular free updates.”</em></p>
<p>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 pre-orders are now open, and everyone who puts their money down early gets access to the “Macragge’s Chosen DLC.” Of course, there are also the usual dizzying array of ways to buy, including the $70 Standard Edition, $100 Gold Edition, $110 Ultra Edition, and an eye-watering $250 Collector’s Edition. Here’s what’s included in each…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24162810/haikyu-the-dumpster-battle-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="PNwZAk">It’s been four years since the last season of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/22152623/haikyuu-volleyball-anime-real-sports"><em>Haikyu!!</em></a> — a certified drought for fans of the sports anime and manga series, which follows an underdog high school volleyball team. Admittedly, long swaths of time between seasons is nothing new for <em>Haikyu!! </em>fans; there was a similar four-year gap between season 3 and season 4. But the wait time just stokes the fervor. The new movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24139099/haikyu-new-season-movie-trailer-karasuno-nekoma"><em>Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle</em></a><em> </em>— opening in theaters ahead of a Crunchyroll streaming release —<em> </em>basically picks up right at the end of season 4, and returns <em>Haikyu!!</em> to what it does best. Director Susumu Mitsunaka, who worked on the first seasons of the show, returns for this movie, which is essentially just a direct sequel to season 4 — and the beginning of the manga’s final arc.</p>
<p id="5Puymk">That makes it a fan-only proposition: If you already have an investment in the franchise’s volleyball teams and characters, this movie hits. And boy does it capture the epic highs of the show. It’s likely to fully reignite the fandom once again. </p>

<p id="XMVTSy">When we last left the Karasuno boys’ volleyball team, they were about to face off against their longtime rival, Nekoma High. But even though the two schools have historic beef, it all stems from a friendly place. Episodes in the first season showcased practice matches between the two teams, with a shared training-camp arc following in season 2. The show has fleshed out the Nekoma athletes and their relationships, both with one another and with members of the Karasuno team. At this point, the Nekoma team members are pretty much <em>Haikyu!!</em>’s secondary characters, since we know so much about them. That makes the movie’s pivot to their side of the net make total sense.</p>
<p id="ESs6OE">Most of the movie centers around the Nekoma team, specifically their setter, Kenma Kozume. The film still spends time with the Karasuno team as they discuss strategy, with each of the main characters getting a chance to shine. But the story is mostly rooted in Kenma’s point of view, diving into his relationship with the sport, his teammates, and his rivals.</p>
<p id="zWxmQb">One of the first things series protagonist Hinata Shoyo learns about Kenma in their initial season 1 meeting is that even though he’s a really talented setter, he doesn’t actually like volleyball much. He plays because his best friend, Kuroo, is the team captain, and because Kenma enjoys analyzing his opponents and determining the best strategy to win. But he isn’t particularly athletic, and he’d rather play video games than volleyball. After the first practice match between Karasuno and Nekoma, Hinata tells Kenma that one day they’ll play a match against each other that will make Kenma admit volleyball <em>is</em> fun. </p>

<p id="XiDWA4">The movie integrates this scene, as well as other flashbacks to the show, in case you need help remembering specifics about moments that first aired years ago. But these flashbacks aren’t really useful if you don’t already have knowledge of and investment in these characters.<em> The Dumpster Battle </em>truly is a continuation of season 4, not a separate movie in its own pocket dimension, à la <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24134207/spy-x-family-code-white-movie-review-anya">S<em>py x Family Code: White</em></a> or any of the Hunter x Hunter movies. </p>
<p id="Ti5Qik">It’s a culmination of Nekoma’s arc in the show — and Kenma’s. The Karasuno team is still the central focal point, and the movie is still about how far they’ve come since season 1. But it’s viewed through Kenma’s eyes as he strategizes how his team can win. Karasuno has evolved greatly as a team since the first time Nekoma faced them, and now they offer Kenma a tantalizing challenge, the first time he’s found opponents totally worthy of his talents throughout his entire volleyball career. True to <em>Haikyu!!</em> fashion, the current match is interspersed with flashbacks from Kenma’s life, particularly when it comes to his relationship with volleyball, building out his motivations and making his current arc resonate even more.  </p>

<p id="TlpARR"><em>Haikyu!! </em>has always excelled at showing each player and team’s individual relationship to the sport, emphasizing that both teams deserve to win. There’s never an outright antagonist, even as Karasuno, the audience POV team, faces increasingly talented competitors. They’re all athletes bound by the love of their sport. </p>
<p id="SLMmFj">By the end of <em>The Dumpster Battle</em>, it’s hard <em>not</em> to cheer for Kenma, and the Nekoma team too, even though the end of the match seems like a foregone conclusion. (Karasuno has that protagonist plot armor.) We’ve learned so much about Nekoma from the show, and the movie weaves all that previous investment together with the current match, and with Kenma’s flashbacks to his relationship with volleyball. It’s an emotional journey across the board. (Er, court?) The way Kenma’s passion for the sport evolves, and the way the team members’ relationships with each other and with Karasuno manifest, is its own kind of win. Maybe it’s an even more satisfying type. </p>

<p>It’s been a while since Valve launched a new game. Their last title was Half-Life: Alyx in 2020. Before that, Dota 2 in 2013. They’re not the most active game development studio, but they positively affect the gaming community all the same. But we’re all eagerly awaiting what’s next from the team, and it appears we have our answer. It’s a hero-based shooter known as Deadlock. But more importantly, what is the Deadlock release date?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-deadlock">What is Deadlock?</h2>



<p>Deadlock is supposedly a 6v6 hero shooter in which you’ll take on the role of one of many playable characters, with a roster that includes robots, wizards, and creatures of all types. You’ll utilize various weapons to deal long-range damage, cast healing abilities, and help your team with buffs and tools to win the match. Alongside the usual active combat, players will participate in tower defense gameplay, too.</p>



<p>It’s similar in style to, say, Overwatch or, more recently, Ubisoft’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-dedsec-in-xdefiant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a>. Although, Valve’s offering appears more lighthearted and whimsical, like their past titles, such as Team Fortress 2.</p>



<p>Speaking of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/6-best-games-you-can-play-for-free-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Fortress 2</a>, many fans within the community are worried that Deadlock will replace it. That’s unlikely, though. They’re two completely unique and separate titles with different gameplay and communities.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s extremely early days for Deadlock. As such, there is no current Deadlock release date available to the world, though there’s a rumor circulating that it’ll launch sometime in 2025.</p>



<p>However, knowing Valve, they’ll want the game perfect before launching worldwide. As such, we expect a delay or two before we see the full release!</p>

<p>While we wait for more news about Deadlock, check out what else Insider Gaming is up to these days:</p>

                <p>Stellar Blade is getting a new patch tomorrow, May 24, that will add a boss-rush mode as well as new costumes for its protagonist, Eve.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/23/stellar-blade-adds-new-boss-challenge-mode-on-may-24/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, the Boss Challenge mode lets you face off against 19 bosses. Progression in Boss Challenge also requires battle data from bosses you've previously defeated, so you'll need to have played the campaign and faced the bosses before. You can either choose to use your own gear collected during the campaign or pick from several preset loadouts. The minimal preset offers more of a challenge, while the maximum preset has all of Eve's skills and stats buffed up.</p>

      </div>
<p>There will be three new Nanosuit costumes for Eve. Those who complete the Boss Challenge on Normal difficulty or higher will unlock the Neurolink Suit. The White Kunoichi and Black Kunoichi suits will seemingly be added automatically when the update goes live.</p><p>Some quality-of-life improvements will come too. If you switch to ranged-attack mode and switch back to close-combat mode while locked on to an enemy, Eve will automatically lock on to the enemy again. There will also be a new option to always show the compass in the HUD.</p><p>Stellar Blade is available on PS5. Developer Shift Up recently revealed that it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-dev-is-considering-a-pc-port-and-sequel/1100-6523587/" data-ref-id="1100-6523587">considering a PC version of Stellar Blade as well as a sequel</a>.</p>

                <p>Atari finally won the oldest console war of all recently--even though most of us thought it ended decades ago. The company announced that it bought the Intellivision brand, best-known for being one of its main competitors in the earliest era of home consoles in the late '70s and early '80s.</p><p dir="ltr">According to a press release, Atari bought the brand and "certain games" from the existing company known as Intellivision Entertainment. That incarnation of Intellivision has promised the release of a new console called the Amico since late 2018, with a planned release date of October 2020. However, the Amico has been delayed multiple times since then for a variety of reasons, most notably the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> AN ICON RETURNS: The Atari 2600+</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Despite these setbacks, Atari says that the Amico console will indeed come out at some point in the future--through the company that formerly owned the Intellivision name--and that it will continue to support the mobile app Amico Home. Originally developed by toy company Mattel, the Intellivision reportedly sold an estimated 5 million units. The best-known Intellivision games are mostly arcade ports (as was common at the time), such as Burger Time, Q*bert, and the Pac-Man clone Lock 'N' Chase. Atari released the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-2600-preorder-guide/1100-6517171/">Atari 2600+</a> last year, a reimagining of the classic console that plays original VCS and 7800 carts, as well as all-new games.</p><p dir="ltr">The Amico is closely associated with former Intellivision CEO Tommy Tallarico, a controversial figure in the games industry who bought a stake in Intellivision in 2017. In 2022, well-known YouTuber Hbomberguy released a lengthy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twDETh6QaI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video essay</a> that covered a number of apparently false (and often bizarre) claims Tallarico has made over the years, including exaggerating the number of games he worked on, as well as being the first American to work on Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/deals/24163208/secretlab-warhammer-40k-gaming-chair-ultramarine<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="CvasH7">Secretlab’s latest licensed gaming chair design is a chair that would do Roboute Guilliman proud. Modeled after the colors of the Ultramarines’ chapter of the Adeptus Astartes, this latest iteration of the Secretlab Titan Evo gaming chair is now available to pre-order from Secretlab, and is estimated to ship by Oct. 7. Priced at $624, this version of the ubiquitous gaming chair comes equipped with all the same features as the stock model of the Titan Evo, but its royal blue patent leather is covered in rich detail worthy of any son of Guilliman.</p>

<p id="QhRkhg">In addition to the crest of the Ultramarines emblazoned on the front and back, you’ll also find a pattern of bolts, vents, and plates designed to emulate the Tacticus power armor of a proud member of the Ultramarines. Topping it all off is a purity seal, giving this chair the emperor's blessing.</p>

<p id="5PLkGB">Like previous versions of the Titan Evo, this version features a generously padded bucket seat in addition to fully adjustable back and lumbar supports and armrests that are height and width adjustable. This licensed version of the Titan Evo is also compatible with the full spectrum of Secretlab gaming chair accessories including the magnetic headrest, swappable armrests, and casters.</p>
<p id="mLLe0e">While I’m personally more of a Chaos Marine main myself, a chair of this caliber will serve nicely until Secretlab can fashion me a throne from the skulls of my enemies. </p>

But one in particular has caught the eye of the games industry, as it shows her playing a Nintendo Switch, but in a way that seems a bit odd.<br></p><div data-video-id="196805" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Hate This FF7 Rebirth Character’s Whole Vibe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="93" data-playlist="196805,195905,196646" data-current="196805"><div><p>I Hate This FF7 Rebirth Character’s Whole Vibe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196805/196805_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196805/196805_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196805/196805_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196805/196805_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22362.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>The “play anywhere” mantra has been key to the handheld/console hybrid device since it launched in 2017. In Schafer’s case, the “anywhere” is on the ground between a couch and a coffee table. Honestly, that’s deeply relatable to me as someone who would like to rot and play video games wherever the compulsion strikes, and sometimes that’s on the ground in inconvenient places. But in the photo, she’s holding her Switch and looking at something off-screen. The shot almost reads like she’s using the Switch as a controller for a game on a television. That would have worked for a Wii U, which has a handheld tablet as a controller but typically displayed the main action on a TV. The other option is that she’s playing her Switch on the floor, but is watching something on the TV. Who among us hasn’t been grinding out an RPG on our Switch while marathoning something on Netflix? That’s a universal experience.</p><p>The photo intentionally plays up the silliness of Schafer’s position, as we’re all prone to lose all concept of sitting comfortably while playing games. So the internet weighed in to praise the realness of gamer rot and also wonder just what could she be looking at. What could she be playing? This is where I’d ask you to weigh in about what game she’s playing, but our comments are still turned off. So just ponder it internally, for now.</p><p>Personally, I hope she’s playing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a></span> in preparation for one day being cast as Princess Zelda in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-zelda-movie-mario-switch-marvel-1851000791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-zelda-movie-mario-switch-marvel-1851000791">live-action movie Nintendo greenlit</a></span>.

The publisher has announced it will hold another June showcase this year on June 7 at 5:00p.m. Pacific Time, and this year it's birthday party-themed.</p><p>The showcase will supposedly celebrate the 15th birthday of Devolver Digital's mascot Volvy, a weird little guy that Devolver <a href="https://www.devolverdirect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced last year in its 2023 showcase as a gag on the idea of a retro mascot making a return</a>. Devolver Digital itself, as a company, turns 15 on June 25 of this year.</p><p>In celebration of, well, something's birthday, Devolver promises to shower "partygoers with a big handful of gaming gifts, including updates and release dates for upcoming titles as well as some exciting new reveals." Currently, Devolver has a number of announced games still in development including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ape-out-creators-next-game-baby-steps-gets-a-release-window-of-next-summer">Baby Steps</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/neva-official-reveal-trailer-playstation-showcase-may-2023">Neva</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/human-fall-flat-2-official-reveal-teaser-trailer-devolver-digital-showcase-2023">Human: Fall Flat 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-crush-house-preview-thirst-person-shooter">The Crush House</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This year's Devolver Direct-er, Volvy's Birthday Party will last approximately 20 minutes. If you've never watched one of these events before and intend to tune into this one, prepare for it to get a little strange. In addition to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/devolver-direct-2023-everything-announced">aforementioned mascot "return" last year</a>, Devolver's events have included <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/devolver-direct-conference-2021-summer-of-gaming-pony-island-inscryption">parodies of massive gaming conferences</a>, subscription service japes, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/devolver-summer-showcase-2022-everything-announced-revealed">a malfunctioning mecha Suda51</a>, and a "marketing countdown to marketing." Who knows what this year will hold?</p><p>Devolver's event will take place over a busy weekend both online and in Los Angeles. Folks tuning in digitally can catch showcases from Ubisoft, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-june-2024-xbox-showcase">Xbox</a>, and the all-encompassing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2024-date-and-livestream-details-officially-announced">Summer Game Fest</a> all covered here on IGN, while folks in LA can check out our own <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-event-june-2024-la-gaming">IGN Live fan event</a> featuring developers, publishers, creators, and more across both gaming and entertainment. </p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/23/atari-announces-intellivision-brand-acquisition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Acquisitions have been rampant in the games industry recently. While the prime example on everyone's mind is likely <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/13/microsoft-has-officially-acquired-activision-blizzard-for-69-billion">Xbox's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which&nbsp;confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.</p>

<p>Atari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming," chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand," CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. "We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms."</p>

<p>Atari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/mr-run-and-jump/the-rewards-of-repetition">Mr. Run and Jump</a> and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration/a-half-century-of-gaming-history-stuffed-into-an">Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration</a>. For more on Atari's outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/09/22/90-minutes-with-atari-ceo-wade-rosen-all-things-nintendo">here</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="336" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Hellblade 2</em> is almost entirely a linear experience. Barring some <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/can-you-remove-the-black-bars-in-hellblade-2/">slight changes</a> in how you tackle combat or how quickly you <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-open-the-village-gate-in-hellblade-2/">solve puzzles</a>, each player gets from point A to point B in the same way. That is, except for one specific moment near the end of the game. Here’s whether you should help Fargrimr or Astridr in <em>Hellblade 2</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-should-you-go-with-fargrimr-or-astridr-in-hellblade-2" data-injectable="false">Should you go with Fargrimr or Astridr in Hellblade 2?</h2> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true">This choice appears when proceeding through the Jarnvior forest near the end of <em>Hellblade 2.</em> As you progress, you’ll link back up with your companions who are experiencing their deepest fears come to life. Senua partially helps both Fargrimr and Astridr with their issues, but then comes upon a crossroads where she must choose who to help. The one who’s lost his way, or the one who fears what can’t die by the blade.</p>
 <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">While this may seem like a big choice, who you choose here doesn’t affect the main story in any meaningful way. You’ll help one of them navigate the forest for a few moments before finding the other down the path, shaken up but no worse for wear. After meeting up with Thorgestr, the story proceeds as if the choice never came up.</p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="711" data-injectable="false">While it is a little sad that neither choice matters, it’s likely Ninja Theory just wanted to test your thoughts on who you’d help in that situation more than making you decide who lives or dies. If you had to choose between someone who could no longer fight for themselves and someone who could no longer see the path forward, who would you choose to save?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-you-can%E2%80%99t-pet-the-dog-in-hades-2-yet.879774/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hades-2-pet-the-dog<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is a dog in <em>Hades 2</em>. You might know him already; you might not. A lot of people have been asking if you can pet him. Let me go ahead and clear things up for you: You cannot. For now.</p><p><strong><em>Hades 2</em></strong><strong> spoilers follow.</strong></p><p>Cerberus is back in <em>Hades 2</em>, but sadly, he’s not having a great time! Zagreus is out of action, Hades is imprisoned, and their loyal hound is wandering the Fields of Mourning, which – in fairness – is about as good as it gets if you’re feeling a little down and want to go cry (or rampage) about it. Unlike in the first <em>Hades</em>, you’ve got to fight this warped version of the three-headed hell hound, but if you manage to bring him down – and not <em>put </em>him down; a crucial distinction – he snaps back to his senses. Afterward, you can find him chilling with a chained-up Hades, who is also about as glum as they come.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, <em>Hades 2</em> does give you the option to try to pet Cerberus. However, if you press the button, the game informs you that Cerberus refuses, and then he pushes you back with some sort of dog-anger forcefield. You can attempt to pet him each time you encounter him during a run, but the result will always be the same.&nbsp;</p><p>Bear in mind that <em>Hades 2 </em>is currently in early access, so at some point in the future, Cerberus might start barking a different tune. I’m writing all of this not to craft some kind of SEO-chasing guide to harvest clicks from desperate dog lovers, but rather because it occurred to me today that it feels like Supergiant is purposely delaying gratification here – in a game where you can already pet almost every other creature. Frinos the frog, Toula the cat, Hecate’s dog and polecat – <em>Hades 2</em> is an all-you-can-pet buffet. But Cerberus, who you could pet after nearly every run in the first <em>Hades</em>, remains conspicuously off-limits. It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chekhov's dog pet</a>. Eventually, something must come of it.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Hades 2 WHAT HAPPEN IF YOU PET CERBERUS" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bOqIaV5_NXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This says to me that Supergiant is setting up an emotionally-devastating dog-petting moment, one for the ages. And they’ve begun the setup <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hades-2s-creative-director-says-we-expect-to-be-in-early-access-at-least-through-the-end-of-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at least half a year in advance</a>, which might be some kind of record. Supergiant’s narrative chops in mind, I imagine The Pet will land for players no matter when they started <em>Hades 2</em>, but I bet it will end up meaning the most to folks who began playing during early access, when giving the traumatized canine a reassuring pat on the head(s) was truly impossible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As with <em>Hades 1</em>, this is <a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-technical-test-early-access-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of what makes <em>Hades 2</em>’s mad dash through early access interesting</a>. No matter how much Melinoë rages against Chronos’ clockwork machinations, she’s stuck in an endless loop. The story, at least for now, is about how she and other characters cope with that fact. But it won’t always be! And then all we’ll have of this version of the story is our memories. We’ll talk about those memories with those who were – and were not – along for this part of the ride, and they’ll take on greater significance still. Together we’ll make a myth, or at least something resembling one.&nbsp;</p><p>So no, you can’t pet the dog in <em>Hades 2</em> yet, but when you finally can, that single button press is gonna go <em>crazy</em>.&nbsp;Hopefully we'll <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-you-can-only-pet-one-of-cerberus-three-heads-in-had-1845106210" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be able to pet all three heads</a> this time.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Naughty Dog might have hit a snag with The Last of Us Online, which was officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> in December 2023 after being labeled <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-is-naughty-dogs-most-ambitious-project-ever-says-neil-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most ambitious project</a> the studio had ever conceived.</p>
<p>Naughty Dog chose to stick with its highly successful formula of making narrative-driven single-player games rather than invest a great deal of the studio's resources for many years in the continued development and support of a live-service game.</p>
<p>Despite this failed endeavor, the studio's millions of fans are still very much looking forward to the next project. Today, Naughty Dog co-president and head of creative Neil Druckmann talked a bit about it in an interview <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published on Sony's website</a>. Druckmann called it the most thrilling project he has worked on yet and teased it may redefine the mainstream's perception of gaming.</p>
<p><em>I've been lucky to work on several dream projects and am currently excited about a new one, which is perhaps the most thrilling yet. There's a growing appreciation for gaming that transcends all age groups, unlike when I was growing up. This shift is highlighted by our venture into television with The Last of Us, which I hoped would bridge the gap between gamers and non-gamers. The show's success has spotlighted gaming, illustrating the rich, immersive experiences it offers. This visibility excites me not only for our current project but for the broader potential of gaming to captivate a global audience. I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.</em></p>
<p>His statement is as intriguing as it is vague. Is he referring to an even bigger focus on cinematic flair and narrative-driven gameplay? Be that as it may, it's probably still going to be a while before we learn anything concrete about Naughty Dog's new game, even though it's been four years already since The Last of Us Part II. Until an official reveal comes, we'll have to stick with such cryptic teases.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[How Animal Well and Lorelei and the Laser Eyes fostered puzzle-solving communities]]></title>
            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24163189/animal-well-lorelei-laser-eyes-puzzle-game-communities</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-animal-well-and-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-fostered-puzzle-solving-communities.879759/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163189/animal-well-lorelei-laser-eyes-puzzle-game-communities<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="dg0J3J">If you’re a puzzle game fan, you’ve had one heck of a month. Within a span of two weeks, two of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24114511/best-puzzle-games-play-ios-android-windows-playstation-xbox">2024’s best puzzle games</a> — or, simply, best games — were released with Big Mode’s <em>Animal Well</em> and Simogo’s <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>. The puzzles couldn’t look or play more differently: <em>Animal Well</em> is a platformer that prioritizes environmental puzzles, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24156522/animal-well-metroidvania-not">somewhat like a Metroidvania</a>, while <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is a puzzle box disguised as a walking simulator, pulling together logic, math, physics, and language puzzles. And yet, both games are labyrinthian mazes with tons of mysteries and secrets; the way <em>Animal Well</em> gates off puzzles until you find a very specific item mirrors the way <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes </em>withholds a key piece of information until you’ve opened the right book or unlocked the correct door. For games that look nothing alike, the act of playing them — and solving their most mysterious puzzles — feels undeniably similar.</p>
<p id="ZWtzHY">Despite these similarities, I’ve found there’s something different about these games that’s manifesting in their two very different online communities. In <em>Animal Well</em>, I look to online communities like Reddit or the official <em>Animal Well</em> Discord for hints — that kind of mass collaboration is actually essential to solving at least one of the game’s puzzles (more on that later). But for <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, I’m turning to individuals — friends and family — who are willing to talk through some of the game’s most devious puzzles. </p>

<p id="NvZJwA">It’s partly because <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> doesn’t have an official Discord or an active Reddit page. I also think there’s something to the need for actual, real-time, one-on-one conversation and collaboration to solve <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>’ complicated puzzles. Simogo co-founder Simon Flesser told Polygon via email interview that online interactions, like those in an official game Discord, tend to be questions with direct answers — not back-and-forth conversations. Solving <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> collaboratively looks more like brainstorming answers for a crossword puzzle with your roommate, while <em>Animal Well</em> feels like digging for secrets in online forums.</p>
<p id="jTMURa">“We definitely want to enthuse communication between players and internally,” Flesser said. “Solving puzzles and problems is much easier when you verbalize and reason about the issue at hand. We think this type of social aspect is really interesting, especially as it doesn’t even need to happen while you are playing the game.”</p>

<p id="o6cGZK">[<strong>Ed. note</strong>: The following paragraph contains spoilers for a late-game puzzle in <em>Animal Well</em>.]</p>
<p id="GcNidp">Flesser said he was impressed by <em>Animal Well</em> and its necessity for collaboration with a larger community — <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-well-contains-a-hidden-puzzle-that-requires-at-least-50-people-to-complete">at least 50 people</a>. Basically, this game includes a 50-piece jigsaw puzzle, but a single player gets a single piece. A community of players must combine their pieces to put together the puzzle and unlock something else in the game. It’s impossible to complete alone, and it’s very unlikely you’ll be able to amass enough real-life friends to put this together. (At least, I certainly don’t know enough people playing <em>Animal Well</em>, let alone have that many friends to begin with!) A Discord server is not only nice to have when playing <em>Animal Well</em>, but downright necessary.</p>
<p id="joPoo0">Meanwhile, The Gamer features editor Tessa Kaur called <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/trust-me-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-is-a-party-game/"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> a party game</a> — and I agree. There are lots of puzzles, and lots of different types of puzzles. While I may be good at some more standard, video game-esque environmental puzzles, I’m awful at math and word problems. Thankfully, I have two sisters — one who excels at word problems and another who specializes in logic, math-based puzzles. (Then there’s me, who can push buttons on my Steam Deck.) Playing <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes </em>with their help was a lot of back-and-forth, one of us suggesting a solution for me to input. No luck, and we’d try again, working through the logic of whatever puzzle we were on. At times, my sisters weren’t even in the same room as I was. </p>
<p id="qDxZXv">The first time I asked for assistance, I texted my family group chat with a screenshot of a word problem, captioned with just two words: “Please help.” (Unfortunately for my family, the text arrived before the screenshot, leaving my family worried I was in actual danger, not just mental anguish.) My sister, a teacher, quickly solved the actual problem, with an explanation of how it’s done. “Word problems are big in fifth grade,” she added. Like Flesser said, the social aspect of the game continued even though my sisters weren’t <em>technically</em> playing it — I was. </p>

<p id="LhELV9">It was a really interesting exercise in understanding how each of our brains worked through <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> puzzles. This sort of collaboration works in <em>Animal Well</em>, too, but it’s a kind of collaboration that’s only relevant to other people actively playing the game: I can’t ask my mom or sisters what to do with <em>Animal Well</em>’s yo-yo, for instance. There’s no way for them to understand the context, whereas in <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, I can easily screenshot a puzzle for help. Neither sort of collaboration is better than another; they’re just different. It’s something Flesser finds interesting about watching other people play Simogo’s games: “It’s always fascinating to learn how any mechanic or specific part of a game will resonate with a larger group of people. A lot of times a component that seemed very basic to us will feel really special to other people.”</p>
<p id="hovFyZ">He continued: “The level ‘Parallel Universes’ in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/23/20880283/sayonara-wild-hearts-review-music"><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em></a> was a good example of this. That applies to puzzles too: It’s interesting to see how people think, and if the puzzles do what they intend to. I think a real good puzzle should be like a good joke; they should lead the player down one straight path, and then suddenly have a funny twist or turn.”</p>
<p id="SnzxYP">If that’s the metric by which we’re thinking about <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> or <em>Animal Well</em>, both are real good puzzle games — ones that their communities, regardless of whether they exist online with strangers or in the kitchen with your family, will be talking about for quite some time. </p>
