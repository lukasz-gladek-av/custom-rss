<p>After eight years, Escape From Tarkov is finally leaving beta as the release date for Version 1.0 has been announced.</p>



<p>In a trailer posted online, Battlestate Games revealed that Escape From Tarkov 1.0 will launch on <strong>November 15, 2025</strong>. The release comes over eight years after it first entered beta and 13 years after initial development began. </p>

<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-escape-from-tarkov-1-0">What to Expect From Escape From Tarkov 1.0</h2>



<p>While no details of what will be in 1.0 were given with the announcement, past reveals should give players an idea of what to expect. First thing’s first, Escape From Tarkov 1.0 is expected to include a dedicated storyline that will see you actually attempt to, as the name suggests, escape from Tarkov. Escaping will then see your character reset, starting things fresh. </p>



<p>In addition to the storyline, elements such as clans and more factions are also slated to be added. Lastly, a vast amount of gameplay updates and changes to mechanics, maps, weapons, and more should come.</p>



<p>Currently, you can buy Escape From Tarkov on PC for $50 for the Standard Edition for the game. There are three other editions, including a $250 “Unheard” Edition that gives access to future DLC, Escape From Tarkov: Arena, and the game’s PvE mode. </p>



<p>Are you excited to finally see what Escape From Tarkov version 1.0 looks like when it launches in November?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bungie studio head and chief executive officer Pete Parsons has announced that after 23 years with the studio, he is stepping down from his role and leaving the studio, and will be replaced by chief development officer Justin Truman.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch">blog post on Bungie's official website</a>, with Parsons saying he is "<em>passing the torch</em>" to Truman, whom he has "<em>full confidence"</em> in as the person to move Bungie forward. Parsons has been the studio head since 2015, and has overseen the studio through some of its biggest highs, including the initial launch and success of Destiny 2, and more recently, its greatest lows, with multiple <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">plagiarism cases</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">several rounds</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/">mass layoffs</a>, and a significant amount of internal turmoil, with former Bungie employees pointing the blame for all of Bungie's woes <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/">directly at Parsons and the rest of Bungie leadership</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Today marks the right time for a new beginning. The future of Bungie will be in the hands of a new generation of leaders,"</em> Parsons wrote.</p>



<p>For Truman's part, he reflected on his 15 years with the studio so far, as he moved from engineer, to designer, to producer, and to his current role before taking over as studio head as the chief development officer.</p>



<p>"<em>Across all of these different roles, Bungie’s purpose has stayed clear: 'We create worlds that inspire friendship</em>,'" Truman wrote. "<em>When we’re at our best – we create those worlds alongside you, our player community, and build something that matters. Something that’s worth your time, your passion, and your investment in us. Something that I’ve learned, hopefully,&nbsp;</em><em>overdelivers</em>."</p>



<p>Truman continued to briefly address the fact that Bungie has been having a rough go, to say the least, in recent years. To that end, Truman says he "<em>personally learned a lot over the years,"</em> and that he is "<em>committed to supporting and working alongside every member of the team here as we continue pouring our hearts and souls into these worlds. Worlds that we love, and that we hope have been worth your time and your passion. Because ultimately those worlds only exist, and thrive, with you in them."</em></p>



<p>Will this really be a time of change for Bungie going forward? Only time will tell, but seeing as how Truman is part of that leadership suite that former employees were blaming Bungie's issues on, it could be more of the same. Hopefully, those former employees, and everyone else who has lost faith in Bungie in recent years, can be proven wrong.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-cracker-barrel-logo-woke-trump-cooperate-greed-2000619204</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-new-cracker-barrel-logo-sucks-and-so-does-the-mess-around-it.1277682/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cracker Barrel is changing its iconic and famous logo for the first time in nearly 50 years. Sadly, the new logo sucks, and is part of a larger trend of corporations ditching their unique qualities and going as broad as possible in order to make the line go up. And somehow this new boring logo, according to chuds online, is <em>also</em> an example of “<a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-microsoft-obsidian-anti-woke-dei-twitter-1851714901">going woke</a>.” Folks, it’s a mess out there.</p> <p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/21/cracker-barrel-cbrl-new-logo-branding.html">On August 19, Cracker Barrel announced</a> that it was ditching its <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/20/lifestyle/cracker-barrel-introduces-controversial-new-logo-and-menu-changes/">48-year-old logo</a> featuring a man sitting next to a barrel. Instead, the restaurant that specializes in “Southern comfort food” has replaced the well-known logo with a new one that is simply a yellow shape with the Cracker Barrel name slapped on it. It’s the kind of thing that I could whip up in Photoshop in under five minutes, though I wouldn’t get paid the likely tens of thousands of dollars (or more) that the people who actually created the new logo received.</p> <p>There’s no way around it: The new logo is boring, bland, and bad. People hate it. You don’t have to look hard to find plenty of people online sharing negative thoughts on the new, modernized logo. It’s also part of a larger, less talked-about rebrand that has been happening at Cracker Barrel over the last year or so, with old restaurants ditching their rustic look for chic white walls and modern design touches.</p>

 <p>“Our story hasn’t changed. Our values haven’t changed,” <a href="https://www.crackerbarrel.com/newsroom/news-releases">said Cracker Barrel’s CMO Sarah Moore</a>. “With ‘All the More,’ we’re honoring our legacy while bringing fresh energy, thoughtful craftsmanship and heartfelt hospitality to our guests this fall.”</p> <p>The reality is that Cracker Barrel’s “story” has changed, because it is now 2025 and it’s a publicly traded company. In this day and age, you can’t just be a successful restaurant that grandparents bring their grandkids to so they can share stories from “back in my day…” over large portions of so-so comfort food. You can’t just be a profitable company. You have to grow. You must always grow. The stockholders demand it. They’ll cut your head off and replace you if there isn’t steady, never-ending growth. Making that line go up is all that matters, and if that means ditching a classic logo that might have put off some younger eaters, &nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818">or laying off people endlessly,</a> so be it. Instead of trying to be one thing for some people, Cracker Barrel and other companies desperate to grow must be many things to everyone. And in trying to appeal to all, Cracker Barrel has stripped itself of its famous logo and unique characteristics, which makes it hard to justify going there for a meal.</p> <h2>Cracker Barrel, Welcome To The Culture War</h2> <p>But of course, also because it is 2025, this logo change can’t just be something we all look at, shake our heads at, maybe make a few jokes or comments about, and then move on from. Nope! Changing the logo has set off a firestorm online among chuds and weirdos, with <a href="https://x.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1958279379408372204">one of President Trump’s sons</a> complaining about the change as an example of a company “going woke.”</p>

You’re about to learn that wokeness really doesn’t pay.” Over on the Cracker Barrel subreddit, which is a thing even if it has a very tiny community, you can find a strange mix of people complaining about food while sharing memes calling the food joint “Cucker Barrel.”</p> <p>“I think it’s time for the Employees and Customers to Stand Up. Go Woke Go Broke,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackerBarrel/comments/1mvv0n8/i_think_its_time_for_the_employees_and_customers/">said one poster</a>. Another person shared a petition to fire the CEO of Cracker Barrel over the changes. <a href="https://www.change.org/p/fire-the-ceo-and-restore-cracker-barrel-s-classic-look-and-rustic-feel?recruiter=326443188&amp;recruited_by_id=0e810e00-19b2-11e5-a5a1-cdf6156a9733&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_campaign=starter_onboarding_share_social&amp;utm_medium=mobileNativeShare">The petition had one signature</a>, and the poster had 0 upvotes.</p>

 <p>To be clear, I don’t think Cracker Barrel changing a logo is “going woke,” whatever that idiotic complaint means today. Nor do I think it’s an attack on old American values. I do, however, think Cracker Barrel’s simplified logo and shift to more sterile-looking dining rooms are bad and frustrating. I don’t want everything to be targeted to everyone with no distinct traits or features. I’d like to have the choice to go to a place that is filled with old-timey decorations and a charming logo from the ’70s.</p> <p>Also, Cracker Barrel, a few logo changes and some white walls aren’t going to trick me or younger people into eating there. I say lean into your clientele and make the menus cursive and put rotary phones on each table that you have to use to order your food. Give those grandparents even more stuff to point at and go, “Oh, I bet you don’t know what that is!” while their young grandkids roll their eyes.&nbsp; Not everything needs to appeal to the masses. That’s how you end up with boring Marvel movies and dull games that are overstuffed with every feature you can think of. And that sounds like a terrible future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I made my way to the ROG super-sized booth at Gamescom, and who did I bump into but Shawn Fonteno and Ned Luke, otherwise known as Franklin Clinton and Michael de Santa from 2013’s Grand Theft Auto 5. The pair were there with ROG and were promoting the new ROG Xbox Ally X, but I pulled them aside for a brief chat, diving quickly into the topic of Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>Amidst their impressions of the trailers and what they’re most excited for, I asked Ned and Shawn if they’d imparted any GTA-related wisdom on the actors in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-it-ll-probably-last-another-10-15-20-years">‘It’ll Probably Last Another 10, 15, 20 Years’</h2>



<p>Even now, the actors behind Lucia and Jason in Grand Theft Auto 6 haven’t been confirmed, <strong>but people have their suspicions</strong>. When I ran into Shawn Fonteno and Ned Luke at Gamescom, I knew I had an opportunity to delve into the topic with some of the most in-the-know people: the most recent lead actors in the Grand Theft Auto franchise.</p>



<p>With that in mind, I asked Shawn if he’d had the opportunity to impart his wisdom and experience on the new generation of actors in GTA 6:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If I knew who they were, I would. I tell them in interviews to get ready, you know? (They’re) fitting to go on a great ride, it’ll probably last another 10, 15, 20 years or something. Just get ready for it, it’s an experience that me, Ned, Steven, the whole GTA 5 cast, we’re still riding this wave.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Either Fonteno was playing coy with me, or he genuinely doesn’t know who is behind Lucia and Jason in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>What Ned and Shawn said makes complete sense, though. In 2013, Grand Theft Auto hit the shelves and never saw any additional story content or expansions released. They stepped into the booth roughly between 2010 and 2013, and then as soon as the game came out, they never looked back.</p>



<p>And yet here they are, 12 years later, still beloved parts of a thriving GTA community.</p>



<p>That’s what Ned alluded to:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You can’t imagine what it’s like. We love our fans, they’re awesome, they’re very loyal. The thing that’s great about our fans is that they appreciate us, and they don’t really know that we appreciate them more than they appreciate us. If we didn’t have the fans, we’d have nothing. We’re lucky to have that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will be released in May 2026. Until then, millions of fans worldwide will continue to explore the story portrayed by Shawn Fonteno, Ned Luke, and Steven Ogg (Trevor Philips) more than a decade ago.</p>



<p>Let me know who you think the actors in GTA 6 are on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The future of Bungie will be in the hands of a new generation of leaders, and I am thrilled to announce that Justin Truman will be stepping into leadership as Bungie’s new Studio Head.</p><p>I have worked alongside Justin for many years. His passion for our games, our team, and our players is unmatched. As a leader in engineering, production, and design—and most recently as the General Manager for <em>Destiny 2</em> and our Chief Development Officer—he has been instrumental in bringing some of the most memorable moments in Bungie’s history to life. He lives and breathes this studio, and I have full confidence that he is the right person to lead Bungie forward.</p><p>Thank you for being the best, most passionate community in gaming. It has been a privilege to serve you. As for me, I’ll be second star to the right and straight on till morning.</p><p><strong>A Message from Justin Truman</strong></p><p>In the 15 years I’ve been a developer at Bungie, I’ve worn a lot of different hats.</p><p>As an engineer, I wrote some code I’m really proud of for our original weapon, abilities, and networking in <em>Destiny 1</em>. As a designer, I helped craft many of our <em>Destiny 2</em> systems (including some of the endgame systems I got terribly wrong at <em>Destiny 2</em> launch). As a producer, I helped our team build and roll out <em>Destiny</em>’s first Seasons. More recently, I’ve helped with our overall talent strategy as Chief Development Officer, and have been helping the <em>Marathon</em> team as we build our next world.</p><p>Across all of these different roles, Bungie’s purpose has stayed clear: “We create worlds that inspire friendship.”</p><p>When we’re at our best—we create those worlds alongside you, our player community, and build something that matters. Something that’s worth your time, your passion, and your investment in us. Something that I’ve learned, hopefully, overdelivers.</p><p>I’ve also been part of these efforts at Bungie when we’ve maybe not been at our best. When we’ve stumbled and realized through listening to our community that we had missed the mark. I know I’ve personally learned a lot over the years, as have all of us here, from those conversations.</p><p>I am committed to supporting and working alongside every member of the team here as we continue pouring our hearts and souls into these worlds. Worlds that we love, and that we hope have been worth your time and your passion. Because ultimately those worlds only exist, and thrive, with you in them.</p><p>We are hard at work right now doing that—both with <em>Marathon</em> and <em>Destiny</em>. We’re currently heads down, but we’ll have more to show you in both of these worlds later this year.</p><p>In closing—I know I can speak for all of Bungie when I say:</p><p>I appreciate your passion, your perspective, and the time you spend with us.</p><p>Per Audacia Ad Astra,<br>Justin Truman<br>Studio Head, Bungie</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-steps-down]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<p>"In case you're wondering: Team Cherry told me they don't plan on sending out early codes for Silksong (they felt like it'd be unfair for critics to be playing before Kickstarter backers and other players), so don't expect to see reviews until after the game comes out," Schreier wrote.</p><p>Schreier also speculated that due to Team Cherry's small size, it could be a logistical challenge to distribute codes widely.</p><p>Silksong, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-which-started-as-dlc-8-years-ago-has-ambitious-post-launch-plans/1100-6534174/" data-ref-id="1100-6534174">originally announced as DLC</a>, quickly evolved into a full standalone sequel. This time, players take on the role of Hornet, a fierce and agile warrior who played a major part in the original game's story. Silksong promises more than 150 new enemies, new combat tools and crafting mechanics, and an even faster-paced, acrobatic style of combat.</p><p>While you won't be able to read any reviews ahead of launch, you can check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/" data-ref-id="1100-6534147">hands-on preview from Gamescom</a>.</p><p>The game will be released on September 4 on all major platforms, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-new-xbox-game-pass-day-one-releases-announced-this-week/2900-6897/" data-ref-id="2900-6897">Game Pass</a>. </p>

"It was always progressing. It's just the case that we're a small team, and games take a lot of time.

According to the devs, that growth continued over time—in 2022, Team Cherry featured </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silksong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> during an Xbox event that promised that all of the games shown would be out within a year. But that wasn't the case.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think we're always underestimating the amount of time and effort it'll take us to achieve things," Gibson told Bloomberg. "It's also that problem where, because we're having fun doing it, it's not like, 'It's taking longer, this is awful, we really need to get past this phase.' It's, 'This is a very enjoyable space to be in. Let's perpetuate this with some new ideas.'"</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/newsbrief-devcom-to-rebrand-as-gamescom-dev" target="_self" data-discover="true">Devcom to rebrand as Gamescom Dev</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Team Cherry, maintaining the team small saved them from having to manage and delegate, even if that led to extended production time.

"I used to manage teams in past lives.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV</a> was originally on my Gamescom schedule as "Unannounced RTS game," and I took the appointment out of pure curiosity. I haven't played an RTS game in ages, save for the excellent Pikmin games, and I wanted to know what "unannounced" was – when I saw <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-reignites-the-flames-of-battle-next-year">Dawn of War IV announced during Opening Night Live</a> earlier this week, I immediately knew it was the game I had an appointment booked for.&nbsp;</p><p>I'll be honest: my excitement for this appointment was quickly dampened when I saw the reveal trailer for Dawn of War IV. I'm not super familiar with the Warhammer 40,000 franchise, save for last year's great <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2/swarms-of-fun">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, and, as I already mentioned, RTS games aren't really for me. Fast forward two days later and I'm sitting on a bench in Cologne, Germany, an hour separated from my hour-long Dawn of War IV hands-on preview, eating those words (or thoughts, rather – I promise I didn't talk out loud while sitting surrounded by strangers during Opening Night Live).&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAPm8fIy5mg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAPm8fIy5mg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Now, let me preface this: I didn't do well during my hands-on preview of the game. In fact, I struggled to make any forward progress as the Blood Ravens (Space Marine) faction against the Orks. Sitting in a room surrounded by other members of the press who clearly live and breathe RTS games, I knew I was doing terribly. However, it's how poorly I was doing that has me wanting to play this game more; I'm even considering giving the older Dawn of War games a try, though it's clear based on the in-room sentiment that I should avoid Dawn of War III.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only did I have a good time tinkering with Dawn of War IV's many, many, many systems, units, buildings, and more, but I feel compelled to learn how this RTS series works, if only, at least, to go back and defeat the Orks in that single mission. It wasn't like playing a Soulslike or another challenging type of game where I just need to keep practicing; I need to learn Dawn of War IV's systems, understand how different combos work best together, and learn the strategy behind gaining ground, winning and holding control points, and ultimately, defeating the enemy.&nbsp;</p>

</article>
<p>The single pre-alpha mission I played was simple: defeat the Ork base. I began at the bottom of the map and that base was at the top. Dotted in between their base and mine were various neutral control points. Taking them over allows me to build various buildings where I can deploy more troops, elite soldiers, vehicles, and more. You absolutely cannot win without winning these control points, as they effectively allow you to move your base of operations and army manufacturing sites forward. Other than that, I needed to direct my soldiers and vehicles to hordes of enemies to defeat. It's all simple on paper, but much harder in execution.&nbsp;</p><p>I sucked at it. I don't want to suck at it. My desire to play more is rooted in beating this mission one day. I suppose this is a roundabout way of saying I think Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV is going to be a hit because if it has me wanting more, I can only imagine what those who already love these games are going to feel. And let's be real: this all might be a way for me to justify the horrid RTS performance I turned in today.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're already a Dawn of War fan and are not enthused reading an amateur's thoughts on the newly announced entry in the long-running hardcore RTS series, don't worry – I'm a much better notetaker than I am a Blood Raven commander and I have plenty to share about what to expect in Dawn of War IV when it launches next year. I've listed them below in bullet form for easy digestion:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>There are over 10,000 permutations for combat, thanks to different factions, all the units, abilities, and more.</li><li>Developer King Art Games says this is going to be the biggest Dawn of War game in series history in terms of content and game modes that will be available at launch.</li><li>Dawn of War IV will launch with Skirmish, Multiplayer (co-op for Skirmish and Campaign), and Last Stand.</li><li>There are four playable factions, and each has its own Campaign:<ul><li>Space Marine: the Blood Ravens</li><li>Adeptus Mechanicus: this is their debut as a playable faction; they are zealous tech priests that use data and connectivity to augment forces and overcome foes.</li><li>Necrons: one of the biggest factions; originally promised for Dawn of War III, but wasn't delivered.</li><li>Orks: They rely on brute force and overwhelming numbers to beat enemies to a pulp.</li></ul></li><li>Each faction has well over a dozen missions to its name:<ul><li>Not every mission will be playable in your first playthrough, as critical narrative choices will change how your Campaign plays out.</li></ul></li><li>Dawn of War IV will feature a "flagship story campaign" with a narrative written by Black Library author John French, who has written various books set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe.</li><li>Dawn of War IV marks a return to the planet Kronus, last seen in the first Dawn of War game.</li><li>Three returning characters (so far, at least):<ul><li>Cyrus, Chief Librarian Jonah Orion, and Ork boss Gorgutz</li></ul></li><li>There are over 40 minutes of "gorgeous" cinematics in the game.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>For more about Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-reignites-the-flames-of-battle-next-year">check out the reveal trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/21/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-makes-me-want-to-become-an-rts-sicko]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A very important and extremely popular mod for roleplayers in <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-goodbye-dawntrail-1851561996">MMORPG <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>,</a> Mare Synchronos, is shutting down with less than 48 hours notice. The news has caught many off guard, and the <em>FFXIV</em> community isn’t happy that such a vital mod for many will no longer be usable in the MMO.</p> <p><a href="https://ffxiv.natsume.io/dalamud/mare-syncronos">Mare Synchronos is a free third-party plugin</a> for <em>FFXIV</em> that, along with some other tools and software, allows players to synchronize their cosmetic mods and custom animations. While thousands of players used the plugin, it was primarily popular with roleplayers and others who enjoy the more social aspects of <em>FFXIV</em>. With Mare, as it is often referred to online, friends could see each other’s characters as they appear on their own PC, complete with all their mods and extra animations that normally are’t seen by other players due to mod restrictions. For many who find <em>FFXIV’s</em> customization features to be lacking and who rely on mods to tweak their looks to create their perfect character, Mare was vital in letting other players see how they “really” look. It was also popular in in-game nightclubs and other areas to allow players to sync up custom dance animations and other…activities. And now all the fun is ending.</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1mwhuzu/final_fantasy_xiv_mod_mare_synchronos_is_shutting/">On August 21</a>, one of the lead devs behind Mare Synchronos reportedly posted on the mod’s Discord server that they had received a “legal inquiry” about the mod, likely from publisher Square Enix, and were shutting down Mare completely.</p>

 <p>“With a heavy heart, I have to announce the end of Mare Synchronos as you know it,” said Her Royal Floofness on Discord, in a message shared on Reddit. “I’ve received a legal inquiry concerning the project. After reviewing my options with counsel, I’m winding it down.”</p> <p>Royal Floofness confirmed that Mare will continue to work until August 22 at 6:00 AM. After that point, the server will shut down and the plugin will be removed. “Enjoy your last doomsday party,” said the modder. “Thank you for the past 3 years of Mare, I hope you enjoyed the ride.”&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Square Enix about the mod being shut down.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mare Synchronos GPose Together" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/877WZ18VIKg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Many players online were shocked by the news and speculated that Mare being killed might lead to fewer people playing the game.</p>

 <p>“Holy fuck getting rid of this is MASSIVE,” posted one user on Reddit. “This game has a huge RP player base. Does [Square Enix] think people keep subbed to this game to raid log?”</p> <p>“If you entire reason for playing was the modded glam game then you probably have less of a reason to play now,” said another Reddit user.</p> <p>“Genuinely worried about what this means for the RP community (and I mean the actual RP community, not nightclub/Balmung QS.) I’ve been actively RPing in the Mateus Quicksands for the past two years or so, and whenever Mare has even had as much of a hiccup the Quicksands clears out. There’s definitely been an over-reliance on Mare, but now it’s been taken away, I worry a lot of my fellow RPers will just struggle to adapt and bail,” said a roleplayer on Reddit in response to the news.</p>  <p>Others are hopeful that someone else will fork the mod and that a similar tool will be created in the future. For now, the nightclubs of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> will be a bit less raucous in the coming days.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-world-map-techland-diverse/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-dying-light-the-beast-has-%E2%80%98the-most-diverse-world%E2%80%99-techland-has-ever-created.1277643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dying Light: The Beast will be released next month, and right now, it’s my most highly anticipated game of the year. I had the pleasure of catching up with the game’s director, Nathan Lemaire, at Gamescom, and we took a deep dive into all things Dying Light: The Beast. When we spoke, I was hot off an hour-long session of The Beast and <strong>full of burning questions</strong>.</p>



<p>One thing I was eager to discuss was the world. When Dying Light: The Beast was revealed, one of the concerns amongst fans was the ‘smaller scale’ of the game. As it turns out, The Beast has a <strong>pretty damn impressive world</strong> ripe for exploration.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-the-map-in-dying-light-the-beast">How Big is the Map in Dying Light: The Beast?</h2>



<p>I tried my best to scope out the largest portion of the map possible when I played Dying Light: The Beast this week at Gamescom. I am very happy to confirm that it’s a fair size, and even if it’s not <strong>the biggest </strong>map in the series, it has the potential to be the best <strong>by far</strong>. There are stacks crammed into Castor Woods, making it a world rich with potential.</p>



<p>When I interviewed Nathan Lemaire behind the scenes at Gamescom, that game world was a topic we covered, and Nathan filled me with excitement for the exploration opportunities ahead:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We wanted to come back to something that is more grounded, but we also wanted to explore some new settings. With Castor Woods, we have created probably<strong> the most diverse world we have ever created </strong>for this franchise, mostly because you’ve got the Old Town, then an industrial biome, some farmland, or swampy areas, a village…</p>



<p>What’s cool is that it creates a renewed experience across each biome.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But just how full is the map in Dying Light: The Beast? That’s something else I needed to know:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One thing that I like to repeat is that Castor Woods hides many secrets. We have lots of little things for players (to find).</p>



<p>We have things that are hidden, like there are some maps that players can find that lead to secret locations, and they will find interesting things there.</p>



<p>We have a lot of collectibles that expand the lore, some trivia about Castor Woods and the people there; it’s really full of little things like this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast has been referred to as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-techland-dying-light-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light 3 by Techland</a>, and <strong>it genuinely feels like it could be</strong>. It might not have a gargantuan map, but what’s there is so detailed and a pleasure to explore, and I can’t wait until the game comes out next month.</p>



<p>Let me know if you’re excited to explore Castor Woods on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">More bosses, more enemies, more...?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, we got our first real, new, meaty trailer for Hollow Knight: Silksong in several years, complete with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">September 4 release date</a>. Fans are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1mwfriy/silksong_might_be_2530_bigger_than_hollow_knight/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already unpacking details</a> from the trailer, including pointing out that it looks like the base game of Silksong might be bigger than the base game of Hollow Knight - quite a feat for something that started out as DLC.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Evidence for this comes from the trailer above, which has text stating the game contains over 200 enemies and over 40 bosses. Compare that to Hollow Knight's launch trailer, which said over 140 enemies and over 30 bosses:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So it <em>sounds like</em> Silksong is launching with more enemies and bosses than Hollow Knight did. And though we don't know the size of the explorable area in Silksong, it stands to reason that it probably needs to be big enough to fit all those little guys, and thus its map is likely to be at least as big as the original Hollow Knight if not more. And while that may sound like a given for a sequel, it's helpful to remember that Silksong didn't start out as a sequel - it began as DLC, and then somehow morphed into something seemingly even bigger than its predecessor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, that comparison doesn't include Hollow Knight's DLC, which added tons of new enemies, areas, bosses, story, and other content. With all that included, the existing game of Hollow Knight is almost certainly larger than Silksong was at launch. That said, we learned today that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-cherry-says-it-has-plans-for-more-silksong-content-for-months-and-years-to-come">developer Team Cherry is still working on more Silksong for the months and years after the game's launch</a>, making it possible it will eventually surpass Hollow Knight's DLC as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you absolutely can't wait until launch to find out what some of these enemies and bosses entail, we did get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-we-played-it-gamescom-2025">preview Hollow Knight: Silksong earlier this week</a> at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany.

			<p>Konami has debuted the launch trailer for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, showcasing the game one last time ahead of its long-awaited release one week from today, on August 28, 2025.</p>



<p>It's one last hurrah for the remake that Metal Gear Solid fans might have, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-mgs3-remake-original-trilogy-returning/">prior to its announcement</a>, hoped for, but never really believed would happen, since it seemed like Konami was letting its biggest series, like Metal Gear Solid and Silent Hill, rest for years without a new entry. Sure, leaks like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-responds-to-geforce-now-database-leak-says-list-included-speculative-titles/">NVIDIA GeForce Now list</a> provided hope, but until we all saw it with our own eyes, it was tough to believe.</p>



<p>Which is what makes the fact that we're a week away from its launch all the more exciting and unbelievable, and adds to the excitement around the fact that this launch trailer makes it seem like fans of what many believe to be the best game in the iconic Metal Gear Solid series will not be disappointed by the remake.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There's even more to look forward to after its launch, with the revised <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-debuts-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-multiplayer-mode-fox-hunt/">Fox Hunt multiplayer mode</a> that will be out this fall. It's unfortunate that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-fox-hunt-multiplayer-fall-no-crossplay/">won't feature crossplay between devices</a>, but we don't live in a perfect world.</p>



<p>If you've never played the original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, you officially have one week to get through it if you want to experience it ahead of the remake's launch, and if you decide to go on that journey, you're in for a treat, since MGS3 is arguably one of the best videogames ever made.</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on August 28, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Earlier this month, the actual play phenomenon </span><i><span>Critical Role </span></i><span>announced a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-internet-reacts-to-critical-roles-big-shakeup-2000614488"><span>pretty big shakeup</span></a><span> for its upcoming fourth campaign. Matt Mercer, who had led each of the group’s previous stories as the game master, will instead take on a player role, and </span><i><span>Dimension 20</span></i><span>’s Brennan Lee Mulligan will step up to lead the next campaign in October. Now, we know what campaign four will entail, and it sounds much more complex than anything </span><i><span>Critical Role </span></i><span>has done before.</span></p> <p><span>In a 17-minute presentation, Mulligan outlined his plans for the campaign, and it sounds pretty ambitious. Rather than being set in Exandria, the world where </span><i><span>Critical Role</span></i><span>’s first three stories took place, this season will see the players enter a new world. Mulligan is dividing the 13 cast members into three distinct groups: Soldiers, Schemers, and Seekers, with each tackling the new fantasy setting and story from a different angle. As such, not every cast member will be present for each episode as it jumps between different perspectives. The announcement didn’t confirm which cast members would be in each group, but it did solidify that </span><i><span>Critical Role</span></i><span>‘s founding members will all be returning. The full cast is as follows:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Laura Bailey</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Luis Carazo</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Robbie Daymond</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Aabria Iyengar</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Taliesin Jaffe</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ashley Johnson</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Matthew Mercer</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Whitney Moore</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Liam O’Brien</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Marisha Ray</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Sam Riegel</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Alex Ward</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Travis Willingham</span></li> </ul> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="What Is Campaign Four?" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nY1JaWT-CKo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Now that it’s confirmed the founding members will return for campaign four, some of </span><i><span>Critical Role</span></i><span>’s fans are</span><a href="https://x.com/fearnexcalloway/status/1958579478914863255"><span> more optimistic about all the changes on the way</span></a><span>, though others are still </span><a href="https://x.com/jordancates/status/1958579250627584376"><span>skeptical about the structure</span></a><span>, given that the entire crew won’t be playing together. At least, not at first. It’s entirely possible the story goes in a direction that sees all these disparate groups end up together down the line, which sounds like it would make for a sick finale, but will likely not happen until years from now. The first episode is set to premiere on October 2.</span></p>

<p>All of Stardew Valley's past collaborations have been one-sided, with Stardew Valley content showing up in other games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-update-adds-stardew-valley-cyberpunk-2077-crossovers/1100-6527387/" data-ref-id="1100-6527387">like Balatro</a>. The one exception was the Stardew Valley crossover with Terraria, for which both games received collaborative content with each other. Of this partnership, <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1958584766850375682" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Barone said</a>, "It was great.

The game goes for $15, but it's also gone on sale multiple times over the years. In any event, Barone--the game's sole developer--has likely made a small fortune from the game's sales.</p><p>Although Barone is not taking direct payment for any collaborations, he and Stardew Valley do benefit from the increased exposure.</p><p>Barone is now making a new title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/haunted-chocolatier-will-feature-a-world-larger-than-stardew-valley/1100-6532350/" data-ref-id="1100-6532350">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, in which players run a confectionary and interact with people and ghosts.

<p>Borderlands 4 is set to be released worldwide on September 12, and it’s the broadest and most ambitious iteration that Gearbox has ever created. In Borderlands 4, players are set to explore a seamless open world and be presented with more choices and options for gameplay styles than ever before.</p>



<p>I sat down with Randy Pitchford at Gamescom to learn all about Borderlands 4, from what it took to create it to where it goes post-launch. He made a bold statement about the sales of the series and how impactful Borderlands 4 will be.</p>



<h2 id="h-we-re-now-expert-at-making-borderlands">‘We’re Now Expert at Making Borderlands’</h2>



<p>When I caught up with Randy Pitchford at Gamescom, I came away with a wealth of information about Borderlands 4, the upcoming open-world shooter from Gearbox. As the CEO and creator of the franchise, Pitchford has been pivotal in pushing the brand forward for the last 20 years, working with a dedicated and talented team to make this series something legendary.</p>



<p>Pitchford reflected on that and looked to the future of the series beyond Borderlands 4:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re just now beginning to dig into what our post-launch is, and we’ve got some <strong>extremely exciting plans </strong>that I cannot wait to share and talk about.</p>



<p>We’re now expert at making Borderlands 4, and when you’re making a game, you kind of figure out how to make it as you ship it. That’s one of the reasons why our post-launch content tends to be so good.</p>



<p>Thinking about Borderlands ‘beyond the game’, it’s so wild to me. I remember I came to Gamescom with Borderlands 1, just trying to scream from the tallest mountain to get anyone to pay attention to it and nobody cared.</p>



<p>A lot of people predicted that Borderlands wasn’t going to work.</p>



<p>Now, here we are with the game franchise, <strong>we will break 100 million units with this launch, easy</strong>, all in with the franchise.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Borderlands is more than 15 years old as a series, and as Pitchford explained, he’s spent the last 20 years of his life building it and pushing it out to the masses. With each iteration, the franchise becomes more explosive and energetic, and Borderlands 4 represents the (for now) pinnacle of the series.</p>



<p>The last numbers suggested that the series was sitting at around 92 million units sold, which means that Gearbox is anticipating at least 8 million sales with Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re most looking forward to about Borderlands 4.</p>

The game places players in control of a single dwarf miner, who can assume one of four classes: Driller, Engineer, Scout, and Gunner. Each class gives the dwarf different abilities and options as he explores Hoxxes IV, a procedurally generated planet filled with hostile aliens and riches beyond imagining.</p><p>Ghost Ship Games set the date for Survivor's release earlier this year, while noting that the decision to launch forced the publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-1-0-launches-in-september-minus-one-mode/1100-6530779/" data-ref-id="1100-6530779">to drop Endless Mode from the game</a>.

However, there is still a plan to add Endless Mode to Survivor at a later date.</p><p>This isn't the only spin-off from the popular shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic/" data-ref-id="5000-460551">Deep Rock Galactic</a>.

			<p>NIS America has announced that Ys X: Proud Nordics will launch outside of Japan on Nintendo Switch 2 and PC sometime in early 2026. It first launched exclusively in Japan for Nintendo Switch 2 this past July 31, 2025.</p>



<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics is the "<em>definitive edition</em>" of Ys X: Nordics, according to NIS America, which launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/ys-x-nordics-is-out-october-25-in-western-countries/">last October outside Japan</a>. The most recent Ys release was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-memoire-the-oath-in-felghana-review-a-classic-reborn/">Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana,</a> which arrived earlier this year. </p>



<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics follows Adol, accompanied by Norman Karja, standing against an undying force called the Griegr. It's then up to Adol and Karja to bring a group of adventurers together to defeat the Griegr, and save the Obelia Gulf.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Proud Nordics will also launch with "<em>improved graphical performance and quality of life updates</em>," and include "<em>new mechanics and content"</em> not previously available in the original version of the game from last October.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-x-nordics-one-more-memorable-adventure/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Ys X: Nordics</a> last October, he called it "<em>one more memorable adventure</em>" in the long-running series. </p>



<p>"<em>While some of the changes made to the formula the series employed for 15 years may not sound too exciting on paper, they come together really well in Ys X Nordics, making it the first proper step forward for the franchise in quite a while. The increased focus on the narrative may put some long-time fans of the series off, as may the slight increase in complexity of its system, but if they manage to look past these non-issues, they will find an extremely solid ARPG and a worthy continuation of the long-running series by Falcom."</em> </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</em> was on at least one fan’s Gamescom 2025 bingo card. “Hear me out: ‘Hell let loose Vietnam,'” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HellLetLoose/comments/1i4cqmp/hear_me_out_hell_let_loose_vietnam/">they wrote</a> on the Hell Let Loose subreddit at the start of 2025. Now that fan has fished their wish, as the game’s announcement trailer delivers the sequel that <em>Battlefield</em> players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/114rpnm/we_can_all_agree_that_we_need_a_battlefield/">are still waiting for</a>.</p> <p>Set during the years of the Vietnam War, between 1965 and 1973, the next <em>Hell Let Loose</em> will be a big departure from the first game’s WWII battlefields in Europe. In addition to the shift to dense jungle terrain, <em>Vietnam</em> will also feature aerial vehicles with players ferrying supplies by helicopter between camps, as well as river patrols by boat. North Vietnamese forces, meanwhile, will have access to sprawling networks of tunnels for bypassing enemy patrols and launching ambushes.</p> <p>It’s set to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in 2026, with the publisher promising that both the new and existing games will continue to be maintained and updated alongside one another. Here’s the trailer:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hell Let Loose: Vietnam | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JzYzYNVWZ_A?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Hell Let Loose</em> blew up on Steam when it launched in 2021 despite being borne of a Kickstarter project years earlier by Australian studio Black Matter. Unlike recent battle royale free-for-alls or modern <em>Call of Duty</em>-style deathmatches, <em>Hell Let Loose</em> leans into the military simulation genre with 50v50 battles, in which players designated as officers share commands over priority voice channels and victory requires prioritizing communication and coordination over individual KDA ratio heroics.</p> <h2><em>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</em> won’t replace the original</h2> <p>The new game will introduce six maps at the start focusing on key moments in the war like Operation Starlite and Operation Piranha. It will also transition the franchise to Unreal Engine 5, hopefully with all of the visual bells-and-whistles that allows and none of the PC performance issues we’ve seen so frequently in other games. But even while this entirely new campaign is being built out across multiple game modes, the developers swear post-launch support for the original <em>Hell Let Loose</em> will continue.</p> <p>“Our World War Two-based&nbsp;<em data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="em">Hell Let Loose</em> is incredibly important to us and our players. We can reassure you all that Team17 remains fully committed to the franchise,” they <a href="https://www.hellletloose.com/blog/introducing-hell-let-loose-vietnam">write in an FAQ</a>. “<span id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="annotation" data-hsprotectannotationtype="inlineComment">To bring </span><em data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="em"><span id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="annotation" data-hsprotectannotationtype="inlineComment">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam </span></em><span id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="annotation" data-hsprotectannotationtype="inlineComment">to life, Expression have built a second team in order to </span><span id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="annotation" data-hsprotectannotationtype="inlineComment">support both titles simultaneously. </span>One game will never come at the expense of the other.

We’ll see how the formula fairs and whether the sequel can live up to its premise. If you’re interested in checking out <em>Hell Let Loose</em> for yourself, it’s currently available on Game Pass on both console and PC. The game continues to get new updates with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HellLetLoose/comments/1je8esl/upcoming_roadmap_hell_let_loose/">a March road map</a> pointing to additional maps, vehicles, and cosmetics coming in the future.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/crisisx-preview-not-the-day-before-not-good-gamescom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crisisx-preview%E2%80%94it-isn%E2%80%99t-%E2%80%98the-day-before-2%E2%80%99-but-it%E2%80%99s-really-not-good.1277541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As I wandered the show floor at Gamescom, I stumbled upon an enormous booth for CrisisX, an all-new open-world, post-apocalyptic survival shooter from HK Hero Entertainment (Hero Games). This title popped up on my radar a couple of weeks ago when it was dubbed ‘The Day Before 2’ by sceptical gamers worried about ambitious promises and the ‘too-good-to-be-true’ image of CrisisX.</p>



<p>Let me preface this by stressing that CrisisX boasts one of the largest open maps ever made, promises to accommodate 5,000 players per server, is <strong>free to play </strong>(with microtransactions), and comes from a developer that hasn’t released anything major <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>I played CrisisX at Gamescom, and I’m here to give you the full rundown.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-the-hell-is-toby">Who The Hell is Toby?</h2>



<p>I started playing CrisisX and was presented with a diverse selection of characters to choose from. At first, I was pleased to see a super detailed character customization screen, but things turned sour <strong>as soon as the game began</strong>. I was walked through a brief tutorial stage that introduced me to weapons and basic mechanics, and then I quickly uncovered how rough CrisisX is.</p>



<p>I’m sure the voice acting was AI-driven, and it was riddled with grammatical errors and nonsensical lines. The animations and visual platter were straight out of a mobile game from days gone by, and the enemies were low-IQ cannon fodder, presenting no real challenge.</p>



<p>At one point, while looking for a mode of transport (a poorly designed horse), I came across a hulking, stronger zombie enemy named ‘Toby’. Why he was named Toby, I’ll never know.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="CrisisX - Official Trailer | Gamescom 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mcAGdnjm64U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>CrisisX has a huge focus on the massive game map that can be explored at will. Within seconds, I’d opened this map, which is reportedly more than <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/the-day-before-2-everyone-is-skeptical-about-this-survival-game-promising-a-map-five-times-the-size-of-dayz-and-5-000-players-per-server/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">five times the size</a> of DayZ’s map, and been <strong>utterly overwhelmed </strong>by all the icons and possibilities of this gargantuan environment.</p>



<p>Where the map is complex and packed with markers, the gameplay loop is numbingly basic and uninspiring. You kill things, you loot things, you build things, and you collect things. The version of the game I played had no other users around, but the full product should have servers that accommodate 5,000 players.</p>



<p>Sure, you’ll need a huge map for that, but 4,999 other players vying to destroy my enjoyment of the already drab CrisisX is <strong>not an encouraging thought.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>Here’s a snap of the CrisisX map… Or a small part of it, at least.</figcaption></figure>







<p>I’m certainly not going to agree with anyone dubbing this ‘The Day Before 2’, though. That was a rug pull at best and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/signs-the-day-before-was-a-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nothing short of a scam</a> that lasted a matter of hours on the open market before being pulled and decimated by the shady developers who have since disappeared into the abyss.</p>



<p>For starters, <strong>I’ve played CrisisX</strong>, which is much further than I (and most other people) got with The Day Before.</p>



<p>CrisisX doesn’t have a release date yet, but it’s supposed to drop next year. Perhaps it’ll be sharpened by the developer before then, and we can enjoy whatever the finished product looks like.</p>



<p>Let me know if you’ve had your eye on CrisisX on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">NIS America has revealed that Ys X: Proud Nordics will arrive on Switch 2 and PC early next year in the US. The company calls this the definitive edition of the RPG, as it boasts a new storyline, mechanics, and dungeon.</p><p dir="ltr">Ys X: Proud Nordics launched on Switch 2 last month in Japan. Originally, the RPG came out in 2023 in Japan before NIS America <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ys-x-nordics-making-its-way-to-the-west-later-this-year/1100-6521078/">brought Ys X: Nordics to the West in 2024</a> for PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. So far, there haven't been any details about a possible upgrade path for Ys X: Proud Nordics on Switch 2 or PC. There have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/">paid Switch 2 upgrades</a> for Nintendo's new system as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/">free patches</a> for the hybrid system since it came out in June.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjgJnBtV-j4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TjgJnBtV-j4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Per usual, Ys X follows Adol Christin (the protagonist of every Ys game), though this time he's joined by a sailor named Karja. The game sees the duo dealing with the "looming threat of an undying horde known as the Griegr," per a press release. "Aboard their ship, the Sandras, Adol and Karja gather a trusty crew of friends and allies as they go head-to-head with the Griegr in one unforgettable journey!"</p><p dir="ltr">Intriguingly, Ys X actually takes place after Ys II and features naval combat for the first time in the franchise. No previous knowledge is needed with Ys X, however, since it's a standalone story. In addition to Switch 2, Ys X: Proud Nordics can be found on three different PC storefronts: Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who don't want to wait, the original Ys X: Nordics is on sale for $30 on PS5 and $35 on Switch.</p><p><strong>Ys X: Nordics Deluxe Edition</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ys+X%3A+Proud+Nordics+Coming+To+Switch+2+And+PC+In+2026&amp;fnauthor=evancampbell&amp;fndate=2025-08-21+11%3A33%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-21+11%3A54%3A06&amp;fnarticle_id=6534185&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fys-x-nordics-deluxe-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fys-x-proud-nordics-coming-to-switch-2-and-pc-in-2026%2F1100-6534185%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">PS5</a> -- $30 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ys+X%3A+Proud+Nordics+Coming+To+Switch+2+And+PC+In+2026&amp;fnauthor=evancampbell&amp;fndate=2025-08-21+11%3A33%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-21+11%3A54%3A06&amp;fnarticle_id=6534185&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fys-x-nordics-deluxe-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fys-x-proud-nordics-coming-to-switch-2-and-pc-in-2026%2F1100-6534185%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">Switch</a> -- $35 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul>

<p>NIS anchors another Game-Key Card release</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>NIS America is bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> to Switch 2 in the West in <strong>early 2026</strong>, the publisher has announced. But, like its other Switch 2 releases in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disgaea-7-complete">Disgaea 7 Complete</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a>, it'll be a Game-Key Card (as per the <a href="https://eustore.nisaeurope.com/products/ys-x-proud-nordics-deluxe-edition-nintendo-switch-2">store listing</a>).</p>
<p>Now, if you're confused and thinking that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_x_nordics">Ys X</a> is already out on Switch, you're not wrong — this is an expanded version of the 2023 (2024 in the West) action RPG. Proud Nordics has been out in Japan since 25th July, so we won't have to wait too long.</p>
<p>As well as being a Switch 2 release, meaning there will be a bump in performance and visuals, Proud Nordics adds additional quality-of-life improvements, new mechanics, and new challenges.</p>
<p>But the biggest draw is Öland Island, a brand new map that "seamlessly" adds in new story elements to the game. So it's a much more expanded rerelease than just a 'bump', from the sounds of it.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game from NIS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experience Adol and Karja's unforgettable journey across Obelia Gulf with new quality of life improvements, then discover the new story centering around Öland Island, and the mysterious newcomers Canute and Astrid. And once you're ready, challenge yourself in the devious, time-trial dungeon of Muspelheim, where every second counts. Your new adventure awaits!</p>
<p>As the definitive edition of this critically acclaimed entry in the <em>Ys</em> series, <em>Ys X: Proud Nordics</em> offers all of the fast-paced combat and enthralling narrative of the original release, with new mechanics, a high-difficulty dungeon, and a brand-new storyline seamlessly integrated throughout the game.</p>
<p>After a tense encounter at sea, the young red-haired adventurer Adol and the proud Norman Karja find themselves bound together by shackles of Mana, and by the looming threat of an undying horde known as the Griegr, who seek to pillage the vibrant Obelia Gulf. Aboard their ship, the Sandras, Adol and Karja gather a trusty crew of friends and allies as they go head-to-head with the Griegr in one unforgettable journey!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>


<p>We <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/ys-x-nordics">were fans of the original Switch version</a>, despite some issues with the sailing — and we've seen online from those who've played the Japanese release that the boat mechanics have been tweaked in Proud Nordics. So if you haven't yet picked up the game on Switch, maybe hold out for this one.</p>

			<p>James Gunn, who has been leading the comeback for DC alongside Peter Safran, spends most of his time focused on upcoming DC films, like the recent Superman movie he directed. His role does also involve him overlooking upcoming DC games, and on that subject he's admitted that there is "<em>one thing in particular</em>" that he's excited about, but the biggest projects all remain in "<em>early stages</em>."</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/dc-tv-shows/after-years-of-silence-dc-boss-james-gunn-teases-dcus-gaming-plans-theres-one-thing-in-particular-im-excited-about-but-it-does-take-time/">GamesRadar</a>, Gunn vaguely spoke about what's to come for DC games, which is one of the four pillars along with <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/">Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, and Game of Thrones that WB Games</a> is focusing its efforts on.</p>



<p>"<em>There's been some slight movement on different things,</em>" Gunn began. "<em>We have a couple of little DC games coming out. But we also have talked about – and in early stages of planning – some bigger things. One thing in particular I'm excited about, but it does take time. There's been some changes in Warner Bros Games, and so we're dealing with new people.</em>"</p>



<p>Of course, some of the changes Gunn is referring to include the restructuring of WB Games to focus on just four major franchises, along with the closing of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and the cancellation of the Wonder Woman</a> game that was previously in the works.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, the next major game featuring a DC character is <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-tt-games-gamescom-onl-2025/">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, which was announced earlier this week during <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom ONL 2025</a>, and will arrive on PC and consoles sometime in 2026.  </p>

			<p>Pearl Abyss has announced Edania, a new region for Black Desert Online that's available across all servers right now, at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p>Edania's launch adds a new main story questline titled The Society of the Equilibrium, which will be available only to players at level 60 or higher. It'll also introduce seven branching questlines with the Edania Adventure Log, for players to further map their journey into the demon realm.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There are also new PvE weekly challenges and a new PvP challenge that players can earn after they've defeated a regional boss. The update also adds new gear, enhancements, artifacts, consumables, and new enemies to fight across new lands to explore. The Azure Battlefield, Nymphamaré Castle, and Orbita Castle are the three new lands, each with unique enemies to fight and a regional boss to defeat.</p>

<p>"<em>Edania is a high-risk, high-reward destination for the boldest of Adventurers," </em>Pearl Abyss writes in a press release. "<em>Whether you're a master of combat, a skilled craftsman, or a sovereign in the making—your legacy in the Demon Realm awaits.</em>"</p>



<p>Pearl Abyss added <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-reveals-black-desert-march-content-roadmap-including-games-first-hardcore-server/">Black Desert Online's first hardcore servers</a> earlier this year. Beyond Black Desert Online, Pearl Abyss is also working on Crimson Desert, which it recently delayed into <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">Q1 2026</a> ahead of the studio making an appearance at Gamescom 2025 with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">Crimson Desert demo</a> for attendees at the convention to try for themselves, just like they did last year.</p>



<p>The next major update for Edania will arrive on September 11, 2025.</p>

        <p>Hang on, they're talking about us!</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Time for your weekly helping of legal Subnaughtiness. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> developers Unknown Worlds are suing recently departed director Charlie Cleveland, CEO Ted Gill, and studio co-founder Max McGuire for, amongst other things, stealing a bunch of game design files shortly before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">they were fired</a>.
</p>
<p>Or at least, an external legal firm acting on behalf of Unknown Worlds have filed suit. The firm in question - Richards, Layton, and Finger - are also representing parent company Krafton as they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-claim-former-subnautica-2-leads-have-resorted-to-litigation-to-demand-a-payday-they-havent-earned">defend themselves</a> against <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paying-the-subnautica-2-team-their-promised-bonus-would-be-embarrassing-kraftons-ceo-allegedly-told-the-games-chief-over-lunch">an earlier lawsuit</a> brought by Cleveland, Gill and McGuire, who are accusing Krafton of dismissing them unfairly and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">delaying Subnautica 2's release</a> to avoid paying out a timed $250 million bonus.
</p>
<p>Krafton 100% own Unknown Worlds, and are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>'s publisher. So why isn't this lawsuit coming from them? As PCGamer's Andy Chalk <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-subnautica-legal-dispute-takes-a-surprise-twist-as-unknown-worlds-not-krafton-sues-its-former-bosses-for-stealing-confidential-material-on-their-way-out-the-door/">suggests</a>, the suspicion is that the lawyers have picked Unknown Worlds as plaintiff, rather than Krafton, because they think they'll get more sympathy that way from Johnny Average Gamer. After all, everybody knows publishers are stinkheads.</p>
<p>A Krafton spokesperson has justified the situation as follows to Chalk: "While Krafton is the parent company, the contracts, intellectual property and confidential information at issue belong to Unknown Worlds. The defendants were executive leadership at Unknown Worlds, and their obligations, including confidentiality and fiduciary duties, were owed to that entity."
</p><p>The lawsuit itself broadly reiterates Krafton's earlier claims that the three banished executives shirked their responsibilities toward Subnautica 2, and that they were only pushing to get the game released this year for the sake of that $250 million bonus (Cleveland, McGuire and Gill stood to receive 90% of it personally, but claim they planned to distribute most of their earnings to the rest of the Unknown Worlds team).
</p>
<p>The document is full of redacted bits, excerpts from internal correspondence, and a bunch of screencaps from Reddit that are offered up as evidence that regular Subnautica players think the departed studio executives are at fault. Congratulations, redditor Plebius-Maximus - when they turn all this into a movie, you are probably going to be played by Justin Timberlake.
</p>
<p>Cleveland is accused of being first to "stray" by leaving video game development in 2023 to "learn how to produce movies and explore other interests". The lawyers say that by 2024, he had abandoned "all creative or other leadership roles with the Company". As for McGuire, he's said to have "spent 2022 and 2023 buried in the passion project of a new game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonbreaker">Moonbreaker</a>, even well past the time that it became clear that Moonbreaker was a commercial failure". The lawsuit accuses Gill, the CEO, of doing nothing about these "functional departures from game development of leadership". It alleges that development "stalled" as a result, resulting in projected release date delays and a "degraded" project scope. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the much-ballyhooed $250 million "earnout", the lawsuit accuses the three of trying to "publish whatever they could under the Subnautica 2 name on a timeline" that would ensure they received the money, despite the game falling "far short of the Company's internally-set expectations for the early access release". It claims that when Krafton rejected their proposals, the three executives threatened to self-publish Subnautica 2. It was this conversation, the lawsuit claims, that led to Unknown Worlds terminating their employment.
</p><p>That much, we've approximately heard before. But the accusations of stealing documents from the company are new. On June 2nd and June 30th- shortly before he was fired - Gill allegedly exported his entire Unknown Worlds email account, triggering an IT alert. McGuire is said to have downloaded 99,902 company files shortly before his own termination, including documents from Moonbreaker's development. Cleveland supposedly "downloaded 72,140 Company files" between June 26th and his termination on 1st July, only to be interrupted when Unknown Worlds cut off his access to the system in the course of his firing. 
</p>
<p>When the mass downloading of files was reported, Unknown Worlds apparently sent a cease &amp; desist letter to the three, demanding that they return any confidential info in their possession. According to the lawsuit, the fired executives at first refused, and then proposed to delete files rather than turn over their devices for inspection. The lawsuit alleges that Gill, Cleveland and McGuire are both using this confidential information in their lawsuit against Krafton, and have also "improperly used or disclosed Confidential Information to members of the press".</p>
<p>It's not clear what this last part refers to, but it could be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-leak-is-authentic-say-publishers-who-benefit-the-most-from-that-leak">the internal Subnautica 2 planning document</a> that appeared online in July. Krafton were happy to confirm that as authentic, which is understandable given that the document's mention of stripped-out features supports their case for delaying the game.</p>

<p>You can read all 74 pages of the redacted Unknown Worlds lawsuit on <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/904055347/Unknown-Worlds-Entertainment-v-Cleveland-McGuire-and-Gill-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=tUP1182XR5apSqla4qJM">Scribd</a>. All of this is going to chug along for a while longer, I expect. For the moment, I will close by noting that the lawyers accuse Gill, Cleveland and McGuire of carrying out a "trifecta of mischief", which is a magic phrase and also, sounds like the title of a Bond film. Perhaps they should cast Idris Elba as Plebius-Maximus - on reflection, I'm not sure Timberlake has the starpower for something this high octane. He can play Johnny Average Gamer instead.</p>
