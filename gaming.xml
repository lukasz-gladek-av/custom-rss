			<p>In a new interview <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/15/a-deep-dive-into-biowares-companion-design-philosophy-in-dragon-age-the" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published today by Game Informer</a>, Dragon Age: The Veilguard Game Director Corinne Busche reckons the upcoming game has the most complex and fully realized companions ever crafted by BioWare.</p>
<p>That's a tall order, given the studio's legendary track of roleplaying games, which includes Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age itself. Busche has an explanation, though:</p>
<p><em>They're complicated, they have complicated problems, and that's what's interesting. As much as I adore the companions and the journeys I've been on with them in past Dragon Age titles – previously, it feels like companions are going on an adventure with me, the main character, whether it's the Hero of Ferelden or Hawke, you name it. But in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, in many ways, the companions are so fleshed out that it feels as though I'm going on a journey with them. I'm exploring how they think and feel; I'm helping them through their problems. We're working through their unique character arcs. They feel like my dear friends, and I absolutely adore them.</em></p>
<p><em>We've really moved into a place where you can have the highest of highs, and it can be colorful, it can be optimistic, but also, you can have the lowest of lows where it gets gritty, it gets painful, it gets quite dark. But throughout it all, there is a sense of optimism. And it creates this delightful throughline throughout the game.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] In our base of operations this time, our player hub, the Lighthouse, each of the companions has their own room. And what I love about it is it becomes a reflection of who they are. The more time you spend with them, as the game develops as you work through their arc, their room and their personalities will evolve and flourish and become more complete as they trust you more and you understand them better.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] The companions also develop romantically and I'm not just talking about with the main character Rook; I'm talking about each other. There are moments in the game where two of our companions fell in love with each other and I had to make some pretty challenging choices as it related to the quest we're on. And it broke my heart, it absolutely did. I would say, as you're adventuring with them, as you're returning to the Lighthouse and getting to know them – all these decisions and conversations and things you learn about them – it endears them to you in a way that I honestly haven't experienced before. And sometimes that fills me with joy and sometimes it breaks my heart.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Dragon Age: The Veilguard has seven companions (that we know of - BioWare might be hiding something....): the Veil Jumper Elf Mage Bellara Lutara, the Grey Warden Elf Warrior Davrin, the Mourn Watch member Human Mage (Necromancer) Emmrich Volkarin, the Inquisition member Dwarf Rogue Lace Harding, the Antivan Crow Human Rogue Lucanis Dellamorte, the Shadow Dragon Human Mage Neve Gallus, and the Lords of Fortune member Qunari Warrior Taash. All of them <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-features-companions-ability-wheel-for-strategic-combat-romance-has-no-limitations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be available for romance</a> regardless of your player character's gender and race.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard currently has a generic Fall 2024 launch window for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.

It was a prebuild that I used to play <em>Warzone </em>and <em>Overwatch</em> and occasionally stream on Twitch, requiring little from me in terms of setup other than removing some cushioning and plugging the tower in. It’s been nearly two years since I had a gaming PC, though, and my attempts to get back into the swing of things have been frustrating as hell.</p><h2 id="h144"><a id=""></a><strong>The trials and tribulations of PC gaming</strong></h2><p>A few months ago, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ibuypower.com/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwkdO0BhDxARIsANkNcrfKsGZ1cssvqVVRej_5dMOTXDK8ykKJvyG56Mij_nkest1BdNzErgkaAq8jEALw_wcB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ibuypower.com/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwkdO0BhDxARIsANkNcrfKsGZ1cssvqVVRej_5dMOTXDK8ykKJvyG56Mij_nkest1BdNzErgkaAq8jEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iBUYPOWER</a></span> sent me a prebuilt PC to test/review that required that I install the graphics card in it (a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-budget-4k-ray-tracing-dlss-3-1850327485&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-budget-4k-ray-tracing-dlss-3-1850327485">GeForce RTX 4070)</a></span>. I followed the instructions, lying prone on the floor of my apartment as I unscrewed the brackets that would hold it in place, desperately trying to keep my cat away from all the tiny screws and delicate parts. I watched YouTube tutorials before I even attempted this process, nervous that my clumsy fingers would snap off a delicate (and crucial) plastic tab. When I placed the graphics card in the tower, I heard the telltale click of it slotting into the PCie (peripheral component interconnect express) port, connected the internal power cables, closed everything back up, plugged in all the peripherals and the HDMI cable, and heaved the beast under my desk. </p><figure id="" data-id="ff5de3345ef631e5db00d73acc919066" data-recommend-id="image://ff5de3345ef631e5db00d73acc919066" data-format="jpg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cat sits on top of a PC tower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A cat sits on top of a PC tower." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Alyssa Mercante</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff5de3345ef631e5db00d73acc919066" data-recommend-id="image://ff5de3345ef631e5db00d73acc919066" data-format="jpg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cat sits on top of a PC tower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I turned it on, however, my monitor said there was no signal. I tried other cables. I uninstalled and reinstalled the GPU. Nothing. I figured maybe the monitor, dormant for nearly a year, was the culprit, so I lugged it out into my living room to check if it would display my Xbox Series S. It did, so I lugged it back into my bedroom and tried again. No luck.<br></p><p>To their credit, iBUYPOWER’s rep was kind and responsive, and did their best to help me get the old PC shipped back and send a new one out, though it took a few months to get it all sorted, during which the space I had cleared out for the gaming PC accumulated dust. I assumed the problem was a user error, a reminder that I am woefully inadequate in the world of PC gaming—until the second PC had the same issue. Determined to troubleshoot it, I put out a call for help on social media, and dozens of learned PC gamers came to my aid. One person walked me through every step of installing the card again, with me sending videos and pictures to them to ensure that I had, indeed, done it correctly.<br></p><p>Then, after it <em>still</em> didn’t work, the person helping me noted that this specific rig had a Hyte riser cable connector in, which is just for aesthetics as it allows you to mount your graphics card upright. They suggested that I unplug the Hyte riser cable and slot the GPU on its side in a different PCie port to see if the cable was the issue, not my GPU installation. So I opened the damn thing up again and got to it, my hands shaking as I tried to ensure nothing snapped off in the process. After successfully unplugging the riser cable, I discovered that the “low profile” layout of the case meant the graphics card couldn’t fit in any other slot. Dejected, defeated, and covered in sweat, I boxed the PC up and prepared to send it back again, thanking iBUYPOWER for their time and energy and abandoning my PC gamer dream.</p><figure id="" data-id="94e4815da5f996773b07834f634b80c5" data-recommend-id="image://94e4815da5f996773b07834f634b80c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The NZXT player three PC." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The NZXT player three PC." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->NZXT</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="94e4815da5f996773b07834f634b80c5" data-recommend-id="image://94e4815da5f996773b07834f634b80c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The NZXT player three PC." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h145"><a id=""></a><strong>A PC gaming breakthrough</strong></h2><p>A generous internet friend who lives near me saw me tweeting my PC woes and offered to let me borrow their old tower, informing me when I came to pick it up that all I would need to do was get Windows downloaded onto it. I stood there, sweating on the sidewalk, realizing the new problem I had created for myself: downloading Windows onto a wiped PC required me to get a version of the OS onto a USB drive, which I could then plug into the tower—and the only functioning computer I have at home is a MacBook Air with no USB ports.<br></p><p>Still, I hauled the tower back to my apartment, where I sat on the floor for about half an hour, dissociating, until I had a eureka moment: the iBUYPOWER’s motherboard display port would at least let me use the PC to download Windows onto the flash drive. So, I unboxed the damn thing again, chided my cat for immediately jumping into the box, and set it up in my living room. A few hours and several questions to my PC builder friend later (where do I download Windows, what the hell is Rufus, which boot device do I select), I had Windows running on my friend’s PC.</p><p>Then, after all that work, after all the sweat and frustration, NZXT sent me over their own prebuilt PC, which already had its graphics card installed (I had told them of my installation woes, and how I’d given up on trying any sort of custom work). In an almost mind-numbingly hilarious manner, the absolute beauty (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://nzxt.com/product/player-three-prime&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://nzxt.com/product/player-three-prime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Player: Three Prime</a></span>, which will run you a cool $3,700 and looks like a gorgeous, techno fish bowl when turned on) booted up with no issue whatsoever.<br></p><p>It took me less than 20 minutes to take the behemoth out of the shipping box and set everything up, after which I collapsed back onto my bed and let out the kind of maniacal laugh you’d expect to hear from a horror movie villain. Hours upon hours of struggle, months of waiting, and this beautiful thing turned on like a light switch. I think it’s prebuilds or nothing for me, guys. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There was a chance that Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire could’ve had different names.</p>



<p>According to the latest data, GameFreak considered other Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire color options. Indigo and crimson are the colors that have popped up.</p>



<p>Revealed by Farore.gba and Wobbuu on Twitter, some interesting data regarding Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire has surfaced. The duo were apparently going through the game’s files, where they found mentions of “藍バージョン” and “朱バージョン”, which translate to Indigo Version and Crimson Version. These were the “earlier names” for the Pokemon game before the developers finalized Ruby and Sapphire.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">Me and <a href="https://twitter.com/Wobbuu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Wobbuu</a> were looking at some RS files. We found "藍バージョン" and "朱バージョン". Translated as "Indigo Version" and "Crimson Version", they are apparently earlier names for Sapphire Version and Ruby Version. <a href="https://t.co/0nxKRdCcBx">pic.twitter.com/0nxKRdCcBx</a></p>— farore.gba (@KmiE_821) <a href="https://twitter.com/KmiE_821/status/1812286458171908180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Farore.gba added that “Indigo” and “Crimson” are unofficial translations by them and not officially assigned by Game Freak. Only 藍 &amp; 朱, shown in the images provided, are definite.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Farore.gba expanded, stating that the first image is from a script file called field_c102.ev (Rustboro’s Grunt flee event), and the second file is cave_d0701s.ev (Mt. Chimney feud between Aqua and Magma). These names were either used as placeholders, or they were genuinely considered as titles for the game.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Moreover, Farore.gba pointed out that the names Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire were revealed at Festa 2002, which was held in July of that year, and that the final dates were back in October 2002. Whatever the case, Pokemon Indigo and Crimson are still solid options for any of Game Freak’s next instalments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Game Freak released a non-Pokemon RPG <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-freak-is-releasing-a-non-pokemon-rpg-this-month/">last month</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamestop-pokemon-collector-graded-cards/">GameStop was considering </a>getting into the Pokemon Card grading business. Would you have liked Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire to be called Crimson and Indigo, or are you happier with the existing names? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A pre-release dev build of&nbsp;Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2&nbsp;has leaked online and is fully playable.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear how the build was leaked, but according to those familiar with the leak, it “was randomly posted on a tracker.” According to those who have been playing the build, it’s around 75GB in size and is fully playable, apart from some missing strings and placeholder assets. The leak also includes server binaries, meaning people can play with friends if they obtain access. </p>



<p><strong><em>We strongly advise you not to download the game due to the risks of hidden malware, etc.</em></strong></p>



<p>Gameplay footage of the game has also started to appear online. You can see some footage below (warning spoilers).</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="space marine 2 part 1" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bsIN65oeFlM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Our research suggests that the build originated on June 20th, 2024, indicating that it is the almost completed version (the game recently was well gold, too).</p>



<p>As for what this means for Focus Entertainment and Saber Interactive is unclear, but we have reached out to both with the opportunity to comment.</p>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is scheduled to release on September 9, 2024, on the PlayStation, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/15/a-deep-dive-into-biowares-companion-design-philosophy-in-dragon-age-the<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During my visit to BioWare in its Edmonton, Canada, office earlier this year for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2024/06/09/cover-reveal-dragon-age-the-veilguard">the current <em>Game Informer</em> cover story on Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, I heard a sentiment repeated throughout the day from the game's leads: in past Dragon Age games, BioWare stumbled onto great companions, but with Veilguard, it's the first game where the studio feels it purposefully and intentionally created great companions. As such, those companions are key to everything happening in Veilguard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With such a significant emphasis on these characters, I spoke to some of the game's leads to learn precisely about BioWare's philosophy on companions in Veilguard.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4F3N4Lxw4_Y" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>"No, that is the case," BioWare general manager Gary McKay tells me when I ask if he agrees with the stumbled-onto-greatness sentiment. "I would first start with Dragon Age – each installment in this franchise has been different, so we didn't set out to make a game that was a sequel or the same game as before. We really wanted to do something different and we did push the envelope in a couple of areas, companions being one of them. Once we got knee deep into it, we really realized we had something special with these companions, again, around the motivations, the story arc, and it really started to become the centerpiece for this game."&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Philosophy Behind Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s Companions</h2>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="9fa5d5a6-68ab-47e1-9360-556c080fef2d" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Game director Corinne Busche agrees, adding that Veilguard's companions are "the most fully realized complex companions we've ever crafted." She also believes they're the Dragon Age series' best. "They're complicated, they have complicated problems, and that's what's interesting," she continues. "As much as I adore the companions and the journeys I've been on with them in past Dragon Age titles – previously, it feels like companions are going on an adventure with me, the main character, whether it's the Hero of Ferelden or Hawke, you name it. But in [Veilguard], in many ways, the companions are so fleshed out that it feels as though I'm going on a journey with them. I'm exploring how they think and feel; I'm helping them through their problems. We're working through their unique character arcs. They feel like my dear friends, and I absolutely adore them."</p>

<p>Busche says these companions participate in the game's darker and more optimistic parts. "We've really moved into a place where you can have the highest of highs, and it can be colorful, it can be optimistic, but also, you can have the lowest of lows where it gets gritty, it gets painful, it gets quite dark. But throughout it all, there is a sense of optimism. And it creates this delightful throughline throughout the game."&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I ask creative director John Epler about BioWare's philosophy behind Veilguard's companions, he reveals a phrase the studio uses: Dragon Age is about characters, not causes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"What that means for us is [...] let's take the Grey Wardens, for example – the Grey Wardens are an interesting faction but by themselves, they don't tell a story, but there are characters within that faction that do," he tells me. "And the same thing with other characters in the story. They represent these factions, they show the face of the other parts of Thedas and of the storytelling we really want to do, which, again, shows Thedas as this large, diverse living world that has things going on when you're not there."</p>

</article><p>Epler says one of BioWare's principles when creating Veilguard was that the world exists even when you – Rook – are not around. There are things, ancient conflicts, grudges, and more, that happen even when Rook isn't participating in them, he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You kind of come in 'in media res' in some of these, so that's where we wanted to go with the companions," he says. "They have stories of their own. Where can Rook come into these stories, and what interesting ways can those stories develop not just based on themselves but also based on Rook's presence within them?"</p>

<p>Dragon Age series art director Matt Rhodes adds that companions are the load-bearing pillars for everything in Veilguard, so "when you're designing them, it's not just designing a character; they're the face for their faction, the face for, in [some cases like Bellara Lutara], an entire area of the world." From his aesthetic-forward part of developing companions in Veilguard as the game's art director, he tells me Veilguard's characters are (hopefully) going to give cosplayers a challenge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The previous art director had the mindset we should make things easier for [cosplayers], which I think is a misunderstanding of cosplayers," Rhodes says. "We've seen the kind of challenges they're willing to take on, and so we've gone for, in some cases, a level of complexity and detail that I hope a lot of them are excited to rise to the challenge for."&nbsp;</p>

</article><h2>Companions, In And Out Of Combat&nbsp;</h2>

</article><p>Rook's companions in Veilguard have roles both in and out of combat, but since I only saw a few hours of this game (which is sure to be multiple dozens of hours long), I wanted to ask Busche about these roles and how they play out. Here's what I learned:&nbsp;</p>

<h4>In Combat</h4>

<p><strong>Bushce</strong>: "So companions as realized characters, we have to take that premise when we talk about how they show up in combat. These are their own people. They have their own behaviors; they have their own autonomy on the battlefield; they'll pick their own targets. As their plots progress, they'll learn how to use their abilities more competently, and it really feels like you're fighting alongside these realized characters in battle. So I love that, I love the believability of it. It feels like we're all in it together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But then when it comes time for the strategy, and the progression I might add, that's where a sense of teamwork comes into play as the leader of this party as Rook. When I open the ability wheel, I almost feel like we're huddling up. We're coming up with a game plan together. I see all the abilities that Harding has, and I see all that Bellara is capable of, and sometimes I'm using vulnerabilities synergistically. Maybe I'm slowing time with Bellara so that I can unleash devastating attacks with Harding, knocking down the enemy, and then me as Rook, rushing in and capitalizing on this setup they've created for me. It is a game about creating this organic sense of teamwork.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Now, there are more explicit synergies as well. We very much have intentional combos where your companions can play off each other, you can queue up abilities between them, and each of those abilities will go off and have their effect. But it results in this massive detonation where you get enhanced effects, debuff the entire battlefield, all because of planning and teamwork. What makes it really cool is you can introduce Rook into that equation as well. One of my favorite things to do is upgrade some of Harding's abilities so she will automatically use some of these abilities that normally I'd have to instruct her to do. And she'll actually set my character up to execute that combo that, again, has that detonation effect."&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<h4>Outside Combat</h4>

<p><strong>Busche</strong>: "It's one of my favorite topics. I talked about the idea that these are fully realized characters, that they're very authentic and relatable. So outside of combat, what that means is they're going to have their own concerns, fears, distractions, and indeed, even their own sanctuaries, their own personal spaces. In our base of operations this time, our player hub, the Lighthouse, each of the companions has their own room. And what I love about it is it becomes a reflection of who they are. The more time you spend with them, as the game develops as you work through their arc, their room and their personalities will evolve and flourish and become more complete as they trust you more and you understand them better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"What's interesting, you mentioned romance, the companions also develop romantically and I'm not just talking about with the main character Rook; I'm talking about each other. There are moments in the game where two of our companions fell in love with each other and I had to make some pretty challenging choices as it related to the quest we're on. And it broke my heart, it absolutely did [<strong>Editor's Note</strong>: I get the sense Busche is talking about a specific playthrough of Veilguard here – not a definitive sequence of events for every playthrough].&nbsp;</p>

<p>"So I would say, as you're adventuring with them, as you're returning to the Lighthouse and getting to know them – all these decisions and conversations and things you learn about them – it endears them to you in a way that I honestly haven't experienced before. And sometimes that fills me with joy and sometimes it breaks my heart."&nbsp;</p>

There have been rumors as recently as this March that a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/spyro-dragon-4-in-development-toys-for-bob-xbox-1851372010&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/spyro-dragon-4-in-development-toys-for-bob-xbox-1851372010">new <em>Spyro</em> game</a></span>, which would be the fourth in the series, was currently in development. Those rumors suggested that developer Toys For Bob was behind the project, and Kole has previously worked for Toys For Bob on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-spyro-reignited-trilogy-preserves-the-excellence-of-1830404671&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-spyro-reignited-trilogy-preserves-the-excellence-of-1830404671"><em>Spyro Reignited Trilogy</em></a></span>.

In response to one fan asking as much, Kole <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/FromHappyRock/status/1812003288193335509&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/FromHappyRock/status/1812003288193335509" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a></span> by saying, “It is not Spyro, but some day folks will hear about the <em>Crash 5</em> that never was and it’s gonna break hearts.” I’m sorry but you can’t just drop that with zero explanation and not elaborate! The people need to know more. Kole clarified that<em> Project Dragon</em> is separate from <em>Crash 5</em>. The last mainline <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> game,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-the-kotaku-review-1845237873&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-the-kotaku-review-1845237873"><em> Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time</em></a></span>, released in 2020 and was also developed by Toys For Bob. </p><p>As for <em>Project Dragon</em>, Kole shared a bunch of concept art for the project as well as details on what the game actually was.

It also links to UTM's website, which has instructions for emulating Windows XP through Windows 11. The App Store description claims UTE SE can emulate x86, PPC, and RISC-V architectures.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign Teaser | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Unlike past years, Black Ops 6 won't feature any platform-exclusive dates. Both beta weekends are available across all platforms, which includes PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p><p>Black Ops 6 features brand-new omnidirectional movement, allowing players to sprint, dive, and slide in any direction, so the beta serves as a great time to get a feel for the new movement mechanics. Specific details haven't been revealed yet, but a Call of Duty beta typically includes a limited weapon pool, a sampling of the game's maps, and a level cap.</p><p>Here are all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/" data-ref-id="1100-6524072">major announcements revealed for Black Ops 6 so far</a>, including campaign details, Zombies, and more information on Treyarch's "omnimovement" system. Additional Black Ops 6 details will be provided during Activision's Call of Duty: Next event on August 28.</p>

Just about every party and club I’ve been to in the past few months has played the song <em>at least </em>once, and a recently released music video has catapulted its popularity even higher.

It’s free of any frills, just like the track it’s based on cuts through the noise and calls Drake a “certified lover boy, certified pedophile.” You’re just a pixelated version of Lamar swinging a bat at an owl, a direct reference to the acclaimed music video, which features Lamar swinging a bat at an owl piñata, the animal that Drake has adopted over the years as a symbol for his record label OVO Sound.<br></p><p>The whole thing is set to a chiptune rendition of “Not Like Us,” and the high score to “beat” is 69, a reference to one of Lamar’s lyrics. It’s all just wonderful. The game feels vintage in the same way that the track’s Bay Area sound does, purposeful given Lamar’s ties to the area and the influence that ‘90s West Coast hip-hop has had on culture beyond rap.<br></p><p><em>Not Like Us: The Game </em>was developed by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/richiebranson&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/richiebranson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richie Branson</a></span> who, per the credits on the game, “designed games for Bleacher Report and worked for Epic Games on a little game called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/fortnite&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a></span>.” His words, not mine, Epic. <em>Not Like Us: The Game </em>is completely free and playable on desktops as well as smartphones. Though it seems like Branson was solely responsible for the programming and music of the game, the credits list a slew of collaborators that worked on its visuals.<br></p><p>Now, the next time you go to a party and someone asks you if you got games on that phone of yours, queue up “Not Like Us” on the aux cord, and pull this up.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warhorse-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-immersive/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was revealed in April, stunning fans worldwide with sumptuous visuals and a continuation of the story that was left wide open at the end of the original game, which dropped in 2018. This next-generation RPG experience promises to be visceral, authentic, and expansive, and a recent interview with Warhorse Studios’ Lead Scripter has revealed that it’s going to be one of the most immersive RPG titles ever made.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-immersed-in-a-real-medieval-bohemia">Immersed ‘In a Real Medieval Bohemia’</h2>



<p>In a recent interview published on epicgames.com, Warhorse Studios’ Martin Ziegler breaks down the intricacies of the storytelling, world-building, and freedom elements that make up the beating heart of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. From the wide-open world that’s based on a real location to the density of the living, breathing cities, players will find themselves immersed in this game like never before.</p>



<p>Ziegler revealed that a team of expert historians, reenactors, professors, and a diverse crew of advisors were brought in to finesse Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and make it intensely authentic. With a combat overhaul landing in this follow-up title, fighting enemies in battle is more realistic but at the same more accessible than in the first game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re introducing many iterative changes to the combat, some aiming to make it more accessible to people for which it was too complex in the first game—and in the other direction, some making it even deeper for players who enjoyed it already and are looking to engage with it even more intensely in the sequel. In addition to all of the weapon classes from the first game, there are also crossbows and rudimentary gunpowder rifles now, which bring their own tactical implications.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ziegler then explained that players are free to approach the entire game as they see fit. In the breakdown <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-medieval-rpg-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">written on the Epic Games site</a>, it was stressed that players can take whatever path they can imagine. In one mission, they could go in stealthily, opt to poison enemies, take them out from a distance with a ranged weapon, or rush in and face them head-on. </p>



<p>Exploring the world will feel much like the first game, too. Every character on the map will have a life that they live, taking them from work to the tavern, then back home for a meal and to go to sleep. This was how things worked in the first title, but Ziegler informed Epic that the authenticity of this replication of medieval life has been boosted immeasurably for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>This is one of my most-wanted games for 2024, without question. I recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/">sat down and interviewed Tom McKay</a>, who plays Henry of Skalitz in Kingdom Come, and the chat filled me with excitement for what’s in store later this year.</p>

There's a lot of them," Vincke said. "This has been a real problem." Baldur's Gate 3 was the surprise hit of 2023, earning myriad game of the year awards including from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-wins-game-of-the-year-from-new-york-video-game-critics-circle">the New York Video Game Critics Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2023-winners-the-full-list">The Game Awards</a>, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gayming-awards-2024-winners-baldurs-gate-3-wins-over-tears-of-the-kingdom-and-spider-man-2">Gayming Awards</a>, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-developers-choice-awards-2024-winners-the-full-list">Game Developers Choice Awards</a>, and more.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It is surprisingly draining on the soul.</p></div><p>Vincke insisted he was still appreciative of the awards, as "it's great that you have a moment of celebration" and Larian does "really appreciate it," but sending key members away to each award show seemingly left the development team fragmented.</p><p>It "would be cool if everybody could agree to do it all at the same time," Vincke said.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-review-tactical-demon-slaying</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review-%E2%80%93-tactical-demon-slaying.927756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-review-tactical-demon-slaying<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> feels like a throwback to an earlier time in the game industry. The experimental age of the 2000s where developers had the freedom to mess around with genre convention and aesthetics. The era that spawned cult hits like <em>God Hand</em>, <em>Okami</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yoshinori-ono-says-onimusha-discussions-happening-at-capcom" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Onimusha</em></a>. In that spirit, Capcom has developed a game that blends two disparate genres, resulting in one of 2024's most pleasant surprises.</p>

<p>The set-up for <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> plays out like a folk tale. A mountain has become infested with a demonic force known as the Seethe. The only one who can purify the mountain is a priestess named Yoshiro. Given how lethal the Seethe is, Yoshiro summons a spirit warrior named Soh to protect her and provide guidance. But Soh is just one warrior. If they intend to save the mountain and its people, Soh must strategically recruit and command local villagers to protect Yoshiro and purify the land one step at a time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-purifying-torii-gate.jpg?itok=OzE0ADjP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-purifying-torii-gate.jpg?itok=KSG_7JTe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Alright, one done, about two dozen to go.</figcaption></figure><p>With that simple premise, <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> frames its entire gameplay loop: a mix of third-person action, and real-time tower defense. You explore the map by day, purifying areas, recruiting villagers, and guiding Yoshiro towards a torii gate. By night, you and the villagers protect Yoshiro from waves of Seethe. Get Yoshiro to purify all torii gates in the area and you complete the level.</p>
<p>The idea of blending tactical strategy and fast-paced action <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/brutal-legend-eddie-riggs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">isn't exactly new</a> in games but <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> 'gameplay demonstrates a high level of polish and intentional design.</p>
<p>This is most apparent in how it melds action and strategy together. Generally, Soh's combat prowess is no different from other hack-and-slash protagonists. Light attack, heavy attack, block, and dodge. But enemy waves are aggressive and numerous.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-soh-combat.jpg?itok=9ZLFKI1V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-soh-combat.jpg?itok=d8Dc5ek2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yes, I pushed back enemies at one gate. There are other gates in the level.</figcaption></figure><p>You can feasibly bottleneck one wave of Seethe with a string of deadly attacks, but what about the two other waves coming elsewhere? You can slice through ground-based enemies, but what about the deadly aerial assassins? What happens when Seethe makes it to Yoshiro and you're on the other side of the map? What happens when you get overwhelmed?</p>
<p>Enter the real-time defense elements. Purifying an area grants you crystals. Crystals can be used to assign villagers different roles. These roles can range from simple axe fighters and archers to more complex sumo wrestlers and cannoneers. Crystals also purify Yoshiro's path to the torii gates, letting her progress. Do you try to get Yoshiro to the goal quickly, or do you invest in sturdy defenses and take your time?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-poison-swamp-gameplay.jpg?itok=iV2J_73J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-poison-swamp-gameplay.jpg?itok=RY8r8dXi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Poison swamp? Better break out the long-range units.</figcaption></figure><p>The time and resource management in these levels compounds with the introduction of the craftsman. The craftsman can repair areas or traps in a level, which can either slow down Seethe or enhance your allies. This leads to plenty of small tactical decisions that can mean victory or defeat during the day. A single damage trap can mean the difference between being overwhelmed and getting to the end.</p>
<p>Like the action sections, the strategy elements of <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> are straightforward in isolation. If you're familiar with the genre, various staples are present and accounted for – cheap reliable melee and ranged units, costly support units, pricey dedicated units, etc.. But when combined with the robust enemy variety and Soh's responsive combat, the entire experience is an electric rush of time management and intense sieges.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-ship-combat.jpg?itok=ZAwwHyp7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-ship-combat.jpg?itok=hE4c1P-- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Alright, archers in front, ascetics stay in the backline. I'll handle any boarding parties.</figcaption></figure><p>It is a fantastic gameplay foundation made juicier with thoughtful level design. Each map in the game is compact; you can go from end to end in about a minute. Each element of the map is intentionally placed – every fork in the path, every branching path, every bottleneck. Furthermore, every single map has some unique environmental or architectural twist – managing visibility in a dark cave, coordinating naval combat on a storm-ridden lake, the list goes on.</p>
<p>But the biggest draw by far is how refined and effortless unit management is. Place a unit in an area, and they will attack anything within a certain area. If they're a defense unit they will buff, debuff, or heal the same way. It may not be as complex as <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>, but for something more fast-paced it works.</p>
<p>If there is one area where the game's combat stretches too thin, it is in the boss fights. They can range from complex multi-level tests of spatial reasoning and tactics to annoying health sponges with tedious unblockable attacks; the source of a few ragequits.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-cave-base-management.jpg?itok=Wrq8gJaz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-cave-base-management.jpg?itok=9lHzCKjA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yes, you can pet the dog here. I have no notes.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> Review – Restoring The Mountain</h2>
<p>In addition to satisfying moment-to-moment gameplay, <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess'</em> macro progression is great. Clearing levels earns you Musubi, which can be used to improve the stats of different unit types or unlock additional abilities for Soh. These improvements range from simple health and damage increases to unlocking more complex commands for your units.</p>
<p>Both Musubi and crystals you earn carry over between levels, adding a layer of long-term management. There were more than a few occasions where I had to make due with basic axemen and archers because I blew my crystal budget on riflemen and spearmen in a boss fight. Conversely, I put my Musubi into maxing out the basic melee and ranged units then put the remainder into Soh's tactical combat options. It let me get the most out of the cheapest options as well as provide a resource reserve if I wanted to indulge in more experimental configurations.</p>

Completing a level unlocks a purified version of it on the world map. These are hub areas where you can assign villagers to different renovation projects like fixing up a shrine or restoring destroyed jizo statues. These projects finish when you complete a certain number of levels. Because of this, you are encouraged to check back in each area, setting up new assignments and collecting rewards.</p>
<p>What stops these sections from becoming a tedious slog is the presentation. It's the game expressing the Shinto belief of cherishing nature as well as showing the clear progress you're having in restoring order.</p>

<p>If there is an area where <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is lacking, it is in narrative storytelling. Gameplay-wise, the campaign is well-paced and packed with twists and turns. But in terms of story and character, it is mostly wordless cutscenes.</p>
<p>It mostly works thanks to the game's dedication to sensation. Everything from the kaleidoscopic art direction to the expressive dancing performance capture to the moody acoustic soundtrack is truly elevating. It is a vibe-driven experience, and the vibes are strong.</p>
<p>Just how rewarding is this gameplay? Upon finishing the story, New Game Plus mode unlocked, and I immediately started it. That is a testament to the craftsmanship and care Capcom put into this title, and I'm hoping it is the start of a new series.</p>

<p>Fallout: London is the long-awaited and highly anticipated game-sized mod for Fallout 4 that has been in development for several years. Following the release of the Fallout 4 next-gen update in April, it was announced by the ‘FOLON’ team that the super-sized mod would be delayed indefinitely owing to uncertainties and inevitable conflicts in the files. </p>



<p>Now, more bad news has surfaced, with the team confirming that anyone with an Epic Games Store version of Fallout 4 <strong>will not </strong>be able to play Fallout: London.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-at-least-it-s-coming">At Least It’s Coming</h2>



<p>Days ago, Team FOLON announced that, to play Fallout: London, users will need to ‘rollback’ their version of Fallout 4, dropping the next-gen update that Bethesda Game Studios deployed in April. This is because the upgrade is ‘inherently flawed’ and not compatible with the mod.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-gog-confirms-no-epic-store-at-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the crew has stated</a> that anyone with an Epic Games Store version of Fallout 4 cannot access the mod at all. This is because the platform doesn’t have a rollback feature for updates – the version you’ve got is the only version you <strong>can </strong>get. This was further explained by a GOG spokesperson, who took the time to highlight why PC-based digital storefronts should offer this feature.</p>



<p>That’s another point – Fallout: London is only obtainable through GOG. It’s not being listed on Nexus Mods because it’s just too large, equalling some 30 GB in size.</p>



<p>Presently, the Fallout 4 mega-mod is being tested by GOG before it’s released worldwide. Will you be installing it?</p>

The result is sometimes messy and doesn't always work, but its distinct qualities set it apart from the core series and ultimately elevate it.”</p><p>A sequel, dubbed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a>, is expected to release in 2025.</p><p>As mentioned, Arceus isn't the only Nintendo Switch exclusive discounted during Best Buy's sale; it's just the one that we see deals for the least.

The only question is: Will people be willing to spend $40 for a multiplayer-only shooter in the year 2024? </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,196909" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Over the weekend, a bunch of people got to play <em>Concord</em>—PlayStation’s upcoming 5v5 hero shooter—for the first time via a new beta. Usually, multiplayer betas are fun marketing demos to get people even more excited for your big new game a few weeks or months before launch. But for <em>Concord</em>, which arrives in August on PS5 and PC, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-dev-respond-reveal-trailer-backlash-playstation-1851564299&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-dev-respond-reveal-trailer-backlash-playstation-1851564299">the situation feels very different</a></span>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-playstation-5-pc-state-of-play-reaction-reddit-1851516496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-playstation-5-pc-state-of-play-reaction-reddit-1851516496">When Concord was first unveiled in May</a></span>, its trailer was negatively compared to <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>while the confirmation that it was a PVP-only game did little to get people excited. So, the stakes were higher than normal for this first online beta. This is <em>Concord’s </em>first real ( and maybe only) chance to win people over and change the conversation around the FPS before launch. And while I’m not sure everyone will be convinced that <em>Concord </em>is good, I’m happy to say that, yes, it’s a damn fine shooter.<br></p><p><em>Overwatch</em> + <em>Destiny </em>with a sprinkle of <em>Call of Duty</em> is the easiest and laziest way to describe <em>Concord </em>to other people who play games. But it’s accurate. <em>Concord</em>—which is set in a brand-new sci-fi universe filled with aliens, mercenaries, and 5v5 arenas—features a large roster of colorful and distinct characters who all play differently ala <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-reddit-review-competitive-rank-1850896550&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-reddit-review-competitive-rank-1850896550"><em>Overwatch</em></a></span>. It also has slightly floaty (in a good way) movement and lots of wild abilities and powers, just like <em>Destiny</em>. And finally, sprinting, shooting, and map design feel very <em>Call of Duty</em> (also in a good way).</p><h2 id="h141"><a id=""></a>So many heroes to choose from...</h2><p>In the beta I mostly played two game modes: Team Deathmatch and a mode which was basically <em>Call of Duty</em>’s “Kill Confirmed” where you kill people, pick up their tags, and try not to die or the enemy will grab your tags.</p><p>The first thing that struck me about <em>Concord </em>as I played these two modes was just how nice it felt to move around and shoot other players. <em>Concord’s </em>action is extremely snappy and smooth, so I always felt in control no matter who I was playing or what I was doing. It made hopping over obstacles to get a better angle or enemies or running away to fight another day a lot of fun.</p><p>The next thing I fell in love with about <em>Concord </em>was how all of its various characters or Freegunners felt different. I don’t really remember their names—during combat, I’d shout out nicknames like “Monkey Man” and “Spy Robot” to my brother—but they all provided a unique experience. If I wanted to be a slow, big, hard-to-kill tank I could choose the giant yellow robot with a vacuum canon that sucks up bullets. If I wanted to be a fast and nimble damage dealer I could pick the alien-elf lady with her SMG and zip around the map like a maniac. </p><p>Sure, plenty of hero shooters offer their own stable of characters with unique skills and roles, but here it feels like <em>Concord</em> wants its Freegunners be more distinct to the point that I assume some people will call the game unbalanced or unfair. (“Why can that character mantle and run around but I can’t?”) The thing is, this ended up making the game a lot more fun as it forced teammates to work together and Concord’s smartly designed UI and gameplay meant that I was constantly doing cool shit with randos—like trapping enemy players behind a magic wall while someone wiped them out with a grenade.<br></p><p> My personal favorite was Daw, a medic with an assault rifle, unlimited healing pads, and a powerful bubble shield. During matches, I’d often cover an area with health pads—which stick around when you die—turning a spot in the map into “Heal City.” However, Daw can be countered, like all the characters in <em>Concord</em>, by shooting the healing pads and prioritizing the medic gunner in fights. </p><p>One thing that did feel off in <em>Concord </em>was some of the maps. They were a bit too big or empty for the 5v5 fights that make up the sci-fi shooter’s foundation. I’m not sure if this can be fixed before launch or if players will get better at traversing the maps over time and make them feel less sparse, but for now, it feels like each map I played could have lost a few of its hallways and rooms and been better off for it. </p><p>Now, with all those positive words out of the way (and one complaint about maps) it’s time to talk about the elephant in the spaceship: <em>Concord</em>’s $40 price tag. </p><h2 id="h142"><a id=""></a><em>Concord</em> is a hard sell in 2024</h2><p>As good as <em>Concord </em>is, I’m not sure this kind of game can work in 2024. There are so many good free-to-play PVP games out there right now that aren’t exclusive to PS5 and PC. Why would someone spend $40 to play a new one? I’m not sure. </p><p>Even worse, <em>Concord </em>doesn’t include—at least not at launch—any kind of PvE horde mode or co-op campaign. It’s unlikely to ship with a map maker or <em>Fortnite</em>-like creative mode, either. It just offers a 5V5 PVP shooter experience and...that’s it. I’m just not sure how many people are going to pay a premium for that when they can get similar experiences in other games for free.</p><p>Sure, those other games contain <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-8-orisa-mythic-skin-1851055727&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-8-orisa-mythic-skin-1851055727">tons of microtransactions</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-battle-pass-shop-skins-rewards-coins-1849673687&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-battle-pass-shop-skins-rewards-coins-1849673687">often lock new</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-prereview-roundup-free-hero-shooter-grind-1849601813&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-prereview-roundup-free-hero-shooter-grind-1849601813">characters behind grinds</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/concords-monetised-content-will-be-exclusively-cosmetic-firewalk-says/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/concords-monetised-content-will-be-exclusively-cosmetic-firewalk-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">something <em>Concord’s </em>devs promise won’t be the case</a></span> in the upcoming sci-fi shooter. All new maps, game modes, and characters will be included for free in future updates. That’s great! But I worry <em>Concord</em> won’t get many future updates if it doesn’t develop a large playerbase. </p><p>And while I get that Sony is trying to pull off another<em> Helldivers 2</em> with Concord—charging a premium and not cramming in annoying in-app purchases—I’m not convinced it will work as well this time around. Hopefully, I’m wrong. Because if I am, then <em>Concord </em>will live on for many years and I’ll get to keep playing it and having a great time. If not well, at least we had some fun in the beta. </p><p><em>Concord </em>launches on PS5 and PC on August 23. Players can check out its second beta weekend, which is open to all, and starts on July 19 and ends on July 22. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
