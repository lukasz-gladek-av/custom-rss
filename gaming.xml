		<p>Christmas is that wonderful time of year where everyone waits for a man covered in a bed sheet to come down their chimney and put some presents by the carved pumpkins, and 3D bullet heaven <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/megabonk">Megabonk</a> is getting right into the spirit of things with a new Spooky Update that’s out now!</p>
<p>Well, OK, so this was actually intended to be a more timely Halloween update developer vedinad says, “but I wanted to make it a bit bigger so it turned into a bit more work than i initially planned. anyway hope you like it!”</p>


<p>So that means there’s a new map, new character, new weapon, items, enemies and bosses and all of that on top of the bug fixes and new settings. Seems a pretty hefty update, which does actually tie in with the Christmas gift-giving spirit this time of year. Nice!</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Megabonk Spooky Update:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Map<wbr></li>
<li>New Character<wbr></li>
<li>New Weapon<wbr></li>
<li>New Items<wbr></li>
<li>New Enemies and Bosses<wbr></li>
<li>New Achievements and challenges<wbr></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>
<p>Made a lot of improvements to FPS late-game<wbr></p>

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where Giant Fork’s Megacrit didn’t work<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could buy items you didnt have unlocked<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Frost Walker reset opacity when changing attack speed<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Holy Book was not affected by Particle Opacity<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed weird text popup when trying to microwave an item that has already hit its max cap (for example Overpowered Lamp)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a “bug” where you could just use the full map on the Blind Challenge<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could reset as you teleported to the next stage to keep your progress and not move to the next stage<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you got an error if you banished every item except one in a specific rarity and then talked to a shady guy.<wbr><wbr></li>
</ul>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li>New Game Setting: Advanced Settings – Will enable certain settings that most players don’t need to use. This is disabled by default to avoid making the settings cluttered for new players.<wbr></li>
<li>New Game Setting: Shrine Counter -&gt; Shows you how many of each shrine is available, and how many you have used<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show HUD -&gt; Shwo or hide the HUD<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Chest Animation -&gt; Skips the chest animation. Note: You won’t be able to banish items from chests if you use this setting.<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Portal Animation -&gt; Skips portal spawn animation (on stage 1)<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Enable Silver Pots -&gt; Enable / Disable silver pots (Ghost Item in shambles if you do this)<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show Item Feed -&gt; Show what items you picked up in a feed at the left side of the screen.<wbr></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>Tried to fix the “caveman” bug / exploit where you could hide in caves and enemies wouldn’t be able to spawn close to you or reach you<wbr></li>
<li>Increased Diceheads passive minimum reward potential (0.02 -&gt; 0.04). Basically his late level up rewards will be twice as high, surely won’t be OP<wbr></li>
<li>Chunkers now start with one more projectile<wbr></li>
<li>Amog Passive now increases in radius every level, from 4 to 12 over 220 levels. Previously it was always 4. Also gain 1% Posion Damage per level.<wbr></li>
<li>Calcium’s passive has been changed slightly. Instead of losing half of his momentum upon taking damage, he now looses about 25%, which decreases the higher you level up. At level 110 (max) you lose about 6.6%<wbr></li>
<li>Cursed grabbies now has a proc per tick limit of 250. Similar items (Spicy Meatball, Ice Cube, etc) already have a limit like this (at 50). It’s to improve FPS, but it is probably a slight nerf to Cursed Grabbies if you’re veeeryy late game.<wbr></li>
<li>Poison Flask starting projectile speed increased 12 -&gt; 16<wbr></li>
<li>Dragon’s Breath now has 200% faster rotation speed, and automatically targets enemies instead of following the player rotation. Damage buff 15 -&gt; 16, duration buff 1s -&gt; 1.5s and damage upgrade offer also buffed 3 -&gt; 4<wbr></li>
<li>Noelle passive gives less size per level: 1% -&gt; 0.75%, and the damage she gains per frozen enemy has also been reduced a bit: 2% -&gt; 1.5%<wbr></li>
<li>Max Silver Multiplier in Final Swarm has changed from 16x -&gt; 8x. People seem to have way too much silver, so it doesn’t make sense to have such a high multiplier anyway. At some point it would be nice to create some features that use silver, but im not sure what that would be yet<wbr></li>
<li>To address some of the flying meta: Final swarm ghosts will start increasing their speed after 20 minutes have passed. Also, normally, an enemy can only be stunned or frozen 15 times (CC cap) before it becomes immune. After this update, starting at 20 minutes, the CC cap will slowly decrease until they can no longer be stunned or frozen.<wbr></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>You can press F10 to open the console<wbr></li>
<li>At the moment, this is only really used to set a specific seed for the dungeon if you wanna speedrun it or something<wbr></li>
<li>Type “help” in the console to see all the commands and how to use them</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/no-law-is-a-lot-more-intimate-than-cyberpunk-2077-says-creative-director/</link>
            <guid>1383244</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When NO LAW was <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-law-from-makers-of-the-ascent-is-a-first-person-open-world-shooter-rpg-remiscent-cyberpunk-2077/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> at The Game Awards 2025, it was hard not to draw a comparison with CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077. The new project from Neon Giant, the studio behind The Ascent, is also set in a cyberpunk city, and it's a single player first-person open world shooter RPG, much like the more famous game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-celebrates-5th-anniversary-heavy-dsicount-new-trading-card-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently celebrated its fifth anniversary</a>.</p>



<p>In the first post-reveal interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-developers-of-no-law-know-everyone-will-compare-it-to-cyberpunk-2077-but-there-are-important-differences" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with IGN</a>, Neon Giant Co-Founder and Creative Director Tor Frick acknowledged the comparison but also explained why NO LAW is going to be a lot different from Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p><em>I think obviously every day we have to do that internally as well. Because we know what Cyberpunk is and we know people will compare us. But the game is very different and the world is very different. A lot of it is, it's just the mood and the tone. Cyberpunk is a big, sprawling experience. It's a mega city. And our game is a lot more intimate both when it comes to the gameplay mechanics but also the world. I think as people see more of the game that will be more apparent. It's hard to do in a short trailer like that. I think you need to see and feel the game more. It is more of an intimate experience, like the world is deep but not so grand. And the same thing with mechanics and the same thing with the story. It is very, very personal and very, very reactive around you as a player, rather than being set in this grand backdrop.</em></p>



<p>The studio's other Co-Founder and Creative Director, Arcade Berg, added that NO LAW also features a slight tongue-in-cheek tone like The Ascent, in contrast to Cyberpunk 2077's far more serious vibe. Other inspirations include 80s-90s action movies, which were also a bit campy, as well as Hong Kong action scenes, and even manga and anime.</p>



<p>In NO LAW, the main character, Grey Harker, is a seasoned veteran who chooses to retire from active military service following the severe injuries sustained during his previous deployment to pursue a life of peace. He had abandoned violence in favor of caring for his plants, but eventually, trouble walked through his door all the same, a bit like in John Wick, prompting him to return and make those who had wronged him pay.</p>



<p>The game is in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X with no set release window. It will be published by KRAFTON, which acquired Neon Giant a few years ago.</p>

<p>Stellar Blade's popularity is no secret, with the game selling exceptionally well <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-pc-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-says-shift-up">during its initial release on consoles</a> as well as its eventual port to PC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-proves-theres-appetite-for-playstation-5-games-on-pc-as-it-blasts-past-one-million-sales-in-three-days">the latter breaking records among similar releases on the platform</a>. ShiftUp is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shift-up-to-expand-stellar-blade-franchise-after-successful-launch-across-multiple-platforms">currently working on a sequel to the game, following the <em>stellar</em> performance of the first</a>.</p><p>Goddess of Victory: Nikke is a totally different beast. A mobile-based gacha shooter, <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/goddess-of-victory-nikke-hits-1bn-on-mobile-during-romantic-valentine-event/">the game surpassed $1bn in revenue earlier this year during its Valentines event</a>. It's featured crossovers from various other IPs,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-gets-confirmed-pc-release-and-goddess-of-victory-nikke-dlc"> including Stellar Blade</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1l7vlvw/rerun_of_the_nier_automata_x_nikke_collab/">Nier Automata</a>, and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF1PYiEqYVA">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-for-switch-2-reportedly-in-development">is also due for a Switch 2 release</a>, with the port reportedly in development. When we'll see some new big news for the series remains a mystery, but given the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away">Stellar Blade sequel was aiming for a 2026 release according to an investor presentation</a>, it shouldn't be much longer.</p>

            <p>After starring in the Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy, Lara Croft actress Camilla Luddington has passed her bow and arrows to Alix Wilton Regan with a farewell post to the character.</p>
<p>Luddington made her debut as Lara Croft in 2013's reboot, which saw a young and inexperienced Lara wash up on the shores of Yamatai. The actress then reprised the role for both 2015's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> and 2018's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>.</p>

<p>However, a new actress has now taken over the role of Lara for upcoming release Tomb Raider Catalyst. As announced at The Game Awards last week, Regan will play Lara Croft in Crystal Dynamics and Amazon's all-new Tomb Raider, as well as in the recently announced remake of the first game, known as Legacy of Atlantis.</p>
<p>Soon after this announcement was made, Luddington said her farewell to the character, adding she has "loved" the Tomb Raider fandom.</p>
<p>"To join the list of Lara Crofts before me was an incredible honour and she will forever be a part of me. The Survivor Trilogy was a decade of adventure I will never ever forget. I could not be prouder of what we created," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSLtUFOgTVj/?igsh=bnU3bDFscmh4amxq&amp;img_index=1">Luddington wrote</a>, with an image of her time filming motion capture.</p><p>"And as always, a new actress receives this incredible gift to step into the boots. 👏💫 So with that said-<a href="https://www.instagram.com/alixwiltonregan/"> @alixwiltonregan</a> .. if you're ever in need of a 🏹 , I know the exact spot to look for one at Croft Manor. 😉"</p>

<p>Regan also shared a post following The Game Awards announcement, calling being revealed as Lara Croft the "absolute highlight" of her career. It has "surpassed even my wildest dreams", <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSKc_PVEX6y/?igsh=MWZmank3c2NkNGx2bw%3D%3D">Regan said</a>. "This Lara Croft just wanted to say thank you, and get excited. We are just getting started guys.</p>
<p>"We are Just. Getting. Started."</p>

<p>Regan has had a number of other prolific roles before being cast as Lara Croft, including Aya in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, Lea in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a>: Overture and Alt Cunningham in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, to name just three. She was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/joanna-dark-actor-asks-fans-to-call-for-perfect-dark-to-be-saved-as-adam-jensens-actor-details-financial-loss-due-to-cancellation">also set to portray Joanna Dark in the cancelled Perfect Dark reboot</a>. </p>

<p>Tomb Raider Catalyst is set to take Lara over to Northern India on its release in 2027, when it will launch across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam. As for Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">due to be released next year</a>. Needless to say, I am incredibly excited about both.</p>
<p>As well as games, Amazon also has a live-action Tomb Raider TV series from Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the pipeline. Filming is expected to begin next month, with Sophie Turner as Lara Croft. Joining Turner are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-from-phoebe-waller-bridge-adds-another-major-cast-member">British actor Martin Bobb-Semple in an undisclosed "major" role</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Sigourney Weaver as Wallace</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm very excited. The scripts are incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty, as we have come to expect from Ms Waller-Bridge," Weaver said last week.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/15/edifier-hecate-g2000-pro-gaming-speaker-review/</link>
            <guid>1383223</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As you set up your brand-new glowing, pulsating RGB-heavy PC, you’ll likely realise there’s something missing: RGB-heavy speakers to light up your ears with sound! While I’m not sure of the medical or auditory accuracy of that, Edifier seem committed to the cause, with the new version of the Hecate G2000 Pro their latest stereo speaker kit, decked out with some extremely bright neon lights. If you’re into RGB, they might just be the perfect addition to your setup.</p>

<p>The Hecate G2000 Pro are, in line with the brand’s visual design language, shaped as a stretched-out hexagon, with our review unit coming with white speaker facades. Central to each of these is the speaker driver, its black surface contrasted by a silver centre emblazoned with the Hecate logo. The rear of each speaker unit is made from clear plastic, exposing the white and silver housing within, and they look smart and futuristic. They are definitely aimed at gamers though, and where you could easily see the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/24/edifier-qr65-desktop-active-monitor-review/">Edifier QR65</a> in a variety of different houses, these feel targeted at someone who wants a particularly flashy gaming setup.</p>


<p>There’s a range of support for different platforms, with the G2000 Pro certified for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S via USB-A, alongside Bluetooth connections, and you can also pump audio in via a 3.5mm connection, all of which means you can use them with pretty much any audio device out there. In the box, you’ll find the Hecate G2000 Pro, a power adaptor, as well as a USB-A cable and a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable in the box too, so you won’t be searching around for things to complete your setup.</p>
<p>The right-hand speaker features a control panel across the top edge, with four buttons giving you access to input selection, Bluetooth pairing, volume, EQ and lighting controls. This is, as with some of their previous speakers, the weakest element, as the input selection simply works its way through a series of clicks, rather than voicing what input they’re connected to, and at various points through our testing I became very confused about why I didn’t have any output from my PC, only to find that the input had changed.</p>


<p>The G button runs you through the different EQ settings, with each represented amusingly by audio prompts, so a short musical trill means you’re in music mode, what sounds like a chugging engine is aimed at movies (I think it’s supposed to be a cinema reel turning), and a click and clunk of a gun reloading is for gaming. This all takes a little unnecessary parsing out, and I can’t help but think things would have been a lot clearer with a simple spoken instruction.</p>
<p>Once you’re in the correct mode though, the next thing to consider is lighting. You can turn this off and on via the G button, and alter the brightness and setup via the control buttons, but for the sake of ease you’ll need to download the Hecate Gaming App. As apps go, this has to be amongst the most basic I’ve seen in recent years, and it’s disappointing to find that you can only choose between six colours, or a rainbow effect that scrolls through them. If you have an orange light setup – which is what I have – you can forget matching the Hecate G2000 Pro to it, which seems very very odd.</p>
<p>The Hecate G2000 Pro redeem themselves somewhat by sounding much better than their app would suggest. There’s a heap of power here, and a pleasingly airy soundstage that adds depth and space to whatever you’re pumping through them. I’ve been checking out President’s King of Terrors EP – that’s definitely Charlie Simpson isn’t it? – and the mix of electronic and rock instrumentation sounded fantastic via the Music EQ setting, with plenty of detail and well controlled bass tones. If you don’t like how this EQ sounds, there’s no option of tweaking or changing it, so you’ll have to search out other EQ options, the availability of which will depend greatly on what platform you’ve got them attached to.</p>

<p>Shifting over to gaming, I put the bespoke EQ through its paces with Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and its suitably epic Japanese-infused soundtrack, and the G2000 Pro definitely helped to immerse me even further into Naoe and Yasuke’s adventures. Dialogue was clear and carried well above the delicate audio, while the interstitial sound effects helped to round out the world further.</p>
<p>Bluetooth audio sounded solid, though the Hecate G2000 Pro is only capable of dealing with the standard SBC codec, so you’re not getting lossless playback or even AAC, and there was a difference in clarity between the USB connection from my PC and the lossy Bluetooth one. That’s not surprising, but I was disappointed to find there was no higher quality codec support when Edifier have put a lot of emphasis on this with their other recent products.</p>

			<p>There's little doubt that CAPCOM crafted a successful roadmap of releases for its Resident Evil franchise, expertly alternating some of the most requested remakes of classic titles with brand new entries.</p>



<p>Following the gamble (won) of <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-king/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and its first-person view, CAPCOM dropped the remakes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3</a> in consecutive years (2019-2020). The first one enjoyed universal acclaim and record-breaking sales, eventually becoming the best-selling game in the franchise (and CAPCOM's third best-selling game of all time after Monster Hunter World and Rise) with 16.30 million units, as last reported by the publisher. Resident Evil 3 was received slightly worse, with criticism focusing on its short length, the omission of content from the original, and the scripted set pieces. Even so, the game recently cracked CAPCOM's Top 10 best-selling chart, having sold 10.30 million units at the last update.</p>



<p>The studio then launched another new entry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Village</a>, in May 2021, concluding the narrative of RE7. This one fell somewhere in the middle between the remakes of 2 and 3 in terms of reception and sales. According to CAPCOM's latest financial report, Village has sold 12.30 million units to date. </p>



<p>Two years later, the Japanese developer released the remake of the most acclaimed installment in the whole series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 4</a>. It was another success on the level of the remake of RE2, earning awards and becoming the fastest-selling game in the series. <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-breaks-10-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It broke the 10 million units milestone this April</a> and yet CAPCOM reported that it's already at 11.10 million units now. At this rate, it should easily overtake Village over time.</p>



<p>All eyes are rightfully on Resident Evil Requiem right now, as the ninth chapter in the mainline series is less than two and a half months away from launch. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TGA 2025 confirmation</a> that Leon would be a playable character, roughly splitting the game with the other protagonist, Grace, further excited fans.</p>



<p>But CAPCOM is already working on the next remakes, in its bid to keep a constant stream of Resident Evil releases. The community has long requested a remake of Code Veronica, which was originally a Dreamcast exclusive. Three years ago, CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-remake-is-a-maybe-given-the-opportunity-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that it may be considered, given the opportunity. </p>



<p>Last year, CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-zero-code-veronica-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told fans</a> that the developers were crafting not only a Code Veronica remake, but also a Resident Evil Zero remake. IGN quickly corroborated the story. Now, Dusk Golem, fresh from the victory of being vindicated for the long-time prediction of Leon as a playable character in Requiem, has <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1999738896800973030#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> on the status of both remakes. Code Veronica is expected to be announced next year for a planned 2027 launch, whereas Zero is scheduled to release in 2028 (and will presumably be announced in 2027). This would follow a similar output to the RE2 and 3 remake, which were released in quick succession.</p>



<p>In Code Veronica, the narrative unfolds three months after the events of Resident Evil 2, following the sibling protagonists, Claire and Chris Redfield, as they try to survive a viral outbreak at a remote prison island in the Southern Ocean and a research facility in Antarctica. Resident Evil Zero, on the other hand, is chronologically the earliest game in the series, being a prequel to the first installment. In this game, the player switches between two characters, S.T.A.R.S. officer Rebecca Chambers and convict Billy Coen, as they explore an abandoned training facility for employees of the pharmaceutical company Umbrella, located on the outskirts of Raccoon City.</p>

We will carefully listen to this community, which shares our love of rich and satisfying game mechanics, to tune and perfect the experience before the console release. That is why choosing to work with Radical Theory as a strategic partner felt natural as they understand and support studios through their experience, deep expertise, and genuine transparency.”</p><p>Radical Theory CEO Luc Heninger added, “It is a real pleasure to collaborate with the team at The Breach Studios – developers who are as passionate as they are friendly and talented. <em>Westlanders</em> won us over in the first few minutes of gameplay, as the Western setting is still rarely explored in the survival-crafting genre. We have a true sandbox experience here that will allow players from all backgrounds to experiment with rich, deep mechanics.

We saw it in every sun-drenched clearing, in every vast, untamed vista. But this land gives with one hand and takes with the other.

To create games that awake that sense of immersion, thrill and discovery that we believe videogames convey in a unique way. It is with this spirit we’ve created <em>Westlanders</em>. We are fans of survival, exploration, crafting and management titles. We love games like <em>ARK</em>, <em><a title="Games > Valheim [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a></em>, <em>Palworld</em>, <em><a title="Games > Factorio [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a></em>, <a title="Genres > Co-Op [363 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative games</a>… and we like Westerns since we’re kids. We’ve of course played too much of <em><a title="Games > Red Dead Redemption [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> series, and we wanted to see what could happen if we combined <em>ARK</em> with the mood of <em>Red Dead</em>—this is how <em>Westlanders</em> is born.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement teaser trailer below.

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#918)—Clues and Answers for Monday, December 15]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-15-918/</link>
            <guid>1383190</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re halfway through December (almost), and the festive window is rapidly drawing nearer. Before it gets here, you’ve got a couple of weeks of NYT Connections puzzles to solve. Fortunately, I’m on hand to give you the answers you need! Below, you’ll find the latest NYT Connections hints to crack today’s puzzle as quickly as possible.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-15">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 15)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #918:</p>



<ul>
<li>FINAL</li>



<li>BUMPER</li>



<li>QUALIFIER</li>



<li>GIANT</li>



<li>QUARTER</li>



<li>MONSTER</li>



<li>SEMI</li>



<li>TITANIC</li>



<li>DIVE</li>



<li>CELSIUS</li>



<li>DUMP</li>



<li>COLD</li>



<li>HOLE</li>



<li>ONE HUNDRED</li>



<li>JOINT</li>



<li>SEE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of the stages you pass through before a champion is crowned</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Words you’d use to describe something so big it feels exaggerated</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Places you might warn a friend not to hang out in</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Different contexts where the single letter “C” takes on a specific meaning</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 15:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-15-918">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 15 (#918)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– FINAL, QUALIFIER, QUARTER, SEMI</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BUMPER, GIANT, MONSTER, TITANIC</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – DIVE, DUMP, HOLE, JOINT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> -CELSIUS, COLD, ONE HUNDRED, SEE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When is the ARC Raiders Cold Snap Update Coming Out?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-release-time/</link>
            <guid>1383184</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is set to receive a major update this week, with Embark Studios pushing Cold Snap to all platforms. It’s one of the biggest updates to launch since the game was released on October 30, and it’s set to introduce new map conditions, quests, and a fresh weather system.</p>



<p>Fans are excited, but when is Cold Snap being released in ARC Raiders? Find out everything you need to know about this update below.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-cold-snap-being-released">When is Cold Snap Being Released?</h2>



<p>Cold Snap will be released on December 16th, most likely at 04:30 AM EST. While we know the update is being released on December 16th, Embark Studios has yet to confirm the specific time that the update goes live. However, if it mirrors the launch of North Line on November 13th, it’ll drop at 04:30 AM EST (09:30 AM GMT).</p>



<p>This is the most anticipated update to hit ARC Raiders since the North Line update introduced Stella Montis just over a month ago. While no new maps are being added in Cold Snap, fresh map conditions are coming to blanket the game in snow, altering the landscape.</p>



<p>The Flickering Flames event will also be added to ARC Raiders with this update. Again, not much is known about this event, but it’s widely assumed it’ll be a harsh change that causes players to take damage if they’re stranded outside in snowy conditions. It should function similarly to the other map conditions we already have, like Lush Blooms, Harvester, and Prospecting Probes.</p>



<p>Cold Snap will be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on December 16th. Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re excited to explore ARC Raiders in the snow.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-shelter-largest-update-yet-comes/</link>
            <guid>1383172</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bethesda Game Studios has invested significant resources into Fallout Shelter, the popular mobile game that has since expanded to multiple platforms, boasting over 250 million downloads as of 2025. The staggering update has introduced a wealth of new content into the game, particularly on Steam, with new quests, characters, themes, and more being added in one comprehensive update.</p>



<p>The supersized update also introduces the first of many Fallout Shelter Seasons, new limited-time events that populate the game with new experiences, exclusive rewards, and a spin-wheel mechanic.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-shelter-is-still-giving-a-decade-later">Fallout Shelter is Still Giving, a Decade Later</h2>



<p>Fallout Shelter is a phenomenal mobile-first title for Fallout fans everywhere. It dropped before the launch of Fallout 4 in 2015 and has remained a staple of the series ever since. In Fallout Shelter, players are charged with building and managing their own vault, embarking on missions into the wasteland, levelling up vault dwellers, and repopulating a fractured planet.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588430/view/514102575975368959">blog post on Steam</a>, the team at Bethesda Game Studios revealed that the <strong>largest update yet </strong>has arrived in Fallout Shelter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Rejoice, Overseers – Fallout Shelter’s biggest update yet is here! Years of content previously only available on mobile is now available on Steam, including new questlines, characters, weapons, themes, and more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This atomic update includes the first Fallout Shelter Season, dubbed ‘Viva New Vegas’ in tribute to the second season of the Fallout television series. It also adds a new questline that mirrors the show perfectly, named Power Struggle. It features all the main characters of the show and boasts <strong>eight </strong>linear quests.</p>



<p>Fans of the show can even unlock CX404, the adorable pup adopted by The Ghoul, as a vault pet.</p>







<p>Are you still playing Fallout Shelter after all these years? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re excited about this content update.</p>

<p>Since its arrival in stores, Mortal Kombat fans have discovered <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mortal_kombat_4">Mortal Kombat 4</a> is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1pkvcto/bad_news_about_the_switch_1_2_physical_versions/">not included on the Legacy Kollection's game card</a>. Digital Eclipse has confirmed this in <a href="https://x.com/DigitalEclipse/status/1999234250332131659">multiple replies</a> on social media – explaining how this build had to be submitted "far in advance" and MK4 was "just not ready", so it's been <a href="https://x.com/DigitalEclipse/status/1999534794082828309">made available as "downloadable content"</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Xs2kwn_IQEU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xs2kwn_IQEU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytXs2kwn_IQEU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xs2kwn_IQEU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xs2kwn_IQEU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed64676azjnpsx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Digital Eclipse:</strong> "MK4 did not make it to the Switch cart in time for physical release. The Switch build had to be submitted for production far in advance of the release date, and MK4 was just not ready. All other platforms have MK4 included."</p>
</blockquote>

<figure data-uuid="31dd1208de183"><a title="Digital Eclipse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/31dd1208de183/digital-eclipse.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the <a href="https://atari.com/products/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-deluxe-edition?variant=45781778137253">official Atari website</a>, where you can purchase a physical copy of the Legacy Kollection, the page for this title has now been updated with a notice about a download adding Mortal Kombat 4 to the Switch versions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Atari:</strong> Nintendo Switch Users - In order to fully enjoy Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection we encourage you to connect your Switch console to the Nintendo store and download our post release patches, which add additional content, including MK4, and performance improvements."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo Life has access to a physical Switch 2 cartridge of the Kollection, which runs on Version 1.0.1 out of the box and it <a href="https://x.com/DigitalEclipse/status/1999505589798322671">requires users to perform a day one update</a> to access Mortal Kombat 4 and the rest of the game.</p>
<p>This again follows Digital Eclipse informing Switch and Switch 2 fans the experience would be on the game cartridge:</p>
<figure data-uuid="27bb5ece85368"><a title="Digital Eclipse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/27bb5ece85368/digital-eclipse.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Digital Eclipse has also confirmed this only impacts the Nintendo versions of the game. The PlayStation 5 physical release contains <a href="https://x.com/DigitalEclipse/status/1999517869667741902">every game in the Kollection on the disc</a>. It also says if <a href="https://x.com/DigitalEclipse/status/1999642095431147587">a future cartridge reprint happens</a> for Switch platforms, it will supposedly include Mortal Kombat 4.</p>
<p>If there are any significant developments regarding the Legacy Kollection's physical release, we'll provide an update.</p>

<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 has concluded with a series between two titans: Team Vitality, the tournament favorite, and FaZe Clan, an unexpected entrant to the grand final. In the end, Vitality proved unstoppable, defeating FaZe Clan with a memorable 3-1 finish and securing back-to-back Major trophies.</p>



<p>The Major might be over, but Counter-Strike 2 isn’t. Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a>&nbsp;to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>

<h2 id="h-team-vitality-just-got-500-000-richer">Team Vitality Just Got $500,000 Richer</h2>



<p>The grand final began with FaZe Clan picking Nuke, where they managed to edge out Team Vitality with a strong scoreline, presenting fans with promise in the earliest map of the final. However, Vitality quickly regained control, crushing FaZe 13-3 in the follow-up. From there, the French-led roster never looked back.</p>



<p>It was a decisive victory for Team Vitality, which has gone down in the history books after putting up one of the best single seasons in the world of esports this year. The team claimed the half-a-million-dollar prize and lifted <strong>another trophy </strong>in 2025.</p>



<p>This makes Vitality the first team since 2019 to secure consecutive Major titles, which is a perfect way to end the season. For FaZe, the loss is a bittersweet one. It was a rocky year for the team, and many had their doubts going into the tournament, let alone the grand final.</p>



<p>Fans of the organization were begging for a redemption shot at the final Major of 2025, but it just wasn’t to be.</p>



<p>Now, we start looking to the 2026 esports calendar and whatever comes next.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nioh 3 – Everything We Know about Team Ninja’s Supernatural Action RPG]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/roundup/nioh-3-everything-we-know-about-team-ninjas-supernatural-action-rpg/</link>
            <guid>1383028</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="overview">
			
<p>Several years after the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 2</a>, Team Ninja returns to the series with <strong>Nioh 3</strong>, after cleansing their palate with many other franchises. Except for 2021, the highly prolific division of Koei Tecmo has released a new game every year, starting with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</a> in 2022, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a> in 2023, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rise of the Ronin</a> in 2024, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> in 2025. Most of these games had their own twists: Stranger of Paradise was a peculiar (and controversial) reinterpretation of the original Final Fantasy featuring a whole party of characters; Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty was the studio's first foray into a Chinese fantasy setting; Rise of the Ronin was an ambitious open world action RPG similar to the recent Assassin's Creed games; and of course, Ninja Gaiden 4 allowed the studio to reintroduce its most prized IP to newer generations with the help of PlatinumGames.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden may be witnessing a resurgence in popularity, but the Nioh series also gained a significant following over time. Koei Tecmo is now self-publishing the new game, too, so they have an even greater interest in making a bigger splash with this new entry.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions</h2>



<p>Nioh 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-announced-with-action-packed-trailer-launches-in-early-2026-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> during June 2025's State of Play event. Right away, Koei Tecmo confirmed the early 2026 target release window. In September, Amazon Japan <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026-amazon-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> the final release date of <strong>February 6, 2026</strong>, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-trailer-provides-new-quick-look-at-story-and-gameplay-confirms-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> a few hours later during September's State of Play.</p>



<p>Players will be able to test the game ahead of its release, thanks to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-demo-ps5-pc-january-29-2026-carries-full-game-crossplay-missing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free demo</a> launching on <strong>January 29, 2026</strong>. The demo's save file will carry over to the full version, allowing demo players to continue the journey right away.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, whereas the first two Nioh titles were published by Sony and released on PlayStation 5 several months before the PC version as part of the exclusivity agreement, this new game is being published by Koei Tecmo and is therefore the first in the franchise to get a <strong>simultaneous release on PlayStation 5 and PC</strong> (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>).</p>



<p>Nioh 3 can already be pre-purchased on both platforms. There are two editions: the Standard one, priced at <strong>$69.99</strong>, and the Digital Deluxe Edition, priced at <strong>$109.99</strong>. The latter includes the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>Base game</li>



<li>Season pass comprising two DLCs, one due by the end of September 2026 and the second by the end of February 2027</li>



<li>Season pass bonus "Chijiko Netsuke Charm" (accessory)</li>



<li>Infernal Weapons Set (14 types)</li>



<li>Kodama Netsuke Charm (accessory)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both editions have a Pre-Order Bonus and an Early Purchase Bonus. The former will activate if you buy the game before the launch date, whereas the latter can still be received as long as you purchase Nioh 3 by <strong>February 19, 2026</strong>. The Pre-Order Bonus provides the Hellfire Equipment Set (Hellfire Warrior Armor set + Hellfire Ninja Attire set) and Scampuss Furball Netsuke Charm (accessory), whereas the Early Purchase Bonus grants you access to the Hellfrost Equipment Set (Hellfrost Warrior Armor set + Hellfrost Ninja Attire set).

<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Like its predecessors, Nioh 3 can be described as a challenging<strong> action RPG</strong>, primarily focused around punishing one-on-one duels and boss encounters rooted in Japanese swordplay and yokai folklore. After the intermission of Nioh 2 (which served as a prequel to the first Nioh chronologically), the story returns to the late <strong>Sengoku period</strong> (16th century). The main protagonist is <strong>Tokugawa Takechiyo</strong>, a young warrior poised to become <span>the Shogun, while his embittered younger brother,&nbsp;<strong>Tokugawa Kunimatsu,</strong>&nbsp;secretly conspires to overthrow him</span> with a horde of yokai (demons in Japanese folklore). Besieged by his brother, Takechiyo travels through time to alter the course of destiny and preserve Japan with the help of his guardian spirit, Kusanagi.</p>



<p>Throughout the course of the narrative, Takechiyo will traverse the Sengoku, Heian, Bakumatsu, and early Edo eras. The developers have confirmed that throughout the game, players will encounter a plethora of historical figures, including, but not limited to, Himiko, Saito Fuku, Hattori Hanzo, Honda Tadakatsu, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, Yagyu Munenori, and Takasugi Shinsaku.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Team Ninja pitched Nioh 3 to fans as an evolution of the series' stance-based combat into a dual-style system where players can freely swap between <strong>Samurai</strong> and <strong>Ninja</strong> modes mid-fight. The <strong>Samurai</strong> style broadly resembles Nioh 1 and 2, emphasizing precision melee with katana and traditional arms, ki (stamina) management, and stance variations, enhanced by new techniques and counters introduced in this new title. The new <strong>Ninja</strong> style, on the other hand, offers a distinctly different experience that emphasizes speed, evasive maneuvers, aerial attacks, and trick-based offense, encouraging hit-and-run and mobility-heavy builds. Players can chain style swaps on the fly, opening hybrid combos that weave heavy samurai strikes into evasive ninja strings. Most of the other familiar series pillars, like guardian spirits, yokai abilities, and loot-driven progression, are returning, albeit now largely tied into a new endgame challenge framework dubbed <strong>The Crucible</strong>, which appears to function as a high-risk, high-reward gauntlet layered on top of the campaign.</p>



<p>The other major innovation is that Team Ninja moved away from the strictly mission-based map of earlier entries toward what they are calling an <strong>“open field”</strong> structure. This doesn't mean a traditional open world; instead, you can expect larger interconnected regions dotted with settlements, roaming yokai, and optional encounters, providing more continuous exploration without abandoning curated combat arenas. As noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our most recent hands-on preview</a>, main and sub-missions still anchor the experience, but surfacing them organically in the landscape makes progressing through a region feel less like hopping between menus and more like inhabiting a continuous war-torn countryside. Every detour—whether it is sweeping up loot, tackling Myths sidequests from NPCs, clearing Enemy Bases, or hunting down Crucible Wraiths—pushes up a regional Exploration Level that hands out permanent perks, from raw stat bumps to a fully revealed map dotted with markers for points of interest. On top of the usual torrent of gear and materials, those activities drip-feed skill points for the game’s sprawling trees and layer in extra blessings from friendly yokai and Jizo Statues. </p>



<p>Speaking during a recent interview, producer Fumihiko Yasuda also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-dev-made-sure-there-wont-be-sudden-difficulty-spikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that while the game will respect the series tradition of being quite hard, there won't be any sudden difficulty spikes. This should lessen frustration for newcomers to Nioh.  </p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Team Ninja is one of the few triple-A studios that has not switched to Epic's Unreal Engine. Nioh 3 will still run on the studio's proprietary Katana Engine, last seen in the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. Based on the studio's previous games, the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro are likely to offer Performance and Quality modes, although this has yet to be confirmed for this title.</p>
