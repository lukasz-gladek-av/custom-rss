<p>Eagle-eyed players have spotted images of Subnautica 2 in the current game, and the moderators on Reddit have confirmed that these images are indeed from the sequel. The new images were found in a time capsule in Subnautica.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subnautica</a> subreddit (via <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/subnautica-2-screenshots-are-appearing-in-the-original-game/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=subnautica-2-screenshots-are-appearing-in-the-original-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Destructoid</a>), a user had posted an image that intrigued the entire community. The image was of a time capsule from Subnautica, which described, “Hey, um, found this on my way to the rocket. Is this thing new? Never seen it before! :O #PEEPERSRULE. Many players started speculating that these images could be from a new game before a moderator confirmed their suspicions.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the comments section, one of the moderators stated that these images are authentic and that there “may or may not be others to find.” In the same thread, the moderator also confirmed that these time capsules have been discovered in Subnautica 1 and are screenshots for the upcoming game, Subnautica 2. Additionally, the moderator clarified that no new creatures were coming to the original game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three images have been spotted so far, all related to one new creature arriving in Subnautica 2. These images showcase the fins, body, and half of the creature’s head separately, with all different body parts following a similar colour pattern.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The screenshots are exciting for the fans eagerly waiting for Subnautica 2’s release, but we still do not have a concrete release date from Unknown World Entertainment. Hopefully, an announcement will arrive soon. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding Subnautica 2, the developers have clarified<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/subnautica-2-developer-clarifies-the-games-multiplayer-and-games-as-a-service-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the game’s multiplayer and games as a service (GaaS) model</a>. In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-devs-update-bugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout: London Devs have promised</a> a fix for the mod’s most significant issues. What are your views on the Subnautica 2 images? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-patch-113-out-now-heres-what-it-does<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> developer FromSoftware has released update 1.13 for the game following a period of server maintenance across all platforms.</p><p>This second post-<a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> patch, live now on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S, follows early July’s 1.12.3 update, which tweaked the Golden Hippopotamus fight, among other things.</p><p>Publisher Bandia Namco released the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.13 patch notes</a>, and there are a few changes worth highlighting. For example, fans are getting excited about this quality-of-life change:</p><p>"Changed the default selection of the OK / CANCEL prompt that shows up when using the 'Spectral Steed Whistle' while the spectral steed is dead. The default selection position is now OK."</p><p>However, localisation staff removed from the credits are still yet to be added in. The patch notes say:</p><p>"In update 1.12, an error was included in the credits of the game. This issue will be corrected in the next update."</p><p>Elden Ring is one of the biggest video games of recent years, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-reaches-25-million-units-sold-ahead-of-shadow-of-the-erdtree">selling an incredible 25 million copies</a>. The Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is a hit, too, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/those-tough-elden-ring-dlc-requirements-didnt-stop-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-it-sold-an-incredible-5-million-in-just-3-days">selling five million in just three days despite tough requirements</a>.</p><p>IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree review</a> returned a 10/10. We said: "Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single-player DLC expansions. It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2>Elden Ring update 1.13 patch

            <p>
There's now an easier way to buy and play Jackbox mini-games, via the brand's new Megapicker launcher, available on Steam.
</p>
<p>
To celebrate, Jackbox is currently offering discounts on its range of mini-games and - for the next 30 days - the fan-favourite Drawful 2 to keep for free. 
</p>
<p>
The Megapicker, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jackbox-finally-adding-megapicker-for-seamless-minigame-swapping-across-packs">first announced last month</a>, is designed to act as a central hub for Jackbox mini-games, eliminating the need to rifle through each of its party packs for the game you're after. (This is handy, as I frequently forget which pack some mini-games were released within!)
</p>
<p>
If you already have Jackbox collections in your Steam library, their respective mini-games will unlock in the Megapicker. 
</p>
<p>
The Megapicker is free to download - and you can grab it via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2828500/The_Jackbox_Megapicker/">Steam</a> here. 
</p>
<p>
Next up from Jackbox? After years of its mini-games being used by players for terrible, awful, booze-driven drama, the brand is set to launch a deliberately adults-only offering: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jackbox-is-getting-risque-with-adults-only-naughty-pack">the Jackbox Naughty Pack</a>. The mind boggles as to what this will contain.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/conscript-review-a-glorious-set-of-stairs-we-make.940197/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/conscript-review-glorious-set-of-stairs-we-make<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Concealed in a lot of anti-war messages is this “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” nature. There’s not a lot of genuine empathy for the characters involved for a lot of it, even if they do harbor genuine regret at the actions brought forth by the powers that be from the beginning. Still, it’s always a place to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/spec-ops-line-10-years-later">showcase the damage done to its soldiers</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/conscript"><em>CONSCRIPT </em></a>is no exception.</p>
<p><em>CONSCRIPT </em>is the debut title from Catchweight Studio and the brainchild of solo developer Jordan Mochi. Based in Australia, Mochi has been working on <em>CONSCRIPT </em>since 2017 and has personally been a highlight of my Twitter timeline the entire time. Sitting alongside other games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/signalis"><em>SIGNALIS</em></a>, <em>Resident Evil</em>, and the old-school <em>Metal Gear</em> games as inspirations, it’s been a long time coming, but we’re out of the trenches now.</p>
<p>You play as André, a French soldier during World War I who is stationed in Verdun. Your brother, Pierre, is fighting alongside you, known to the fritz above as they continue their assault in the French countryside. During a tumultuous assault on several forts occupied by the French Poilu, Pierre goes missing during a raid, and you must find him before the Germans do.</p>

<p>You may be surprised to learn that <em>CONSCRIPT</em>’s penning as a psychological horror game all comes from reality. There are no ghosts, no supernatural element attached whatsoever, just the pure cold realities of war. A noble effort, especially as you walk out of your bombed-out tent for the first time and see what war truly means.</p>
<p>Continuous machine gun fire in the distance. A thin haze covering anything with a wispy overcoat, and screams that call out for help, for mother, or for God. As first impressions go, <em>CONSCRIPT </em>is right up there with the best of them for immediately setting a tone, that being “war is hell”, and sets you up for what should be the fight of your life.</p>
<p>Combat can be rugged, bone-shredding, and otherwise brutal as you attempt to get to grips with it. Everything has a hearty kick, and the ranged weapons all sound and feel like they’re doing damage. There’s a quirk to some weapons like the revolver or rifle where you’ll have to cock it back after each shot, which only makes your timings all the more crucial.</p>

<p>In practice, it falls apart, however. There’s not a lot of grace or nuance to any of it, you’ll mostly be kiting several enemies around a square set and popping off shots whenever you can, which isn’t really in the spirit of things. The enemy AI also has no other play than “run forward and swing”, which is probably why it tends to cheat half the time you’re in combat.</p>
<p>When you’re facing enemies who actually have ranged weaponry, survival instinct says to dodge, or hide behind cover. Your combat roll can get things done in the heat of the moment, but for some reason, the level geometry - even when it’s clearly above André’s head - is penetrable for the German soldiers. It’s a deal-breaker when you’re looking to just breathe and focus on the next play, and the flammenwerfer soldiers can do it too!</p>
<p>It’s entirely plausible to avoid combat entirely, thanks to some fairly basic stealth mechanics introduced early on. Enemies have a wind-up timer for noticing you in plain sight, and you can do one-hit takedowns of most enemies if you hit them from behind without noticing. Actually navigating some of the areas later in the game with this mindset, however? Forget about it, due to the previously mentioned level geometry being a flat-out stinking lie, and the game hosting some absolutely godawful map design.</p>

<p>Some may call it intricate, but in its essence, it is obtuse to the point of sheer derision. Occasionally, André will pen maps as he explores the game world, but only occasionally will he decide to actually mark down blockades that otherwise wouldn’t appear on the map. This is something that is forgotten pretty quickly however, as the game will present you a map that has dead ends, but actually has rubble, fire, or barbed wire preventing you from continuing further.</p>
<p>So you start to completely ignore what the world offers, as it soon becomes clear that <em>CONSCRIPT </em>isn’t remotely interested in playing fair. Early on, there’s a rat mechanic introduced similar to how it works in <em>Dishonored</em>. If you kill an enemy and don’t take the proper precautions of burning their body afterwards, rats will spawn in, feast on the carcass, and become a new threat.</p>
<p>While they tend to be fairly negligible since dealing with them is a complete faff, it turns out they’re part of a bigger issue. Say that German soldiers have respawned in an area where you’ve already wiped them out, and rats have spawned in before the soldiers arrived. What might be considered a smart move - letting the rats deal with the soldiers or vice versa - is instead nullified by virtue of… I don’t know, the rats are also German, I guess?</p>

<p>So that’s two hazards in cahoots with each other, acting as a punishment for the player for overlooking their mechanics. If you place barbed wire in certain spots, it can stop the soldiers from respawning, and throwing a grenade into tiny cubby holes in the trenches can stop rats from feasting on corpses killed by André. It’s a good game of inventory management it presents and is indeed one of the few mechanics that aren’t immediately overused or immersion-breaking.</p>
<p>It’s hard pretending you’re the last line of defense between a German invasion and French liberation when the trenches you’re stuck in seem to be an offshoot of the Spencer Mansion. Survival horror can be as indebted to Resident Evil as much as it wants, but when <em>CONSCRIPT </em>invites the same arbitrary “3 keys for 1 door” blockade several times in a playthrough, I realize I am not in Verdun trying to save my brother and comrades; I am in an escape room playing for a Personal Best.</p>
<h2><em>CONSCRIPT </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>
<p>I cannot stress enough how much I wanted to like <em>CONSCRIPT</em>. The world is begging for survival horror with undertones like this, and while it certainly tries, mere words cannot explain how badly it misses the mark. It’s a constant cheat in its gameplay, its horror elements are downplayed to the point of mockery, and the story lacks anyone or anything that warrants sympathy.</p>
<p>If this is a love letter to survival horror, it’s a Dear John.</p>

<div>
<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Remarkably dull and unremarkably poignant, CONSCRIPT’s gameplay isn’t fun, its horror isn’t scary or impactful, and its story isn’t worth repeating. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p>The Global Head for LoL Esports at Riot Games, Naz Aletaha, has announced her departure through a new post on X (formerly Twitter). After working for Riot Games for around 12 and a half years, Naz Aletaha is ready to begin the next chapter in her career.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through a post titled “A Grateful Farewell,” Naz Aletaha announced her departure from Riot. Aletaha stated that the decision wasn’t easy, given the many accomplishments during her tenure, but it was time for Aletaha to explore new horizons. Aletaha also talks about the early days. He said LoL esports was a “bold dream amid a sea of scepticism,” Now they have managed to fill arenas, break records, and build one of the most significant esports communities.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.strafe.com/news/read/global-head-of-lol-esports-leaves-riot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Strafe</a>, Aletaha was hired by Riot in 2012 as a Senior Manager in Business Development before she took over the position of the Global Head for LoL esports in 2021. Prior to her journey with Riot, Aletaha was employed by Activision, another big name in the business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During her time as the Global Esports head for LoL, they accomplished some massive feats. Still, the most significant was bringing a peak viewership of over 6.4 million viewers to the League of Legends 2023 world championship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before her departure, Aletaha announced that she was taking a break through the Riot sabbatical program, stating that she would be out for a few months and return to close out the 14th season. However, before we could see that happen, Aletaha announced her exit from the company. It will be interesting to see where her journey takes her next.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus - the gorgeous 2.5D platformer with Metroidvania elements based on Japanese folklore - released earlier this month across PC and consoles. However, due to its partnership with Humble Games, developer Squid Shock says it has faced a number of unexpected stumbling blocks since release, notably with its console ports.</p>
<p>In a recent post shared on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1614440/Bo_Path_of_the_Teal_Lotus/">Steam</a>, Squid Shock acknowledged the "unexpected changes" within Humble Games, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-confirms-restructuring-amid-reports-all-staff-have-been-laid-off">layoffs were confirmed at the indie publisher</a>, and said it was still unsure what was happening next.</p>
<p>"This news caught us off guard, and we are still working to understand the full implications," the Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus team wrote on 25th July.</p>

</figure>
<p>At this time, the studio said while Squid Shock is a separate entity to Humble Games, and it remains committed to both Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus and its community, the changes at the publisher could result in delays for updates, particularly on consoles.</p>
<p>"This is mainly due to issues with storefront accessibility, which we're actively working to resolve as quickly as possible," Squid Shock said last week.</p>
<p>In a further post on social media platform X shared last night, the developer called the recent layoffs a "critical blow" to Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus' post-launch support. It then elaborated further on updates for console versions of the game.</p>
<p>"We are now in a difficult situation when it comes to updating the console ports, as both Porting and QA Support was tied into our deal with Humble," it wrote. "We are actively pursuing all available avenues to allow us to roll out updates to console versions, but we regret to say this may take some time to put in place."</p>
<p>Squid Shock said it "will get this resolved", and will continue to work on updates for the PC version of Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus. "We want to assure you that these updates and fixes will come to consoles in the future," the team wrote.</p>
<p>In a subsequent reply to one commenter, who said they were refraining from purchasing the game on PS5 due to past issues with 7 Days to Die, Squid Shock said this was a different situation.</p>
<p>"We will get backend access. They just haven't done the transfer yet," it affirmed.</p> <div>

<p>Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus is not the only game to suffer from collateral damage following the layoffs at Humble. Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/coral-island-developer-blames-humble-games-layoffs-for-leaving-switch-port-in-a-place-of-uncertainty">Coral Island developer Stairway Games</a> blamed the recent layoffs for leaving console versions of its game "in a place of uncertainty". Switch backers are now being offered a key change to Steam, effective immediately.</p>
<p>As for Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, I was rather enamoured with it when I gave the demo a go earlier this year.

            <p>
The International Olympics Committee walked away from its partnership with Nintendo and Sega for the long-running Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games series in order to explore deals with new partners, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a> and esports, Eurogamer understands.
</p>
<p>
As the real-life Olympics gets underway in Paris, there's been discussion online of there being no new Mario &amp; Sonic tie-in for this summer's Games, for the first time in almost two decades. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking with Eurogamer, a veteran behind the series has now said the decision to end the popular Mario &amp; Sonic franchise rested with the IOC, which chose not to renew its licensing deal with Nintendo and Sega, and allowed it to lapse in 2020.

<p>
"They wanted to look at other partners and NFTs and esports," <a href="https://leecocker.com/">Lee Cocker</a>, who worked on almost every entry in the series, told Eurogamer. "Basically the IOC wanted to bring [it] back to themselves internally and look at other partners so they would get more money."
</p>
<p>
Cocker previously worked at ISM Ltd, a sports marketing and digital media firm responsible for managing the Olympic Games license in the world of video games. 
</p>
<p>
Over the past 20 years, six Mario &amp; Sonic Olympic Games titles have launched, beginning in 2007. Subsequent entries tied into London 2012, Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020, as well as the Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver 2010 and Sochi 2014.
</p>
<p>
The Mario &amp; Sonic Olympics series has been hugely successful, though latter entries suffered somewhat from the same sports recurring. 
</p>
<p>
With Nintendo and Sega's mascots ditched, the IOC has gone elsewhere. It's not been well promoted, but this year's Paris 2024 Games do have an official video game tie-in: Olympics Go! Paris 2024, a free-to-play smartphone-focused effort from San Franciso and Seoul-based company nWay, which previously developed several Power Rangers games. 
</p>
<p>
There's a PC version of Olympics Go! too, released via the Epic Games Store, though screenshots show the same touch controls and basic visuals of its smartphone versions. You can compete in 12 Olympic Sports, such as archery, gymnastics, 100m athletics, swimming and golf.

<p>Recently, one of the prominent Valorant esports players, Sentinels player Tyson ‘TenZ’ Ngo, took to Twitch to express his deep disappointment in Riot. He grilled Riot for using lower-end PCs during their premier competitions like VCT, stating that if he can afford it, surely Riot can too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/valorant/tenz-calls-out-riot-for-using-old-pcs-for-major-vct-events-2842435/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> during a recent Twitch livestream, TenZ spoke about not understanding Riot’s perspective on investing in lower-end PCs for their competitions. TenZ compares the situation with his days as a Counter-Strike pro, where their PCs were outfitted with the best CPUs and GPUs and came with a monitor with the highest refresh rate.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SEN TenZ Cooked RIOT For Providing Bad PC For VCT's Biggest Event" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOUFefmEClE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The former CS Pro expands, stating that Riot, on the other hand, features some “off-brand” monitors that are “2 generations behind”. He understands that purchasing a bunch of high-end PCs costs a lot, “but if I can fund that from my bank account right now, then sure as hell, Riot can do it”, said the Sentinels player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>TenZ speaks about how this has been a complaint against Riot for so many events, and they have yet to make any moves to remedy the situation. At the same time, he is “almost certain” that Riot uses the same PCs for Valorant and LoL esports competitions, and the company might be “trying to min/max the cost” by using the same hardware for both games. However, he added, “League can run on a potato,” but Valorant is different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>TenZ also commented on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOUFefmEClE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube clip</a> of his opinion, stating that his complaints aren’t an “excuse” and that he has a “big enough platform” to voice his opinion as a competitor, which is not just for him but all the players participating at these events. He feels the best players should use the best gear; “that’s just a fact”. Also, he added, “Riot makes so much money from this game, and it feels like they put the bare minimum back towards the esports scene”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An apology was issued on the game's X account, noting their names would be added in an upcoming patch.</p>
<p>However, that's still to be rectified. "In update 1.12, an error was included in the credits of the game," reads the patch notes. "This issue will be corrected in the next update."</p>

<p>The biggest change in the patch is to the Spirit Ashes. The notes include a long list of the summons, which will now no longer stagger as easily, while some also have increased attack power.</p>
<p>Further, summoned spirits will have increased attack power and damage negation when at Revered Spirit Ash Blessing level five and over - all except the Mimic Tear.</p>
<p>There are also balance adjustments specifically for PvP, as well as more general balance changes impacting a large number of weapons, skills, spells, and incantations from the DLC.</p>

<p>Modders have been busy altering the game too, including a mod to allow players to summon bosses as Spirit Ashes - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-mod-lets-you-summon-bosses-for-aid">Divine Beast Dancing Lion and even Messmer the Impaler</a>.</p>

            <p>As the first Something Of Mana game to come out in 15 years, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/visions-of-mana">Visions Of Mana</a> is bound to be exciting some of you out there. Well, funnel all that anticipation into your mouse-clicking finger, because developers Square Enix have just put up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490990/Visions_of_Mana/">a playable demo of the bright JRPG</a> on Steam. I'm not sure how much the demo offers, as we're only told it includes "a section of the story, battles and exploration." But that's better than nothing, and with a full month before release, you have plenty of time to scope it out.</p>

<p>Playing the demo will also get you some flashy weapons when it comes time to play the full game, say Square Enix in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2490990/view/4360131627020109908">an accompanying post</a>. The Gladius, Falx, and Horn Lance will unlock at certain points in its full release, provided you have the data from the demo on your PC. However, actual progress from the demo won't carry over to the full game, we're told. This is the one thing that stops me playing demos - the gnawing fear that I will have to repeat something I have already done. An absolutely bone-shattering debilitation to have when one is a games journalist. Never mind.</p>
<p>In Visions Of Mana you play as Val, a young lad from the local "Fire Village", as he travels to the Tree of Mana with his Val pals, exploring "semi-open" environments and donking enemy monsters in party-based real-time combat. So far it looks very colourful and cheery, if a little conventional. It's still one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-75-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2024">75 most anticipated games of the year</a>. Our Jeremy has fond Mana-ly memories, for example, and is interested to see what Squeenix do with the first original game in the series since 2007 (we're not counting all the remakes). He's excited that Flammie, the Falcor-inspired mascot of the series, seems to be a party member in this entry. You can see the fluffy little dragon guy fighting alongside our heroes in the trailers.</p>
<p>The full game is due out August 29th. We may have more thoughts on it then. You should always check back when we have more thoughts. You have no idea how many thoughts we all have here. Listen, just keep us open in a tab for the rest of the month and hit refresh every day. The thoughts never cease. </p>

            <p>In Cleanfall you essentially play a Roomba that is trying to reverse the apocalypse because the apocalypse is <em>messy</em>. A Roomba capable of tunnelling through miles of procedurally generated, monster-infested crust so as to reorganise the Earth's core and bring about its ultimate objective - a sparkling living room. I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.</p><!--more-->

<p>"You are a small, unassuming cleaning bot that desires nothing more than a neat and tidy home," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2769780/CleanFall/">the Steam page</a>. "But ever since the planet was dragged closer to the sun by a monomaniacal tech nerd, dust and death swirl across the surface, making for a very messy situation. If your house will ever be clean again, you need to fix the world. A clean world means a clean house. So, fix the world. Simple." Pretty sure this is how Genghis Khan got started.</p>
<p>Cleanfall takes the form of a 2D platformer roguelite with a surprising tower defence element. As the aforesaid cleaning bot, which you can upgrade into an extremely jaded robo-maid, you'll burrow through each biome in search of resources, items and hidden friendly or at least, non-hostile characters. You'll study the habits of organisms which look like spiders, tadpoles and octopods dosed up on Compound V. And you'll build hellish dangling labyrinths of "alchemic" turrets, ranging from mortars to drone hubs. Going by the trailer above, the action nears bullet hell intensity when there's a full complement of rancid kaiju spermatozoa involved.</p>
<p>I haven't had a chance to play, but there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3130820/CleanFall_Demo/">a demo on Steam</a>, and initial user reactions suggest that this is worth a pop. The full game is out in 2025. The obvious comparisons, which I will now crudely weld into a revolting headline, are Spelunky and Terraria with a touch of Carrion and Noita. </p>

            <p>After years of anticipation mixed with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-delays-the-release-of-dlc-sized-fan-mod-fallout-london">a few unexpected delays</a>, Team Folon's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-fan-made-mod-out-today">Fallout: London mod finally released last week</a>.</p>
<p>The fan-made game-sized mod for Fallout 4 faced a number of challenges on launch, however. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-ian-explore-the-new-fan-made-fallout-london-mod-in-todays-live-stream">our Ian discovered when he gave it a whirl last week</a>, he couldn't explore very much of it because it kept hard crashing back to his desktop (he did get mauled to death by a fox, though, so still rates the whole experience very highly).</p>
<p>You can see Ian playing through some Fallout: London via the video below.</p>

<p>Thankfully for those like Ian who are eager to explore more of the mod - which despite its issues clearly holds a lot of promise - Team Folon is working on a fix.</p>
<p>Addressing the "reported technical issues" in Fallout: London in a post on social media platform X, the team said it will release an update "soon". It then thanked everyone for their patience in the meantime.</p>
<p>Team Folon also shared an installation guide which it said should help make the process "as hassle-free as it gets". <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/fallout_london/fallout_london_quick_start_guide_common_bug_fixes/page1">You can find it here</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Eurogamer has followed the development of Team Folon's mod for some time. Recently, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-cast-will-include-former-speaker-of-the-house-john-bercow">former Speaker of the House John Bercow would be lending his voice</a> to an AI robot. In addition to Bercow, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-adds-baldurs-gate-3-actor-to-its-cast">Neil Newbon - voice of Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3 - is also in the cast</a>.</p>
<p>As for Fallout more generally, it has had quite the renaissance this year, thanks to the popularity of Amazon's TV series. This Fallout adaptation was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">watched by 65 million people in its first two weeks</a> and has just recently been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-adaptation-nominated-for-16-emmy-awards">nominated for 16 Emmy Awards</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">second season was announced to be in the pipeline</a> soon after the show made its debut in April. According to showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-second-season-will-be-out-as-fast-as-humanly-possible">Fallout team is "going to be pedal to the metal to get season two out as fast as humanly possible"</a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> staff are concerned a third round of layoffs could hit the streaming platform, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reportedly-set-to-lay-off-around-500-employees-later-this-week">500 job cuts earlier this year</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-lays-off-400-employees-as-part-of-latest-amazon-cuts">400 in 2023</a>.
</p>
<p>
That's according to a new report from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/twitch-amazon-video-games-investment-9020db87">The Wall Street Journal</a>, which states Amazon paid almost $1bn for Twitch but it's now making less money and engagement has slowed.
</p>
<p>
The company is set to have an annual operational review this autumn and staff are concerned more job losses could follow. Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy has led a profitability review at Twitch and shown little tolerance for unprofitable business, the Journal reports.

<p>

Sources at Twitch are concerned the platform could become a "zombie brand" at Amazon. These are projects or acquisitions that are sidelined for not living up to expectations - Goodreads and Woot are two examples.
</p>
<p>
A spokeswoman for Amazon told the Journal it has always taken a long-term view of Twitch and noted its ability to attract harder-to-reach audiences. The company said it remains confident in Twitch's potential.
</p>
<p>
At the start of the year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-isnt-profitable-admits-ceo-in-wake-of-recent-layoffs">Twitch CEO Dan Clancy admitted the company isn't profitable</a>, shortly after layoffs were announced.

</p>
<p>
Amazon doesn't publicly reveal revenue figures for Twitch, but internal documents reviewed by the Journal suggest it generated about $667m in ad revenue and $1.3bn in commerce revenue in 2023. This accounts for less than 0.5 percent of Amazon's total revenue for the year.
</p>
<p>
The Journal reports spending on subscriptions is down and, if internal projections are correct, Twitch could shed almost a quarter of a billion dollars in revenue by the end of 2025. Further, Twitch's advertising sales have plateaued since its boom during the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
According to network analytics and security firm Noka Deepfield, Twitch has dropped from the fourth largest source of US web traffic in 2014 when bought by Amazon to the 18th.
</p>
<p>
"We definitely are intending to be around for many years," VP of product Jeremy Forrester told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-future-of-twitch-safety-growth-and-the-importance-of-finding-community">Eurogamer at this year's TwitchCon EU event</a>. "Obviously the biggest action that we took was the layoffs... to try and put Twitch in a position to be sustainable for the long run. We want to be in a position where we can continue supporting creators for the longest time."

</p>
<p>
"I personally feel very confident about where we are right now," he continued. "We're structured in a way in which we have a good line of sight for the next few years of where we want to go and where we want to be."
</p>
<p>
A major part of Twitch's strategy is improving its mobile experience. At TwitchCon EU it announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitchs-revised-mobile-app-will-arrive-this-summer">new mobile app would be released this summer</a> - that's now available for all users.

</p>
<p>
"Today, most of the hours watched on Twitch come from our desktop experience. But in any given month, over 50 percent of users primarily use Twitch on their phone, with 40 percent exclusively using their phone," reveals a <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/07/29/find-content-you-love-faster-with-the-new-twitch-mobile-app/">blog post about the new app</a>. "Most of our desktop users also check in regularly from the app. This is even more pronounced with new viewers - almost three quarters start watching Twitch for the first time on mobile."

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-4x-performance-ray-tracing-path-tracing/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-could-definitely-offer-up-to-4x-ray-tracing-performance-of-base-model-but-path-tracing-will-remain-ambitious-leaked-specs-suggest.940143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-4x-performance-ray-tracing-path-tracing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro could definitely offer&nbsp;<span>up to four times the ray tracing performance of the base model claimed in&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked documents</a>, as some of the system's new ray tracing features </span>will indeed bring considerable performance improvements.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3MlpJrJHXE">latest episode of their weekly podcas</a>t, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a look at some of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-rdna-4-gpus-feature-enhanced-ray-tracing-architecture-double-rt-intersect-engine-radeon-rx-8000-ps5-pro/">leaked new ray tracing features that will be included in the RDNA 4 architecture</a> and will make their way onto the upcoming console, highlighting how some of them, such as double ray tracing intersect engine and BVH footprint improvement could indeed lead to much better performance. The former, for example, will improve the performance of the intersect engine that is used to repurpose texture units as ray tracing accelerators to do the smaller part of ray tracing, which is also the most expensive. The latter, on the other hand, should improve BHV compaction, which is used to reduce the memory footprint for what a developer needs to trace against. As of now, on PC, NVIDIA benefits more from BHV compaction, but this enhancement should improve things on AMD as well as on the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this recent leak doesn't go into any detail regarding specific hardware changes and does not make any mention of traversal, which is an important part of ray tracing. NVIDIA and Intel, for example, have hardware that takes over the traversal aspect of shooting a ray through the BVH structure, which is something extremely expensive and that is notoriously bad on a "normal" GPU. A patent from Sony a while back revealed a traversal unit that has yet to surface in any PlayStation 5 Pro leak, so maybe the console will have new hardware that will further improve ray tracing quality.</p>
<p>However, if the system really lacks traversal acceleration, then path tracing may be too ambitious for it. Older games with path tracing, like Quake 2 RTX or even Minecraft, could definitely run on the system, but more modern titles, like games powered by Unreal Engine 5, never could, no matter how simple they are. Since games will still need to run on the base model, the scale of ambition of the PlayStation 5 Pro is certainly limited.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #173: PS5 Pro RT Features, PS5 Pro No Man's Sky Settings, Fallout London Launches!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3MlpJrJHXE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially revealed. If the system is indeed releasing before the end of the year, it will undoubtedly be finally announced within the next few weeks.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has today released a demo for its forthcoming Action-RPG Visions of Mana.
</p>
<p>
Included in the demo are story, battle, and exploration elements, plus players who complete it will receive three weapons for main character Val in the full game. It takes place partway through the first chapter, but progress won't carry over to the main game as the demo has been specially created.
</p>
<p>
The demo was surprise-released, with a new trailer below showing off some new gameplay.

</p>
<p>
Visions of Mana will be the first new game in the series for over 15 years - it began with Secret of Mana on the SNES back in 1993 and has seen multiple releases since.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, fresh details on its Elemental Vessels were revealed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/29/visions-of-mana-new-details-on-three-elemental-vessels-plus-deep-dive-video/">PlayStation Blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
The series has long revolved around elemental powers and Visions of Mana is no different. Here, acquiring Elemental Vessels has three effects: they provide methods of environmental traversal, and they impact combat by providing both elemental abilities and altering the class of the character they're assigned to.
</p>
<p>
"One of the most important elements of Mana games is that feeling that you're interacting with the elementals (spirits that control elements like wind, fire or darkness)," said director Ryosuke Yoshida.
</p>
<p>
"That's at the core of the design of Visions of Mana and something that was really important to me. It's such a vital part of that distinctive Mana series identity, and if the battles didn't capture it, there would be no point to the game at all!"
</p>
<p>
Said series producer Masaru Oyamada: "The Mana series has always featured eight distinct elementals with each embodying one of the core forces that shape the world. Naturally then, there would be eight vessels that house each of their powers. We came up with lots of interesting ideas for different objects to use, but ultimately aimed to create designs that would best capture the interesting aspects of each elemental."
</p>
<p>
New examples of the Elemental Vessels were provided in the blog. For instance, the Lumina Lantern houses the power of light which can use the power of reflection to create new walkways and reflect damage between enemies. Shade Sight, meanwhile, has the power of darkness and gravity, acting like a grappling hook.
</p>
<p>
More details on these Elemental Vessels are in the below video.

<p>
Yoshida also discussed how the elements are integrated into combat.
</p>
<p>
"Central mechanics like switching between three party members in battle, using ring menu and shortcut bindings are inspired by elements from past Mana games. However, I had a strong desire to put more weight on switching between different characters during combat," said Yoshida.
</p>
<p>
"One way we did this, for example, was through the Elemental Vessels and the gameplay options they offer. You have a party of three characters and can equip each one with a different Elemental Vessel that manifests different effects. It's possible to follow up after you use one of these effects by switching and using a different elemental power to create an even more potent compound ability. 
</p>
<p>
"In this way we create motivation and benefits for the player to switch between different characters in battle."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visions-of-mana-releases-this-august-square-enix-announces">Visions of Mana is set for release</a> on 29th August. I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visions-of-mana-returns-to-series-roots-but-is-yet-to-flower-into-a-truly-original-experience">hands-on with it earlier this year</a> and was impressed with its return to series roots.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-games-the-lost-olympics<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>Forgotten Gems is a regular column about notable games that have moved out of the public eye and may not be easily accessible anymore. To see all the other games I've covered so far, be sure to check out the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/columns/forgotten-gems"><em>13 previous issues of Forgotten Gems</em></a><em> in our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/columns"><em>Columns</em></a><em> section.</em></p><p>First-person shooters. Roleplaying games. Action adventures. Even though they’ve evolved significantly alongside the gaming hardware they run on, some of today’s most-popular genres are multiple decades old and are likely here to stay for good. It’s hard to imagine people not playing a Call of Duty game in 2030, just as it’s unlikely that fighting games like Street Fighter and Tekken will just be over and done with in the foreseeable future. </p><p>But some some genres have definitely diminished over the years to the point of almost disappearing entirely. Real-time strategy games – like StarCraft – at one time filled entire sports arenas of people eager to watch esports competitions. I haven’t heard anyone mention the “brain training” genre in years. Some bygone genres come complete with physical relics – literal skeletons in our closets: plastic guitars, fake drumkits, or even turntable controllers  One of you – yes, I’m talking to you – even still has that Tony Hawk skateboarding controller in his attic.</p><h2>We Have The Olympics at Home</h2><p>As a kid, I couldn’t have imagined that The Games would ever end. When we didn’t know what else to do, a “quick game” of Epyx’s Summer Games or Winter Games would inevitably fill an entire afternoon. As you may be able to guess just from their titles, Epyx’s sports games simulated events you would find at the Olympic Games or in Track &amp; Field competitions, with different control styles depending on the style of each event.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/29/summergames-ad-1984-1722297026057.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>While not licensed by the IOC, Epyx played to 1984's Olympic Fever in all its marketing.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Despite being one of the defining multiplayer game series of the ‘80s, these Commodore 64 (et al.) hits kept us busy until 1992 and then quickly vanished, essentially ending what we thought would be a game genre for the ages. </p><p>There’s not even a widely-accepted game sub-genre moniker to attach to them. “Multi-event sports” games, perhaps? But they were all the rage in the early ‘80s thanks to the genre-defining Olympic Decathlon created by Timothy W. Smith for the TRS-80, Tandy’s home computer system sold via their Radio Shack stores (TRS stands for Tandy Radio Shack). This ten-event “key-masher” really took off when it was ported to Apple II in 1982. It then got an even wider release year later on IBM PC under the name Microsoft Decathlon.</p><p>Summer Games, like Konami’s 1983 arcade hit Track &amp; Field (aka Hyper Olympic), took inspiration from Decathlon, but left behind the top-down track views of the original to try and create more realistic, TV-like visuals. The two games were developed in parallel, with Konami’s game out of Japan becoming a major success in arcades and Summer Games targeting home computers instead. The race was on – and a new gaming genre was born. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Decathlon was our first choice, because it seemed like it would be easy to break up into discrete tasks that each programmer could work on without needing to interact." - Scott Nelson</p></div><p>“I just remember the Apple II Decathlon game was being successful, or at least a lot of us were having fun with it at work,” said Jon Leupp, who came over from Starpath and ended up designing and programming a number of memorable events in Epyx’s Games. “The events were all so simple, and the fun was trying to beat each other’s scores and of course to always trying to improve your own best score just a tiny bit more. We realized we could take the graphics to a whole new level so it seemed like a great project to move forward with.”</p><h2>Getting Summer Games on Track</h2><p>In a now-archived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020312054517fw_/https://home.arcor.de/cybergoth/epyx/summer1interview1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Epyx Shrine interview</a>, designer Scott Nelson, responsible for the framework and master control program, said that the choice to work on Summer Games was a pragmatic one: “When Starpath and Epyx merged, we needed a C64 game quickly. That meant a project that five or six people could work on at the same time, and still actually reduce the time to market. Decathlon was our first choice, because it seemed like it would be easy to break up into discrete tasks that each programmer could work on without needing to interact.”</p><p>But the team didn’t like some of the events included in decathlon and started from scratch to create a new list of events they wanted to include. “We had a big list of possible events, and picked the ones we thought would be easiest to do,” said Nelson. “Some of the events that looked hard ended up in Summer Games II."</p><p>The designers locked in six unique events and two variants – Pole Vault, Platform Diving, 4x400m Relay, 100m Dash, Gymnastics, Freestyle Relay Swimming, 100m Freestyle Swimming, and Skeet Shooting – and delivered the final game for release in 1984. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Summer Games (1984, Epyx) Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>While most of the events used a 2D side view, Skeet Shooting, developed by Leupp, took a different angle as the sole first-person perspective event.</p><p>“We were trying hard in those original games to keep details like the scoring systems fairly accurate to the real world events. We also wanted to capture something of the feel of the mechanics, though clearly with a joystick and a button that’s a bit of a stretch,” he told me. “For Skeet Shooting I wanted the gravity of the gun barrel to come into play and force you to account for that as you swung through to lead the target. I studied the real world event rather than looking at any similar game mechanics, so that may explain my ‘unique’ approach.”</p><p>This courage to depart from the visual and gameplay templates of other events in the same package and include unique physics quirks to create wholly new experiences would become a defining trait for the Epyx Games series for years to come.</p><h2>Sprint to the Finish</h2><p>While lightning fast by today’s standards, the actual development process turned out far more interactive than Nelson originally envisioned, according to Leupp. “We were all in the same office. I believe we all designed our events ourselves but we discussed the initial designs as a group so we had buy-in from everyone,” he recalls. “We were a good collaborative group so we’d ask for and offer each other advice throughout development. There were no egos getting in the way. We all played each other’s games as they came together, more for fun than as an official process, but of course that helped make all the games better.”</p><p>Obviously, hitting a summer release window was crucial timing for a game called Summer Games – but more importantly, it arrived in time for the much-hyped 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Whether it was the perfect timing or the design team’s wise decision to avoid the joystick-breaking, button-mashing approach of its contemporaries, Summer Games was a hit! </p><p>It seemed like the design team at Epyx had come up with a perfect formula for success. Critics and gamers liked the varied, and more technical approach to sports events – and this type of game could be developed fast while still maintaining a high quality level if the individual designers all delivered on their respective parts of the whole.</p><p>“One fun thing is that different designers bring different approaches to events, so I think that brought a fun variety of experiences to the package that might not have been true if a single designer had made them all,” said Leupp. “Another nice thing about multi-event games is it’s easy to create more events, so when Summer Games turned out to be a huge hit, it only made sense to do Summer Games II, Winter Games, California Games, and others.”</p><h2>Faster, Higher, Stronger, Gone</h2><p>Long before Activision and EA  talking about “annualized franchises”, Epyx started releasing a new “Games” title every year. Winter Games hit just months after Summer Games in 1984. Summer Games II followed in 1984. World Games in 1985. California Games in 1987. In 1988, the year of the Summer Olympic Games in Seoul, Korea, and the Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada, Epyx released two games under the new brand names The Games: Summer Edition and Winter Edition. But despite securing an official licensing deal from the 1988 U.S. Olympic Team, The Games weren’t able to recapture the excitement of the earlier titles. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Epyx Games: Complete Playlist</h3><p>From Summer Games to Winter and back to the sun of California, here are all of Epyx's sports games over the years.</p></div><p>The inevitable California Games II arrived almost as a footnote in 1990 for DOS PCs and was ported to other platforms, including the SNES, two years later. By then, Epyx had downsized significantly, laid off all but 20 employees – a tenth of its workforce just four years earlier – and shifted to exclusively work on Atari Lynx games. Whether it was oversaturation, or the company’s choice to back ailing Atari instead of aligning with new market leader Nintendo, Epyx kept shrinking until its remaining assets were sold off to Bridgestone Multimedia and the company ceased to exist. </p><p>“Epyx went bankrupt because it never really understood why it had been successful in the past, and then decided to branch out in a lot of directions, all of which turned out to be failures", programmer Stephen Landrum said in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090504083458/https://www.fomalhaut.de/c64.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">archived interview</a> on a German fan site. </p><p>While Epyx’s sports games are not a household name today, you’d be hard pressed to find gamers in their 50s who grew up playing games on C64 or Atari computers and couldn’t immediately tell you their favorite. For me, personally, it never got better than the original Winter Games. Gorgeous art aside, there was just something special about how well that game rewarded players for learning the intricacies of its very technical controls. The Biathlon mode is almost a mini-adventure game of its own; the way it cycles through multiple screens before getting to the gun range! I have fond memories of playing arcade game competitor Track &amp; Field as well (I used improvised contraptions such as a pen and pen-cap "seesaw" for maximum buttonmashery, just so I could rank higher than our local arcade machine’s top-ranked players... Curse you, “ASS” and “SEX”!) -- but in the end, Summer and Winter Games will always remain my favorite sports games from those days.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/wintergames-1722298240315.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Instead of rote button mashing or joystick waggling, Winter Games' Biathlon event requires players to balance  their skiier's movement and watch their pulse to ensure a steady hand during the shooting portion.</figcaption></figure></output><p>However, most of my friends will point to California Games as the one that stuck with them. Not only did California Games tackle surfing way before it became an Olympic discipline, programmer Jon Leupp blazed trails to create the first – and many would argue still best – surfing video (mini) game of all time. </p><p>“For better or worse in my career, I never stopped to consider how difficult a task might be. If it was fun, I wanted to do it. So, the first challenge was to make an animated wave. Clearly that wasn’t going to be done with sprites, so I wrote a character set animation tool and Susie Greene did a great job building a rolling wave with it”, recalls Leupp. “I studied wave physics and initially tried simulating those, then quickly punted and just used tables that I tweaked to make the motions feel reasonable. In the Lynx version the designer went wild and allowed quadruple flips and those sorts of things which actually made it super fun. I think that was the right thing to do for that new handheld device, and that new generation of games. In the original I was still trying to simulate real world competitive surfing. “</p><h2>Where Can You Play it Now?</h2><p>Just like MOBAs taking over from competitive RTS games or Rocket League becoming this generation's NBA Jam, there is, of course, an heir to the decathlon-likes. All it took was for control methods to evolve – namely, via Nintendo’s Wii Remote and Nunchuk – and suddenly every game publisher under both the summer and winter sun released multi-event sports competitions once again. Only, this time, players used gestures and Wii’s version of button mashing, the dreaded “waggle”. Even Mario &amp; Sonic got in on it and headlined a series of officially-licensed, whimsical takes on the Olympic Games that lasted until the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.</p><p>Wii Sports started the fad and became one of the most-played video games of all time, but like Epyx’s Games, the new-found trend didn’t last. Too many people waggled far too much in too little time and what looked like a new way to play quickly became an old way to never play again.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The genre feels timeless to me so I’d be surprised to not see new incarnations of it in the future." - Jon Leupp</p></div><p>“The genre feels timeless to me so I’d be surprised to not see new incarnations of it in the future,” agrees Leupp, who left the games industry to work on slot machines for the last 27 years and just retired from that job in February to spend more time traveling with his wife and his two Australian Shepherd dogs. “Maybe online leaderboards have replaced the charm of trying to outdo your friends scores on a single simple event, or a series of events, but I can still imagine creating games where those components are appealing.”</p><p>You can, of course, gather friends and family for a great time playing modern, more raucous takes on multi-event games like Nintendo’s own Mario Party. But if you want to revisit the dinosaurs that didn’t quite make it, you can pick up a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/30/the-c64-mini-review">Commodore 64 Mini micro-console</a> and play California Games, Summer Games II, World Games, and Winter Games with period-appropriate joysticks. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/c64mini-1722299437857.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The most authentic way to relieve the glory of (at least some of) the Epyx Games is via The C64 Mini. Check <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/30/the-c64-mini-review">our review</a> for more.</figcaption></figure></output><p>If you don't want any additional hardware in your home, Pixel Games UK licensed the rights for some of Epyx's games and put out a <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/summer-games-atari-2600cpcmaster-systemspectrum">2022 Summer Games compilation</a> on Steam -- but there's a catch: it collects only the inferior ports (from Atari 2600 to ZX Spectrum), not the classic C64 edition or the decent Atari 8-bit conversion. The famed Atari Lynx version of California Games saw a re-release this year via <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-epyx-collection-handheld">The Epyx Collection: Handheld</a> on Nintendo Switch, courtesy of the same publisher. The lack of an IOC license is actually an advantage for game preservation as it’s much easier for the games to get reissued without changes, so we're bound to also see the C64 originals in more places in the future. </p><p>The idea behind Summer Games lives on. I’m hopeful that someday, someone will pick up the torch and assemble an ensemble of talented game designers to create the most realistic take on the world’s most enduring athletic competition. Until then, you may just have to travel back to 1984 to relieve the genre’s glory days. Or watch the real Olympics on TV.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/PeerIGN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Peer Schneider</em></a><em> leads game guides and tools strategy across IGN, Map Genie, RockPaperShotGun, VG247, and Eurogamer.

In Behaviour Interactive's post-apocalyptic multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/meet-your-maker">Meet Your Maker</a>, you raise grim forts of rusty blocks, pop-out manglers and robot ambushers from the desert sands. Each base harbours a cannister of genetic material and other resources, and the idea is to fiendishly arrange traps and defences to stop people taking your precious genmat while doing your best to clean out their bases. Sound like good wholesome fun? You might want to check out the current free trial on Steam. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's not clear from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1194810/eventcomments/4514380244078925809?snr=1_2108_9__2107">announcement release</a> how long the trial will last. It's also not entirely clear how long Meet Your Maker will last. The shoot-o-builder launched to a largely positive reception, but has seemingly struggled to build a following. <a href="https://meetyourmakergame.com/news/whats-next-for-meet-your-maker/">As of March this year</a>, Behaviour have "[shifted] the team's attention towards new and exciting projects within the company" following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-layoffs-as-behaviour-interactive-and-ci-games-adjust-scope-and-make-optimisations">layoffs in January</a>. Since then the game has received more superficial-sounding updates in the form of seasonal Expedition level-up tracks for cosmetics items. Behaviour <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-by-daylight-studio-behaviour-are-laying-off-almost-100-staff-mere-months-after-they-cut-dozens-of-devs">made another, much larger round of layoffs in June</a>.
</p>
<p>
All that notwithstanding, Meet Your Maker can be a hoot and a holler. The advantage of theming the whole thing around raiding bases, of course, is that the game is better equipped to weather the shrinking of the active player base. I tried it back at launch last year, and while I didn't manage to fulfil my overall objective of recreating the Central Perk cafe from Friends  with a cast of bellowing cyborgs, I did enjoy getting slaughtered by other people's cheeky contraptions. Lava cube above the floor spikes, is it? You scalliwags!</p>
<p>"Curious is the trapmaker's art - his efficacy unwitnessed by his own eyes," ponders the Ancestor from Darkest Dungeon. Not in this case, Mr Ancestor - Meet Your Maker comes with a Replay Station that lets you watch other people raiding your maps. Smash a few of those together with the Benny Hill music and you're surely in the running for a BAFTA. As for those "new and exciting" projects at Behaviour - I wouldn't be surprised if a few had been shelved during the company's last round of cost-cutting. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead By Daylight</a> remains Behaviour's flagship production, bolstered by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lara-croft-is-the-next-survivor-coming-to-dead-by-daylight">a steady stream of guest stars from other games</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-adds-fsr-3-support-difficulty-modifiers-and-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer Keen Games announced the release of a new major update for the survival action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-2024-early-access-roadmap-full-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enshrouded</a>. 'Back to the Shroud' adds support for AMD FSR 3, upgraded from FSR 2, although it should be clarified there is no frame generation (yet). They just updated FidelityFX Super Resolution to the latest version, thus improving its quality.</p>
<p>From a gameplay standpoint, the update's highlight is the addition of several difficulty modifiers that allow you to customize your Enshrouded experience. The developers have set four standard settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Default</strong>: this difficulty is still present as the baseline and would be the recommended setting for first-time players.</li>
<li><strong>Relaxed</strong>: reduces the amount of enemies and provides you with more resources and loot. A perfect mode if you are most interested in base-building and light-hearted adventuring.</li>
<li><strong>Hard</strong>: increases the amount of enemies and makes them more aggressive to give you a tougher combat experience.</li>
<li><strong>Survival</strong>: for those who seek some punishment with additional survival mechanics on top of more aggressive enemies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, over thirty individual settings can be tweaked to the player's preferences, from enemy damage to boss health, player skills, and even a starvation mode similar to other survival games, to the duration of buffs, the length of day and night cycles, and the duration of the Shroud. All these tweaks are available both in single player and co-op mode, including when playing on dedicated servers.</p>
<p>Keen Games also introduced new character customization options with this update for skin color, eye color, eyebrow color, and six additional character presets. Moreover, equipment like armor pieces and weapons can now be displayed in your base by attaching them to newly available craftable props; collectible props can also be found throughout the world of Enshrouded and then displayed on decorative shelves. Last but not least, the crafting menu was improved, the block and parry system was refined, and several points of interest have been expanded.</p>

<p>The World Series of Warzone Global Final has just been given a location by Activision Blizzard, and this year, it’s headed to Las Vegas, Nevada. Last year, the tournament took place in the United Kingdom, but Call of Duty is slipping away from Europe dramatically quickly. This time around, players will travel to the Orleans Arena in LAs Vegas to compete for a portion of the $1 million prize pool.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-time-coming">Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>Activision Blizzard has left the organisation of the World Series of Warzone very late this season. On September 14, the best Warzone players in the business will travel to Las Vegas to take part in this million-dollar event, but with just six weeks of notice until the tournament takes place, many are grumbling about the close schedule.</p>



<p>Activision recently revealed the teams (trios) competing at the World Series of Warzone Global Final:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a stunning list of players, and there’s a $300,000 prize reserved for the number one squad. Last year, that squad was Team Biffle, with Biffle, Shifty, and Sage winning the top prize in an epic fashion. </p>



<p>Las Vegas’ World Series of Warzone event will also herald the return of SoloYolo, a winner-takes-all tournament with a one-shot match and a $50,000 grand prize for <strong>one player</strong>. This has historically been one of the most exciting tournaments in the Call of Duty: Warzone space, and it’s all over in a matter of minutes. </p>



<p>This is a fairly huge deal for Call of Duty fans – Activision has invested more in the World Series of Warzone this year than in previous years. It’s easily one of the most popular events in the battle royale space, pulling in hundreds of thousands of viewers. </p>



<p>It all kicks off on September 14 – will you be watching?</p>

<p>Call of Duty is one of the most electrifying FPS franchises ever made. It has a history that stretches back more than twenty years, and for the last decade, it has been coming up as one of the most popular esports games in the business. In this guide, we’re breaking down everything you need to know about Call of Duty esports, from the best tournaments to the most notable players who have spearheaded the growth of the competitive scene.</p>



<p>If you want to know as much as possible about COD esports, look no further than this guide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-call-of-duty-an-esports-game">Is Call of Duty an Esports Game?</h2>



<p>Typically, any game that boasts a competitive, multiplayer-based platform can be an esports game – that’s all that’s technically needed. However, Call of Duty transcends that, with the series being the home of a multi-million-dollar esports ecosystem backed up by Activision Blizzard and some of the best esports organisations in the world.</p>



<p>Call of Duty has been growing as an esports game for more than ten years, with the first big-budget, mainstream Call of Duty tournaments surfacing in 2012 with Black Ops II. That was when the first Call of Duty World Championship tournament took place, but thanks to MLG and similar organisations, the origins of COD esports still go back a little further.</p>



<p>It might not be as big as Counter-Strike or as valuable as Dota 2, but Call of Duty esports are still popular enough to pull in hundreds of thousands of viewers with each new tournament. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-call-of-duty-tournaments">Best Call of Duty Tournaments</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Call of Duty esports scene would be nothing without the tournaments that make it so popular. Every year, the best Call of Duty teams fight for millions of dollars and immense bragging rights, taking to grand stages around the world to face off against their opponents.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of the best Call of Duty esports tournaments:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Call of Duty League</strong>: The top-tier competitive league in COD esports which takes place annually</li>



<li><strong>Call of Duty Challengers:</strong> The second-level tier of competitive Call of Duty that is played alongside the CDL</li>



<li><strong>World Series of Warzone</strong>: Call of Duty Warzone’s foremost tournament, which is played on a global level</li>



<li><strong>Esports World Cup: </strong>Call of Duty appears at the Esports World Cup with a multiplayer and a battle royale category</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-what-is-the-most-valuable-call-of-duty-tournament">What is the most valuable Call of Duty tournament?</h3>



<p>The most valuable Call of Duty tournament is the Call of Duty League, which is the highest tier of competitive COD. It has a prize pool that exceeds $5 million per year.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-the-most-popular-call-of-duty-tournament">What is the most popular Call of Duty tournament?</h3>



<p>The Call of Duty League remains the most popular COD tournament in 2024, boasting peak viewership counts that almost reach half a million users per event.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-call-of-duty-pro-players">Best Call of Duty Pro Players</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>We’ve got a full breakdown of the best Call of Duty esports players, but for now, here’s a small assortment of the top COD players in history:</p>



<h3 id="h-damon-karma-barlow">Damon ‘Karma’ Barlow</h3>



<p>In 2024, Karma became the first COD player with four ‘rings’ after winning the Call of Duty League Championship as OpTic Texas’ coach. He has secured three world championships as a player and won the first-ever title in BO2 in 2012 with Fariko Impact.</p>



<h3 id="h-ian-crimsix-porter">Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter</h3>



<p>Crimsix is the winningest COD player ever, boasting more ‘chips’ and rings than any other player. He is retired from Call of Duty now, but his legacy lives on and he’s regarded as a Hall of Fame player by many.</p>



<h3 id="h-seth-scump-abner">Seth ‘Scump’ Abner</h3>



<p>Scump was known as the King of Call of Duty before his retirement in 2023. He has been the face of COD esports for years and is one of the most popular creators and gamers in the COD space.</p>



<h3 id="h-chris-simp-lehr">Chris ‘Simp’ Lehr</h3>



<p>Simp is considered a prodigy in Call of Duty esports, being one of the most consistent players ever seen by fans. He has represented Atlanta FaZe for years and has become one of the wealthiest players thanks to his many wins and close finishes.</p>



<h3 id="h-matthew-formal-piper">Matthew ‘FormaL’ Piper</h3>



<p>FormaL now plays competitive Halo, but in his Call of Duty days, he was a force to be reckoned with. Many consider FormaL to be the greatest controller-based esports player ever, and he’s one of just two people in the world with an esports world championship win in two different games.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-call-of-duty-esports">How to Watch Call of Duty Esports</h2>



<p>Activision Blizzard often changes where the Call of Duty League is broadcast – some years it’s Twitch, others it’s on YouTube. That’s the sum total of the debate, though – it’s one of those platforms. </p>



<p>Every year, the most popular COD streamers will also sign up to ‘co-stream’ any gameplay in the Call of Duty space, so you’re spoilt for choice when it comes to figuring out how to watch Call of Duty online.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-call-of-duty-teams">Best Call of Duty Teams</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The roster of Call of Duty teams is chopping and changing all the time, but these days, the core organisations tend to remain the same. The players that represent these organisations will regularly change, but their make-up mostly remains static.</p>



<p>Here are some of the best Call of Duty teams in the esports scene right now:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>OpTic Texas</strong></li>



<li><strong>Atlanta FaZe</strong></li>



<li><strong>Toronto Ultra</strong></li>



<li><strong>New York Subliners </strong>(brand shut down following acquisition by C9 in 2024)</li>
</ul>



<p>Because the Call of Duty League has a franchised structure, the teams won’t ever really change that much. There are plenty of teams outside of the CDL that deserve a spot on this list, though:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Lore</strong></li>



<li><strong>OMiT</strong></li>



<li><strong>Decimate</strong></li>



<li><strong>WaR</strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-are-cod-esports-played">How are COD Esports Played?</h2>



<p>Traditionally, Call of Duty esports won’t change too dramatically year-over-year. The game modes that are represented in these tournaments have remained the same for a very long time, and usually, only one mode will be dynamic.</p>



<p>Three core game modes make up the beating heart of COD esports: Search and Destroy, Hardpoint, and Control. Usually, each match will be a ‘best-of-five’, except for a grand final in a tournament, which tends to be a best-of-seven or even a best-of-nine. That means that most often, the first team to win three ‘maps’ will be crowned the victor.</p>



<p>Every team has four players and a coach, and almost every event known in the Call of Duty space is played on PC rather than on consoles. Players are only allowed to use controllers in COD esports, which has led some diehard esports fanatics to question the ‘legitimacy’ of the skill levels of COD players.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-bet-on-call-of-duty">Can You Bet on Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>Call of Duty is one of the more popular games when it comes to esports betting, particularly in North America and the United Kingdom. The most populated event for COD betting is the Call of Duty League, which has plenty of market coverage across the staggering variety of esports betting sites out there.</p>

<p>Making a career as a professional Fortnite player is not something that happens overnight. Many pro players did not find success until later seasons in the game’s lifecycle. The majority of these players’ success can be attributed to their Fortnite settings in-game – that’s why we’ve compiled a catch-all guide to the top Fortnite pro player settings.</p>



<p>Making sure you have the best Fortnite settings is optimal if you want to make a career within the competitive world of this immensely popular battle royale game.</p>



<p>Here are the top Fortnite pro player settings.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-settings-for-fortnite">Best Settings For Fortnite</h2>



<p>While specific Fortnite settings vary among different pro players, there are still a few that are considered the best Fortnite settings if you plan on competing within the game.</p>



<p>If you are playing Fortnite just to have fun and want to enjoy some good graphics, then none of this is for you. But if you want to play at your best ability with the least amount of screen tear and lag, then following these Fortnite pro player settings is highly recommended.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>From different equipment to settings within the game, here are the best Fortnite esports settings.</p>







<h2 id="h-display-settings-for-fortnite-esports">Display Settings For Fortnite Esports</h2>



<p>Having the best display settings in Fortnite is crucial for a smooth competitive experience. Unless you have the strongest and fastest PC in the world, then you will want to make sure you use the most optimal display settings when playing the game.</p>



<h4 id="h-settings-to-low">Settings to low:</h4>



<p>This is not an understatement. Everything that allows you to turn it to low, do so. This means options like Textures, Digital Image Processing, Effects and View distance should be turned to low. The lower you have them the less CPU your computer needs to use, giving you the best frame rate possible.</p>



<h4 id="h-frame-rate">Frame Rate:</h4>



<p>Depending on your computer and your monitor, limit your frame rate! If you allow it to go too high for your PC then you are risking screen tear issues. If you have a 144 hz monitor, then there is no reason to let your FPS run any higher. </p>



<h4 id="h-performance-mode">Performance Mode:</h4>



<p>Performance Mode is the route you want to take when playing competitive Fortnite. Many of the top Fortnite pro players use this setting. Performance Mode basically lowers everything to optimize the game’s performance.</p>



<h4 id="h-anti-aliasing">Anti-Aliasing:</h4>



<p>Turn Anti-Aliasing off.</p>



<h4 id="h-resolution">Resolution:</h4>



<p>Your resolution can stay at 1920×1080. Just be sure to follow the guidelines above for the best experience possible.</p>



<h4 id="h-additional-fortnite-settings">Additional Fortnite Settings:</h4>



<p>Settings such as VSync, Motion Blur and Ray Tracing can be turned off. The majority of these will already be set to off when switched to Performance Mode, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-keybinds">Keybinds</h2>



<p>There are no specific keybinds that are considered the best. Every Fortnite pro player has different keybinds set up. It just depends on what works best for the player.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The best advice is to watch a few of your favourite Fortnite pro players and study their keybinds, then try out a few and see which feels the best for you.</p>







<h2 id="h-keyboard-and-mouse-or-controller">Keyboard and Mouse or Controller?</h2>



<p>While many believe it simply just matters what you grew up on, a keyboard and mouse is the recommended way to play Fortnite if you want to be a pro player. In fact, in 2023 at the Fortnite Globals in Denmark, only one duo out of the 50 used a controller.</p>



<p>It is just a simple fact that reaction time can be displayed differently (faster) with a keyboard and mouse, making it the optimal way to play the game.</p>



<p>Overall, the top Fortnite settings may vary a bit across different pro players within the esport, but a large majority of players follow everything listed above. Many specifics, though, such as mouse sensitivity and more, are best figured out by the player.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-fortnite-pro-settings-for-ps5">Best Fortnite Pro Settings For PS5 </h3>



<p>Unfortunately, consoles allow for very little leeway when it comes to changing settings within the game. Display settings will have to be kept as is, making it much more difficult to compete with PC players. This guide might address the PlayStation 5, but the rules are mostly the same when you’re hunting for the best Fortnite settings for PS4.</p>



<p>But for those competing in the PlayStation Cups, there are still a few settings you can change to have the advantage.</p>



<p><strong>Fortnite PS5 Controller Settings:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Builder Pro</li>
</ul>



<p>Builder Pro allows players to build much easier, while still having the necessary settings to fight in combat. </p>



<p>Make sure to also have your build sensitivity much higher than your aim sensitivity when establishing your Fortnite settings on the PS5. This allows you to build faster while still having control over your aim.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-fortnite-pro-settings-for-xbox-series-x-s">Best Fortnite Pro Settings for Xbox Series X|S</h3>



<p>The Xbox Series X|S follows the same pro settings guide as the PS5 does. Unfortunately, though, Fortnite does not have an Xbox-only tournament, but there is a yearly Console Cup that Xbox players can compete in. </p>



<p>Again, this part of the guide is for the Xbox Series X|S but it still applies if you’re looking for the best Fortnite settings for Xbox One.</p>



<p><strong>Fortnite Xbox Controller Settings:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Builder Pro</li>
</ul>



<p>Similar to PlayStation, Xbox players should have their controllers set to Builder Pro and their build sensitivity much higher than their aim sensitivity.</p>

I will introduce them in more depth than what we have done in previous Exclusives</p><p>We will continue to introduce new information about <em>Metaphor</em> on the ATLUS YouTube channel, so please be sure to subscribe to our channel. Now, let’s begin the Character Edition Showcase.</p><p><strong>■ Synopsis</strong></p><p>First, here is a synopsis of the story. On a special mission to save the prince, the protagonist attends the king’s funeral to assassinate the mastermind, the great <a title="Companies > crim [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inal Louis. Suddenly, the giant face of the supposedly dead king appears in the sky over the Royal Capital, and the “election magic” is triggered. “Whoever can win the most support from the people by the deadline will be the next king.” Thus began an unprecedented uprising for the throne, allowing the citizens to be a candidate to become the next king.</p><p>Gathering popular support is not an easy task for regular citizens who have no electoral experience. That is when Sanctifex Forden of the Sanctus Church, a leading figure in the country, declares the “Tournament for the Throne” as an opportunity for people to put their powers on display and gather support. In this “Tournament for the Throne,” those who have put themselves forward as candidates for king are tasked to visit the major cities in the kingdom, proving their worth to the public as they tackle tough challenges. The first destination, Port Brielhaven, will host the “Exhibition of the Brave,” in which candidates compete to see who can bring in the biggest monster head. Those who make it through will head to Altabury Heights to take on the next challenge.</p><p>It is Batlin, a Sanctus crier, who is responsible for informing the public about the Tournament for the Throne, which has become a truly national event. His lighthearted play-by-play keeps the public engaged in the tournament.</p><p><strong>■ Candidates Vying for the Throne</strong></p><p>Now, in this national election campaign, candidates with various agendas come forward. The two most powerful men leading the tournament from unassailable positions are Forden and the protagonist’s arch-nemesis, Louis.</p><p><strong>Forden</strong></p><p>Forden is the supreme authority of Sanctism, the state religion of the United Kingdom of Euchronia, and is also the head of the Crown Theocracy, the government ruled with Sanctism at its center. In the turmoil following the sudden death of the previous king, he has garnered wide support from the population, given his position as the leader of the moderate faction.</p><p><strong>Louis</strong></p><p>Louis, on the other hand, in contrast to the moderate Forden, is an army officer with military prowess who believes in true meritocracy, wielding overwhelming combat and magical skills that enable him to defeat the humans. His policy of valuing skill and rationality over birth or circumstance has garnered tremendous support, especially among radical youths.</p><p>Of course, these two are not the only ones who will be competing in the Royal Tournament campaign. Other candidates also put their names forward in the campaign, each with their own quirky platforms.</p><p><strong>Gideaux</strong></p><p>The first one I would like to introduce is Gideaux. He is Forden’s primary bodyguard, as well as the Captain of the Monk Army, the enforcement arm of the Crown Theocracy. He himself does not intend to be king, but he doesn’t seem to take kindly to the arrival of the “filthy” elda protagonist.</p><p><strong>Godell</strong></p><p>Next, Godell. Known as “Godell the Black Hound,” he is Louis’ subordinate, but is a rather ambitious man who is running for election on the platform of rising to power. He makes no effort to hide his open hostility, which may eventually become a thorny issue for you.</p><p><strong>Milo</strong></p><p>One of the oddballs is Milo of the ishkia tribe, who preaches an agenda where those of beauty will strip all the hideous of their titles. Wherever he goes, you’re bound to hear the high-pitched screams of his fans.</p><p><strong>Loveless</strong></p><p>Next, the third son of a tavern owner, with the slogan of “All you can drink all year round.” Without giving much thought to the future of the kingdom, some might be tempted to agree with Loveless’ pledge, which falls in line with his hedonistic paripus traits.</p><p><strong>Rudolf</strong></p><p>Rudolf, another bloodthirsty candidate .He pledges to establish a roussainte military dictatorship. His appeal for greater control of the roussainte tribe seems to have attracted the support of those who feel repressed by the rule of moderate clemars.</p><p><strong>Lina</strong></p><p>Lina, a eugief candidate and the only daughter of the family that runs the Kayden Workshop, is participating to promote the gauntlet runner family business. </p><p><strong>Goddard</strong></p><p>Goddard, a demolitionist of the rhoag tribe, is a representative of the elderly, with his pledge to give preferential treatment to the old and tax the young.</p><p><strong>Roger</strong></p><p>Roger, a young man of the clemar tribe, believes in his own righteousness and is pushing forward with his vision of a truly free country with no taxes, no laws, and no religion</p><p><strong>Jin</strong></p><p>Jin from the nidia tribe is intent on winning no matter what, changing his campaign pledge depending on where he goes and who he needs to please at the moment.</p><p><strong>Julian</strong></p><p>We also have Julian of the ishkia tribe who is very conscious about pro-animal rights even when it comes to monsters that threaten people. </p><p><strong>Edeni</strong></p><p>Edeni, an island chief of the mustari tribe, decides to participate in the tournament as a pagan advocate for religious freedom.</p><p>And others with various agendas and objectives will appear.</p><p>As you can see, the “Tournament for the Throne” has a festive aspect with a truly diverse field of rival candidates. But maybe Gallica is right. If one of these candidates become king, the country will face bigger problems.</p><p>The candidates we’ve introduced are all powerful people who have expensive gauntlet runners at their disposal. And I think you will find that there are many who want to represent the tribe they come from and increase their influence. However, some of these rivals are so impacted by the protagonist’s <a title="Genres > Action [2,042 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s down the line that they later become his supporters. I won’t go into detail now, but I hope you will look forward to that as well. Posters highlighting the candidates’ pledges are posted in cities with influential power. You may want to listen to people’s opinions as you walk the streets to see what they think of the candidates’ promises and claims made in speeches.</p><p>During the election period, the protagonist’s popularity ranking in the race can be checked by pressing a specific button in the overworld. At the beginning, the protagonist’s support ranking starts in a rather low position, around 8,121st place as you see here. This is not a <a title="Genres > Simulation [529 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation game</a> where the popularity ranking fluctuates in real time, so it is only a flavor element of the game. But these rankings will change significantly as the campaign progresses.</p><p>The protagonist is a nobody at the lowest level in the country. Of course, he is not the kind of person that anyone would expect to be king. You will feel the dynamics of this royal tournament campaign as you watch the ranking gradually change with the results of completing your missions and through your actions towards the people of the city!</p><p><strong>■ Followers that Support the Protagonist</strong></p><p>Now, while there are rivals in the tournament who stand in the protagonist’s way, there are also encouraging allies who will support your campaign. In the cities that the protagonist will stay at, there are many people with various kinds of problems. By listening to them and helping them, they will become strong supporters of the protagonist.</p><p>Of course, the allies who travel with him, such as Strohl and Hulkenberg, are also important supporters of the protagonist. But he will also meet unique supporters on his journey who do not directly participate in battle. The unique feature of interacting with supporters, or followers as we call them in this title, is that you can acquire powerful Archetypes that you can equip and use in battle.</p><p>Let us now introduce you to what kinds of followers we have.</p><p><strong>Brigitta</strong></p><p>First, there is a rhoag follower named Brigitta who owns an ignitor shop in the Royal Capital. She notices that the protagonist is an elda and asks him to take on a quest to test his strength. If you can complete said request and gain her trust, she will be a powerful follower. When she becomes a follower, the protagonist will not only be able to awaken to the Merchant Archetype, which offers more rewards in battle, but he will also be able to make purchases at the ignitor shop in the Royal Capital, which is usually not available to the elda.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong></p><p>Next is a girl named Maria who lives at the Hushed Honeybee Inn located in the Royal Capital. Separated from her parents and having no friends due to her rhoag and ishkia mixed background, she eagerly awaits the souvenir of stories that the protagonists bring back through encounters they have on their travels. If you can help her feel less lonely, she will also be a powerful follower. The bond with Maria awakens the Healer Archetype, which specializes in healing and purification.</p><p><strong>Bardon</strong></p><p>Next is Bardon, a roussainte who is the captain of the guard corps in Martira. He is a simple, clumsy, but likeable and earnest man who faces new problems after an incident that happens in his town is solved. By supporting him, he will become a strong follower. Your bond with him awakens the Commander Archetype, which can bend the flow of battles to your will.</p><p><strong>Alonzo</strong></p><p>Like Bardon, we meet Alonzo in Martira, an elusive and enigmatic young man of the nidia tribe. His smooth talk leads the protagonist to undertake a certain quest. Even though he swings the protagonist around with his words and actions that go back and forth, he ends up being a one-of-a-kind follower. If you can strengthen your bond with him, you will be able to awaken the Faker, that can be used as a trump card to tackle difficult enemies.</p><p><strong>Catherina</strong></p><p>Last but not least is Catherina, a bounty hunter. She is one of the protagonist’s followers, but she is also a candidate herself who stands up for her tribe—the paripus—which is often looked down upon, with the pledge to make them wealthier. From the bond you form with her, you can awaken the Brawler Archetype, which can deliver decisive blows. While they may be rivals in the campaign together, they do form a strong bond, allowing the protagonist and Catherina to create a unique relationship. We invite you to see for yourself how the competition between the candidates will play out.</p><p><strong><a title="Genres > Party [69 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a> Members</strong></p><p>In addition to the followers introduced here, you can also bond with fellow party members such as Strohl and Hulkenberg, and build a follower relationship with them. Interacting with characters of all ages, tribes, and values, and from different perspectives, will give you a new experience unlike any you have had in previous titles.</p><p>Strengthening bonds with followers can lead to the evolution of Archetypes to higher levels and the unlocking of abilities that will give you a strategic advantage. So please be proactive and talk to your followers when you see them in town or in gauntlet runners. You can check the status of your interactions with your followers, as well as the Archetypes and abilities you have acquired through them, at any time in the main menu, which will help you strategize how to use your time during the operation periods.</p><p>In addition, the follower characters are also voiced by talented voice actors, which we believe will provide a deeper game experience.</p><p><strong>■ Closing</strong></p><p>How did you like it? We are pleased to announce that we have released new information on quite a few characters. Was there a character you liked among the unique candidates and followers? Let us know your favorite in the comments.</p><p>One of the most exciting aspects of this game system is the fact that the bonding process increases the number of very powerful Archetypes. Thinking about what battles you can fight with the Archetypes you acquire from the followers you meet will play a large role in your strategies. It is up to you, the player, to choose a follower in favor of strategy or choose a follower whose circumstances are of interest to you. It is well worth giving thought to, so I hope you look forward to it.</p><p>Up to this point, we have introduced the battle system, the dungeons, the story, and the characters. However, a new and different aspect of <em>Metaphor</em> is the element of enjoying daily activities on your journey. In the next Showcase, I will finally introduce the journey aspect in detail, so please stay tuned.</p><p>Once again, <em>Metaphor</em> is scheduled for release this fall on October 11, 2024. Both the physical and digital editions are available for pre-orders, so please pre-order your copy or add it to your wishlist. Along with the standard edition, a Digital Deluxe Edition commemorating the 35th anniversary of the ATLUS brand is also available. You can also get additional pre-order bonuses, so make sure to pre-order today. See you at the next ATLUS Exclusive Showcase! Thank you very much for your time today!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game features a solo career mode, exhibition matches, and online multiplayer matches for teams of up to three players. Think Madden or EA Sports FS but for Quidditch.</p><p dir="ltr">As with all Harry Potter-related media, Quidditch Champions has received criticism due to its connections with the franchise's creator, JK Rowling, whose transphobic statements and political activism have actively harmed the global trans community. While Rowling did not directly contribute to Quidditch Champions, she benefits monetarily from sales for the game. In 2022, US Quidditch and Major League Quidditch--real sports leagues inspired by the fictional game--<a href="https://www.usquadball.org/news/quidditch-changes-name-to-quadball" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rebranded to Quadball in response to Rowling's transphobic statements</a>.
