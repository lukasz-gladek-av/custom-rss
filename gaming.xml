              <p>Desktop towers eat up precious desk space, generate noise and cost more than they should. Mini PCs solve all three problems by delivering full Windows performance in a package smaller than a hardcover book. The GMKtec G10 with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed offers a compelling alternative to Apple’s Mac Mini if you need Windows instead of macOS: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/">just dropped this 512GB mini PC to an all-time low of $189 instead of $299</a>, and gives you real desktop power for less than a basic Chromebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Desktop Power in a Compact AMD Package</h2>
<p>The AMD Ryzen 5 3500U is driving the G10 and it is a 64-bit processor that <strong>features four cores and comes from AMD’s Zen+ architecture</strong>. This quad-core processor has a processing speed of 2.1 GHz and requires only a 15W thermal design power so that it is energy-friendly for use every day. This processor can further scale up to speeds of 3.7 GHz when it comes to single-threaded activity for smooth performance for users when it comes to web browsing, document processing, and video streaming.</p>



<p>The integrated Radeon Vega 8 has a processing speed of up to 1.2 GHz and uses the system memory along with the CPU. The unified memory allows for faster processing by avoiding the lag that comes when the CPU has to access different memories which makes it efficient for graphics processing. The Vega 8 processor has around 35 percent better graphics processing compared to Intel N-series, such as N100 or N150, used in entry-level mini-computers.</p>
<p>The GMKtec G10 is shipped with <strong>16GB of DDR4 SDRAM running in dual-channel mode</strong>, and it has two 8GB SO-DIMMs installed. The use of dual-channel mode increases the bandwidth from the CPU to the Ram by two times that of the single-channel mode setup. Users can upgrade the RAM to a maximum of 64GB by replacing the two installed SO-DIMMs, although 16GB will suit any user. The<strong> computer comes preinstalled with a 512GB SSD drive and has a PCIe 3.0 connection</strong> for faster access.</p>



<p>This small enclosure is turned into a productivity powerhouse by its triple display support: The <strong>Radeon Vega 8 Graphics can handle a total of three 4K displays simultaneously using its HDMI 2.1 display port, display port, and USB-C display port</strong>. The maximum recommended resolution for each display support is 4K, and the refresh rate is 60Hz, ensuring that there are no motion or text artifacts. This feature is particularly beneficial for stock market professionals requiring simultaneous access to different market feeds, designers requiring access to images, and any user requiring maximum display space.</p>
<p>The<strong> 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port provides speeds that reach up to 2500 Mbps</strong>, well over double that supported by 1 Gigabit, the average standard found on computer ports. This will provide faster access times for larger file transfers through your home network which makes it easier to stream video without buffering. The added boost offered by the faster connection will also shine when accessing NAS storage, servers or using home networking software tools like pfSense or Untangle.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro is installed and activated</strong>&nbsp;so there’s no waiting around for activation codes. The Windows 11 Pro comes with various features, such as <em>Remote Desktop</em>, allowing connection to the mini PC from another computer, <em>BitLocker</em>, used for encryption to protect your files, and <em>Hyper-V</em>, used for creating virtual machines.</p>
<p>Make sure you don’t miss that deal, it’s one of the most affordable ways to get a decent Windows computer.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govees-floor-lamp-is-selling-for-pocket-change-amazon-has-zero-profit-margin-left-on-it-2000639420</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee%E2%80%99s-floor-lamp-is-selling-for-pocket-change-amazon-has-zero-profit-margin-left-on-it.1336387/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking to transform a dull corner into something that actually catches the eye? Smart lighting has become the go-to solution for people who want to add personality to their space without committing to a full room makeover. Several <em>Govee</em> lamp models are currently on sale on Amazon but the real star of the show is their <em>RGBIC Floor Lamp Basic</em>, the platform’s number one best-seller in floor lamps. Right now, you can grab this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/">game-changing lighting solution for just $69, down from its usual $99 price tag</a>. That’s a <strong>record low for this fantastic lamp</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Lamp Changes Everything About Room Lighting</h2>
<p>See what’s different about this floor lamp from your regular standing lamp: The RGBIC tech allows for <strong>different colors to be displayed on different parts of the LED strip</strong> <strong>lighting</strong> at the same time. When it comes to regular RGB lighting, it can only display one color at a time for the whole lamp itself: This RGBIC lamp can display actual color gradients and light displays that are more suited for your activity or desired mood. You can display red transitioning through orange, through yellow, then through blue, all simultaneously,<strong> along the lamp’s 136-cm standing height</strong>.</p>



<p>The lamp emits 1000 lumens and that’s incredibly bright for any use, whether it’s reading, working or any other activity. The warm white LEDs, too, are not merely a gimmick. This way, the lamp will provide decent lighting when needed, and then it’s free to display its outrageous colors when desired. The lamp’s design is also quite clever. Four poles made from aluminum can be assembled and rest upon another piece made from the same metal so that it doesn’t topple. The silicone that coats the light strip around the poles does more than add to the aesthetic. Instead, it helps diffuse the lighting from the LED lights, eradicating spots to ensure that lighting transitions smoothly from one color to the other.</p>



<p>Getting this lamp set up and running takes minimal effort: The Govee Home app (available for iOS and Android) connects <strong>via your home’s 2.4GHz WiFi network and unlocks the full potential of those 16 million color options</strong>. Inside the app, you’ll find <strong>58 dynamic scene modes</strong> with names like Cheerful and Romantic that do exactly what they promise. But the real power comes from creating your own custom scenes: Want specific colors at specific brightness levels for different times of day? Set it up once and let automation handle the rest. Voice control through Alexa or Google Assistant means you can adjust everything without touching your phone. Simple commands like asking Alexa to turn the lamp blue or dim it to 30% work exactly as you’d expect.</p>
<p>The sync feature for music makes way for something special to happen for entertainment purposes: Connect it to your sound system or simply play your music around the lamp, and see how it lights up in sync with the sounds. Gaming sessions become more interesting when the lights around you shine in sync with what’s happening in the action. Movie time sessions become more enjoyable when the environment lights around it change in sync with the sounds from the movie.</p>
<p>Considering the price, you are basically having access to technology that previously sold for so much more. Other rival intelligent lighting systems will require additional hub setups, so many elements, and so much hassle when it comes to putting them together. This lamp requires only that it’s plugged in and that the app is downloaded, and it will start functioning by itself.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/crash-bandicoot-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix/">Whats-on-netflix.com</a> is reporting that an animated series based on everyone’s favourite marsupial is being worked on for Netflix. The studio behind the Sonic Prime animated series, WildBrain Studios, is said to be working on the show.</p>
<p>Amazon had previously announced a Crash Bandicoot series, but that was cancelled without reason in 2021. However, test animations from the series have appeared and you can watch them below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Cartoon - Scene Pitch Old vs. New" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/orXw6JpEK1Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There is no other information on the new series but it does seem a peculiar option, as popular as Crash was he’s not exactly an A-lister in 2025. There again Hollywood is trying to make a film based on Sleeping Dogs which had one game back in 2012.</p>
<p>Toys For Bob, who were behind the remakes of Crash 1-3 and the new game, Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time, split from<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/01/toys-for-bob-goes-independent-but-explores-partnership-with-microsoft/"> Activision in March 2024</a> and were rumoured to be working on a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/a-new-spyro-game-reportedly-in-development-at-toys-for-bob/">new Spyro game.&nbsp;</a>However, Microsoft – who now own Activision – have been making sweeping cuts to both their upcoming projects and<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/25/microsoft-is-laying-off-a-staggering-1900-people-across-xbox-activision-zenimax/"> their staff, </a>&nbsp;concentrating on their big hitters such as Call of Duty.</p>

<p>The Toys for Bob website still shows they are working on a game but it has not been updated since 2024 so the fate of Spyro seems unclear. A sequel to Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time was rumoured to be in development at Toys for Bob but was allegedly cancelled when the sales for Crash 4 were underwhelming.</p>
<p>We gave the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/02/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-review/">7/10 in our review</a>. “Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time really is the definitive Crash game,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/02/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-review/">said Steve</a>. “Toys For Bob have taken all the series’ trademarks, refined them into a challenging and polished experience and given us tons of levels to play and secrets to hunt for. There’s new characters to play as and masks that shake up the gameplay when they appear, but Crash 4 is the same old Bandicoot who’s learnt a few new tricks.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/beats-pill-selling-for-pennies-amazon-liquidates-the-iconic-bluetooth-speaker-2000639295</link>

              <p>Good sound matters most during the moments when music becomes the backdrop to your life. Game day gatherings with friends, cooking marathons in the kitchen, cozy living room hangouts during these cold months or even impromptu dance sessions when your favorite track comes on. You need a speaker that can keep up with your energy without constantly dying or worrying about spills.</p>
<p>The Beats Pill has been a favorite for years, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5035/">Amazon just dropped it to an all-time low of $99 instead of the original $149</a>. This iconic capsule-shaped speaker is being cleared out at a price that makes sense for what you get.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5035/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Redesigned Acoustics Deliver Seriously Loud Performance</h2>
<p>The 2024 Beats Pill went through a complete internal redesign focused on one goal: <strong>bigger, cleaner sound</strong>. At the core sits a reengineered racetrack woofer that uses stronger neodymium magnets to drive 28 percent more motor force compared to the previous Beats Pill Plus. This increased power lets the woofer displace 90 percent more air volume, which translates directly into deeper bass that you can actually feel. The woofer’s innovative structure includes ridges and contours designed to minimize low-end distortion even when you crank the volume to maximum.</p>
<p>The tweeter is encased in its own secure compartment to provide additional support that helps prevent unwanted vibrations. The tweeter’s compartment allows it to produce <strong>clear highs and full-bodied middle tones without disruption from the motion of the woofer</strong>. The speaker unit itself is tilted at an angle of 20°, ensuring that sound waves reach your ears instead of the floor or any piece of furniture in front that could absorb them. This feature allows Pill to perform better than its 8.6-inch size by sounding larger.</p>



<p>Bluetooth 5.3 increases connectivity functionality when compared to the previous version and offers quicker pairing, greater range and more stable connectivity. The Beats Pill comes equipped with Class 1 Bluetooth and offers the range advantage that standard Bluetooth speakers lack. This allows you to move from room to room or outside without having to worry about the sound suddenly cutting off. The <strong>speaker has quick pairing capabilities for both iOS and Android</strong>&nbsp;so it will automatically recall your device for easy reconnecting. The<em> Find My</em> and <em>Find My Device</em> integration feature for both iOS and Android also assists in tracking the location of the speaker using your smartphone.</p>



<p>Battery life has also improved to reach an <strong>impressive 24 hours of playback at 50 percent volume</strong> which is double what the previous model offered. With the improved battery life, the speaker can last through an entire day without requiring a recharge. Fast fuel charging has also improved functionality and offers up to two hours of playback time when charged for only 10 minutes if you need to leave for an important engagement.</p>
<p>The <strong>IP67 rating</strong> is also a serious level of protection for resisting the elements: This level of certification allows the speaker to withstand immersion beyond 1m for 30 minutes without any issue, while still blocking ingression from dust. The added sealing helps resist ingress from sand, dirt, and water. The silicone grips securely on smooth surfaces, making it resistant to slipping, and the lanyard cord allows for effortless carrying.</p>
<p>At this price point, the Beats Pill are among the best portable Bluetooth speakers on the market.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/27/kojima-matrix-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-new-report-reveals-kojima-was-asked-to-make-a-matrix-game.1336366/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Many years ago, in the last century in fact, there were rumours that Hideo Kojima was in talks to create a video game based on the blockbuster film The Matrix.&nbsp; That never came to pass and Shiny Entertainment took the license and released two games which were cannon within the Matrix universe. They were Enter the Matrix and The Path of Neo, and both were rather good, I remember spending most of one Christmas playing Enter The Matrix.</p>
<p>A new interview with Christopher Bergstresser, a former vice president of licensing at Konami Digital Entertainment, has revealed that “the Wachowskis were big fans of Kojima” and met with him along with Aki Saito and Kasumi Kitaue, an executive at Konami.</p>


<p>“The two of them came in with their concept artist, and effectively they said to Kojima, ‘We really want you to do the Matrix game. Can you do that’?” recalls Christopher. “Aki translated this into Japanese for Mr. Kitaue, and Kitaue just looked at them and told them plainly, ‘No’.”</p>
<p>It seems that Kojima continued to be interested in the idea, but it never came to pass, probably as Konami had him busy with Metal Gear Solid 2 at the time.</p>
<p>Kojima continued to correspond with the Wachowskis and in 2000 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-speaks-about-the-matrix/1100-2448486/">met with them</a> to discuss the similarities between their works.&nbsp; “I have seen (The Matrix) four times. I like this type of work. What I was planning to do in my next project, they pretty much made into a motion picture. We were planning on certain things like characters running on walls and such, but they’ve beat me to it (laughs).”</p>

<p>Later, Kojima’s hit Death Stranding explored similar themes as The Matrix franchise, such as the blurring of reality and another world, while the character Higgs has similarities to Agent Smith.</p>
<p>However, this might not be the end of the story. Kojima is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/23/kojima-productions-new-od-knock-teaser-is-pretty-creepy/">working on OD for Microsoft</a>, and we now know that is going to be an anthology horror game with a famous directors taking on an episode. The only confirmed name is Jordan Peele, but the Wachowskis would be an excellent choice for an episode.</p>

This morning, the DHS posted an image featuring <em>Halo</em> characters, a Warthog vehicle from the games, and the text “DESTROY THE FLOOD” and a link to ICE’s recruitment website. The DHS captioned <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">the post</a>, “finishing this fight.”</p><p>Like with its <em>Pokémon</em>-themed post, which was captioned, “Gotta Catch ‘Em All,” the DHS’s <em>Halo</em> post implicitly compares immigrants to creatures from video games — this time, the parasitic alien species called the Flood.</p><div><p>The DHS’s post was the culmination of a social media exchange between the Trump administration and video game retailer GameStop, based on a joke that Trump had overseen the <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1982587953676247375">end of the “console wars”</a> thanks to the announcement of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805174/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-xbox-ps5-release-date"><em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> remake</a> for PlayStation next year. GameStop, whose CEO and chairman Ryan Cohen has been <a href="https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1849974769338220754">a vocal supporter of Trump,</a> quoted the joke with a picture of Trump <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982619455797821810">shaking hands with <em>Halo</em> protagonist Master Chief.</a> The White House followed up with an image of Trump in <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632">a suit of armor similar to Master Chief’s,</a> and GameStop responded with its own <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982654845166428607">photoshopped Master Chief Trump</a>, adding a meme-ified version of Vice President JD Vance’s head swapped onto what looks to be the feminine anthropomorphic AI Cortana.</p></div><p>Microsoft declined to comment about the DHS’s post, and didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the White House’s and GameStop’s posts.

              <p>The perfect laptop needs to do three things well: <strong>handle your daily workload</strong> without hiccups, <strong>last through a full day</strong> without hunting for outlets, and <strong>stay portable</strong> enough to carry anywhere. Since its launch in March, Apple’s 2025 MacBook Air with the M4 chip with 256GB storage has been doing a pricing dance on Amazon that’s been frustrating to watch. It started at $999, dropped to $849, climbed back up to $899, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/">and now it’s finally hit rock bottom at $799 instead of $999</a>. This marks a new all-time low for what’s already Apple’s most popular laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The M4 Chip Brings Desktop Power to Ultraportable Design</h2>
<p>The Apple M4 chip is the central processing unit in that laptop and it <strong>has a speed rate of 4.4 GHz, along with a 10-core CPU</strong> (four performance cores and six efficiency cores). This will allow the performance cores to undertake difficult tasks such as video production and processing complex documents, while the efficiency cores will perform everyday tasks without affecting the battery life.</p>
<p>The 8-core GPU that comes standard in the model supports ray tracing, mesh shading and other advanced features that were only found in the company’s M3 chip. Ray tracing allows light to trace its paths through 3D settings. The GPU also allows for faster editing times in Final Cut Pro and Adobe Photoshop, increasing photo-editing performance by up to 3.6 times faster than Intel models and movie editing by eight times faster in the movie-editing software iMovie.</p>
<p>Apple has incorporated <strong>a 16-core Neural Engine in the M4</strong> which executes a mind-boggling 38 trillion operations every second and nearly double that of the previous M3 chip. This Neural Engine enables <strong>Apple Intelligence functionality in the latest macOS version</strong>, including the functionality to remove background noise from videos automatically, improve images in a single click and provide system-wide AI support for keeping your data completely private.</p>



<p>The display is a <strong>13.6-inch Liquid Retina which offers a resolution of 2560×1664 pixels</strong> at 224 pixels per inch and features support for more than one billion colors. The display has a brightness level of 500 nits for clarity when used in bright conditions, such as outdoor lighting. The display can display colors accurately as it features the P3 wide color standard and offers support for more than a billion colors, <strong>along with True Tone technology</strong>.</p>
<p>The battery life can last for a <strong>maximum of 18 hours when used normally</strong> thanks to Apple’s optimized architecture using the ARM chip. The Macbook Air 2025 will provide its users with similar performance when using the battery and when it’s plugged into power, unlike Windows-based laptops whose performance will decline when using the battery for energy conservation reasons.</p>



<p>The improved 12MP Center Stage camera has an ultra-wide sensor and crops intelligently so that the user is always in frame during video calls. The <em>Center Stage</em> feature automatically tracks the user’s movement, zooms and pans to frame them regardless of where they happen to be in the room. The camera also has a feature that allows it to flip to <em>Desk View</em> mode which allows it to shoot from directly above, using the ultra-wide angle, highlighting the user’s desk.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include t<strong>wo Thunderbolt 4 ports that provide a data transfer rate of 40 Gbps</strong>, which makes it possible to connect high-resolution monitors and storage drives. The computer can support a maximum of 2 exterior monitors without affecting its internal display unlike its previous versions. The Wi-Fi 6E technology supports the use of the less crowded 6 GHz bandwidth and offers users faster internet connectivity. The computer also has a Bluetooth connection technology that allows it to connect to wireless devices. The <strong>computer has a 3.5 mm headphone jack</strong> that can support high-impedance headphones.</p>
<p>With a weight that’s only 2.7 pounds and thickness of 0.44 inches, the MacBook Air still leads the way when it comes to portability in Apple’s range. If you’re looking for a solid ultraportable laptop, this is a great choice – especially at this price point.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is giving free access to its Multiplayer and Zombies starting October 28th. Coincidentally, Battlefield 6 <span>begins its first season, which introduces its Battle Royale mode&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6s-new-battle-royale-mode/" target="_blank">REDSEC</a>, on the same day</span>.</p>



<p>With Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 releasing on November 14th, many players are looking forward to what’s in store for the new entry. While beta turnout was quite low, its predecessor, Black Ops 6, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received quite well</a> by fans and critics. However, the FPS throne seems to have been taken by Battlefield 6 this year, with its incredible graphics and fun gameplay. You’d think Activision would let Battlefield revel in it for a bit. Well, it turns out it wants to cause some competition.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-gets-limited-time-free-trial-during-battlefield-6-s-first-season">Black Ops 6 Gets Limited-Time Free Trial During Battlefield 6’s First Season</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>A post from <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1982928103417753961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty’s Twitter/X account</a> confirms that Black Ops 6’s Multiplayer and Zombies are going free-to-play from October 28th to November 3rd. The trial will include all of the maps, including a few new ones like Gravity and Mothball. The Halloween event, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-the-haunting-2025-unveiled-poster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Haunting</a>, will also be available, which brings iconic killers like Jason and Predator to the fray. Unfortunately, the campaign is not free, but can be played with Xbox Game Pass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we’ve mentioned before, October 28th is also the day Battlefield 6 launches Season One. The event will bring new weapons and maps to enjoy. However, the biggest addition is REDSEC, the game’s Battle Royale mode. The mode is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-start-times-battlefield-redsec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to shadow drop</a> with Season One and has been rumored for quite some time. While not confirmed, it does seem rather interesting that Black Ops 6 would open its doors right when Battlefield is going all out with itself.</p>



<p>What do you think about Black Ops 6 going free-to-play? Think it’s a snipe at Battlefield 6? Which game do you prefer?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new report claims that Netflix is developing an animated <a href="https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-the-kotaku-review-1845237873"><em>Crash Bandicoot</em></a> series. And that could be cool, Crash seems perfectly suited to a cartoon, but I do have one request: He better not talk.</p> <p>On October 27, <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/crash-bandicoot-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix/"><em>What’s On Netflix</em> reported</a> that it had heard from sources that Netflix has been quietly working on a <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> animated TV show. Plot details are being kept under wraps, but the outlet claims that WildBrain Studios is the animation team behind the yet-to-be-announced <em>Crash</em> series. This is the same studio that worked on<em> Sonic Prime</em> from 2022 to 2024. The studio has also worked on <em>Johnny Test, The Snoopy Show, </em>and <em>Carmen Sandiego.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Crash Bandicoot first appeared in the PlayStation 1 OG 3D platformer <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> in 1996. That title was developed by Naughty Dog, long before the studio would go on to make <em>Uncharted</em> and <em>The Last of Us</em>. It then developed two more sequels and a kart racer spin-off before moving on to other projects. Meanwhile, other studios continued to make <em>Crash</em> games well into the Xbox 360 era. In 2017, Activision put out the <a href="https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-naughty-dog-vicarious-visions-jump-1851786482"><em>N. Sane Trilogy</em>,</a> which contained remakes of the first three PS1 games. That was followed by 2021’s <em>Crash 4: It’s About Time</em>. Following Xbox’s purchase of Activision, Crash is now owned by Xbox. Weird.</p>

  <p>Assuming this TV show happens<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->and considering <a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-tv-show-netflix-amazon-prime-fallout-last-of-1848707788">every streaming studio is desperately spending millions of dollars</a> on making their own <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505"><em>Fallout</em></a> or <em>Last of Us</em>-sized hit, it’s very likely<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->it will be Crash’s first original show. It won’t, however, be his first appearance on Netflix. Controversially, the platforming legend appeared in Netflix’s <em>Skylanders</em> series, sporting an Australian accent. I hate it. And a lot of Crash fans did, too. The character has normally not spoken in the games or, at most, only uttered a handful of words, like “Whoa!” or “Uh-Oh!” And that’s all he needs. Let the others do the talking. Crash should be a force of nature that causes chaos in each episode.</p> <p>Talking or no talking, this reported <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> show is likely still a ways off from being announced and released. While we wait, we can watch some footage from <a href="https://youtu.be/LVFJ49X11ck">a different animated <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> show</a> that Amazon was rumored to be working on a few years ago, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/01/rumour_looks_like_crash_bandicoots_cartoon_series_has_been_cancelled">but which was reportedly canned in 2021</a>.</p>

              <p>25 years ago,<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/what-the-matrix-resurrections-really-says-about-video-g-1848276051">Matrix</a></em> creators and directors the <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-m-sorry-to-say-laurence-fishburne-died-in-the-2005-ma-1844803953">Wachowskis</a>&nbsp;met up with <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> creator <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-metal-gear-solid-death-stranding-ai-2000636622">Hideo Kojima</a> to ask him and his team to create a video game based on the blockbuster sci-fi action film starring Keanu Reeves. Apparently, Kojima was very interested in doing it, but higher-ups at Konami passed.</p> <p><a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/they-were-big-fans-of-kojima-the-wachowskis-once-asked-the-metal-gear-creator-to-make-a-matrix-video-game">In a recent interview with <em>Time Extension,</em></a> former Konami Digital Entertainment vice president of licensing Christopher Bergstresser talked about the long-rumored tale that Kojima was asked to make a <em>Matrix</em> game in 2000. It seemed like it was probably true, and details about it were floating around online, but the specifics were always a mystery. But not anymore, as Bergstresser talked openly about the meeting with <em>Time Extension.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>“The Wachowskis were big fans of Kojima,” Bergstresser told the outlet. “So (Konami producer) Kazumi Kitaue, [Hideo] Kojima, Aki Saito (who still works with Kojima), and I were at the Konami HQ, and we got a call from the Wachowskis, who wanted to come in and meet with Kojima. So they did! The two of them came in with their concept artist, and effectively they said to Kojima, ‘We really want you to do the <em>Matrix</em> game. Can you do that?’”</p>

 <p>According to Bergstresser, this question was translated for Kitaue, and his response was a blunt “No.” This was likely because Konami wanted Kojima to focus on making <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em>, which was in the early stages of production. While this might have been disappointing for the Wachowskis, they didn’t have any hard feelings and still invited the group to <em>The</em> <em>Matrix’s</em> launch party in Japan.</p> <p>Before this interview, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-speaks-about-the-matrix/1100-2448486/">there was evidence of this meeting</a>, as <em>Time Extension</em> points out. But this is the first time we’ve really heard anything about it directly from someone who was there. The outlet does claim, however, that a different Konami employee told them that this story isn’t entirely accurate. Reportedly, Kojima still showed a “strong interest” in making a <em>Matrix</em> game even after Kitaue shut it down, and many members of the <em>MGS</em> creator’s team were filled with “immense disappointment” after missing out on such an opportunity.</p>

                                        <p dir="ltr">Ever since he was a boy, Shuhei Yoshida dreamed of living outside Japan. Born and raised in Kyoto, Yoshida studied science at his local university and spent his college downtime slaying beasts in Dragon Quest. He yearned to embark on a globe-trotting adventure of his own--and just like in his favorite RPG, destiny soon came calling.</p><p dir="ltr">Yoshida landed a job at Sony fresh out of college, excitedly joining the company's corporate strategy group. "With Walkman, TV and video, 80% to 90% of Sony's business was done outside Japan," Yoshida recalls, "So, I thought, at Sony, I might have a chance to live outside Japan."</p><p dir="ltr">Working under Sony's management group, Yoshida's job was to help grow internal businesses. There was one new team that caught Yoshida's eye: a small group, led by Ken Kutaragi, that had just finished developing the audio chip for Nintendo's massively successful SNES console. Although it was one of Yoshida's colleagues who was ultimately assigned to the project, Yoshida says he tried to assist with Kutaragi's project wherever he could. "Ken's team then started to work on a CD-ROM system for Super Nintendo," Yoshida said. "My colleague was not a big video game fan, so I was giving advice to him."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4591449-6202656489-32297.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4591449" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4591449-6202656489-32297.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4591449"></a><figcaption>Console modder Ben Heck got the Nintendo PlayStation prototype's CD drive running in 2017</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4591449-6202656489-32297.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">The Nintendo Betraystation</h2><p dir="ltr">As Yoshida excitedly gushed about video games to anyone who'd listen, Kutaragi's team worked diligently to provide Nintendo with the SNES CD-ROM expansion. Its working name? The Nintendo PlayStation. As Sony experimented with laptops and PCs, Yoshida kept his head down until 1991, when Sony's relationship with Nintendo suddenly went up in flames.</p><p dir="ltr">"At CES, Sony was preparing to announce the original Nintendo PlayStation," Yoshida explains. "But a couple of days before that, Nintendo announced a collaboration with Philips to release the CD-ROM attachment, instead."</p><p dir="ltr">After years of collaboration with Nintendo, it was a move that stunned everyone at Sony. "I think it was vaporware," reflects Yoshida of Nintendo's Phillips CD-ROM console, which ultimately never materialized. "I think [Nintendo] just made the announcement to get out of the contract with Sony." Whatever Nintendo's reasoning, Sony had been very publicly betrayed. "After that, Sony had two choices," Yoshida says. "Get out of the video game business or create their own console."</p><p dir="ltr">As we all know, Sony opted for the latter. Yet it wasn't enough just to release a rival console--for Sony's furious upper management, their machine had to wipe the floor with Nintendo's upcoming console. "Ken [Kutaragi] leveraged the anger of Sony management to get the investment that he needed to make a console with real-time 3D graphics," reveals Yoshida. "So it ended up being a much higher performance system than the original [Nintendo PlayStation], which was based on Super NES tech."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Hell hath no fury like a Sony scorned</h2><p dir="ltr">After partnering with Sony Music to help fund the company's ambitious game console, operation PlayStation was a go. In February 1993, Yoshida's years of excitable office video games chatter finally paid off and he was assigned to Kutaragi's PlayStation third-party licensing team. "Everyone else on my team were engineers," Yoshida says. "I felt incredibly lucky."</p><p dir="ltr">Under Sony Music Japan's tutelage, Yoshida's team approached their new console like a record label, going from door-to-door, vying to convince massive game publishers and indies alike to bring their games to Sony's new system. Yet Yoshida and Kutaragi didn't just have to overcome skepticism in Sony's gaming chops, but publishers' doubts around 3D gaming itself.</p><p dir="ltr">"A small number of companies were fascinated by the capability of PlayStation's real time 3D," Yoshida says of his initial meetings. "But at the time, most people were not familiar with 3D graphics." Luckily, that same year, Sega revealed Virtua Fighter for arcades, the first true 3D fighting game, and publishers finally began to see 3D's potential.</p><p dir="ltr">"As soon as that announcement happened, I got lots of phone calls from companies who were very interested to work with PlayStation," Yoshida recalls. "Sega Saturn was the biggest competition for PlayStation, but Sega really helped to educate the industry that 3D graphics can be used for more than racing or shooting games."</p><p dir="ltr">While Virtua Fighter eventually swayed the 3D skeptics, Yoshida says one publisher believed in PlayStation from the very beginning: Bandai Namco. Yoshida called the company Sony's "biggest ally for the launch of PlayStation." Part of this relationship stemmed from Namco having 3D arcade games ready to go while the current lineup of 16-bit consoles remained unable to run them. Ridge Racer and Tekken ultimately became crucial day-one graphical showcases for Sony's new console.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet it was winning over Nintendo's former third-party darling, Squaresoft (now known as Square Enix following a merger), that cemented PlayStation's Japanese success. "Square obviously had a huge hit with Final Fantasy games on Super Nintendo, " says Yoshida. "However, Sakaguchi-san, the creator, was very unhappy with the decision that Nintendo made with Nintendo 64 to use cartridges." Sakaguchi dreamed of shipping games with full 3D movies--epics that could truly immerse players in his fantastical world. "The cartridge has such a small memory that they didn't allow him to realize this vision," explains Yoshida. "So, he was very interested to work on a CD-ROM-based system."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Shmoozing Sake-guchi</h2><p dir="ltr">PlayStation, however, wasn't the only CD-ROM system in town. With Sega also trying to nab Square's newest game, Sony was desperate to sign Final Fantasy VII first. Luckily, Sony had a secret weapon up its sleeve. "My boss, who came from Sony Music Japan, was a really amazing schmoozer," smiles Yoshida. "He hung out with another vice president of Square who was running the business side. I was taken with them to have dinner or do karaoke so many times, and he schmoozed and somehow convinced them that Sony is easy to work with." The secret behind Final Fantasy VII coming to PlayStation? Sake and karaoke. "That's how business is done in Japan!" laughs Yoshida.</p><p dir="ltr">The rest, as they say, is history. PlayStation launched in Japan in December 1994 and was a huge hit, shifting 300,000 units in its first year in Japan before finding success in Europe and the US in 1995. Another factor that Yoshida attributes to PlayStation's success was Sony Music's insistence that game developers were given the spotlight. "In their mind, game creators are artists like musicians," explains Yoshida. "Some companies didn't allow the game developers to put their real name in the game's credits because they were afraid of other companies stealing these developers. But PlayStation said, 'Let's get the magazine to interview creators;, let's make them stars!'"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4591451-3419348054-XCRm8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4591451" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4591451-3419348054-XCRm8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4591451"></a><figcaption>The PS3 launched on November 11, 2006 in Japan</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4591451-3419348054-XCRm8.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With third parties flocking to the console in droves, Yoshida's job was complete. He was soon shifted over to head up first-party projects, where he helped produce games like Ape Escape and The Legend of Dragoon. Yet there was one PS1 classic that got away. "Another team I put together was not able to finish their game on PS1, which was Ico," says Yoshida of the Fumito Ueda classic. "We had an amazing-looking prototype. However, the game was not performing well on PS1. Ueda-san's ambition was too high and the game was running at 10fps, so I moved the project to PS2."</p><p dir="ltr">Then, in 2000, Yoshida finally realized his childhood dream and moved to the US to become the head of development for Sony's American studios. Sony, meanwhile, was also living out a dream of its own, as its once-unproven gaming upstart had now become the dominant console in the PS2 generation. While Yoshida laments a few missed exclusives--"Capcom decided to release Resident Evil 4 on GameCube, why?! We had Resident Evil 1, 2, and 3 on PlayStation..."--as the end of the PS2 generation rolled around, Sony seemed unstoppable.</p><p dir="ltr">And then, it all went wrong.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The PS3 generation, and a cell of Sony's own creation</h2><p dir="ltr">When the PS3 arrived in 2006, its prohibitively expensive price point ($499.99) and difficult-to-develop-for architecture turned the PS3 generation into a hubristic disaster. Suddenly, Sony was losing ground to another electronics company that had belatedly entered the console space, Microsoft.</p><p dir="ltr">"The PS3 generation was hard," recalls Yoshida. "For the first couple of years it was really tough to see the same games come out on PS3 and Xbox 360, and the Xbox 360 version performing better. In theory, PS3 was going to be much higher performance, but at launch we were not able to show that. We had first-party games like Resistance looking great, but then third-party games were constantly compared side-by-side unfavorably to 360. It was quite shocking."</p><p dir="ltr">By the end of the generation, the PS3 had toughed it out, eventually amassing an enviable lineup of exclusive titles. It's these mature, story-led games that would ultimately set the tone for Sony's enviable PS4 library. The quality of these games is one that Yoshida ultimately attributes to Sony executives' patience; although they weren't happy about it, Yoshida says his bosses allowed him to delay unfinished PS3 games no matter the cost.</p><p dir="ltr">"Every year I had to apologize to the business side that we have to delay this game," says Yoshida. "But the company understood that by spending enough time and polishing the game, in the end, the game will sell more than rushing it out."</p><p dir="ltr">One such game that Yoshida had to keep delaying? An ambitious zombie project from the creators of Uncharted. "It was a bit surprising that Naughty Dog wanted to move on from Uncharted, but also that they were going to create something really mature," he recalls. "Uncharted was like a summer blockbuster movie for a very broad audience, so I was a little concerned that we may be going too niche by going so mature. But in the end, their craft produced such an amazing game that they established an IP even bigger than Uncharted, [The Last of Us]. I'm so excited that they are working on a new IP again with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic</a>."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Unifying hardware and software</h2><p dir="ltr">The end of the PS3 generation saw a change of leadership from Ken Kutaragi to Kaz Hirai, and from then, Yoshida focused on helping developers collaborate with the hardware team during the production of the PS4--an effort to ensure that the disaster of the PS3 generation never happened again.</p><p dir="ltr">"Kaz asked me to move to Japan to work very closely with the hardware team," Yoshida recalls. "I was able to connect them to the right Worldwide Studio members and that's how PS4 and PS Vita, in my mind, became really good systems for developers to make games for."</p><p dir="ltr">In his final years at Sony, Yoshida moved away from top-level first-party decisions and went back to his PS1 roots. Try as he might, he became less interested in the AAA titles hogging the spotlight and was instead drawn to the quirky indie curiosities beckoning from the shadows.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was a huge proponent of indie games," smiles Yoshida. "Every time I went to a games show like E3 or Gamescom, even though we had booths to show our big, first-party titles, I went to the indie area. When I saw a game that I liked, I [took] a photo with the developers and [tried] to help promote these games. We were able to support games like Journey… And that led me to become the evangelist of indie games for PlayStation for the last five years of my career there."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4591507-7213130070-GVq9yeBX0AAyqax.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4591507" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4591507-7213130070-GVq9yeBX0AAyqax.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4591507"></a><figcaption>Yoshida has always been a champion of indie games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4591507-7213130070-GVq9yeBX0AAyqax.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">A new chapter</h2><p dir="ltr">As of January 2025, Yoshida is a freelance consultant, working directly with indie developers. As well as being a notable indie champion, Yoshida is also a huge advocate for VR, working with long-standing VR developer NDreams on the recently launched game Reach. This is hardly a new passion for Yoshida, though, as he reveals that he was pivotal in bringing PSVR to the market. "I was involved in the hardware development of the first PSVR," says Yoshida. "The project started as a grassroots activity from Santa Monica Studio during [the] PS3 days."</p><p dir="ltr">Using the PS Move's 3D-tracking, Sony Santa Monica jerry-rigged a crude, handmade VR headset together in their spare time. Yoshida was instantly sold. "They customized a God of War game on PS3 and I tried it, and I was like, 'Wow, I'm in God of War!' I looked down and I was Kratos! It was an amazing experience."</p><p dir="ltr">As he excitedly tells me about his Xbox ROG Ally X preorder and laments the death of the Vita, it's impossible not to leave the conversation charmed by Shuhei Yoshida. There's a sense of playfulness about him--one that you can feel throughout the many of the initiatives he spearheaded at PlayStation, as well. From the quirky curation of games of the PS1 era to the childlike wonder of PSVR, after 39 years, Yoshida's playful spirit will undoubtedly be missed by PlayStation fans.</p><p dir="ltr">"The PS1 generation was like an indie scene," Yoshida smiles. "There were so many small teams making interesting new concepts that came out of nowhere. So many hit products that came from non-traditional game creators." Now as Yoshida leaves Sony behind and enters a new chapter of guiding independent creators, it seems he's ready to share that playfulness with the wider world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With <a href="https://gizmodo.com/chainsaw-man-the-movie-reze-arc-review-anime-mappa-2000675933#comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Chainsaw Man — The Movie: Reze Arc</em></a> sitting at the number one spot in the U.S., <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/10/24/chainsaw-man-reze-arc-beats-demon-slayers-rotten-tomatoes-score/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drawing rave reviews</a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-chainsaw-man-movie-carves-up-a-box-office-win-2000677288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IMAX box office buzz</a>, anime’s bold leap into the mainstream has never felt more confident or surprising. For legacy outlets and casual moviegoers alike, the challenge with <em>Chainsaw Man </em>isn’t so much reviewing the film and anime’s signature mix of graphic violence and grief as figuring out how to interpret its overt horniness. And I’ve been loving every second seeing it on my timeline.&nbsp;</p><p>One Rotten Tomatoes critic quote from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/movies/chainsaw-man-the-movie-reze-arc-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times writer Nicholas Rapold’s review</a>—“It’s hard not to feel limited by the character’s somewhat stunted psychology”—while taken out of context from its otherwise glowing review (<a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/31/16107948/rotten-tomatoes-score-get-their-ratings-top-critics-certified-fresh-aggregate-mean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as it often happens</a>), reads like a shrug from someone who simply doesn’t understand the complexities of Denji’s process of turning his inverted hierarchical pyramid upright in his long, slow coming-of-age story to separate physicality and sex from emotional love.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, Rapold’s passing sentiment is a common refrain many fans grapple with when they first start the series. As YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHeJT0aNWJE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MoistCr1tikal</a> pointed out, the question of whether <em>Chainsaw Man</em> is an anime about a horny teenager or a horny anime about a teenager is an age-old debate that’s answered simply: yes to both. But the depravity of <em>Chainsaw Man</em> goes far deeper than Rotten Tomatoes’ cherry-picked pull quote from Rapold or the confines of <em>Reze Arc</em>’s stark nudity. Beneath Denji’s slow journey toward emotional literacy, which reviewers (including myself) have tried to capture in their reviews, lies a fandom that’s long since abandoned restraint.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="米津玄師  Kenshi Yonezu - IRIS OUT" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LmZD-TU96q4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>At their most peevish, they <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@weebeffect/video/7556176140306599175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bark at Makima’s appearance in theaters</a>. At their most exasperating, they “<a href="https://x.com/ver_zeke/status/1889422669067723170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wish that were me</a>,” like <a href="https://youtu.be/PV5063fjZ6I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Park characters </a>and boil down the adult women<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChainsawMan/comments/i7j4bs/psa_denji_is_not_a_simp_denji_is_a_victim_of/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> manipulating the 16-year-old protagonist with sex</a> to “simping.” Truly, the stunted psychology of <em>Chainsaw Man</em> fans might rival that of the hero. But I want to highlight how shipping—the great equalizer of depravity in any fandom—turns one glorious act of depravity into the primo example of how deep into the delinquent abyss <em>Chainsaw Man</em> fans can truly go in a vastly more positive light than the usual fair for the fandom scaring the hoes (read: normies).&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite examples of unhinged feats from the <em>Chainsaw Man</em> fandom are one unsung fan’s attempt to do the math (literally) and determine how long the average anime fan can raw dog the series’ resident cherub, Angel Devil, before dying.</p><p><strong>Light series spoilers for that.</strong></p><p>In a previous blog post in which I rightly stated that <a href="https://aftermath.site/chainsaw-man-reze-arc-tatsuki-fujimoto-the-bible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Chainsaw Man</em> is better than the Bible</a>, I explained that a Devil’s strength depends on humanity’s fear of the concept they embody. Falling Devils, Bomb Devils, and STD Devils are all real entities that exist in Chainsaw Man. One odd man out in the Devil pantheon is Angel Devil, a devil who looks more like a lil guy than a freakish homunculus. Angel Devil’s whole deal is that your lifespan is shortened the longer you make physical contact with him. Angel Devil works alongside Denji, specifically his roommate Aki Hayakawa, to hunt devils. Despite their limited screentime, fans strongly ship the straight-laced Aki and the innocent Angel Devil. They have their own ship name, <a href="https://shipping.fandom.com/wiki/AkiAngel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AkiAngel</a>. Plus, the whole cannot touch aspect of their partnership fits well with monster-fucker fantasies. Sony’s marketing team has been <a href="https://x.com/Chainsaw_EN/status/1980696214485233744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaning into that</a>, hyping up their relationship despite their limited screentime, much to the delight of AkiAngel fans.&nbsp;</p><p>Toward the climax of the film, Aki and Angel Devil are on the brink of getting caught up in the chaos of Denji and Shark Devil’s battle with Bomb Devil and Typhoon Devil. Instead of letting Angel Devil go, Aki pulls him close, clutching his hand as the chaos level of a disaster film like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000386/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolland Emmerich</a> tears through Japan. It’s a cute shipper moment in both the manga and the anime. But one fan was laser-focused on their brief contact, which lasted over 3 seconds, cutting 2 months from the 2 years Aki has left to live, and reverse-engineering how long the average anime fan could spend recreating the creature with two backs with Angel Devil before dying.&nbsp;</p><p>In the post, the fan, whose origin point in a sea of reposts on <a href="https://x.com/cavalierposting/status/1970834156113613225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Animemes/comments/zu57mx/chainsaw_man_sanest_chainsaw_man_fan_sir/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> about it is lost to time, hypothesized from chapter 50 of <em>Chainsaw Man</em> that the three seconds Aki touched Angel Devil, that a year of a person’s total lifespan would be depleted from physically touching Angel Devil for 18 seconds. Taking this knowledge from Tatsuki Fujimoto to its logical exaggeration, answering the question on every fan’s mind three years ago, crunched the numbers, concocting an equation for how long you could bump uglies with Angel Devil before meeting God.&nbsp;</p><p>They arrived at their equation by taking the average male life expectancy is 72.75 worldwide (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now 75.8 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—go men!</a>), subtracting from the average age of anime fans of 18 to 25, they estimated that the average viewer has around 47.75 to 54.75 years to spare to touch Angel Devil.&nbsp;</p><p>For clarity, the Angel Devil Porking Life Equation is: the average male lifespan minus your current age, multiplied by 18 seconds, then divided by 60 to get the exact minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>Using my age this year as an example, along with the updated male life expectancy, that equation looks like this:</p><p>75.8 - 29 = 46.8 years to spare</p><p>46.8 years to spare x 18 seconds =&nbsp; 828 seconds</p><p>828 seconds ÷ 60 = 13.8 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>So by my calculations, I’d get roughly 14 minutes with Angel Devil to, as the nameless fan so eloquently put it, “pound that angel bussy straight” before my lifespan taps out. While that’s not a lot to boast about, it’s undoubtedly more than Aki can say, given he’s got less than two years left post-<em>Reze Arc</em>. Could you wear protection and forgo the whole life-draining phenomenon entirely? Sure. But where’s the doomed romance in that? Sometimes you raw dog a life-sapping twink not for survival, but for the love of the game.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Chainsaw Man</em> fans, at the height of their passion, are dedicated enough in their depravity to do the math on how long characters can have sex. This is a crucial fact for anyone to know as anime movies continue to take over the box office: your fellow audience members are likely deranged.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/trump-halo-twitter"><h3>The Trump Halo Memes Aren’t Supposed To Make Sense</h3></a><p>It's me, the sucker trying to figure them out anyway</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon"><h3>What The Hell Is Microsoft Doing?</h3></a><p>"They added a new Clippy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lost during a big move? Stolen when you’re out of town? Consumed in a tragic fire? What’s the worst way your meticulously grown <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-scalpers-mega-evolution-tiktok-2000638182">Pokémon card collectio</a>n could perish? Water damage from flooding is definitely up there. Water damage from a broken sewer line might be the absolute worst, though. That’s what recently happened to one collector who’s still trying to process what happened. “It hurts that I lost a multiple thousand dollar collection, but it really just hurts from losing all the memories,” he wrote.</p> <p>Pictures shared <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1og98du/i_lost_my_entire_collection/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/pokemon-tcg-collector-devastated-after-sewage-flood-destroys-thousands-in-sealed-cards-3275184/">over the weekend</a> in the Pokémon trading card Reddit community tell the grim story (via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/pokemon-tcg-collector-devastated-after-sewage-flood-destroys-thousands-in-sealed-cards-3275184/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>). Unopened packs of <em>Astral Radiance</em>,<em> Surging Sparks</em>, <em>Chilling Reign</em>, <em>Stellar Crown</em>, and more lay on a grey basement floor after having sat in pools of contaminated water from a broken sewer line. Their owner, Reddit user Substantial-Pie-4973, said he also lost his entire collection of opened packs as well. Some of the rarest cards spotted in his binder included a Moonbreon and Tomokazu Komiya Charmeleon,</p>

 <p>“I go to the store and get a phone call from my wife. She tells me the basement is flooding and right when I heard those words my heart dropped,” he wrote. “The sewage line busted in the basement which ruined almost all of our belongings and my entire Pokémon collection. The cards in my binders, all of my sealed/loose packs had been soaking in the sewage water for about 2-3 days from what I’m being told, but since the storage room is closed off, we did not smell or see any of the flooding.”</p>

   <p>Substantial-Pie-4973 went into the circumstances of how the collection ended up in the basement in the first place. He said he took a pay cut to help his father open a new business, and he and his wife were living at his grandparents until they could afford a new place to live. As a result, everything was sitting in cardboard moving boxes in the basement. In addition to not being aware of the leak at first, Substantial-Pie-4973 said he also recently had surgery for a hernia, delaying him from getting everything opened and sorted as soon as the mess was discovered. None of it was insured either. An absolute nightmare scenario.</p>

 <p>“Category 3 water damage can be super harmful and porous items like cards are not safely salvageable, so pretty much everything that was touched had to be thrown out,” Substantial-Pie-4973 wrote. “Getting that hit after opening so many packs, finding that product that everyone is wanting on the shelf at the store, trying to complete certain sets, etc…all gone before I felt like I could blink.”</p>

 <p>While this is as good a moment as any to remind people to 1) not store collections in basements, 2) keep everything in sealed plastic containers, and 3) get the collection added as separate item in your insurance policy, it’s also a reminder that those best practices aren’t always available to everyone all of the time. Sometimes life cuts you a break and sometimes it kicks you when you’re already vulnerable.</p> <p>If there’s one silver lining, it’s that fellow collectors are already encouraging Substantial-Pie-4973 to livestream his pulls for the remaining damaged packs and encourage others to donate to help him start rebuilding his collection. “Open the poop packs! Open the poop packs!” chanted one commenter. “It’s every collectors worst nightmare,” wrote another. “Hard to spin it in any positive way. I’m sorry you’re going through all that.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Crash Bandicoot may be spinning his way onto Netflix with a new series, a new report claims. The iconic orange marsupial has been charming fans since the early 1990s, and now, he may get some more attention.</p>



<p>The franchise, owned by Toys for Bob and Activision, has had a few new entries in the new generation like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crash-team-rumble-release-date-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crash Team Rumble</a> and Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time! as part of a revival. While no new entries have been greenlit or revealed, a new report hints that one, albeit an animated TV series, is in the works at Netflix with the help of the team behind Sonic Prime.</p>



<h2 id="h-an-animated-crash-bandicoot-series-possibly-in-the-works-at-netflix-and-wildbrain">An Animated Crash Bandicoot Series Possibly in the Works at Netflix and WildBrain</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to a claim by <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/crash-bandicoot-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">What’s On N</a>etflix, Netflix is quietly working on a Crash Bandicoot animated series. Furthermore, it’s being made by WildBrain Studios, who previously did the Sonic Prime show. Other projects from the company include Johnny Test, The Snoopy Show, and Carmen Sandiego. Unfortunately, the report doesn’t reveal any other details like casting or release, so take it with a grain of salt. That said, Insider Gaming has reached out to Netflix, but has received no comment as of writing.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that no official announcement has been made on the project. However, a Crash Bandicoot series has been asked for, and even attempted at, for quite some time, as recently as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/01/rumour_looks_like_crash_bandicoots_cartoon_series_has_been_cancelled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2021 with Amazon</a>. During the production of the original 1997 title, Universal&nbsp;Animation Studios created an animated opening and ending that it hoped&nbsp;would inspire a TV series. It unfortunately didn’t come to be, though it did get <a href="https://youtu.be/6d5651XSuh0">uploaded onto YouTube</a> in 2015. Outside of that, the character appeared in Netflix’s Skylanders Academy as a cameo, played by Our Flag Means Death’s Rhys Darby. </p>



<p>Whether the news is true or not, Crash Bandicoot is a great choice for an animated series. The wacky world and colorful characters make for some awesome visuals. Plus, Mario and Sonic already got adaptations, so it’s high time for Crash to get his. Maybe we’ll get Spyro and Banjo-Kazooie next for mascot shows? Here’s hoping!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Trump Halo Memes Aren’t Supposed To Make Sense]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-trump-halo-memes-aren%E2%80%99t-supposed-to-make-sense.1336261/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s a theory that started on Bluesky a month ago from composer Patrick Cosmos that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/veryimportant.lawyer/post/3lybxlwzjuc2h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everyone in the US government is 12 now</a>. Cosmos goes on to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/veryimportant.lawyer/post/3lybyflzgzs2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">show</a> how all the dumb shit we’re currently living through, and which boggles the minds of regular people, makes total sense if you imagine it was conjured up by the brain of a pre-teen. I had a little laugh at this theory but didn’t think about it too seriously until this weekend, when several government social media accounts got really into <em>Halo</em>.</p><p>How did we get here? On Friday, it was announced that a remake of the original <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>, called <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em>, is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-launches-on-ps5-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to the PlayStation</a> in 2026. It’s the first time the iconic Xbox series will appear on its top competitor’s platform, as Xbox moves away from the whole “<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-marketing-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being an Xbox</a>” thing into <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whatever the heck it’s trying to be now</a>. This is, on the one hand, a big deal given Halo’s place in Xbox’s identity. On the other hand, it feels like a natural evolution as console exclusivity becomes <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-playstation-ps5-exclusivity-indiana-jones-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less and less of a thing</a>.</p><p>On Saturday, retailer GameStop <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982213786221109263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted a statement</a> declaring the “official cessation of the console wars,” which it writes started with <em>Combat Evolved</em>, but that now “console loyalists are instructed to cease hostilities, disband militias, and enjoy this new era of gaming.” There’s not much to this, though you could say the language is a little cringe given <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/live-updates/israel-gaza-live-updates-search-continues-bodies-missing/?id=126889888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current events</a>; GameStop sells games, this is a joke about selling games, whatever.</p><p>But for some reason the <em>literal US government</em> has taken an interest in this thoroughly mid-tier joke. It started with the official White House account retweeting GameStop’s post with an <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">image of Trump done up in Spartan armor </a>with the GameStop slogan “Power to the players.” Why? Looking at a <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/here-s-who-s-running-trump-s-digital-offensive-de4e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">list of the chuds</a> behind the government’s social media accounts, at least one of them is probably a gamer and saw GameStop’s tweet and, I guess given Trump’s efforts to portray himself as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-venezuela-strikes-regime-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peace president</a>, thought a games retailer declaring a joke truce in a joke war would fit with that image.&nbsp;</p><p>GameStop then retweeted the White House image with an <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982654845166428607/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">image of its own</a>, showing Trump in a Spartan helmet in front of JD Vance stylized as Cortana. Except for some reason it’s <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/jd-vance-babyface-edits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">babyface Vance</a>, a meme meant to be insulting to the vice president. Is GameStop knocking Vance? Does it just want to squeeze another meme into its meme to demonstrate that, I don’t know, memes are happening?&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the official <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1982587953676247375" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">White House rapid response account</a> retweeted GameStop’s ceasefire joke with the declaration that “President Trump presides over the end of the 20-year Console Wars,” including an emoji of a dove (for peace, you see). GameStop retweeted this with <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982619455797821810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>another</em> Trump/Halo meme</a>. And then today the Department of Homeland Security–which loves to use <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-administration-dhs-white-house-deportations-meme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pop culture references</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-creative-social-media-posts-artists-brands-happy/story?id=124541747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other people’s music</a> in its memes, including <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8ex9n8gxdwo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokemon</a>–got in on the action with a graphic of a Halo warthog vehicle with the phrase “Destroy the Flood” and an exhortation to join ICE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft declined to comment.&nbsp;</p><p>What is going on here? Out of all of this, the DHS post is the only one that makes “sense:” it’s desperate and racist (Nathan described it in our Slack as “Great Replacement Theory but make it Flood”) in the way of all DHS’ posts, just the same old loser shit. But it’s all the rest of the posts that are bugging me, none of which are out of character for the people currently steering the American ship into every available iceberg, but feeling to me as uniquely nonsensical.&nbsp;</p><p>Is Trump earnest about taking credit for “ending the console wars?” Is the Rapid Response account for real that this is some kind of Trump accomplishment? I have to doubt it. So did they just see something they imagine gamers find good and think, <em>you know what else we want gamers to think is good–Trump!</em> (this despite having previously <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-suggests-video-games-blame-mass-shootings-n1039411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blamed video games</a> for mass violence) and so throw something up, assuming people reading their accounts are so stupid that if you put two ostensibly “good” things together their audience will just connect the two? This theory has weight in that we know how stupid everyone involved is, and how stupid they think everyone else is.&nbsp;</p><p>As I ranted about this to my Aftermath colleagues this morning, raising my <a href="https://aftermath.site/civil-war-middle-age" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">middle-aged man</a> blood pressure as I frantically mined for meaning in posts that will remain in the historical record long after all of us are dead, Gita reminded me of the “everyone is 12” theory. They compared these posts to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/oct/23/six-seven-meme-invades-uk-classrooms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“six seven” meme</a>, also popular with 12-year-olds: incoherent nonsense that exists solely to remind the audience that an in-group exists and you’re not in it. It’s like the “<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/white-house-wild-response-to-huffpost-question_n_68f26217e4b0ee732e24eb66" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your mom</a>” replies to reporters’ questions, juvenile and combative for no other reason than that the people giving them are allowed to be juvenile and combative now.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s all the dumbest possible exercise of power: You can post whatever you want! You can say “your mom!” at work! You can <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/the-east-wing-of-the-white-house-has-been-demolished-heres-a-look-at-its-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tear down a chunk of your house</a>! I don’t think it matters to the White House whether Trump is sincerely taking credit for <em>Halo </em>on PlayStation or not, or if there’s any kind of strategy to win over gamers with the claim. It’s just that he can say whatever he wants, and he’s far beyond the requirement of that stuff making any sense. He knows his audience will salivate over his mention of <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-stupid-do-they-think-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things they recognize</a>, even if those things are meaningless. And it’s funny to rile up people like me who don’t get it, to hint at some secret knowledge or private joke even when there’s literally nothing underneath it.&nbsp;</p><p>Many adults know the particularly embarrassing terror that grips you when you walk by a group of teens on the street and prepare to get roasted. Our whole government feels like that now, except without the ability to take a different route home, and with the roasts not being insults about our outfits but the destruction of our families, communities, social safety nets, and more. This entire administration is one big childish outburst, and nonsense video game memes just drive that point home.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon"><h3>What The Hell Is Microsoft Doing?</h3></a><p>"They added a new Clippy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new prewritten adventure is available for free on D&amp;D Beyond. To promote the upcoming Forgotten Realms books coming to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2024, Wizards of the Coast is releasing one of the book's new adventures, <em>The Tenebrous Stone</em>, as part of a sneak peek.</p>



<p>According to a post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2084-claim-your-copy-of-the-tenebrous-stone-adventure" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, the free adventure being released is intended for level 3 adventurers. It is a "Deity Adventure" set in Helmsdale. An adventuring party is sent to a basalt quarry to track down an evil artifact. On their journey, they will face down dark cultists and undead horrors. This one-shot adventure is designed to be completed in about 2-3 hours.</p>

This contains brief, high-level notes about the adventure and a breakdown of key encounters. Additionally, the adventure features digital maps and monsters on the platform's Maps VTT. This isn't to be confused with their dedicated VTT, Sigil, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-closes-doors-on-sigil-dd-beyond-vtt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ending support</a> at the end of this month.</p>

<p>In short, this adventure is a solid starting point for new adventurers, online or otherwise.</p>

<p>The Tenebrous Stone is just one prewritten adventure that appears in the upcoming Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerun book. According to its listing, the book will contain over 50 prewritten adventures and 52 maps, all packed with adventures for heroes of all stripes. It is being sold alongside a player supplement that will include new subclasses, spells, magic items, and a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-previews-dungeons-dragons-2024-circle-magic-in-new-forgotten-realms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Circle Magic</a> gameplay mechanic.</p>

<p>There is no expiration date given for <em>The Tenebrous Stone's</em> availability on D&amp;D Beyond. However, given WOTC has done similar promos before, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/spelljammer-academy-on-dd-beyond-for-free" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">previewing monster</a> statblocks ahead of Spelljammer, providing a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-and-dragons-vecna-5e-statblock-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new 5e statblock</a> for The Whispered One, Vecna, and even released official statblocks for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/baldurs-gate-3-character-sheets-released-by-wizards-of-coast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cast of <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, it is wise to pick up the adventure now while you can.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/easy-halloween-costume-party-1851676907">October is a spooky month</a>. It’s that time of year when everyone starts watching horror movies, <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-horror-games-october-2023-rdr2-pc-ps5-1850879972">playing scary games</a>, decorating their houses with giant skeletons, and listening to “Monster Mash” a few too many times. But on <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-not-scary-games-to-play-on-halloween-1844512015">Halloween</a> night, we remember the real reason for the season: Candy. And lots of it.</p> <p>But while any candy is better than no candy, not all of these delicious and sugary sweet treats are equal. In fact, some downright suck while others are heavenly pieces of joy wrapped and packaged in plastic. So fellow <em>Kotaku </em>writer Ethan Gach and I sat down and used a very complicated and scientific process, trust us, to rank 38 different candies to find out what is truly the best (and worst) Halloween treat around.</p> <p><strong>Update 10/27/2025:</strong> This list was originally published on October 23, 2024. We’ve updated this ranking to add even more candy to the list.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-the-library-2000639359</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo%E2%80%99s-controversial-level-%E2%80%98the-library%E2%80%99-is-great-the-way-it-is.1336246/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In its last few levels, 2001’s <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> virtually turns into a survival horror game as you battle your way through hordes of twisted, undead enemies in dimly lit corridors, pressed to make every shot count and desperate to preserve your health as you press forward. Perhaps no level in <i>Halo</i>’s storied campaign presents such a sudden change of tone and intensity as “The Library,” a long set of spacious corridors in which you first meet the sentient undead lifeform known as the Flood, and must face an almost inexhaustible supply of them while equipped with the game’s most powerful weapons.</p> <p>“The Library” has once again become topical as we look toward the release of the upcoming <i>Halo: Campaign Evolved</i>, a remake of the original Xbox launch title. Unlike the anniversary edition of the game which shipped in 2011, <i>Campaign Evolved</i> sets out to tweak existing level structures, as well as the weapon sandbox. And the level whose potential changes fans are speculating about the most is “<a href="https://kotaku.com/halos-worst-level-is-getting-changed-in-the-new-ps5-remake-2000638963">The Library</a>.”</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/halos-worst-level-is-getting-changed-in-the-new-ps5-remake-2000638963"><i>Halo</i>’s Worst Level Is Getting Changed In The New PS5 Remake</a></p> <p>That’s because “The Library” is a notorious level, widely considered a low point, a blemish on <i>Combat Evolved</i>’s otherwise outstanding campaign. But I disagree with the sentiment that “The Library” is some broken level that desperately needs remixing to fix. After recently replaying the level, I am convinced it remains a tense, brutal section of the game that tests you in everything you’ve learned about <i>Halo</i>’s combat thus far, equipping you with the skills necessary to finish the remaining levels, which only amplify the threat by tossing Covenant back in the mix with the Flood.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639368" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639368"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639368">© Gif: Halo Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The arrival of the Flood dramatically steps up the difficulty in <i>CE</i>. After several levels spent fighting the Covenant, the introduction of these swarming parasites forces you to learn some new playstyles and find new strengths and weaknesses in each of the game’s weapons. The last few levels could’ve just been more of the same. But the Flood dramatically change the pace and scope of the game. Their introduction is when <i>Halo</i> evolves. And evolution is often painful, and full of surprises.</p>

 <p>The Flood swarm the player in vast numbers wielding <i>both </i>human and Covenant weapons; they can leap incredible distances; their melee attack is brutal; the bulbous carrier form explodes with an AOE attack and spawns in several tiny enemies which can collectively swarm you to death if you’re careless. Oh, and they can basically rise from the dead at least once, usually when you least expect it.</p>

 <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://youtu.be/Q_nsjC8BItc">25 Years Later, <i>Halo</i> Is Finally Coming To PlayStation</a></p> <p>They’re a challenge to fight. Critically, they’re a challenge to <i>survive</i>. And that’s what makes “The Library” such an engaging level; it’s a test of endurance, knowing which fights are worth engaging in, and which ones are better left in your dust.</p>

 <h2>“The Library” is tough, but it has a logic</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639367" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639367"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639367">© Gif: Halo Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>“The Library” asks three things from you: Equip yourself well, use your enemy against you, and <i>keep moving</i>. While there are a few segments in which you’re asked to stand your ground while 343 Guilty Spark takes his sweet time to open a door, that last challenge—keep moving—is the most important of all. Standing still in “The Library” is guaranteed to lead to death, so mastering circle strafing, bunny hopping, and crouch jumping to get on to the elevated platforms is essential for maintaining distance.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><i>Halo</i> Gets Sucked Into ICE’s Recruitment Meme War</a></p> <p>The Flood are nasty but they also have critical vulnerabilities, all of which “The Library” asks you to manage. Take the bulbous carrier forms which explode. Not only can their explosion work against them when they’re in a dense crowd of Flood, displacing or destroying their own comrades, but they can also trigger chain effect grenade explosions from any explosives dropped by the standard infantry. Again, the challenge is to spot those opportunities, creating more problems for your enemy than they do for you.</p>  <p>And because virtually every weapon in the game is available in the Library by way of the Flood carrying both human and alien firepower, your challenge is to keep yourself stocked. My preference is for a shotgun and plasma rifle combo, occasionally picking up a rocket launcher or needler if I feel I need to take out larger hordes.</p> <h2>In the darkness, terror</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639364" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639364"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639364">© Screenshot: Halo Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>“The Library” is ominously dark, almost bland, utilitarian. It doesn’t feel like it was made to bedazzle you, the player. It feels purpose-built by some ancient alien intelligence that wasn’t concerned with baroque, sci-fi trappings. It’s a dreary, barren set of massive corridors turned into a hellscape by the swarm of undead after you.</p>

 <p>All the while, as you fight for your life, 343 Guilty Spark’s comments on the inefficiencies of your weapons and his strange fascination with the Flood as a life form are reminiscent of Ash’s speech about the xenomorph in <i>Alien</i> being a “<a href="https://youtu.be/VA8jv1M6Y2g">perfect organism</a>.” It feels absurd, almost hilarious, how 343 is more pre-occupied with miscellaneous facts about the function of the parasitic life form than on your actual struggle as you fend off the terrifying swarm.</p> <p>I’m always reminded of <i>Alien, </i>particularly <a href="https://youtu.be/Q_nsjC8BItc">its opening scenes</a>, when I play “The Library,” with which it shares a haunting austerity and ever-present darkness. Dimly lit corridors seem to stretch on forever, revealing an indecipherable architectural language lit only by a passing flashlight.</p>

 <h2>What’s at risk of getting lost when Halo Studios changes “The Library”?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639366" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639366"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639366">© Screenshot: Halo Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I remain skeptical of the need to remake <i>Halo</i> at all. To be honest, I think we’re still living in an era of first-person shooters that, especially on console, was largely shaped by <i>Halo</i> to begin with. Tweaking the original <i>Halo</i> to include sprint, ADS, new weapons, and some new level layouts isn’t going to be as substantial an evolution as we saw in, say, the remake of <i>Resident Evil 2</i> a few years ago.</p> <p>What is to be gained by altering “The Library”? Does it just become a more casual stroll through an amusement park of sci-fi architecture?</p> <p>The difficulty of “The Library” speaks to the unstoppable brutality of the Flood in <i>Halo</i>’s narrative: They are such a threat, we’re told, that a previous civilization had to destroy (almost) all sentient life in the galaxy to stop them. Nothing else would do. And in surviving them, Master Chief’s heroism is equally amplified.</p>

 <p>Is <i>Halo</i> the same story if “The Library” isn’t a trip through hell? Is the Flood truly such a terrifying foe if it isn’t given the spacious emptiness of the Library to swarm around in?</p> <p>“The Library” is a demonstration, both narratively and through its challenging gameplay, of why the Flood are so feared. Pare those elements back, and <i>Halo: Campaign Evolved</i> risks being something more generic than the groundbreaking shooter it’s based on.</p>

<section><p>Rapha and Marach’s story goes against the grain by portraying SWANA characters as virtuous, imperfect people--an opportunity not awarded to many SWANA characters.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Final Fantasy Tactics has returned after 28 years to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review-a-polished-historical-gem/1900-6418413/">phenomenal critical acclaim</a> in The Ivalice Chronicles, with fans both old and new reveling in the improved gameplay and actor performances that weren’t possible in 1997. As Yasumi Matsuno, the creator of the original game, wrote in a moving <a href="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1930391930317484080" rel="nofollow ">Twitter post</a>, Tactics comes to players in a time much like when the original was released--a time fraught with “inequality and division” that may leave many feeling “robbed of hope.” While Tactics is a fantasy story set in a fictional setting, developers did take a page or two out of real historical events, such as England’s War of the Roses in the mid to late 1400s. It’s bittersweet that history repeats itself now, but it does emphasize how relevant the evergreen themes of Tactics are, and how important Rapha and Marach Galthena’s involvement in the story is.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Israel and Palestine were also making headlines in 1997, the recent dramatic escalation of the situation has become a prominent global conversation today. With this escalation comes an <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/11/anti-muslim-hate-hits-new-high-in-us-advocacy-group" rel="nofollow ">uptick in anti-Arab sentiment</a>, making Rapha and Marach’s involvement in The Ivalice Chronicles that much more special to South West Asian and North African (SWANA) gamers like me. It’s also very refreshing to hear actors Elham Ehsas and Lara Sawalha bringing these characters to life so authentically because it’s no secret that SWANA coded characters have, historically, not been depicted in the most flattering or nuanced light--especially in video games. From Metal Slug to Counter Strike, SWANA coded characters have been one of three things: belly dancers, camel-riding snake charmers, or just flat out evil terrorists. Rapha and Marach tell a very different story--one that allows room for nuance and mirrors many of the issues that our community faces internationally, which was saying a lot back in 1997 and says even more in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Rapha and Marach are orphans who were swiftly brought under the wing of Duke Barrington, a powerful man who intended to use the siblings for their rare mantra abilities. Duke Barrington not only recruited Rapha and Marach as child soldiers for his war efforts, but he also indoctrinated and trained countless other children too, by opening orphanages filled with “a pool of willing young minds.” This allowed him to select the very best to "mold and train,” as Ramza puts it. It may sound cartoonishly evil, but this is actually eerily similar to how <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/09/20/our-opportunity-end-talibans-use-child-soldiers" rel="nofollow ">the Taliban recruits today</a>. It is commendable that instead of framing Marach and Rapha as roadblocks designed to be cut down on Ramza’s journey, they are given a humanizing backstory that explains why they end up on a megalomaniac’s side of the war instead of Ramza’s. Rapha especially plays a crucial role in highlighting just how misled she and her brother have been, and tries her best to make him see that, in spite of his initial obstinance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4591506-ff%2816%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4591506" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4591506-ff%2816%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4591506"></a><figcaption>Rapha confronts Marach about his belief in Duke Barrington.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4591506-ff%2816%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now, despite how much care is taken in handling the Galthenas’ story, there is room for critique as well. It's worth noting that the siblings are the only characters in the game with mantra abilities; this feeds into an Orientalist trope, essentially exoticizing the only SWANA coded characters in the game. Additionally, the fact that Rapha and Marach are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/1nz6zt1/rapha_and_marach_are_terrible_characters_with/" rel="nofollow ">not well-optimized</a> at all makes them much less popular with Tactics fans. While this is relatively easy to fix with some respeccing, it still isn’t immediately obvious how to best utilize both characters in combat, and that could ultimately dissuade players from including Rapha and Marach in their parties, which is unfortunate and reflects some carelessness on the part of Square.</p><p dir="ltr">The other major critique I have is one narrative moment that paints an unflattering picture of Marach, specifically. When Rapha and Marach are first introduced in The Ivalice Chronicles, they are mid-argument. Marach is angry with Rapha for saying disparaging things about the man who he thinks saved them as children. When Rapha tells him she knows Barrington is the one who made them orphans in the first place, Marach slaps her across the face and says he “will not abide [her] ill-mannered tongue”. This seems to suggest that Marach is a fervent supporter of Duke Barrington and is enraged that anyone, let alone his own sister, would say a negative word about him. What this moment also does, is play into a negative stereotype about SWANA men being <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10857900/#:~:text=Arab%20Stereotypes&amp;text=Similar%20to%20Black%20people%2C%20Arab,i.e.%2C%20a%20physical%20threat%29." rel="nofollow ">‘inherently more violent’</a>, especially toward women. This scene makes even less sense when it is revealed that Marach actually wants to be free of Barrington, and is not intent on staying in service to him.</p><p dir="ltr">With all the changes and improvements that this version of Tactics went through, including a gorgeous script overhaul, I think there was room to remove the slap from Marach and Rapha’s argument to avoid unintentionally reinforcing a negative stereotype. It wouldn’t be the first time a character was re-examined in the Final Fantasy franchise. Cid in Final Fantasy 7 was originally implied to be <a href="https://youtu.be/KYWGfBjo0Ew?si=Fz8iAtOwEf9nkLbw" rel="nofollow ">abusive</a> in the 1997 version of the game, and has since been reworked to be an endearing, upbeat southern gentleman in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.</p><p dir="ltr">While the original FF7 Cid was a pretty dour character overall, Marach, on the other hand, is a flawed character, but not a bad one. He genuinely cares for his sister, and even takes a bullet for her once he finally hears Duke Barrington admit to being the villain he has always been. After Rapha brings Marach back to life with the Scorpio Stone, the siblings both join Ramza’s party. For the first time in their lives, they actively choose what to fight for and who to fight alongside. It’s also revealed in optional dialogue when battling Hashmal/Folmarv that Rapha and Marach want that encounter to be the very last time they have to kill anyone ever again, which was unheard of for SWANA coded characters in the 90s and is still fairly uncommon now.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Rapha and Marach’s story is a bit of a short one in Tactics’ overall narrative, it is still impactful and continues to go against the grain by portraying SWANA characters as virtuous, imperfect people, like many other characters get to be. Would it be nice if their stats were better optimized? Sure. But in the grand scheme of things, the Galthena siblings are still great examples of how SWANA coded characters can be, and what I hope to see more of in future games.</p>

                <p>It's been a very good year for indie titles on Steam, even in the aftermath of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-has-already-surpassed-4-2-million-in-sales-report/1100-6534845/" data-ref-id="1100-6534845">blockbuster success</a>.

Now, another indie game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rv-there-yet/" data-ref-id="5000-697807">RV There Yet</a>, has raced past 1.3 million sales in a single week.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7mXFwVNX6Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H7mXFwVNX6Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>RV There Yet is the debut game of Nuggets Entertainment, and up to four players can join this co-op experience as they get behind the wheel of an RV home while attempting a very perilous side route through Mabutts Valley. The goal of the game is to get the RV past obstacles that it would ordinarily be unable to traverse. To pull that off, players will have to leave the RV and creatively use a winch and other tools to get by. As seen in the trailer above, some of those attempts can end very badly. This band of bros also has to deal with wildlife and snakes, which is why an EpiPen is one of their primary tools.</p><p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3949040/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, RV There Yet had over 100,000 concurrent players in its first week. Nuggets Entertainment community manager Jace Varlet subsequently posted the following video, in which he thanks players on behalf of the team. He also explains why the game wasn't marked as "early access."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CaS-_47zI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P2CaS-_47zI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In short, Nuggets Entertainment didn't expect this game to take off the way it did, and the studio just wanted to finish the title by its internally agreed-upon release date. There weren't originally any plans to add more content to RV There Yet, but that may soon change. Meanwhile, Varlet acknowledged that there are some bugs in the game and he pledged that they will be fixed.</p><p>There aren't any current plans for RV There Yet to make the leap to consoles, but it's currently on sale on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3949040/RV_There_Yet/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> for $7.19 before reverting to its regular price of $8 on October 28. Nuggets has also been concurrently developing another title called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/among-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-631981">Among the Wild</a>, but it just isn't ready for release yet.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 11 Minutes Of Halo Campaign Evolved Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p>Many wondered if Halo Studios employed some kind of artificial intelligence tool to help with this, but Microsoft has not confirmed one way or another, stating only that there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-wasnt-forced-to-use-generative-ai/1100-6535730/" data-ref-id="1100-6535730">no mandate that the studio <em>needed </em>to use AI</a>. In any event, executive producer Damon Conn said, "We've done everything we can to make sure that we preserve the heart of Halo as we rebuild and retouch everything."</p><p>The developers working on the remake said they were able to achieve this while keeping the "tone, the atmosphere, and the emotional impact" of the original game "preserved" for Campaign Evolved.</p><p>The remake makes some controversial changes, too, including the addition of sprint and some vehicle updates that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-halo-developer-slams-campaign-evolveds-changes/1100-6535720/" data-ref-id="1100-6535720">one of the game's original designers is not too happy about.</a> Another developer who worked on the original Halo weighed in on the remake with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">different, more enthusiastic and hopeful take. </a></p><p>Campaign Evolved launches in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S and PC, as well as PlayStation 5. The franchise is synonymous with Xbox and has never appeared on PlayStation until this remake. It may not be the last Halo game on PS5, either, as Halo Studios has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-halo-games-will-be-on-playstation-going-forward-says-microsoft/1100-6535712/" data-ref-id="1100-6535712">"Halo is on PlayStation" going forward.</a></p><p>There is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-halo-1-remake-has-no-multiplayer/1100-6535707/" data-ref-id="1100-6535707">no head-to-head multiplayer support</a>, but campaign co-op will be available. Check out the video above to get a closer look at the remake compared against the original. Pricing for Halo: Campaign Evolved has not been announced, but it has been confirmed that the game will launch at the same time on all platforms, as opposed to coming to Xbox and PC before PS5.</p><p>Microsoft has said it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/">multiple new Halo games in the works</a>, and another one might be a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/"> live-service Halo game</a> that could also release in 2026 for Halo's 25th anniversary.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> marked the official confirmation of something that felt like it would never happen just a short few years ago, with Halo officially coming to PlayStation. Following that announcement, GameStop, the retailer that was initially known for selling physical video games that's now more known for turning into a glorified Pop Funko and merch store called the 'Console Wars' over. Of all entities, the White House, which would normally have more important things to post about, responded with an AI-generated image of President Trump in Spartan armor with the caption "<em>Power to the players</em>."</p>



<p>GameStop's original post comes with a long and drawn-out declaration about the console wars being over, calling them <em>"petty</em>," which they definitely are, and also claiming that they originated with the release of the original Xbox and Halo: Combat Evolved with it. </p>



<p>A bit of a history lesson here for GameStop: console wars or, more accurately, players needlessly siding with one console manufacturer over another based on things like exclusive games you might prefer over the other and real-life factors like most parents being unwilling and/or unable to afford buying their kids consoles from every manufacturer, began long before the days of Xbox vs. PlayStation with Nintendo vs. SEGA.</p>



<p>Sure, Console Wars have always been more than a bit idiotic, but at least get the details of it right if you're going to go through the effort of making a big song-and-dance over it.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Speaking of getting the details right, unspurisingly, the AI that someone at the White House used to generate the image of Trump in Master Chief's armor holding an energy sword and saluting the American Flag on the White House lawn, did not get the details right. Specifically the key detail of the fact that the American flag should have 50 stars on it, one for each state. Instead, the AI-generated image only has 40 stars on the flag. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>By now, we're used to AI-generated images getting details wrong, and we've also become used to The White House using AI-generated images to display the President in all manner of ways, including ones that have caught a fair deal of flak, like the image that showed Trump as the Pope following the death of Pope Francis.</p>



<p>But it feels telling that important details like getting the right number of stars on the American flag in a post coming from the official White House account are overlooked in an attempt to garner some kind of cultural clout. Like how the caption "<em>Power to the Players</em>" overlooks the fact that tariffs instituted by the current administration have been a direct factor in the cost of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-development-kits-price-hike-microsoft/">gaming hardware going up in the United States and worldwide</a>. </p>



<p>Or how, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-suggests-video-games-blame-mass-shootings-n1039411">in 2019, Trump pointed to video games as "<em>the glorification of violence in our society</em>,"</a> and pointed to violence in games as a reason for America's mass shooting problems. Never mind the fact that several studies have never been able to prove any links between mass shootings and violence in video games, or the fact that games like Halo and Call of Duty are available everywhere in the world, and only in the United States do these mass shooting issues persist.</p>
