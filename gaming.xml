<p>Before jumping into a game of Madden 26, it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with the best players and the top ratings by position. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-madden-26-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a> and previous games, EA determines player ratings by evaluating 43 different attributes for each player, combining them with position-specific weightings, and updating them throughout the season based on real-world performance. There are dedicated employees tasked with analyzing film to make these subjective decisions. </p>



<p>In the 2023/24 season, several players had breakout seasons, while others suffered lackluster campaigns. Based on that data, here are the best offensive and defensive players in Madden 26. </p>

<p>Treasure Tracker also got a Switch 2 upgrade recently</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> has received its weekly update today and this time it adds the soundtrack from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to listen to tracks like the game's title theme, The King of Pyropuff Peak and much more. All up, this album contains a total of <strong>58 tracks</strong> and has a runtime of 1 hour and 46 minutes.</p>
<p>To listen to this soundtrack on the Nintendo Music app, you'll need to have an active Switch Online subscription.</p>

<p>This follows an update to the app last week which added the soundtracks for the Pilotwings series. The app was also recently updated to Version 1.3.0 – adding the ability to use some functions of the app, even without an active Switch Online subscription.</p>
<p>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker was originally released on the Wii U, and was followed up with a 3DS and Switch release. It was also one of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/12-free-switch-2-game-upgrades-are-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">12 free game upgrades</a> released alongside the Switch 2 recently, optimising the game visuals, and adding HDR and GameShare support.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-bloody-love-the-drifter.1267623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Drifter</em> is a new point-and-click adventure game from Powerhoof that I have been <em>very </em>into these past couple of weeks. It’s a game that owes a debt to many influences, all of which end up being a perfect match for this story, genre and, most importantly of all (for me), setting.</p><p>First and most obviously it owes a <em>lot </em>to the Lucasarts adventure games of the 90s, a subgenre that has inspired countless successors and imitators over the decades, but few--if any--that have felt as close to the source as this. Playing <em>The Drifter</em> is like visiting a parallel timeline where Lucasarts never went 3D after <em>Full Throttle</em>, and instead simply iterated on their existing art style over and over and at some point came up with, somehow, an even smarter interface.</p><p>But this is not a breezy adventure with a slapstick pirate and a load of double entendres, nor is it a game content to simply trace over the lines of a 30-year-old genre. <em>The Drifter's</em> own promos say the game draws heavily from "King, Crichton and Carpenter, with a dash of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozploitation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 70s Ozpolitation</a>", and those are all correct. <em>The Drifter </em>has a <em>mood</em>, nailing its self-proclaimed "pulp adventure thriller brief" absolutely, the whole thing dripping with atmospheric lighting and intrigue, a sci-fi noir vibe brought to life by some incredibly <em>cool </em>pixel art and voice acting. </p><p>It also calls itself a fast-paced adventure game, a sentence that makes no sense until you play it, then it makes perfect sense. While in some ways this is a traditional point-and-click adventure game, it's not the type to keep you stuck on a puzzle for 10 hours; between its snappy interface, in-game hints, action sequences (I can't explain these without spoiling a central story element, but just trust me, they work) and relentless pacing, it really does keep moving at a brisk rate, which doesn't just remove a long-standing roadblock with this genre but also helps keep the story zipping along.</p><p>Were this all I wanted to talk about--me taking time out of your day just to say "this is the best Lucasarts homage I've ever played"--I think <em>The Drifter</em> would be worth talking about! Its story of grief, love, murder and monsters plays like you're clicking rapidly through a pulpy graphic novel, and nailing that Lucasarts energy is hard! Those games were magic, making this magic by association!</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Drifter - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CgNrA925M44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But what really got me about <em>The Drifter</em> was how <em>Australian </em>it is. Let me explain:<a href="https://aftermath.site/australian-video-game-list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Australia has enjoyed an indie renaissance over the past decade, a recovery from the dark days of the late 00s/early 2010s when a AAApocalypse closed all of the country's major studios</a>. From <em>Hollow Knight</em> to <em>Crossy Road</em>, <em>Goose Game</em> to <em>Cult of the Lamb</em>, <em>Plucky Squire</em> to <em>Unpacking</em>, many of the best and most important games of the last few years have been developed in Australia.</p><p>And almost none of them have anything to say about living here, or being from here, or just <em>here</em>. That's fine, nobody is obligated to make their game about anything, you can set it whenever and wherever you want. But when you live outside the US, Japan or Europe as a player, you're almost always playing games about other people's homes and other people's stories, and sometimes, just sometimes, I wish there were more video games set a little closer to home.</p><p>Of course the problem here is that even when a game <em>is </em>set here, depictions of Australia in popular culture tend to skew towards a spectrum of caricatures:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max_(2015_video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Mad Max</em></a> on one end, <em>Crocodile Dundee</em> on the other. Which is fine, but also sometimes I just want to play video games where the characters are Australian and they use Australian slang and the game is set here, but that setting doesn’t really doesn't <em>matter</em>, in a way that I would find nice but you (statistically most people reading this are not Australian) could play it and not mind either, the same way I (an Australian) find <em>Yakuza </em>or <em>KRZ </em>interesting.</p><p>(<a href="https://youtu.be/Xt2Rj1FeZgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wayward Strand </em>is a good example of what I’m talking about!<em>)</em></a></p><p><em>The Drifter</em> is very much set here, and has some of the most Australian voice acting I've ever heard in a game, but it's also extremely relaxed about it. Like yeah, this is an Australian video game, but it's not interested in cringe or tropes, desert vistas or kangaroos, it just wants to tell a very cool story that just happens to be set here. This is exactly what I've been after in an Australian game for a while now, so I'm very thankful to have got the chance to play through it here.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-bookshop-impressions"><h3>Recommending Books Is The Best Part Of Tiny Bookshop</h3></a><p>Forget The Lorax, kid; it's time for classic architecture</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/digital-foundry-ign-ziff-davis-eurogamer-patreon"><h3>Good For Digital Foundry</h3></a><p>'We answer to nobody but you, the audience'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia]]></content:encoded>

The announcement was accompanied by a teaser trailer that may give fans of The Witcher some Deja vu.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHH6xQT2-dw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PHH6xQT2-dw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There's no English language audio option for this video, but the closed captioning does offer an English translation of the spoken lines. The woman's name is Myoan, and she's a shaman who performs a violent sacrificial rite with a snake. Woochi is the man who confronts Myoan at her dark shrine before she transforms into a monster before his eyes. Woochi isn't defenseless and the manifestation of his sword is impressive. However, Myoan overpowers Woochi before declaring, "Proclaim it to Heaven, we rise again."</p><p>The game is set durning Korea's Joseon era, and Jeon Woochi is said to be a man "who uses his powers to fight injustice and trick the corrupt." This is a single-player game built with Unreal Engine 5 by developer LoreVault Studio. The announcement notes the dev team is currently consulting experts on Korean literature and traditional music, while also scouting locations that will be used to recreate the period setting of the game. The game's music will be composed by Jung Jae-il, whose previous credits include Squid Game and Parasite.</p><p>Nexon Games hasn't set a release date yet for Woochi the Wayfarer, but it will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

It also has support for local and online multiplayer. There are 40 playable characters with their own unique stats and a slew of unlockables to keep you playing.</p><p>If you already own Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 for Switch (or another console), the new features probably aren't worth the price of admission.

Like the other Sega games for Switch 2, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S is a Game-Key Card, so you'll download the bulk of the game from the eShop when inserting the cartridge for the first time.</p></div>                      </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crkd-gibson-les-paul-wireless-guitar-controllers-consoles-and-pc-buying-guide/1100-6529788/">CRKD's Gibson Les Paul Guitar Controllers Are Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rebuild-of-evangelion-blu-ray-editions-neon-genesis-evangelion-complete-series/1100-6533665/">Two Rebuild Of Evangelion Movies Are Finally Returning To Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-star-wars-3-in-1-clone-wars-mandalorian-adventure-gift-set-walmart-2025/1100-6533571/">New Lego Star Wars Gift Bundle In Stock At Walmart - 3 Sets For $45</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-minecraft-5-in-1-world-explorer-walmart-gift-set-2025/1100-6533572/">Lego Minecraft 5-In-1 Gift Set Up For Grabs For $45 Exclusively At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-deals-limited-edition-restock-guide/1100-6526172/">Rune Factory: Guardians Of Azuma For Switch 2 Gets First Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chonicles-preorder-amazon-exclusive-edition-switch-2-playstation/1100-6532119/">Final Fantasy Tactics Remake Has Free Nintendo Switch 2 Upgrade</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-one-piece-netflix-anime-all-building-sets-available-now/1100-6532155/">Lego One Piece - Going Merry Ship &amp; Six Other Sets Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-lorcana-tcg-reign-of-jafar-palace-heist-cooperative-game-is-steeply-discounted/1100-6531334/">Disney Lorcana TCG Palace Heist Solo And Co-Op Game Is Steeply Discounted</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war/" data-ref-id="5000-20083">Warhammer 40: Dawn of War's</a> original opening cinematic has been remastered a second time in order to restore a "beloved" Space Marine scream that, to the dismay of fans, had been removed the first time around.</p><p dir="ltr">When developer Relic Entertainment first announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remaster-of-one-of-warhammer-40ks-best-games-is-just-a-month-away-with-discount-for-loyal-fans/1100-6533148/" data-ref-id="1100-6533148">August 14 release date for Dawn of War - Definitive Edition</a>--an updated version of the RTS classic that includes features like upscaled unit textures, lighting upgrades, and 4K resolution support--it did so by releasing a new, remastered version of the original's iconic opening cinematic. The CGI trailer shows the Space Marines of the Blood Ravens battling against an Orkish horde in a desperate last stand against all odds.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HiUectTy9Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2HiUectTy9Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It's a well-loved cinematic, largely because at the time it was released in 2004, it was one of the first great looks at the Warhammer 40K universe in action. The remastered cinematic (the first time it was put out) was nearly identical to the original aside from the higher-definition visuals, except for one notable exception--the scream of a Space Marine charging into battle had been removed and replaced with voice over from a different character entirely, that of Blood Ravens Chapter Master Gabriel Angelos.</p><p dir="ltr">That didn't sit well with fans, who complained about the scream's absence and its lore-breaking replacement in the comments for the trailer on YouTube. Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-dev-says-replaced-space-marine-scream-was-even-more-beloved-than-we-realized-as-intro-cinematic-changes-spark-backlash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> amidst the outcry, Relic seemed to have been caught off-guard by upset fans and said the Space Marine's "roar was even more beloved than we realized." Relic then teased it would have "something for OG roar enjoyers soon."</p><p dir="ltr">Now, the remastered cinematic has been uploaded once again, this time with the original audio. The Space Marine's battle cry has been restored to its previous glory, and Dawn of War fans can (hopefully) now rest easy, assured that an iconic part of Warhammer 40K video game history has been properly preserved.</p><p dir="ltr">"We heard you!" the description of the new original audio trailer reads. "We've re-released the enhanced trailer with the original audio. The iconic roar is back to celebrate launch week. Are you ready to serve...again?"</p><p dir="ltr">Dawn of War - Definitive Edition arrives August 14 and will be $30, with "loyal fans" who own the game's previous anniversary edition receiving a 30% discount, putting the price at around $21. The Definitive Edition includes a remastered version of the original game along with all three of the game's expansions, Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm, which each include an additional campaign and fan-favorite factions like the Imperial Guard, Necrons, and the Sisters of Battle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm looking at a map of my city, Kansas City, right now, and wondering what I should do for fun this coming weekend. Should I visit the giant purple Zoroark stomping over downtown? If I want to see the Superman with the glowing red eyes in the suburbs to the south, I first have to pass Ralsei Deltarune sitting atop the highway, smoking an enormous blunt. I could go visit the Northland, but there is an enormous United Airlines plane straddling the Missouri River, which might make transit a bit confusing. Hmm. Options, options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That probably sounded like nonsense if you're not aware of <a href="https://wplace.live/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wplace</a>, a delightful new time waster in the form of a world map where users can draw a single pixel in a color of their choice, wherever they like, once every 30 seconds. If that sounds familiar, you're probably thinking of one of its main inspirations: /r/place, the Reddit game with a blank canvas that let users similarly place one pixel at a time. Though /r/place closed a few years ago, wplace has rapidly gained popularly in the last few days, to the point where just about wherever you live or wherever you look, you can find detailed collaborative drawings, silly graffiti, inside jokes, and more doodled all over the map. And unshockingly, a lot of those doodles are gaming references.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like most people, I checked out my own city first before exploring wplace more widely. Kansas City is indeed covered with gaming characters. At a glance, I can see several Pokemon, characters from Rain World, Deltarune, OneShot, Metroid, Final Fantasy, Mario, Earthbound, Among Us, Angry Birds, and plenty more can be spotted amid the city's roadways and rivers. There are also lots of other pop culture icons, like SpongeBob and various Transformers, sprinkled in with political messages, sports team logos, various flags, location-specific graffiti, and other random doodles. Some people just wrote their names.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/capture-1754943131032.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">wplace at the time this piece was written, hovering over Kansas City</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But KC is far from the most interesting city on wplace.

Despite the various adventurers that call it home and stop to rest at the Yawning Portal Inn, the city and its citizenry find themselves under assault by dangerous and powerful monsters, leaving everyone Horrified. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest rendition of Ravensburger's popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> series, Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons, crosses over with Wizards of the Coast's legendary tabletop RPG. The result is a game that my friends and I thoroughly enjoyed and were eager to play again, despite a few stumbling blocks.</p><div catalogid="d6f233e8-bd4d-4b71-9c36-c72486a907f5" id="226288"><div id="226288" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8jXm?object_uuid=6ec8716a-8fd3-41d4-ae12-392dc5a9d851&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">original Horrified</a> was released back in 2019, and this new Dungeons &amp; Dragons edition is the series’ sixth iteration. The basic premise each game shares is that up to five players work together to vanquish a selection of monsters by racing around the map, collecting resources, escorting civilians to safety, and beating back the monsters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To win, each monster has to be dealt with. But players will lose if the monster deck is depleted or if the terror track ever hits seven (it's raised whenever a citizen is killed, hero is knocked out, or an effect triggers it). The extra fun part is taking out the monsters. How you deal with each monster is unique, with each one having its own sort of mini-game associated with it that players have to work through before they are gone for good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Being <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-dungeons-and-dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> themed, this version of Horrified features some of the most recognizable creatures from its pantheon, including the Displacer Beast, a Mimic, the Beholder, and of course, a big red dragon. As a longtime fan and player of D&amp;D, I was instantly intrigued by the box art and the board – but it was the monsters and how they operate that really drew my friends and me in. The developers really managed to work in how these creatures behave according to D&amp;D lore when designing their challenges.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Red Dragon, for instance, has a treasure you have to claim before you can vanquish it upon its treasure horde. The Mimic, for its part, is hidden and off the board until the party manages to finally reveal it. My favorite, by far, was the Beholder, which requires you to take out its 10 eye tendrils first, before going after its large central eye, each with a unique and powerful effect they could hit you with, dictated by a die roll. And yes, of course, there are dice rolls here; you can’t have Dungeons &amp; Dragons without some sort of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dice-rolling-board-games">dice-rolling goodness</a> involved, and it doesn’t stop with just eye lasers either. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players assume the roles of staple D&amp;D classes, including the Fighter, Rogue, Cleric, Bard, or Wizard. For the most part, each character plays identically, with the exception of their special actions, which require you to roll a 20-sided die (one is included with the game in case you don’t have a small dice horde like yours truly). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That’s just how it goes when you’re rolling d20s.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking your special action can result in one of five possible outcomes, with the various classes behaving differently. For instance, bards can allure other players and citizens towards themselves. The fighter can rush to the nearest monster to do battle, and the cleric helps during monster attacks by letting you re-roll dice. We had some especially funny moments where our resident Wizard teleported the Beholder monster straight to the spot where our cleric just so happened to be – twice in a row. We had a good laugh about that (at least most of us), but that’s just how it goes when you’re rolling d20s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Admittedly, we did homebrew and tweak the cleric a bit, however, allowing her to “stock” her special actions (basically using actions on her turn to hold rolls for actions), allowing her to use her beneficial skills during any monster phase up until her next turn. This lets the character feel more cleric-y, helping her teammates, as opposed to the as-written rules, which only let her use those skills on her turn’s monster phase. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horrified, in general, isn’t an overly complex board game. In my testing, first-time players were usually able to grasp the flow of the game within a turn or two. Taking actions is straightforward, and the monster cards that dictate how many new items are spawned, any events that take place, citizens that appear, and what monsters activate, are equally so. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the wording on how monsters behave caused some confusion and debate, such as whether the mimic monster moved the number of spaces indicacted on the monster card’s movement space, or just a single space when it is activated. But overall, we figured it out (whether our decision was correct or not) and it worked out for us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unique to this version of Horrified is the ability to reduce the terror track, which gives players a hand, pushing them further back from defeat. This is done whenever a monster is defeated, and I found it to be a great addition to use – especially when first introducing new players to the game, as Horrified games can be a bit challenging and require strategy to win. I also appreciate that it is easy enough <em>not</em> to use, so Horrified veterans can simply ignore this feature if they find it lessens the challenge too much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One aspect that I am a bit disappointed by with Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is its small pool of monsters you can pick from. With “easy” games asking players to pick from two monsters and the standard challenge requiring three, it means you'll be replaying these monsters frequently. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other versions featured six or seven monsters, with only the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbBNw?object_uuid=6ec8716a-8fd3-41d4-ae12-392dc5a9d851&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cthulu-themed Horrified</a> offering just four monsters. And with so many other classic D&amp;D monsters left on the table, it’s a shame we couldn’t have gotten a couple more in the box. Where are my Gelatinous Cubes and Owlbears, or heck, throw something wild like Vecna, the terrifying Lich, into the mix. I can only hope that Ravensburger adds more monsters or classes with future expansions.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/92xB1E?object_uuid=6ec8716a-8fd3-41d4-ae12-392dc5a9d851&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Target</a><em></em></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 11, 2025 9:42 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is one of those games that I find easy to recommend to anyone who enjoys the tabletop RPG and even has an inclination to play board games. It does a wonderful job blending the realms of the Horrified and D&amp;D worlds together for a fun game night title that is approachable but offers avenues for strategy and cooperation. For fans of Horrified, if the idea of a new random dice rolling element doesn’t turn you off, I think you will have a great time with this new iteration as well. It’s more Horrified, after all.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/horrified-dungeons-and-dragons-is-a-scary-good-time]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The head of the biggest gaming site in the world is leaving the company at the end of August, <em>Kotaku</em> has learned. John Davison, who has been <em>IGN</em>‘s publisher since joining back in 2019, told staff on Monday it was time for “the next chapter.” The high-profile departure comes shortly after a big round of layoffs that saw multiple departments across the company impacted.</p> <p>Arriving just months before the start of the 2020 pandemic, Davison’s tenure at <em>IGN</em> saw the site expand into events like <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-and-sega-among-publishers-appearing-at-ign-live">IGN Live</a> and a market analytics platform called <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-launches-gaming-trends-platform-shedding-light-on-how-mobile-roblox-and-more-are-reshaping-the-industry">Gaming Trends</a>. Under parent-company Ziff Davis, <em>IGN</em> also made a massive acquisition last year in the form of the Gamer Network, a suite of European-facing gaming sites like <em>Eurogamer</em>, <em>VG247</em>, and <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em>. Many of those sites were hit with mass layoffs at the time of the deal, and <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> was gutted. One of the most valuable parts of that package, <em>Digital Foundry</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/digital-foundry-df-direct-ign-patreon-retro-games-media-2000616308">announced just last week</a> that it had purchased all outstanding equity to allow it to leave<em> IGN</em> and go fully independent.</p> <p>Davison, whose 25+ years in games media include stints at <em>EGM</em>, <em>Official PlayStation Magazine</em>, and <em>GameSpot</em>, will be leaving<em> IGN</em> at a time when its future trajectory has never been more uncertain. A reporting, news, and features operation that expanded under previous EIC Tina Amini has suffered cuts in recent years due to multiple rounds of layoffs and buyouts. Amini, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-editor-in-chief-tina-amini-steps-down">who left in 2022 and now works at Xbox</a>, was never replaced. Davison reported to Ziff Davis president of gaming and entertainment Yael Prough, and it’s not yet clear if the parent company plans on backfilling his role.</p>

 <p>Davison and <em>IGN</em> did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p><em>IGN</em> laid off over a dozen staff earlier this month, which included approximately 12 percent members in its editorial union. “The company has told us that the reason for this layoff stems from a Ziff Davis mandate to cut costs despite several quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue increases, to which IGN Entertainment responded by coming for our members’ jobs,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ignunion.bsky.social/post/3lvm4rhup5k2a">the IGN Creators Guild wrote at the time</a>. “This is perplexing to us, as we are told again and again that IGN Entertainment has had a tremendously successful year thus far thanks to their hard work.”</p> <p>“It’s been an honor to work alongside such talented, passionate people, and I’m deeply proud of what we’ve accomplished together,” Davison wrote in a message to staff today. “I’m excited for what comes next.”</p>

This new update adds the "Mesa" biome to the game, which temporarily replaces the Alpine biome, and will eventually go into rotation alongside it. Where the Alpine level was a chilly place with freezing winds and icy rocks, the Mesa is a sun-baked little world where sunscreen and umbrellas aren't just a suggestion but a requirement to survive. This new biome has it all: cactuses, tumbleweeds, a deadly sun, and tornadoes that will send you flying.</p><p>This new update has more people playing today than any time since Peak launched (per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3527290/charts/#1m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>), so this quick fix will be appreciated by many fans and newcomers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A <a href="https://kotaku.com/league-legends-riot-games-worlds-23-interview-1851071665"><em>League of Legends</em></a> player who claimed to have built a career around boosting accounts and selling them replied angrily on social media to a developer at Riot Games. He was worried about how he would make money now. The dev’s response was a link to McDonalds’ careers page.</p> <p>On August 11, <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-banning-bots-boosters-and-more-in-2025/?_gl=1*dgamq1*_gcl_au*MTU3NTAxOTczNy4xNzU0OTQ2Nzkw*_ga*MTM2MDIzODkzMS4xNzU0OTQ2Nzkw*_ga_FXBJE5DEDD*czE3NTQ5NDY3OTAkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTQ5NDY3OTEkajU5JGwwJGgw">Riot Games announced plans</a>&nbsp;to ramp up its efforts to fight back against smurf and alt account misuse in <em>League of Legends,</em> one of the biggest MOBAs on the planet. These new plans include banning and punishing people who grind on accounts owned by other players, boosting their rank in the process, and charging a fee for doing so. These services have <a href="https://insaneboost.gg/">become quite common online.</a> Even <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670">Elon Musk admitted to using one such service</a> in <em>Path of Exile II.</em> But Riot is cracking down and banning accounts associated with the practice. These changes will begin in <em>LoL</em> update 25.18 and will likely lead to players being far more cautious about paying others to boost their rank in<em> League of Legends</em>. That will lead to fewer customers for those offering such “services,” and one of these people wasn’t happy about that news.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://x.com/cat1_alex/status/1954924168245358742?">Twitter user SLS replied to Riot’s Director of Product Drew Levin</a>, and explained that their “main income” comes primarily from boosting other players’ accounts in <em>League of Legends</em>. They also coach players in the free-to-play MOBA, but admitted that this only earned them about 15 percent of what they make boosting in a month. They wrapped up their comment with: “What I do after? [sic] Just chill at McDonald’s?” Levin reshared the post and included a link to McDonald’s careers page, seemingly joking that it was time for SLS to find a new job.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/Ku080U0fB4">https://t.co/Ku080U0fB4</a> <a href="https://t.co/7JgyjgOpJF">https://t.co/7JgyjgOpJF</a></p> <p>— Drew Levin (@drewlevin) <a href="https://twitter.com/drewlevin/status/1954931160469114915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Bro, you do understand that you have built a business off of ruining other people’s games, right?” <a href="https://x.com/drewlevin/status/1954926308049494207">replied Levin</a>. “[I] have no desire to preserve that at the expense of whatever lobbies you’re boosting accounts through.”</p> <p>When SLS replied to that message with a complaint that the boosting industry wasn’t hurting the game and that boosters take specific orders related to very high ranks, Levin replied again, this time pointing out how absurd it was that SLS was describing breaking how the game ranks players as an “industry.”</p> <p>“‘The industry?’ ‘Taking orders?’ Bro you are paid to trick our skill evaluation systems, and you are talking to the person leading the effort to improve their integrity,” <a href="https://x.com/drewlevin/status/1954930709510168878">said Levin on social media</a>.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Riot Games about the response.</p> <p>While some players who relied on boosting or liked smurfing–which is when a high-level player creates a new account to use their skills against low-level players–were upset about the changes, the vast majority of the replies to Levin were happy to hear Riot Games was taking alt account abuse seriously in 2025. Of course, it remains to be seen if Riot Games can actually weed out all the boosters and smurf accounts from <em>League of Legends</em> and how quickly people find ways around their new efforts.</p> <p>Also, it should be noted that working at McDonald’s, like any other fast food joint, is a very hard job that requires incredible amounts of patience and stamina. It would be nice if we could all stop acting like people who work at these places are lazy teens working a summer job for beer money or whatever. If that cultural shift were to happen, perhaps they’d have a better shot at getting paid more. And don’t you think the people making your food deserve more money? I do.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh no, the latest World of Warcraft patch has us teaming up with an evil cosmic void being who has tried to kill us many times already and will <em>definitely</em> stab us in the back later...but we're all kind of okay with it? Partially because we have no choice but also because she's hot and sarcastic?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm talking about Xal'atath. You know, this lady. <strong>Heads up, I'm going to talk in this article about spoilers for World of Warcraft: The War Within leading up to the events in Patch 11.2, Ghosts of K'aresh that dropped last Tuesday.</strong> If you haven't started playing the patch yet and don't want to know what's happening, maybe don't keep reading.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/the-war-within-official-cinematic-shadows-beneath-world-of-warcraft-2-17-screenshot-1754926715062.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you're a lapsed World of Warcraft player, you might know this lady if you've dipped in as recently as World of Warcraft: Legion. Xal'atath first appeared in that expansion in the form of a dagger artifact weapon wielded by Shadow Priests, which would occasionally whisper creepy evil stuff to them about N'Zoth and the Old Gods and all that malarky. At the time, <em>some</em> folks grew rather fond of her unsettling whispers, even affectionately referring to her as "knaifu". The dagger, with the rest of the expansion's artifact weapons, was used to drain the corruption from the giant sword that Sargeras stuck in the planet at the end of the expansion. Normal stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we naively thought we wouldn't hear from Xal'atath ever again, what was once one weapon among a giant stack of them turned out to be hugely plot-relevant. Xal'atath was passed around from place to place in the interim expansions, finally regaining her power and emerging from the dagger in the form of a void-infused high elf, all the better to corrupt people with. She bopped around Azeroth for a while, manipulating the underground giant bug people and some dragons before she finally made herself known as something called the "Harbinger of Dimensius," basically a herald of a super powerful void lord bent on destroying reality. Again, normal stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the start of our current expansion, The War Within, Xal'atath appears to be the main villain. She opens the expansion by causing the destruction of Dalaran (again), and she's responsible for the events that lead us to fighting both the Nerubians and the goblin Gallywix. She's spent a lot of time popping up here and there and taunting our ally Alleria Windrunner, she nearly kills Khadgar, and she's obsessed with this void artifact she's been carrying around called the Dark Heart, which she keeps using to corrupt and empower and manipulate. All of this is to say, she seems pretty evil to me! She serves the void and is clearly very interested in destroying us, our buddies, and probably all of Azeroth! Nothing she has done so far seems good, at all!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>And yet.</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In patch 11.2, Xal'atath <em>joins us.</em> The short explanation is that she actually betrayed Dimensius in the past, but he's coming back, and he's probably pissed off at her. If he shows up, she's done for. Out of a sense of self-preservation, she's been trying to beef up the Dark Heart to <em>stop</em> his return rather than accelerate it, and was messing around with the Nerubians and the Goblins in an effort to get that done. But at the end of patch 11.1, she accidentally (and sort of stupidly) loses the Dark Heart, forcing her to team up with Alleria and the player as a back-up plan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What this actually means, in practice, is that Xal'atath follows us around while questing and occasionally proposes we do things that sound horrible and dangerous, like turn ourselves into an energy being and fill someone with void energy so they can hear the planet sing to them (normal stuff!). But, you know, we can't stop Dimensius without her. She knows his weaknesses, and is pretty much the only path to getting close enough to him to do something about his encroachment. So the murdery knife-elf gets to come along.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/capture-1754938789710.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mkdb1y/tone_matters_magni/">https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mkdb1y/tone_matters_magni/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing is, Blizzard has done such a lovely job writing Xal'atath, and Claudia Christian does such a great job voicing her, that most players are...kind of enjoying her presence. The first few days of the new patch last week saw the community subreddit flooded with cheeky, obsessive posts about Xal'atath. Sure, she's evil, but apart from being gorgeous, she's also clever, funny, powerful, and dare I say, kind of sultry? Her banter with the player is almost flirtateous at times, referring to us again and again as "my champion", while simultaneously reminding us that she could snuff us out on a whim. She spends a <em>lot</em> of time needling Alleria Windrunner and, as the ever-wise Ve'nari puts it, "floating around and making sarcastic remarks." And irritatingly enough, she's also correct a lot of the time about the behaviors and motivations of the other people who claim to be Alleria's allies (looking at you, Locus-Walker) and the ways in which they aren't exactly behaving righteously, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Love for Xal'atath has reached such a point that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mkv7jh/mommy_xalatath_addon/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">someone even made a mod (add-on) for World of Warcraft</a> that has Xal'atath whisper praise to the player every time they exit a combat scenario...though notably in these messages, Xal'atath refers to herself as "mommy". So download that at your own risk, I guess.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, this lady is <em>definitely</em> going to turn on us. And while plenty of players are enjoying the twist of her temporary allegiance and the opportunity to get to know her a little better, others are (rightfully!) recognizing that Xal'atath is definitely a hot mess we're going to regret partying with sooner or later:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/capture-1754939255090.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj3014/the_story_so_far/">https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj3014/the_story_so_far/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an interesting move by Blizzard to build Xal'atath up for, technically, five expansions, introduce her as the <em>seemingly</em> big bad of this one, only to form an alliance of convenience in the final act of The War Within with the promise that she's definitely going to keep on being evil in future expansions. With Xal'atath's dark and void theming, it seems likely she might play a major role in the next expansion, Midnight, which will be fully revealed at Gamescom in just a few weeks. The long game Blizzard's playing here is especially potent given that some of its other storylines that similar took several expansions of setup did not go over so well, such as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23015539/world-of-warcraft-sylvanas-windrunner-story-explainer-battle-for-azeroth-shadowlands-novel/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whatever was going on with Sylvanas and the Jailer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, trust Knaifu at your own risk, and enjoy her while you can. Manaforge Omega, the new raid, opens tomorrow and will bring with it another chapter of The War Within's story as we inch closer to the Midnight reveal and what I can only assume is Xal'atath's inevitable re-betrayal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675129">Madden NFL 26</a> features dozens of different celebrations that your players can perform after making a big play on the field. From scoring a touchdown to recording an interception to just making a first down, you'll be able to celebrate quite often during a game. However, you first have to know what buttons to press to be able to celebrate and which celebrations you have access to, depending on what kind of play you made.</p><p>Below, we'll go over all of the available celebrations in Madden 26, how to perform them, and when you can perform each one.</p><h2>How to perform celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Before we get into each celebration offered in Madden 26, how do you perform one after you make a big play? Fortunately, it's fairly simple.</p><p>After you score a touchdown, intercept a pass, or make a first down, look at the bottom left corner of your screen. You'll see a "Celebrate" icon appear, and you can press a specific button combination after it appears to perform a celebration. You want to make sure you press the celebration buttons quickly, though, as the icon doesn't stay on the screen for too long.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548149" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548149"></a><figcaption>The Celebration icon appears in the bottom-left corner of the screen</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg"></figure><p>Once the icon disappears, your celebration window has passed, and you'll have to wait for the next big play to celebrate.</p><h2>All celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Now that you know what to look for before you celebrate, let's go over all of the celebrations and the buttons to press to perform each one.</p><p>As we mentioned before, you can celebrate after scoring a touchdown, intercepting a pass, or making a first down. There are specific celebrations you can perform after each of these big plays. This means you can only use certain celebrations after scoring a touchdown, and those celebrations aren't available after intercepting a pass or making a first down.</p><p>All three of the big play types in Madden 26 have their own celebrations with unique button combinations, so you have to remember which celebrations correlate with each play. You'll also have to remember the buttons to press to perform the celebration you want.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548150" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548150"></a><figcaption>Some of the TD celebrations in Madden 26</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg"></figure><p>Below, we've separated the different categories of celebrations and listed the button combinations for each one in Madden 26:</p><p><strong>All Touchdown celebrations </strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Point to Fans</td><td>Right Stick (RS) Up</td></tr><tr><td>Step Back on Em</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Griddy</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Salute</td><td>RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Reach Low Flex</td><td>L2/LT + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Shake With It</td><td>L2/LT + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Wavy Walk</td><td>L2/LT + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>He's a Dawg</td><td><p>L2/LT + RS Left</p></td></tr><tr><td>Stand on Biz</td><td>L1/LB + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Afterburners</td><td>L1/LB + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Spike</td><td>L1/LB + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Two-Step Shuffle</td><td>L1/LB + RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Headstand</td><td>R2/RT + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Run Up Flex</td><td>R2/RT + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Fancy Flip</td><td><p>R2/RT + RS Down</p></td></tr><tr><td>All Together Now</td><td>R2/RT + RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Candy Karate</td><td>R1/RB + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Wait For It</td><td>R1/RB + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Shake Em Up</td><td>R1/RB + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>At the Y</td><td>R1/RB + RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>All Interception celebrations</strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wave Goodbye</td><td>RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Why You Throwing My Way</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Strapped</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Head Swag</td><td>RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>All First Down celebrations </strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Signal It</td><td>RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Touch Em Up</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Jacked</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Shake It Off</td><td>RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can view all of these celebrations by pressing pause during the middle of a game or training session and selecting the "Celebrations" tab.</p><h2>How to perform Hot Spot Celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Finally, Madden 26 has also introduced Hot Spot Celebrations, which give you more freedom in how your player celebrates after a touchdown.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548151" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548151"></a><figcaption>Performing a touchdown celebration</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg"></figure><p>Hot Spot Celebrations work by giving you time to move your player after they've scored a touchdown. During this time, you can move your player to certain parts of the endzone to have them interact with specific elements of the field. There are a few different zones throughout the endzone, and moving to each zone will result in a new celebration.</p><p>For example, running to the field goal post will make your player interact with it, while running to one side of the endzone sees your player get the crowd involved. You only have a few seconds to move your player after they've scored a touchdown if you want to use a Hot Spot Celebration, so make your movements count.</p>

              <p>OpenAI launched its long-awaited <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/">AI update, GPT-5,</a> on August 7. It made lofty promises like “PhD‑level intelligence.” But within 24 hours, the tool’s most devoted users were cataloging its many bugs, errors, and shortcomings on Reddit. The ChatGPT fandom <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkobei/openai_just_pulled_the_biggest_baitandswitch_in/">started melting down</a>. CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1953893841381273969">responded</a> by promising to let customers start using the older GPT models again. By August 11, Altman was in <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1954703747495649670">full screencap apology</a> mode trying to cauterize the flow of bad vibes.</p> <p>“If you have been following the GPT-5 rollout, one thing you might be noticing is how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models,” he posted on X earlier today. “It feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology (and so suddenly deprecating old models that users depended on in their workflows was a mistake).”</p> <p>The tenor of this self-inflicted debacle should be familiar to anyone who’s played <em>Destin</em>y, <em>World of Warcraft</em>, or dozens of other online multiplayer games. It’s the same mix of developer hubris, corporate profit motive, hyper fandom, and “<a href="https://x.com/dril/status/660644922744262656?lang=en">Sorry. Im sorry. Im trying to remove it</a>.” An upcoming expansion is sold with lofty promises. It arrives full of half-baked ideas and stealth nerfs. Players encounter a surprising number of bugs. Meanwhile the prices in the microtransaction shop are going up and the places where you can earn rewards for free are disappearing.</p>

 <p>“This guy communicates in a way that is indistinguishable from a community manager of a live service video game having a botched expansion release,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/catharsis23.bsky.social/post/3lw5jvotgfk2s">wrote</a> one Bluesky user in response. “Seems kind of humiliating.” Vocal AI critic Ed Zitron, who pegged GPT-5 as <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittification-of-generative-ai/">generative AI’s enshittification moment</a>, was more direct. “This is the ultimate folly of OpenAI: they engaged gamer-like hype, got gamer-like fandom, and now face the wrath of gamer-like hate,” he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/edzitron.com/post/3lw5k3nkztc2r">wrote</a> today.</p> <p>The GTP-5 fiasco <a href="https://gizmodo.com/it-took-just-24-hours-of-complaints-for-openai-to-start-bringing-back-its-old-model-2000640912">revolved around a few main issues</a>. While it was promised as another big leap in the model’s capabilities, what really seemed to be going on was that it was just routing queries to lots of different models to save time and money. There was also a very limiting cap on the number of queries users outside of the most expensive plans could make each week. Finally, there was the disappearances of GPT-4o, one of OpenAI’s most popular models which also <a href="https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/">had a reputation for being</a> “sycophantic.”</p> <p>“ChatGPT psychosis” is one of the biggest concerns with the billion-dollar cash-burning enterprise right now. Chat bots can suck users into “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html">delusional spirals</a>” with them. People are reportedly being <a href="https://futurism.com/commitment-jail-chatgpt-psychosis">involuntarily committed or jailed</a> after becoming obsessed with their GPT interactions. One guy thought he had trained his AI to become self-aware and that <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-spiritual-delusions-destroying-human-relationships-1235330175/">it was talking to God for him</a>.</p>

 <p>Altman clearly thinks this aspect of ChatGPT can be harmful in the wrong hands. But many of the people currently paying for ChatGPT also clearly prefer it. And he’s spent so long packaging OpenAI’s platform-shift moonshot as a grand cosmic journey everyone’s on together that dialing down the snake oil is no longer an option. After years of hyping AGI (artificial general intelligence), Altman told Wall Street last week that it’s actually “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/11/sam-altman-says-agi-is-a-pointless-term-experts-agree.html?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=689a05a3778386000185beda&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_content=main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky">not a super useful term</a>.”</p> <p>This is the part in the live-service hype cycle where studios usually go from talking about how their game is completely transformative and unlike anything else you’ve ever played before to offering very in-the-weeds explanations of why patch notes that are impossible for outsiders to parse will overhaul the game into the best version of the thing you already love. The players, who have invested not just their money and free time but also no small chunk of their identity in how your product makes them feel will now become like the dinosaurs at Jurassic Park. They are not trapped in your hyper-complex, infinitely monetizable skinner box. You are trapped in whatever they insist on perverting it into. Even if that’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/i-feel-like-im-going-crazy-chatgpt-fuels-delusional-spirals-ae5a51fc?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiqx4e9RsfPVEG8-vSVaF26bdgC8kiLYXSykv1hX5M3kzc2lNInkty8wQyYn5o%3D&amp;gaa_ts=689a6287&amp;gaa_sig=w891GxyjybddGBhS316rMpTsfH3domwnKveQDIM4DMGXW47JE1c4U4x30cETuWVawzdNGNzebYIZi-hOBA5Rcw%3D%3D">an expensive rabbit hole full of apocalyptic conspiracies</a>.</p>

                <p>From the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption franchises to the 2K sports titles, Take-Two Interactive has some of the most-desirable games in the industry. However, the company has largely kept its marquee titles away from Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus. Now, Take-Two President Karl Slatoff has explained why the company hasn't embraced lending more of its games to subscription services.</p><p>"We do put our titles occasionally into some of the subscription services," Slatoff said earlier this month during a Take-Two investor call (via <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/08/07/take-two-ttwo-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Motley Fool</a>). "They're great partners for us. And in many cases, they're great ... We wouldn't do it unless it was a good economic deal. The platforms wouldn't do it either. So we do take advantage of that, and it's been compelling much from an economic standpoint. As it relates to NBA, we have done it in the past. We don't really talk about whether we're gonna do anything in the future. But when you do put something into a channel like that, it generates obviously, engagement. It generates income for us. And it's something that we consider, and we do it if the time is right, if the math makes sense."</p><p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has previously weighed in on the subject by stating that it doesn't make sense <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-doesnt-want-new-games-on-game-pass/1100-6494686/" data-ref-id="1100-6494686">to put any of the company's new titles on Game Pass or PS Plus</a>. He also said that high-profile day-one games like Call of Duty <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">will only drive up Game Pass subscriptions for a short period of time</a>.</p><p>Raccoon Logic studio head Alex Hutchinson recently argued that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-who-launched-game-into-game-pass-warns-against-launching-games-into-game-pass/1100-6532306/" data-ref-id="1100-6532306">launching titles day one on Game Pass can devalue games</a> and hurt the industry. Hutchinson has first-hand experience with the subject: Raccoon Logic launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/revenge-of-the-savage-planet/" data-ref-id="5000-640444">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> as a day one title earlier this year, and the company didn't get the response it hoped for.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-anime-critics-at-ign-navigate-the-complex-score-obsessed-discourse.1267494/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><figure><figcaption><span>IGN/David Production/Aftermath</span></figcaption></figure></p></div><div><p>Colloquially, an IGN review has become more than just a critique—it’s a meme, a lightning rod for online discourse, and a battleground. This is especially true in the anime space, where numerical scores are treated less as subjective assessments and more like declarations of war, with fandoms accusing them of rage engagement clicks.&nbsp;</p><p>For the critics who decide these scores, the backlash often spills into their mentions and DMs on social media platforms. In 2025, reviewing anime isn’t just about evaluating a show’s artistic merit; it’s about weighing whether a writer can survive the fallout of a fandom’s fury should a show’s premiere and season finale not vibe with them. I spoke with stalwart IGN freelance reviewers <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/rgmotamayor/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rafael Motamayor</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/SiddhantAdlakha/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siddhant Adlakha</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/kircarey/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirsten Carey</a> to debunk misconceptions about reviews of popular anime and animated works for one of gaming’s biggest publications.&nbsp;</p><h2>What makes a 10/10 anime?</h2><p>IGN is quite transparent about the criteria that determine its numerical scores. The site has <a href="https://corp.ign.com/review-practices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">examples of its review scale</a> and what qualifies a video game, TV show, or movie as unbearable, painful, awful, bad, mediocre, okay, good, great, amazing, or a masterpiece. Since the scores range from one to 10, people online often compare them to school grades out of 100, where a seven—commonly joked about as a typical pub score—is seen as a C-grade, failing to realize it still indicates a good rating.&nbsp;</p><p>Other readers have taken it upon themselves to use the rubric to compare IGN’s scores to each other, aiming to determine whether one work is better than another. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/ddwqbj/ign_has_never_rated_a_mystery_dungeon_game_above/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most popular meme </a>involves people comparing new reviews to <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/most-hated-game-imagine-party-babyz-meme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN’s score for <em>Imagine Party Babyz</em></a>.</p><figure><blockquote><p>It’s also difficult to give something a 10 that isn’t over.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Contrary to the idea that IGN randomly selects writers to review superhero shows and anime, writers must pitch to IGN’s editor, explaining their expertise and familiarity with the medium or source material, to let editors know their critique comes from an informed place.</p><p>I asked Motamayor, Adlakha, and Carey what they look for in the rarely awarded masterpiece, or 10, IGN review score.&nbsp;</p><p>“Whether or not it accomplishes what the show is trying to do from the beginning,” Motamayor said. “Different shows are trying to do different things. Not every show is trying to be serious, dramatic, [or] epic. But whether or not the goal of the show is&nbsp; accomplished and whether or not it does something unique for the tone, genre, or the space in which the show occupies.”</p><p>“For me, it’s a combination of how ambitious something is versus how well it executes that ambition,” Adlakha said. “If a particular episode has a high bar for what it’s going for—whether it’s visually, emotionally, or thematically—and if it’s able to stir up emotions in a successful way using the tools of the medium, that for me makes it a successful episode.”</p><p>“A 10 out of 10 anime would be gorgeously animated, and this is my own bias, preferably 2D animation, and if it’s CG, <em>Spider-Verse</em> levels with immaculate artistic choices with a good story, characters,” Carey said. “No weird sexism or anti-LGBTQ stuff happening that makes little flags go up in my brain. The difference between a nine and a 10, for lack of a better word, is an X factor. When people look back on that review 10 years from now, if the internet is still around, that will age well.”</p><p>Save for the final season of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/attack-on-titan-series-finale-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Attack on Titan</em></a>, which Motamayor reviewed, contemporary anime has yet to get a masterpiece, or 10, rating.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s also difficult to give something a 10 that isn’t over,” Carey said. “Most anime coming out right now, you’re just reviewing the first couple of episodes. How can you give the beginning of something a 10 unless it's the most incredible opening to a thing you’ve ever seen? I guess I would give the first episode of <em>Attack on Titan</em> a 10 because that’s an iconic hook. But it’s tough to give the beginning of a thing, or an unfinished thing, a perfect score because we don’t know how it’s gonna end.”</p><p>IGN is often misperceived as a hegemonic entity when it comes to its numerical review scores, especially in the anime genre, rather than focusing on individual reviewers with varying tastes. While using a numerical score is, for better or worse, a convenient summary and a core part of <a href="https://store.ign.com/collections/ign-review-tees?srsltid=AfmBOooTf0jAEjS9bFZHJap628H--WUgDG5rLi8yNgfQMR1AhEO6K0XY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN’s identity</a> as a media outlet, reviewers are divided on their opinions of these scores and whether they capture or oversimplify the nuances of an anime.&nbsp;</p><p>“I start by figuring out the number, and then write the review in a way to justify it. That helps me structure things,” Carey said. “The way that I worry about it flattening is if the number review is gonna make it seem like I like [a show] less than I do. Even if something is a six, that’s still ‘Okay.’ I enjoy the structure of how the number comes at the end, so you’re working up to the reveal, even though I know a lot of people who just scroll down to see what the number is. I’ve done that on other people’s reviews.”</p><p>“I have mixed feelings on numerical scores because I think on one hand they can be a representative shorthand of what someone feels about something that can be a helpful guide,” Adlakha said. “But I think the way it’s interpreted a lot of the time—whether it’s a score out of 10 or five stars on a film-centric website, I think people see that as the end-all of criticism. [Readers will] look at what the score is and not even read what you’ve written and treat it as an attempt at objectivity, and then they tend to clash with you on that.”</p><p>“I do not like numerical scores at all,” Motamayor said. “It definitely boils [a review] down. It makes it a shortcut for people to just read a score and ignore everything else.”</p><p>Granted, IGN provides numerous ways for readers to access short versions of reviews, accompanied by verdicts and blurbs that characterize its numerical rating, but even still, Motamayor finds that people “just ignore that and go straight for the score.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Charlie Goes Into An IGN Anime Review Rabbit Hole | MoistCr1tikal" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dAGvgWGJuCY?start=434&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Adlakha pointed out that readers often blame a single reviewer as the scapegoat for poor reviews of shows whenever online discussions become heated. In their frustration, audiences frequently overlook that their “this you” quote retweets of recent IGN reviews come from completely different reviewers. Even when confronted with this, some audiences will counter, believing that IGN has a mandate from on high dictating reviews be contrarian.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I’ve received gore for not liking one episode of a show.</p></blockquote></figure><p>This misperception appears to stem from an idea about how YouTube works, where a positive or negative review depends on whether the creator's check clears, implying that it is akin to a paid advertisement. This assumption ignores the fact that review writers are paid a <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fixed rate</a> regardless of whether the review is positive or negative.&nbsp;</p><p>“The idea that there are [pay difference between a positive or negative review] is straight up conspiratorial, and it's such a prevalent thing when it comes to the mistrust of critics and journalism at large that I don't really know what to do about it,” Adlakha said. “Even addressing it seems to lead to even more pushback, but it's also one of many conspiratorial accusations.”</p><p>“People have told me ‘You're just trying to be contrarian,’ but usually when I review something, there is no overarching opinion for me to be contrarian towards. There is no public opinion. There's no critical opinion just yet because usually the stuff is reviewed in advance,” Adlakha continued. “Even if I have these amazing psychic powers to predict what the public opinion on something is going to be, being contrarian in that sense would just lead to me being harassed nonstop, which has happened many, many times over reviews. Being intentionally contrarian has no advantages for me, and I don't know what people think [negative reviews] do.”</p><figure><figcaption>Demon Slayer<span></span><span>ufotable</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Rocking the fandom boat</h2><p>Writing reviews for highly anticipated anime often sparks controversy when a critique doesn't portray a beloved source material’s adaptation positively for fans. This is especially true in shonen anime and superhero shows. IGN’s tendency to exclusively cover big-name anime in a given season—all typically shonen—also comes with more eyes on its anime coverage as well as more scrutiny from audience expectations of a writer reviewing one of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-harassment-comes-with-the-territory-of-translating-popular-manga-2000556430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anime’s most popular (and toxic) genres</a>. Although Adlakha reviews superhero and superhero animated shows, he encounters a similar phenomenon with backlash on his reviews for popular shows, similar to what Carey and Motamayor experience with their reviews of popular shonen anime.</p><p>“It’s fine to have an opinion that runs counter to what a critic is saying, but in the particular case of superhero stuff, especially superhero animated stuff, it’s people who will track you down on any and every possible social media—including LinkedIn—and will just send you the nastiest stuff unprompted,” Adlakha said. “I’ve received gore for not liking one episode of a show. It tends to get really uncomfortable.”&nbsp;</p><p>The writers I talked to have become public enemies in IGN readership circles for writing less favorable reviews, which consistently make them the main characters of anime Twitter discourse for several days after their reviews are published. Adlakha and Motamayor are more infamous within IGN’s pool of freelance critics whenever they appear on IGN’s masthead because of their past review scores for popular series like <em>Demon</em> <em>Slayer</em>, <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>, and <em>Invincible</em>. For clarity, Motamayor rated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/demon-slayer-season-4-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Demon Slayer</em> Season 4</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jujutsu-kaisen-season-2-part-2-review-shibuya-incident-arc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> Shibuya Incident Arc</a> a four and a six, respectively. Meanwhile, Adlakha rated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-season-3-review-prime-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Invincible</em> Season 3</a> a seven.</p><p>“Specifically, when it comes to shonen anime, my reviews on<em> Demon Slayer</em>—and to be fair—you can <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/demon-slayer/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see my reviews going down with time</a> as, in my opinion, the show got progressively worse,” said Motamayor.</p><p>Just like how a series can fluctuate from season to season, the same can happen with its coverage—especially when different reviewers take the reins. That was the case with <em>Demon Slaye</em>r, which Carey initially reviewed at the beginning of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-to-the-hashira-training-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hashira Arc</a> before Motamayor stepped in.</p><p>“I disagree hard with the final review, which goes against anyone thinking that IGN reviewers are a monolith,” Carey said.</p><p>“There is a tendency, specifically with IGN, to generalize not only a reviewer's opinion based on a single review but the entire website and the entire staff as a singular mindset or opinion,” Motamayor said. “In my case, when things like my <em>Demon Slayer</em> review become a point of discourse among certain groups, then they start looking at my reviews to prove their point. Other than those specific cases, ideals seem to be generalizing IGN as a single entity.”</p><p>“It comes down to people seeing a score and then working backwards from there as to what your opinion might be or what your intentions might be without actually reading what you have to say. There’s not much I can do about that if someone’s unwilling to engage with what I’m saying in good faith,” Adlakha said.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Attack on Titan<span></span><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p>Adlakha compared the phenomenon to a kind of cult within the readership that would message him about qualifying a show with a seven or eight IGN score as a “meme score.”</p><p>“I’m not gonna unpack what that means,” Adlakha said. “You live in your own world where a number out of 10 tells you something more than just what someone’s opinion might be. I think it’s gone to this almost fringe point. I can’t even begin to reverse engineer what any of it might mean,” Adlakha said. “It’s like the GIF of Donald Glover in <em>Community </em>walking into that room that’s on fire. It feels like I’ve walked into something that there’s some kind of ongoing conversation within this in-group who, through confirmation bias, convinced themselves that reviews on IGN are specifically designed to piss them off. If they’ve collectively decided that nothing I say is going to penetrate that, then I don’t see a point in engaging with it.”</p><p>Much of the discourse backlash that comes Motamayor’s way comes from manga readers rather than anime watchers. “I don’t want to generalize all anime fans, but a lot of the louder commenters, specifically on IGN’s website and social media, very much focus on a show being good because of the source material,” Motamayor said. Although many commenters end up agreeing with what Motamayor might say in a review, especially on points he’s less enthusiastic about, like fights in <em>JJK</em> being too long and convoluted, they eventually return to the consensus that he’s wrong because the anime and manga are popular.</p><p>“A lot of the engagement seems to be based on reputation rather than the actual artistic value of a show or a movie,” Motamayor said. “Another big part of it is boiling down the show to the fight scenes. If a reviewer finds issues with things other than the fight scenes, it doesn’t matter because the fight scenes, in some anime fans’ opinions, are the only thing that matters.”</p><div><p>Because of this shonen rule of cool, Motamayor says some groups of viewers can excuse almost anything in a critique, but once the focus shifts to an anime’s action—and the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/netflix-animation-anime-interview-power-house-sam-deats-adam-deats-david-how-2000517324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difference between special effects compositing and animation</a>—readers tend to have issues with reviewers. That or they assume a reviewer doesn’t understand the subject because they didn’t read the source material—another odd sticking point for anime, which reviewers either avoid mentioning in their reviews (because they’re not reviewing the source material) or emphasize because they also read the manga and comics.</p><p>“Even if I have read it, I don’t normally mention the source material in my reviews unless it’s a big part of something specifically worth mentioning,” Motamayor said. “Otherwise, I’m not reviewing a manga [because] you’re watching a show.”</p></div><p>“For me, it helps because it’s about striking a balance in a review, looking at something as both an adaptation and as its own thing,” Adlakha said. “Of course, some people might be looking for complete fidelity to the story and the structure, but for me that’s not what adaptation is all about, especially in an animated medium where you can use things like movement, rhythm, and music to enhance or subvert things that were already done in the source material.”</p><p>When hate comments appear, reviewers say IGN mainly steps in if they’re extremely vitriolic by moderating the comments section on its website. Still, because reviews are blasted onto social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, it’s unfortunate but common for reviewers to go no-contact on social media or block people for uncharitable responses.</p><figure><blockquote><p>It’s the actual critique in the conversation that is far more important. </p></blockquote></figure><p>While neither of the three have considered walking away from anime review writing because of online discourse, they have weighed whether it is worth putting up with the backlash that spills outside of IGN’s moderation onto their personal social media.&nbsp;</p><p>“I have considered whether there is enough of an upside if the downside is being harassed for weeks and months on end across every single social media place that I am available online—email, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, BlueSky, Threads, LinkedIn—all at once, sending not just insults but death threats,” Adlakha said. “I have to consider whether this is worth it from a mental health standpoint. I haven’t gone to the extent of walking away, but the thought has come up.”</p><p>“The zeroing in on IGN numerical scores comes from the effect that the internet is having on our brain, that we have shorter attention spans. That <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results/#:~:text=Google%20users%20who%20encountered%20an,on%20pages%20without%20a%20summary." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one percent of people now click on links at Google</a> because <a href="https://aftermath.site/google-ai-idioms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everyone’s just reading the AI overview</a>—that is the focus on the numerical score,” Carey said. “We could take away the numerical score, and that would allow more nuance in the review, perhaps, but IGN’s whole model is thrown into the sea... I feel it’s almost less of an issue with IGN and more of an issue with how social media is training us to think. I would love to write reviews where I don’t have to assign a thing and just talk about something, but increasingly few outlets are allowed to do that.”</p><figure><figcaption>Jujutsu Kaisen<span></span><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Hype-driven online culture be damned; traditional criticism is still essential&nbsp;</h2><p>In the New Yorker’s “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-lede/in-defense-of-the-traditional-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Defense of the Traditional Review</a>,” writer Richard Brody quoted Pauline Kael’s 1971 article<em> “</em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1971/01/23/notes-on-heart-and-mind" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Notes on Heart and Mind</a>,” in which she writes that “Without a few independent critics, there’s nothing between the public and the advertisers.” Brody’s use of the quote highlighted his argument that traditional reviews serve as an essential buffer between audiences and commercial influence, preserving artistic integrity and encouraging informed engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of anime reviews, the buffer of traditional review writing is as crucial as in any other medium. In a media landscape increasingly molded by algorithmic promotion, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/new-media-circuit-hollywood-publicity.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influencer culture supplanting press interviews</a>, criticism that engages and challenges should be valued. This level of scrutiny can keep conversation alive and help a medium evolve. Review writing that risks discomfort for fandoms and creatives alike is far more valuable than one that reads like a press release angling for a back-of-the-box quote or an accolade trailer shout-out.</p><p>While the hate comments and baggage that come with being an IGN anime reviewer haven't deterred Motamayor, Carey, or Alaksha from continuing to work for the publication, that doesn’t mean IGN as an institution doesn’t have room to grow in legitimizing anime reviews within the mainstream. Motamayor suggested IGN and traditional media coverage as a whole should expand its anime coverage beyond shonen-centric content as a way to make reviews of action-oriented shows less of a polarizing echo chamber and to highlight shows that aren’t solely focused on power levels and aura farming.&nbsp;</p><p>“My dream world would be one where IGN is reviewing enough anime consistently, where the big show, and specifically the reviewer writing about the big show, is not seen as representative of their whole career or the entire website's reputation. As it is now, the fact that we are mostly just running about the big shows makes it so that the reviews can be boiled down to ‘what, do you not like shonen anime in general, because of one show you didn’t like?’ Or ‘I guess they like writing negative reviews for the engagement.’”</p><p>In addition to expanding what kind of anime the site covers, there’s also the question of review scores overshadowing the nuance of a critique.&nbsp;</p><p>“The prominence of scores, these numerical figures, tends to be very overemphasized because art is not something you can approach objectively. It’s not what criticism is about, “Adlakha said. “A score or a star rating can be a gateway to a deeper and more fulfilling criticism. But the intense focus on these things reduces what criticism is capable of and skews what the conversation around a piece of art even is in this very thumbs-up, thumbs-down sense. Art and our response to it is a little more complicated than just a yes or no, or a 7 or 8, because I don’t feel that strongly about the numbers themselves. It’s the actual critique in the conversation that is far more important. To only get messages and responses just about a number is like we’re having two completely different conversations.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia"><h3>I Bloody Love The Drifter</h3></a><p>A homage to Lucasarts, John Carpenter and so much more</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-bookshop-impressions"><h3>Recommending Books Is The Best Part Of Tiny Bookshop</h3></a><p>Forget The Lorax, kid; it's time for classic architecture</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/digital-foundry-ign-ziff-davis-eurogamer-patreon"><h3>Good For Digital Foundry</h3></a><p>'We answer to nobody but you, the audience'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ign-anime-review-score-discourse]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>For months now, rumors of a Lego <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><em>Star Wars</em></a> Death Star set have been floating around Reddit, Instagram, and other places where Lego nerds (like myself) hang out. Now we finally have our first real look at the massive upcoming Lego set, and it seems to confirm the previous rumors, which also claimed the price for this 9,000+ piece set might be $1,000.</p> <p>I first heard about a massive <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-review-kotaku-ps5-xbox-tt-1848746867">Lego Death Star</a> set that could cost as much as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegoStarWarsLeaks/comments/1lq9y5m/death_star/">$1,000 back in May</a>. At the time, the only supposed details that had leaked were its set number, piece count, October release date, and estimated price, as well as some tiny details on possible minifigs that would be included. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegoStarWarsLeaks/comments/1kj36y8/my_speculation_and_analysis_on_the_1000_death/">There was also speculation</a> that it wouldn’t be a full orb, but instead a half-orb that would serve as more of a large diorama piece. Now some new leaked images seem to confirm many, but not all, of those previously rumored details.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1mm3ecd/75419_ucs_death_star_full_box_source/">On August&nbsp; 9, three photos</a> of what appears to be the (still officially unconfirmed) Lego Death Star set were shared on Reddit. The photos show the massive set’s equally massive box and confirm the previously leaked set number and piece count. Well, actually, the piece count of 9,023 is a few bricks more than what was leaked, but it’s close enough that I’m confident that the source of the details had advanced information.</p>

 <p>The new leak also confirms <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-andor-season-2-review-discussion-so-good-1851777959"><em>Rogue One </em>and<em> Andor’s</em> Orson Krennic</a> is one of the many included minifigs. Others include Ben Kenobi, Luke Skywalker in his Stormtrooper disguise, R2-D2 and C-3PO, the Emperor, a bunch of Imperial higher-ups seen in <em>A New Hope</em>, and Darth Vader. Oh, and I think I spotted a <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sim_Aloo">Sim Aloo</a> figure in the images included on the back of the box. (Though a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegoStarWarsLeaks/comments/1m8ys0s/part_2_for_death_star_mini_figures/"><em>different</em> leak</a> simply refers to him as an “Imperial Dignitary.” Boo!)</p> <p>Of course, the big news from this leak is that if all these previously rumored and speculated details are accurate, then it’s very likely Lego is about to set <a href="https://www.brickeconomy.com/sets/top/most-expensive-lego-sets">a new record for the most expensive official Lego set ever.</a></p> <p>Currently, the highest retail price the toy company has ever placed on a single set is $850 for the very big Millennium Falcon. <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/millennium-falcon-75192">That 7,500+ piece set was released in 2017</a> and is still for sale as of August 2025. The rumored price point of $1,000 for the new <em>Star Wars</em> Death Star would shatter the old record. However, the new Death Star won’t break the biggest set record, which is held by the Eiffel Tower set released in 2022. It contains 10,001 pieces and costs $630.</p> <p>And if you’re curious, the old Death Star set released in 2016 cost $500. At the time that seemed like a lot, and it still is a lot of money in 2025 to most people. I can’t imagine how many people will be able to afford double that when the new set arrives in October, assuming the rumored price is accurate. <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">And as tariffs continue to be a growing problem</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">in the United States thanks to President Trump</a>, expect Lego sets and other toys to become more expensive, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Woochi the Wayfarer is a new single-player action-adventure game developed by LoreVault Studio, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-the-first-descendant-death-relives/">The First Descendent</a> developer, Nexon Games, signed on as its publisher. Similar to how <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> leaned on a famous Chinese story, Woochi the Wayfarer leans on a famous Korean story, as a press release reveals the game is a depiction of 'The Tale of Jeon Woochi,' a famous Korean novel.</p>



<p>Nexon Games and LoreVault Studio debuted a nearly two-and-a-half-minute cinematic trailer, which set up the grandeur that the Unreal Engine 5 game is certainly going for, but didn't provide any real insight into the gameplay or what the final product will look like when it arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in the future. A release date, or even a release window, was not provided.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Woochi the Wayfarer | Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PHH6xQT2-dw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a press release, Nexon Games chief executive officer, Park Yong-hyun, said "<em>Woochi the Wayfarer will provide a fresh and unique play experience that is based on traditional Korean materials while also having an emotional resonance that anyone around the world can relate to. We plan to present a game that will appeal to gamers of all cultures, telling an amazing story that fully showcases Nexon Games' development capabilities and accumulated experience</em>."</p>



<p>The game's soundtrack is inspired by traditional Korean music and is being composed by Korean composer Jung Jae-il, whose work you might recognize from the film Parasite or the Netflix series, Squid Game.</p>



<p>Between the storytelling, the visuals, and the music, it'll be cool to see Korean culture on display in Woochi the Wayfarer. Hopefully, the game is able to stick the landing with its gameplay on top of what already seems to be a strong setting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A retail release of the Welcome to Night Vale RPG is on the way. After a successful <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-comes-to-backerkit-this-october" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Backerkit campaign</a>, Night Vale Presents and Renegade Game Studios will be bringing a box set of their licensed TTRPG to hobby shops this September.</p>

<h2>The <em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em> Retail Release Date</h2>

<p>In an official newsletter, Renegade Game Studios has confirmed that the <em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em> boxed set will be coming to retail stores on September 9. This is roughly one month after the game's Backerkit supporters have received their copies of the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-town-artwork.jpg?itok=1nxG-Dl- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-town-artwork.jpg?itok=vKUlZ-B- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As the name implies, the RPG has players explore the titular desert town from the beloved podcast series. The podcast began in 2012 and has since become a multimedia property with vinyl records and book spin-offs. Given that its Backerkit campaign raised over half a million dollars, it is a series with a large, passionate fanbase.</p>

<p>The game contains the show's unique blend of surreal, absurd, and dark atmosphere alongside an expansive cast of characters. It uses a simplified version of Renegade's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/essence20-field-guide-to-action-adventure-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Essence20</a>&nbsp;RPG system, which has been used in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/power-rangers-beneath-helmet-review-herolife-balance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Power Rangers</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/transformers-enigma-of-combination-review-new-meaning-of-teamwork" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Transformers</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-review-changeling-mischief" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>My Little Pony</em></a> RPGs.</p>

<p>The <em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em> boxed set will contain the following:</p>

<ul><li>Complete rules for playing the game</li>
	<li>A Citizen's Guide for character creation, a Host's Guide to help you share strange tales in Night Vale, and a Visitor's Guide that helps flesh out the desert town</li>
	<li>The <em>Skeleton Gorge Incident</em>, a five-part mystery adventure that leads characters through different Night Vale locations including the Numbers Station and the Library</li>
	<li>Eight dice and a Welcome to Night Vale-themed Game Master Screen</li>
	<li>Eleven pregenerated character sheets to help bring new players to the game quickly</li>
	<li>Nine new Threats for the players to encounter in the town of Night Vale&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>The <em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em> box set will be sold at an MSRP of $65.</p>

<figure><a title="Paper Mario N64" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e558bc1801db/paper-mario-n64.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>25 years ago today, 11th August, Mario jumped into a whole new dimension.</p>
<p>Today marks the anniversary of the N64 turn-based RPG, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/paper_mario">Paper Mario</a> — which is a pretty big deal, because that means the entire series is <em>also</em> celebrating its quarter-century anniversary. Feeling old yet?</p>
<p>Originally planned to be developed by Square — who previously teamed up with Nintendo to make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_rpg_legend_of_the_seven_stars">Super Mario RPG</a> on the SNES — Intelligent Systems took the helm for what became the first of many papercraft adventures for Mario. And for many, the original (or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Thousand-Year Door</a>) are the high watermark for the series.</p>
<p>Taking a leaf from Mario's previous RPG outing, Paper Mario uses similar reaction timing-based combat but, instead of a party of three, Mario only has one other companion join him both in battle and in the overworld.</p>

<p>Throughout the story, Mario has various different companions join his team, each with different skill sets. Each companion represents a different type of enemy within the Mario universe — fan favourite Lady Bow is a Boo, for example, while Sushie is a Cheep Cheep.</p>
<p>Those skills aren't exclusive to combat, as every character has an ability that Mario can use to explore. Goombario's skill is that he can tell you all about the location you're in. Parakarry, the Paratroopa, allows you to cross large gaps, and Sushie gives Mario the ability to swim.</p>
<p>The game also introduced Badges, equipable items that give Mario boosts, effects, and sometimes new moves.</p>
<p>Plus, don't forget that amazing magazine ad from before the game's release:</p>

<p>Much of Paper Mario's spirit and skills would carry on in The Thousand-Year Door, the GameCube sequel that got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">a remake on Switch in 2024</a>, but the series gradually moved away from traditional turn-based combat, experimenting with gameplay gimmicks beyond the standard RPG ones.</p>
<p>Still, the franchise wouldn't exist without the charming N64 original, which you can play on the N64 Nintendo Classics (formerly NSO) service if you have the Expansion Pack tier. The latest entry in the series is 2020's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_origami_king">The Origami King</a>, which is available on Switch - hopefully it'll get a Switch 2 upgrade at some point!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A small store in California was <a href="https://kotaku.com/card-shop-pokemon-robbed-100k-hammer-rare-cards-thief-1851786241">robbed earlier this month</a>, and the thieves focused primarily on taking thousands of dollars’ worth of Labubu dolls. The owner says this happened only two months after opening her shop.</p> <p><a href="https://abc7.com/post/thousands-dollars-worth-labubu-dolls-stolen-la-puente-resale-shop/17465366/">As reported by ABC7,</a> Joanna Avendano’s One Stop Sales, located in La Puente, California, was burglarized on August 6 at around 2:00 a.m. local time. The owner explained that she was hit with a “gut feeling” to check her phone and noticed there was motion and sound coming from the store’s surveillance camera. Nobody was supposed to be there at the time. It was clear at that point that the place was being robbed. Four masked suspects entered the store after smashing in a window and proceeded to grab over $30,000 worth of inventory.</p> <p>“There was a lot taken, maybe like around $30,000 or more of inventory,” Avendano told the outlet.”We worked so hard to get to this point, and for them to just come in and, like nothing, take it all away, it’s really bad.”</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Thieves ransack LA County resale shop for its Labubu dolls" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0PUD3A0EDHo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>ABC7 reports that the suspects didn’t steal cash or high-end electronics in the store and instead focused on grabbing Labubu dolls and other collectible merchandise. Labubu dolls have become quite popular over the last year or so, thanks to TikTok and celebrities posting about the bizarre monster plushies with big eyes that come in various colors and designs.</p>

 <p>“I was watching everything, from when they got in, what they were taking,” said Avendano. “I was panicking because I was just…I couldn’t do anything.”</p> <p>Avendano told ABC7 that she believes the robbery was planned, explaining that a suspicious truck was parked near her store as she closed up before the robbery. She also thinks the thieves were watching the shop’s social media posts and were waiting for her to share news of a Labubu restock. The dolls are currently very hard to find as their popularity continues to grow, mostly pushed by the algorithm.</p> <p>In fact, it’s entirely possible you’ve never heard of these hard-to-find dolls, and if so, you aren’t alone. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-11/tiktok-trends-are-driving-random-consumer-spending-spikes">As reported by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, many younger people are posting on TikTok about how many odd trends have gone viral recently, including Labubu, and how confusing it’s all becoming. It almost feels like these trends aren’t coming about organically, but instead are a symptom of pop culture becoming dominated by dopamine hits and corporate-controlled algorithms. Monoculture is dead and its replacement sucks.</p> <p>On August 8, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNFH1hTOOKV/?hl=en">Avendano shared a post on Instagram</a> claiming that police had recovered some of her stolen goods, including some Labubu dolls. However, she and local law enforcement are still asking residents in the area to report anything they might know to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department City.</p> <p>——</p> <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department City of Industry substation is investigating the burglary.</p>
