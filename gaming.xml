            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We've seen our fair share of Pikachu plushies over the years (it's only one of the most recognisable faces in media <em>ever</em>, after all), but few have been quite as lifelike as this.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Wow! Stuff and RealFX unveiled their latest creation: the Pikachu Puppetronic. As that name suggests, this is a puppet with a traditional hand-controlled design, combined with a fair amount of electronics for even more movement and expression.</p>
<p>We're talking dual-motion ears, blinking eyes, light-up cheeks, a moving mouth, and sensors all over its head, body and neck, so it can react to your touch. Throw in "over 120 sounds and actions", and this is probably as close as you can come to having ol' anime Pika in your home.</p>
<p>Naturally, it doesn't come cheap. The first wave of pre-orders went up on <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/product/72-11257-101/pikachu-puppetronic-by-real-fx">the Pokémon Center UK website</a> yesterday for <strong>£89.99</strong> and almost immediately sold out. Admittedly, there may have been a rush on these thanks to the inclusion of a special "First Edition" badge and certificate to up the FOMO, but we wouldn't be surprised to see folks clamouring for these for a while yet.</p>

<p>It's all very sweet, but there's a bit of us that finds the puppet a little... freaky. There's something about the blinking eyes, the vacant expression, and the promise that it can move on its own that pushes things closer to the uncanny valley than we'd like. A cute plushie, we can deal with, but one that might open its mouth and blurt out a "Pika Pi" in the middle of the night? *<em>gulp</em>*</p>
<p>The puppetronic is expected to ship in mid-spring 2026, so keep an eye out for restocks in the coming months, if this looks up your street.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot Games Allegedly Tried to Buy Ashes of Creation in 2022-2023; Intrepid CEO Steven Sharif Files Counter-Lawsuit]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The story behind the MMORPG <strong>Ashes of Creation</strong>, its development team (<strong>Intrepid Studios</strong>), its founder and CEO <strong>Steven Sharif</strong>, and its major investors (<strong>Robert Dawson</strong>, <strong>Jason Caramanis</strong>) continues to get messier.</p>



<p>As you might remember, Jason Caramanis publicly accused Steven Sharif of fraud, embezzlement, and other illegal acts, and mentioned that Sharif would be the target of several lawsuits, including one already filed by <strong>TFE Games Holdings</strong> against Steven Sharif and his husband, John Moore, <strong>on February 9, 2026</strong>, in the Nevada District Court, Clark County. However, a few days ago, Sharif himself <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/72286984/1/sharif-v-dawson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>filed a counter-lawsuit</strong></a> in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, against Robert Dawson and others (<strong>not against Caramanis, though</strong>), including the aforementioned <strong>TFE Games Holdings LLC</strong>, a Delaware-based LLC created and controlled by Dawson that the filing describes as having been created for the sole purpose of receiving, exploiting, and monetizing Intrepid's trade secrets and intellectual property.</p>



<p>One of the most explosive revelations from the new legal documents is that between late 2022 and early 2023, a major game development company <strong>offered hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire Ashes of Creation and the studio behind it</strong>. However, Dawson allegedly urged Sharif to reject the deal in favor of continuing development under his financing, which eventually led to the talks with the acquiring company ending. This company is never named in the filing, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p-mL-Nlq4M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a new video interview with NefasQS</a>, who was the first one to break the veil of mystery on this whole controversy, Caramanis reveals that "<strong>the only company that I know they had dialogues with that they communicated with was Riot</strong>."</p>



<p>Needless to say, it's a surprising turn of events (albeit not officially confirmed) that the public didn't know about before. Riot's backing could have certainly helped Ashes of Creation, although they have been working on their own <strong>League of Legends MMO</strong> for several years without anything to show for it. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/league-of-legends-mmo-is-still-in-development-but-has-been-rebooted-says-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It was rebooted in March 2024</a></strong>, and we still haven't learned anything concrete about it.</p>



<p>Anyway, the counter-lawsuit frames this as the turning point in their relationship: Sharif alleges that, seeing the company's real potential for extremely high returns, <strong>Dawson then began a campaign to seize control of the company</strong>, but notably, he did so "without consideration for the quality of the game and the typical development timeline of MMORPGs."</p>



<p>The allegations made by Sharif against Dawson only get harsher from here on. According to Sharif, from <strong>early 2023 through May 2024</strong>, Dawson repeatedly threatened to withhold payroll and health insurance financing just before payroll deadlines, to shut the company down through litigation, and to cause Sharif <strong>financial ruin and physical harm</strong>, unless Sharif signed documents granting him progressively greater equity and control. The filing lists the following examples:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dawson demanded <strong>a warrant granting him 10% of the company for $10</strong></li>



<li>He demanded <strong>zero-cost non-dilutable equity options</strong> in his convertible debt notes</li>



<li>He <strong>required Sharif to involve him in all discussions with company counsel,</strong> despite having no right to that access (at least according to Sharif)</li>



<li>He <strong>falsely represented that he was an agent of the Company</strong> to retain Company counsel</li>
</ul>



<p>Steven Sharif <strong>claimed to have suffered from severe health issues due to these undue threats and pressure</strong>, including a hypertensive emergency, acute kidney failure, hospitalization, and vision loss from blood pressure complications, including macular edema. </p>



<p>As a result of debt-to-equity conversions under the <strong>May 2024 Settlement Agreement</strong>, <strong>Dawson became the majority shareholder</strong><span><strong>, holding</strong>&nbsp;4,008.67 shares of Class A, B, and C Common Stock, representing</span> roughly <strong>58% of all shares in Intrepid Studios</strong>. Under that same agreement, Sharif <strong>expressly retained full creative control of the Company</strong>, even as Dawson gained financial and governance control.</p>

<iframe title="RIOT Games Was Supposed to Buy Ashes of Creation???" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p-mL-Nlq4M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>At a subsequent Board meeting that took place on September 4, 2024, Dawson was appointed Chairman of the Board, and <strong>Ryan Ogden</strong> was appointed Chief Financial Officer. Dawson then directed Ogden to open new Intrepid bank accounts at Pathway Bank, which the lawsuit frames as a bank over which Dawson exercises de facto or de jure control. From this point, Sharif<strong> was effectively stripped of all financial authority and ceased to have any access to active company bank accounts</strong>. By August 2025, Dawson added Theresa Fette and Aaron Bartels (both of whom are also among the lawsuit's defendants) to the board. From that point until Sharif's formal resignation dated January 19, 2026, <strong>the full board consisted of Dawson, Ogden, Fette, Bartels, and Sharif</strong>, who claimed that Ogden, Fette, and Bartels were acting at Dawson's behest rather than as independent directors.</p>



<p>Even the early access launch of Ashes of Creation, clearly rushed by most gamers' judgment, <strong>was forced by the board against Sharif's and other senior leadership's advice</strong>, at least according to Sharif's own reconstruction of the events. The filing also states that prior to the board's interference, Ashes of Creation had achieved an unusually strong Day 30 player retention rate of approximately 76%.</p>



<p>Critically, it is alleged that Ryan Ogden <strong>specifically assured CommerceWest Bank that Steam revenue from the Early Access launch would cover the outstanding loan obligations</strong>. As a reminder, Caramanis had alleged that Sharif was notified by Valve that a Steam payout was incoming, and then Sharif deliberately allowed or directed those funds to flow to the CommerceWest Bank loan, which Caramanis described as Sharif essentially using company money to cover a personal debt, since the $6 million loan was personally guaranteed by his husband, John Moore.</p>



<p>The two accounts actually agree on the assurance given to CommerceWest Bank, but <strong>the funds themselves appear to still be frozen</strong>. Prior to the foreclosure, Ogden had specifically directed Valve to divert the Steam revenue owed to Intrepid into a new Pathway Bank account opened for TFE, but <strong>Valve refused to comply</strong>. On February 3, 2026, <strong>Valve terminated Intrepid's Steam partnership entirely</strong>, citing multiple conflicting requests from alleged account administrators trying to change Intrepid's banking information, demands from multiple potential creditors for Intrepid's revenues, and a large volume of player refund requests. The filing states that before refunds, <strong>Intrepid would have been entitled to approximately $5 million from Steam</strong>.</p>



<p>Sharif's counter-lawsuit lists eight specific violations of the law:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Defend Trade Secrets Act</strong> (federal): Misappropriation of Intrepid's IP and trade secrets</li>



<li><strong>California Uniform Trade Secrets Act</strong>: The same, albeit under state law</li>



<li><strong>California Commercial Code violations</strong>: The Article 9 foreclosure was procedurally unlawful, commercially unreasonable, and conducted without required notice to senior creditors</li>



<li><strong>Breach of Fiduciary Duty</strong>: Board defendants failed their duties of loyalty, care, candor, and independence to the company and shareholders</li>



<li><strong>Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty</strong>: This one specifically targets TFE for knowingly facilitating the board's breaches</li>



<li><strong>Corporate Waste</strong>: The board's actions were so reckless and devoid of legitimate business purpose that they constituted a waste of corporate assets</li>



<li><strong>Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</strong>: A direct personal claim by Sharif, based on the deliberate campaign to destroy his reputation and safety</li>



<li><strong>Civil Conspiracy</strong>: All defendants knowingly conspired to misappropriate IP and trade secrets and to scapegoat Sharif publicly</li>
</ol>



<p> The filing requests a variety of remedies, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>An injunction to prevent the defendants from accessing, using, or selling the trade secrets related to Ashes of Creation</li>



<li>The annulment of the wrongful foreclosure</li>



<li>Compensation for consequential and punitive damages</li>



<li>The disgorgement of profits</li>



<li>The removal of the board of directors</li>



<li>The establishment of a constructive trust</li>



<li>The payment of legal fees</li>



<li>Permanent injunctive relief against future misconduct</li>
</ul>



<p>By the way, Steven Sharif himself <strong>appeared in the YouTube chat of the linked NefasQS video to share this message</strong>:</p>



<p><em>My goal is maximum accountability. I am glad to see Jason commenting and sharing as much as he is, I think you are doing a great job with that @NefasQS, so thank you for that. It obviously would not make much sense for me to fight a battle in the court of public opinion, when the truth will come out obviously in court. Federal court is not like state court; there is a higher burden of factual proof required. I would not sign my name to that document if I was not certain of the truthfulness.</em></p>



<p>To say that the situation is intricate would be an understatement. We'll keep tracking the development of this legal battle; stay tuned.</p>

That's not too shabby, and we can probably expect <em>Nioh 3 </em>to compete with its forebears on this front, at the very least.</p><figure role="group">

<p>In general, it seems that <em>Nioh 3 </em>is part of an upward trend for Koei Tecmo when it comes to initial sales; back in 2024, the studio also revealed that its Bakumatsu-era RPG <em>Rise of the Ronin </em>had surpassed the first two <em>Nioh </em>games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-sales-koei-tecmo-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="67f991d6-0e1a-4301-9f20-4cef49c020a1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in terms of launch sales</a>.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Nioh 3</em>, it is, believe it or not, the third game in the <em>Nioh </em>series, which blends <em>Souls</em>-esque combat and exploration with a focus on loot gathering and fast-paced combat.</p><p>In contrast to its predecessors, <em>Nioh 3 </em>allows you to travel between various eras in Japanese history, including the aforementioned Bakumatsu era, as well as the Edo, Sengoku, and Heian periods.</p><p>Much like in Team Ninja's other Soulslike RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wo-long-fallen-dynasty" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ded52dd9-4edb-4dd7-b4c6-09ff708bab63" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em></a>, you'll meet and interact with historical figures from throughout these periods, including the likes of Hattori Hanzo, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, and Himiko.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games campaign</a>'s organisers are currently awaiting a chat with European Union politicians about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">server shutdowns rendering online-only games impossible to play</a>. Said chat's been set up by a petition which racked up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-amassed-just-under-13-million-verified-signatures-according-to-final-count">just under 1.3 million verified signatures</a> at its final count, with that being one of the alleys the group have gone down in pursuit of action against publishers being able to abandon games without leaving a way for them to be kept running.</p>
<p>Rather than simply adjusting their ties and googling nice places to visit on a trip to Brussels while they wait for their meeting, the group have announced some more action they'll be taking to get their message out in the ling term. Two Stop Killing Games non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are going to be set up to cover Europe and the US.</p>

<p>There are definite advantages [to launching these NGOs]," YouTuber Ross Scott said in the campaign's latest update video. "The first is this will allow us to do long-term counter lobbying on this issue. I mean, we're hoping to get the [European] Citizens Initiative passed or added to the Digital Fairness Act, but if those fail, there's still the possibility of being added to the Digital Content Directive revision. We're trying to find a way in any way we can. This will also signal that we're not just going away on this issue." He added that it'll "also allow for more watchdog action", such as the setting up of sites where players can report the situations of specific games to consumer protection agencies who may then take action.</p><p>As a social studies refresher, non-governmental organisations are typically groups which campaign about or take action to address specific issues - Oxfam fight inequality, Doctors without Borders tackle medical emergencies, the WWF promote wildlife conservation. As you might have gleaned from that list, many NGOs are non-profit charities funded by donations, but they can also draw funding from governments or run like for-profit businesses in some cases.</p>
<p>Ross cited Stop Killing Games campaigner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moritz-katzner-473a54342/?locale=en">Moritz Katzner</a> as having spearheaded the push for these NGOs, with the German political activist also having led the charge on the campaign's EU petition. As for what'll come out of the meeting with EU lawmakers that petition's set up, Ross said the campaigners have "actually have no idea what to expect".</p>

            <p>Ubisoft are laying off around 40 people at Ubisoft Toronto, the studio behind the forthcoming remake of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a>. That’s approximately eight percent of the studio headcount. It’s all in the service of Ubisoft’s drive to cut costs after restructuring their operations around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">a big dollop of Tencent funding</a>, which has elsewhere seen Ubisoft propose to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">lay off up to 200 people in Paris</a>, and chop fixed costs by €200 million over the next two years.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As ever with layoff announcements, the accompanying statement consists of an anonymous spokesperson rotating a dial back and forth between “robotic platitude” and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">“ghastly euphemism”</a>, while looking back at the audience for approval. In this case, the dial is tilting towards “robotic platitude”.</p>
<p>“This decision was not taken lightly and does not in any way reflect the talent, dedication, or contributions of the individuals affected,” an Ubi rep told <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">MobileSyrup</a>, as passed along by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-confirms-layoffs-at-toronto-studio-but-insists-splinter-cells-remake-is-still-coming/">Very Gary Computing</a>. “Our priority now is to support them through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement assistance.”</p>
<p>MobileSyrup have also gotten hold of an internal email in which some company bigwig allegedly claims that Toronto will remain “a key contributor to several codev mandates and service teams,” in addition to developing Splinter Cell’s remake. The latter was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-the-new-tom-clancy-game-reveal-here-today">announced back in 2021</a> as a Snowdrop engine project. We’ve heard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-looks-like-the-splinter-cell-remake-might-be-about-to-reappear-after-years-in-the-dark">very little</a> about it since. Splinter Cell is not one of the three flagship series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-didnt-cancel-beyond-good-evil-2-because-open-world-games-are-a-priority-but-i-suspect-the-real-reason-is-more-boring">identified by Ubi management as being potential “billionaire brands”</a>. As such, Splinter Cell projects are theoretically at more risk of being terminated, though Ubisoft have yet to cancel infamous vapourware game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good and Evil 2</a>, so who knows.</p><p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">Begun in January</a>, Ubisoft’s Tencent-abetted restructuring has seen them cancel six games, delay seven others, and close a couple of studios, alongside company-wide layoffs. They’ve also announced a new RTO policy, with staff getting a yearly allowance of home days instead of proper hybrid working. All of which has provoked hundreds of Ubisoft workers to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/1200-ubisoft-staff-go-on-strike-against-assassins-creed-companys-massive-cutbacks">go on strike</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A dataminer has seemingly found links to the next game in the series in the God of War: Ragnarok files, which mention Athena and an Egyptian cat. </p>



<p>Since the announcement of the God of War <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trilogy Remake</a> and the insider talks about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/santa-monica-developing-more-than-just-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Santa Monica’s other game</a>, fans have been eagerly waiting for the next announcement. Many think it will be God of War in Egypt; however, we haven’t received confirmation for that yet. Now, some details about the next God of War game have surfaced online. </p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-ragnarok-sequel-appears-to-have-references-to-athena-and-egypt">God of War Ragnarok Sequel Appears to Have References to Athena and Egypt</h2>



<p>A new post on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWarRagnarok/comments/1r986bw/found_athena_cutscene_and_atreus_in_his_travels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GodofWarRagnarok</a> subreddit discusses the datamine related to the next game. It seems this user found hidden content in God of War 2018 that turned out to be the beginning of Ragnarok (Atreus killing the bear, finding Tyr). Now, the user has found hidden content in Ragnarok’s files that could be part of the next game. </p>



<p>The datamined content includes a cutscene featuring Athena discussing Atreus and Odin. The Greek Goddess of Wisdom is apparently also referenced as the ‘Robed One’ in this cutscene. Athena’s dialogues are “To lefkó fídi tha se fáei,” which is Greek for “The white snake will eat you,” and “One failed us. One rejected us,” probably referencing Odin failing the ones from the higher plane and Atreus rejecting the mask.</p>



<p>There’s also a cutscene for Atreus, where he talks to a character called ‘Mau’. Mau is also a cat in Egyptian, and “one of the manifestations of the Sun God Ra.” The Mau character is like Groot from the MCU: he only says ‘I am Groot’. Mau only says ‘mau’, but Atreus seems to understand what he means. Check out the conversations below: </p>



<h4 id="h-athena-cutscene">Athena Cutscene: </h4>



<ul>
<li>Robed Figure: “<strong><em>To lefkó fídi tha se fáei</em></strong>.”</li>



<li>Robed Figure: “<strong><em>One failed us. One rejected us</em></strong>.”</li>



<li>Athena: “<strong><em>We have a problem</em></strong>.”</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-atreus-and-mau-cutscene">Atreus and Mau Cutscene: </h4>



<ul>
<li>Atreus: “<em><strong>Wake up. I think we’re close</strong></em>.”</li>



<li>Mau: “<strong><em>Mau?</em></strong>“</li>



<li>Atreus: “<strong><em>Hey, you insisted on coming along. C’mon, let’s have a look</em></strong>.”</li>



<li>Mau: “<strong><em>Mau</em></strong>.”</li>



<li>Atreus: “<strong><em>I hope you’re right. Sounds like we found it</em></strong>.”</li>
</ul>







<p>Readers should take this information with a grain of salt and wait for official confirmation from Santa Monica to know for sure. </p>

Embark are continuing their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-takes-a-turn-for-the-long-dark-with-todays-cold-snap-update-beware-the-frostbite">meteorological experiments</a> in extraction shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> with a  rousing injection of wind. There’s a hurricane coming to the game on February 24th, a new map condition that limits visibility, degrades shields, impedes movement, and makes you suck even more at shooting things. Still, this stormcloud has a few silver linings. With the gale at your back, you’ll naturally move a lot faster. Also, you may find it easier to avoid detection in the open if you disable your shield.

“The wind will change how you navigate topside,” explains <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition">an official site post</a>. “When you have a tailwind, you’ll feel fast and nimble, but fighting against the gales will inhibit your speed and quickly drain your stamina. Throwables will also behave differently in these conditions, and it may take a while to master the trajectory of thrown items like grenades. Other aspects of gameplay like smoke, gas, and even jumping will be affected by the power of the Hurricane.”
</p>
<p>
The howling boreads will also steadily erode your shield, causing it to glitch and spark. This will make you more visible to other raiders through the murk, so you might want to turn it off. The steady mithering of the elements will also make it harder to see and hear Arc robots. It’s not entirely clear from the blog post if the likes of Wasps and Hornets will be whirled off course by the hurricane. Perhaps if we could work out the wind direction, we could set up a big net to catch them and then grenade them all in one go.
</p>
<p>
As ever with map-wide afflictions in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>, peril brings plunder. The storm will reveal new caches of gear. Baby wanna new powercell? Out you go into the squall, then.
</p>
<p>
Off the top of my head, the only thing the Arc Raiders hurricane is missing is the opportunity to get lifted clean away Dorothy-style and land in a different map, perhaps even a different game. Picture a bunch of sky-tossed Raiders touching down on the sun-kissed isles of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>, headshotting Tom Nook and stripping his cottage for parts. If you find Embark's approach to live service updates too turbulent, I'm sorry to say that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-like-how-often-map-conditions-rotate-in-arc-raiders-sorry-but-the-devs-say-that-most-likely-wont-change">the studio have no plans to change how they rotate the map conditions</a>.

<p>Shrouded Sky is bringing a lot of new content to ARC Raiders, but one of the highlights is undoubtedly the Hurricane map Condition. These are a key part of what keeps ARC Raiders feeling fresh and exciting, as some of them can fundamentally change how a map is played. </p>







<p>Some of the Map Conditions can be minor, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bird City</a>, but it seems like the Hurricanes are set to make some big changes when they roll through the maps. If you’re wondering what’s on the way with the Hurricanes, as well as what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> maps they’re playable on, then you’re in the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-maps-are-hurricanes-on-in-arc-raiders">What Maps Are Hurricanes On In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t get swept away! Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, it hasn’t been officially announced which maps the new Hurricane Map Condition will be playable on, but the teaser trailer provides a few clues.</strong></p>



<p>During the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition" id="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a>, the iconic Spaceport tower is clearly visible, indicating that the Hurricane will be playable on that map, but the rest of the footage is notably dark and unclear. Whilst that might replicate the visibility issues during the Hurricane, it makes it harder to figure out what maps are being played on. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders Shrouded Sky Release Date &amp; Start Times—All Content, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>However, from what little can be seen, it appears that Dam Battlegrounds will be another playable map that features the new Map Condition, and maybe even The Blue Gate. They seem to be safe guesses, as both maps feature prominent overground areas, and a Hurricane hitting Buried City might be thematically inappropriate, whilst Stella Montis would simply be unfeasible.</p>



<p>Once <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/embark-studios/" id="96820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embark Studios</a> officially reveals which maps the Hurricane Map Condition will be playable on, Insider Gaming will be sure to update this article with more certain clarity.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-changes-will-the-hurricane-map-condition-make-in-arc-raiders">What Changes Will The Hurricane Map Condition Make In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to extract? Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Hurricane Map Condition will make numerous changes to ARC Raiders, with the key ones being impacted visibility and flying debris that can damage shields. </strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/">ARC Raiders Event Tracker—Every Map Condition Schedule</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s every change coming to ARC Raiders during the Hurricane Map Condition:</p>







<h3 id="h-wind">Wind</h3>



<p>Perhaps the most prominent feature of the Hurricane Map Condition is that raiders will have to battle unrelenting winds as they explore topside. They’re not just for show, however, as they’ll directly hinder movement and the trajectory of thrown items like grenades. Even smoke, gas, and jumping will be impacted by the Hurricane, so it’s important to plan your movements carefully.</p>



<h3 id="h-debris">Debris</h3>



<p>The winds don’t just impact raiders, though, as they’ll also kick up debris from the surface, which spells bad news for your shield. When hit by debris, your shield will glitch and degrade, both making you more visible to other raiders and lowering your chances of surviving many gunfights. It seems that when navigating the Hurricanes, it might be best to take off your shield, though you’ll be far more susceptible to a raider ambush.</p>



<h3 id="h-visibility">Visibility</h3>



<p>Clouds hang low during the Hurricanes, making topside almost unrecognisable. Vision will be limited, as will be your hearing, thanks to the howls of the winds. However, it doesn’t have to be all bad news, as you’re more than welcome to use it to your advantage too—just don’t walk headfirst into an obscured ARC.</p>



<h3 id="h-first-wave-caches">First Wave Caches</h3>



<p>Everyone’s always on the lookout for loot in ARC Raiders, and it looks like the Hurricanes will unearth some forgotten treasures. First Wave Caches can be found during the Hurricanes, as these First Wave relics have resurfaced due to the powerful winds. It seems like good loot can be found in these, so it might be worth weathering the storm after all. </p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem copies are in the wild, and Capcom has now promised to take action against the people posting any gameplay videos. </p>



<p>Capcom’s Resident Evil Requiem is one of the developer’s biggest releases of the year, and they are committed to preserving the experience for fans. While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-will-have-3-playable-characters-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks</a> prior to official reveals and announcements typically reveal only limited details about the game, the physical copies being shared earlier are spoiling content for players.</p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-spoilers-are-already-online">Resident Evil Requiem Spoilers Are Already Online</h2>



<p>Capcom released a new statement on the BIO_OFFICIAL <a href="https://x.com/BIO_OFFICIAL/status/2024787173917249896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) regarding actions against individuals who spoil content from Resident Evil Requiem. The developers acknowledged that a significant number of gameplay videos have surfaced, which they believe were obtained illegally. They have requested that players who have access to the content or the game refrain from posting it online.</p>



<p>The developers have stated that posting these videos is not only a copyright infringement but also an offense against their customers. As a result, they will take firm action, such as deleting these videos and issuing warnings to users who engage in this activity. The developers aim to deliver a story that intertwines mystery and tension, providing a thrilling gaming experience that challenges players with unknown threats. They don’t want this experience to be spoiled for their audience.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Jake Solomon, a decorated game designer known for his work at Firaxis on games like XCOM and Marvel Midnight Suns, has announced that his studio Midsummer is going to close. In doing so, he also shared a pre-alpha look at the "Life Sims + The Truman Show" game the studio was making, called Burbank.</p>
<p>Solomon didn't elaborate on the reasons for closure in <a href="https://x.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181">the statement he released on X</a>. "We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both," he wrote. "Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into."</p>
<p>Burbank seems to be a game about making TV shows with a cast of characters you can pick up and drop into various customisable situations. It reminds me a lot of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lionheads-secret-best-game-and-one-of-the-greatest-ever-abandonware-games-the-movies-turns-20-today">Lionhead's The Movies</a>.</p>
<p>The Burbank trailer shows somewhat action-figure-like people leading dramatic lives in a small-town location, which you watch as though you would a soap opera on TV. The trailer then reveals that you're the one directing it, choosing the characters who'll be the stars and then adding a support cast from bundles of support cast characters. Then you choose a broad outline for the episode, establish character motivations and behaviour, and go on to unlock new cast abilities as you play.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both. Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into.</p><p>It's like "Life Sims + The Truman Show," but it's more than that. I believe people are… <a href="https://t.co/RuYvDhdEZO">pic.twitter.com/RuYvDhdEZO</a></p></div>— Jake Solomon (@SolomonJake) <a href="https://twitter.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>The alluring part seems to be that you're not totally in control, which means your actors and characters have minds of their own, so finding out what they'll do when placed in certain situations becomes a key part of the game. You set their parameters and then watch to see what you've created.</p>
<p>Jake Solomon explained: "It's like 'Life Sims + The Truman Show', but it's more than that. I believe people are storytellers, and I want them to share whatever stories and characters they can dream up. Burbank lets you do that.</p>
<p>"We have moments playing this game where characters come alive in a way we've never experienced. And for an old game developer like me that's special [...] This game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us."</p>
<p>He later added: "Our characters use AI for memory, reasoning and speech. That's what lets you create anyone you want and drop them in any story you write. But all of our art is created by our talented artists. We had no interest in replacing *any* developers with AI."</p>
<p>That is the only other comment he made.</p>

<p>It's a surprising announcement and it's sad, and it's also slightly strange in that it doesn't unequivocally state that this game's journey is over. The language used seems to suggest Burbank could live on, but if the studio is about to close, how could that be? Jake Solomon has given no previous indication the studio was in trouble. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jake-solomon-0247a037_midsummer-is-officially-a-game-changer-activity-7395096938137690112-Zc8d?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAUoxGIBcYD7dzkEFna_Jwj_cI4OhPmSEjo">His last post on LinkedIn</a>, made three months ago, had him saying he was "excited to share more about what we're building soon".</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-superheroes-to-soap-operas-xcoms-jake-solomon-unveils-first-details-of-his-new-studio-and-next-gen-life-sim">We last spoke to Solomon in 2024</a>, a couple of years after Marvel's Midnight Suns had charmed us, and after Solomon had left Firaxis to create his own studio and spin-up this new game idea. In that interview, he said Midsummer had been backed by venture capitalists and received funding from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> maker Krafton. I'm assuming that money has now run out. Solomon also talked more about the thinking behind Burbank, and the 'create your own stories' idea.</p>
<p>Marvel's Midnight Suns was released in 2022. It's a card-based, turn-based spin on creating your own Marvel superhero team - and Marvel superhero - and then saving the day. And very good it was too. "Great tactical fun nestled in a sweet-natured superhero dollhouse," wrote Christian Donlan in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-midnight-suns-review-crush-evil-dm-the-avengers-and-find-that-perfect-bedside-table">Marvel's Midnight Suns review</a>.</p>

		<p>I’ve had a great week of gaming this week. I’ve just really enjoyed myself, and a lot of that seems to come down to my returning addiction to Overwatch. The community has blossomed with the introduction of the five new characters, and everything feels somehow fresh and new, while also being reassuringly locked down. I know I enjoyed my time with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/28/highguard-review-in-progress/">Highguard</a>, but, with limited competitive gaming time, it’s got to be Overwatch for me. I, perhaps, shouldn’t still be playing it at 1AM, but, what are you going to do? Sleep?</p>
<p>Jason has been playing Skyrim, which he’s playing with mods for the first time. He says, “I’m enjoying the mix of nostalgia and cool new spells a lot. I’ve also been playing more Lort, which is an excellent roguelike which might have broken the balance with the latest character, but I’m not complaining.”</p>

<p>Aran finished The Man Who Erased His Name, which he says, “Was a great Yakuza spin-off. I enjoyed playing as Kiryu and wandering around Osaka playing through a standard over the top Yakuza storyline. The ending was great and very emotional.</p>
<p>Gamoc has been played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/17/styx-blades-of-greed-review/">Styx</a> for review. He also started NG+ in Spidey 2 since it’s on PS+, while also starting Phantom Doctrine, “Because it was £1-odd on Switch.”</p>

<p>Jim has been glued to Red Dead Redemption all week, again. He said, “For the past several hours, I’ve been roaming Mexico, crossing off side quests and challenges before heading back up north. I remember finding this middle act fairly boring during my initial playthrough many years ago though now I have a much greater appreciation for it and clever shift in tone/setting. I’m unsure whether I’ll go for the platinum trophy though I intend to at least finish the main story and Undead Nightmares.”</p>
<p>Laura has been trying out Planet of Lana 2 for review this week – she says, “So far I’ve “squee-ed” (I’m pretty sure that’s a word) at least nine times at how adorable Mui is and “flargh-ed” (yep, that’s a word too) several times at how perfectly tricky the puzzles are! I’ve also been enjoying all the new updated content and improvements to Absolum with Ade – it’s now even better than before!”</p>

<p>Ade confirmed, “Oh yes! Let me tell you, the Absolum devs have clearly been working hard post-launch and have now fixed all of the roguelike related issues I brought up in my review. As a result, Absolum is now more than likely the best side-scrolling beat ’em up I’ve ever played!”</p>
<p>Steve has been writing a heck of a lot this week, while also fitting in some of his own gaming too. He said, ” I managed to spend some quality time playing through Lost Records: Bloom and Rage in an effort to clear some space on my PS5 for a big download which I ended up installing on PC instead. That big download is my current play but I am not allowed to speak of it. I also made a start on Son of Sparta, which is&nbsp; a perfectly solid search adventure game but hasn’t really got going yet. Aesthetically, it reminds me of a dialled-down Prince of Persia but doesn’t have the fluidity or innovation (especially the map screenshot feature) of Ubi’s most recent iteration. Whilst commuting, I enjoyed finishing Gumball in Trick or Treat Land, a modern GBC JRPG that I’ll have the review up for soon.”</p>
<p>Tef has swanned off to Munich to check out the latest updates to Rennsport, though he’s also spent a lot of this week squinting into the Nintendo Virtual Boy. Fancy!</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

<p><em>"A hidden cutscene with what I think are beings from the higher plane and Athena talking about Odin and Atreus. There is also another character called 'Robed Figure', who says 'To lefkó fídi tha se fáei.' Greek for 'The white snake will eat you.'

<p><em>"One failed us.

            <p>Ubisoft is laying off 40 employees at its Toronto studio, which is currently working on the company's long-in-the-works Splinter Cell remake.</p>
<p>In a statement shared with tech outlet <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">MobileSyrup</a>, Ubisoft said this decision "was not taken lightly". It added it was not a reflection of the "talent, dedication, or contributions" of those impacted by the layoffs at the studio.</p>

<p>"Our priority now is to support them through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement assistance," Ubisoft said.</p>
<p>Despite these changes at Ubisoft Toronto, its Splinter Cell remake is still in development, the company confirmed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-splinter-cell-remake">Ubisoft first announced its plans to remake Splinter Cell in December 2021</a>. At this time, the company said this game is being built "from the ground up" with updated visuals and improved design elements to "match player comfort and expectations". In addition to this, Ubisoft confirmed the game will be linear, and won't feature any open world gameplay, much like the originals.</p><p>In the time since, a job listing revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-splinter-cell-remake-will-update-story-for-a-modern-day-audience">Ubisoft is updating its story for a "modern-day audience"</a>, and that it hopes to bring in new fans to the franchise with this remake. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-remake-shares-concept-art-but-still-very-early-in-development">the studio then revealed some concept art</a> for its upcoming - but still "very early" in development - Splinter Cell remake.</p>
<p>As well as this remake, Ubisoft Toronto will also remain a "key contributor to several codev mandates and service teams", the company told MobileSyrup.</p>

<p>News of layoffs at the Toronto studio follows an announcement earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft was initiating a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>. This saw Ubisoft close two studios, cancel six projects - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sands-of-times-shock-cancellation-does-not-mean-we-are-stepping-away-from-the-franchise-says-remake-team">including its Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> -  and delay seven games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 20, 2026, Quordle is the #1488 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 20.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

<p>How come these games aren't coming to Nintendo Switch Online like the other GBA games in the Expansion Pack? Will I be able to trade? Will we be seeing more Virtual Console-style releases like this?</p>
<p>Well, preempting all those questions, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71365/#s1q4">Nintendo of America has put out a FAQ</a> answering all those and more.</p>

<p>In celebration of 30 years of Pokémon, we thought it would be fun to return to the ultimate versions of the original Pokémon adventures in the Kanto region with these special releases.</p>

<p>So, it seems NOA tried to head the big questions off at the pass.</p>
<p>With the games priced at £16.99 / $19.99 each, and with all those separately listed language variants opening further possibilities for confusion, it seems wise to answer the biggest head-scratchers before a barrage of clarification requests from press and fans alike. The language version thing, in particular, seems more complicated than necessary, but hey, we'd expect no less.</p>
<p><em>Has NOA answered your main questions here? Let us know below if you're looking forward to a return trip to Kanto on Switch next week.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Omega Strikers </em>developer Odyssey Interactive has become the latest studio to be hit by layoffs, with around 50% of the studio's workforce apparently affected.</p><p>That's according to <a href="https://x.com/TotoroIsMyHomie/status/2024579265283706938" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a post</a> by (now-former) Odyssey Interactive artist Jordan Ewing, who says that he, along with "roughly 50% of the team", has been let go. Odyssey itself doesn't appear to have officially confirmed the layoffs anywhere.</p><p>You might recognize Odyssey Interactive's name from "footbrawler" <em>Omega Strikers</em>, which was released in September 2022. Just eight months or so after its launch, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/omega-strikers-will-cease-content-development-8-months-after-release-as-studio-moves-on" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1dfc6fb0-f5c9-4964-89dd-62b8efda69aa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">active content development on <em>Omega Strikers </em>was halted</a>, and the studio pivoted to other projects instead.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>Upon the cessation of regular updates for <em>Omega Strikers</em>, Odyssey pledged to keep the game's servers open so players could continue to play. A quick look at the game's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1869590/charts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steam charts</a> shows a 24-hour peak of just over 200 players.</p><p>To date, <em>Omega Strikers </em>remains Odyssey Interactive's only released game. In September 2024, the developer revealed a platform fighter called <em>Byte Breakers</em>, holding playtesting on Steam despite the admission that the studio "might not even make this game".</p><p>At time of writing, the announcement of <em>Byte Breakers</em>' playtest remains the last video uploaded to the Odyssey YouTube channel, and the status of the project is unknown, although these layoffs don't exactly instil confidence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Odyssey is just the latest in an increasingly long string of developers and publishers to be hit by layoffs. In recent months alone, others include <em>Splinter Cell </em>remake developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="62d2788d-7dd8-425b-8a67-fe5154e140d9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft Toronto</a>, Riot Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2xko-layoffs-riot" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="156c400e-add5-4e40-ad10-9f36c14e77e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>2XKO </em>team</a>, and <em>Ashes of Creation</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ashes-of-creation-layoffs-canceled-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1b59358e-2c0a-4543-a759-154075e27078" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Intrepid Studios</a>.</p><p>The market for competitive live-service games is growing increasingly fierce and cutthroat, and it's becoming more and more common for smaller studios like Odyssey (or, indeed, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/highguard-developer-wildlight-reportedly-lays-off-most-staff" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="662d78d2-0c4f-4bac-903f-7998daba8b76" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Highguard </em>developer Wildlight</a>) to slip through the cracks.</p><p>For now, it seems like Odyssey Interactive remains a going concern, although I sadly can't imagine that the studio has too bright a future ahead of it without a major success under its belt.

<figcaption><em>Burbank </em>was an attempt to reinvent the life sim courtesy of <em>XCOM</em>'s Jake Solomon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Solomon describes <em>Burbank </em>as "life sims + <em>The Truman Show</em>", but he also says the project was "more than that", allowing players to "share whatever stories and characters they can dream up".</p><p>He also confirms that the studio was using generative AI for characters' "memory, reasoning, and speech", which would have been central to <em>Burbank</em>'s systems. However, Solomon says Midsummer "had no interest in replacing <em>any</em> (that's Solomon's stress) developers with AI".</p><p>Alongside Solomon, Midsummer also included luminaries like <em>The Sims </em>producer Grant Rodiek and <em>Marvel's Midnight Suns </em>lead engineer Will Miller. The studio had <a href="https://www.midsummerstudios.com/news/studio-announcement" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">already secured funding</a> for <em>Burbank</em>, so it's not entirely clear why Midsummer has shut down.</p><p>Sadly, Solomon's studio is far from the only one to close without releasing anything.

<p><em>Burbank</em>'s attempt to redefine the life sim genre also isn't the only one that's failed; while it's much less high-profile than <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c822c0ba-3847-4141-97dd-732cffafcf52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Paradox's <em>Life by You</em></a>, it's another name to join that ill-fated project in the life sim graveyard.</p><p>Whether or not Jake Solomon re-emerges with another studio (or as a designer elsewhere) remains to be seen, but at the very least, <em>Burbank </em>is no more, unfortunately.

            <p>Every year, Pokémon holds a presentation to mark the anniversary of the original Pokémon Red and Green titles launching in Japan for Game Boy, and this year is no exception. One thing that does make this February's Pokémon Presents a little different, though, is that this year marks 30 years since Red and Green made their debut.</p>

<p>The Pokémon Company's annual Pokémon Presents broadcast has been confirmed to air next week, on Friday 27th February at 2pm UK time. For those Pikachu fans across the pond, that's 6am Pacific Time, or 9am Eastern.</p>
<p>As to what we can expect, well earlier today the company announced that the remakes of those classic Pokémon Game Boy games from 1996 will arrive on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> on 27th February.

<p>There's also the chance we will see more from Pokémon Pokopia, which is due to be released next month, on 5th March. Pokopia is Pokémon's take on Animal Crossing, and our Alex is already rather taken with the upcoming release.</p><p>"Mechanics I love mashed up with characters and a world I also have a great affinity for," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-hour-with-pokopia-suggests-itll-might-be-the-best-pokemon-spin-off-ever-and-its-more-viva-pinata-than-minecraft-or-animal-crossing">Eurogamer's Pokémon Pokopia preview</a>. " I haven't felt this way about a Pokémon game since Conquest, the 2012 strategy crossover with Nobunaga's Ambition."</p>
<p>We will also probably hear about some updates for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, Pokémon Sleep, Pokémon Unite and Pokémon EX Masters. Perhaps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japans-pokemon-theme-park-is-opening-next-february-and-pikachus-popping-up-in-an-electric-pokemon-ride">something to do with the Pokémon park in Japan</a>? Our Lottie, though, is hopeful we will hear something about Gen 10.</p>
<p>What do you hope to see next week?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Veteran game designer <strong>Jake Solomon</strong>, known mostly for <strong>XCOM: Enemy Unknown</strong>, <strong>XCOM 2</strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-midnight-suns-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel's Midnight Suns</a></strong>, announced the closure of <strong>Midsummer Studios</strong>. Solomon had founded the development team after leaving <strong>Firaxis</strong>. In 2024, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xcoms-jake-solomon-qa-building-a-narrative-driven-life-sim-game-at-midsummer-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I interviewed him to learn more about his next game</a></strong>, a narrative-driven life simulation for which he had already raised $6 million in seed funding.</p>



<p>Rather than going for a traditional sandbox-like approach in the vein of the king of the genre, <strong>The Sims</strong> from <strong>Maxis</strong>, the game was conceived around player-driven storytelling. <strong>It was a systems-based approach where conflict, relationships, and consequences would combine to generate compelling, episodic personal stories</strong>. Characters would have jobs, love lives, and competing desires, with failure treated not as a dead end but as a narrative opportunity, in the spirit of improv theater. <strong>There would be no game-over screen</strong>.<br>The game was designed to be <strong>open-ended and ongoing</strong>, with <strong>no fixed conclusion</strong>, and Solomon expressed hopes that a thriving modding community would emerge over time. It would have been a single-player experience only, built in Unreal Engine 5 with a stylized visual approach, deliberately designed to keep the team small and the production sustainable.</p>



<p>The closure announcement came directly from Solomon, who <a href="https://x.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote a post on X</a> and also shared a brief Pre-Alpha footage of the game, which was codenamed "<strong>Burbank</strong>":</p>



<p><em>We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both. Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios, I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into. It's like "Life Sims + The Truman Show," but it's more than that. I believe people are storytellers, and I want them to share whatever stories and characters they can dream up. Burbank lets you do that.</em></p>



<p><em>We have moments playing this game where characters come alive in a way we've never experienced. And for an old game developer like me that's special. What you're about to see is definitely pre-alpha. But this game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us.</em></p>

</div></figure>



<p>Solomon later admitted that <strong>Burbank's characters used AI for memory, reasoning, and speech</strong>, allowing players to create any characters they wanted and drop them into any story. The art, however, was entirely human-made.</p>



<p>It's yet another closure at a dire time for the gaming industry. Just yesterday, <strong>Sony</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong></a>, the maker of the <strong>Demon's Souls remake</strong>. However, Solomon's studio has perhaps more in common with the <strong>"extinction level event"</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/denis-dyack-defends-ue5-decries-state-of-the-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that was mentioned by <strong>Denis Dyack</strong></a>: the failed <strong>$2 billion deal</strong> between <strong>Embracer Group</strong> and <strong>Savvy Group</strong>, which <strong>flooded the market with prototypes of AA and AAA games</strong>, thus making it much harder for indie studios to get funding.</p>

We don't know what else might be revealed during that show yet.</p><p><em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen </em>are remakes of the original two <em>Pokemon </em>games; while you may remember <em>Pokemon Red and Blue </em>kicking off the franchise, the Japanese versions of the game were actually <em>Red and Green</em>, so the remake stays faithful to those releases.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Nintendo says you'll be able to trade and battle with your friends using local communication, too, so you'll still be able to collect the Pokemon that can only evolve via this method.</p><p>Whether or not <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen</em>'s Switch releases will support <em>Pokemon Home </em>remains to be seen, although I think it'd be a huge misstep if that wasn't the case. Let's hope you can transfer your friends to <em>Home </em>when the games launch.</p><p><em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen</em>'s Switch releases come amid a flurry of activity for the franchise; yesterday, a brand new <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-paldean-wonders-set" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee463c7f-df01-4445-8c97-75dc31184111" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">set was announced</a>, and a range of Lego <em>Pokemon </em>products were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-pokemon-fan-favorites-revealed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="20154363-2140-41d8-aed8-9ac66d983fc8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">also revealed last month</a>.</p><p>Of course, there's also the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-leak" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3eeb790b-1baf-43d8-afe2-99182049c947" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">impending release</a> of the life sim <em>Pokemon Pokopia</em>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-leak-2025-gen-10-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5a709d9-d361-46d9-823d-aa0957eba8ed" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">mounting speculation</a> revolving around the tenth mainline <em>Pokemon </em>generation, which may or may not be revealed during the Presents showcase next week.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what else gets revealed during that Presents show, but for the meantime, <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen </em>launch on Switch on February 27th. It sounds like they'll be standalone releases rather than Switch Online goodies, too.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>Cue the release of a fresh early access trailer by developers Mega Crit, who've also penned a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2868840/view/538879349212840702?l=english">Steam post about the date reveal</a>. "Climb the Spire with a new and returning cast of characters, each with their own cards, motives, and secrets," they wrote. "Make allies of the most ancient of the Spire’s residents, encounter all-new environments, defeat formidable foes, and uncover fragments of the Spire’s past as you ascend it again and again.</p>
<p>"Also, while you can always choose to brave the ascent on your own, up to four players can now team up to face the Spire’s challenges together in an all-new co-op mode. Discover multiplayer-specific cards, powerful team synergies, and carry your friends (or get carried) to victory!" So, you've got a week and a bit to get a gang of mates together if you fancy giving that co-op mode a crack.</p>
<p>The likes of collaborative map-doodling and intense pointing battles over relics await!</p>
<p>Alec (RPS in peace) played 187 hours of the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a> over the course of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slay-the-spire-review">reviewing it</a>, betraying  both how addictively moreish it is and the fact he appears to have had an enviable amount of spare time on his hands.</p><p>"Traditionally, I look at a number like that and hate myself – so much time wasted pursuing incremental item upgrades in an MMO or Diablolike, or, God help me, watching pretend numbers go eternally up in a clicker game," he wrote. "A number like that generally means I lost myself to something unhealthy, like a toddler set loose in a ball-pit full of popping candy. And so I snarl at myself in the mirror, and swear myself off such practices for life. Until the next time.</p>
<p>"I look at those 187 hours in Slay The Spire and I don’t feel that way. I feel... pride? I think 'all that time, and I’m still not tired of this wonderful toy. Do it again, do it again!'"</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>

<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>

<p>We use "physical" hesitantly there, because it seems that this boxed release is still reliant on its included download code if you actually want to, you know, play the game.

<p>The Special Edition includes two reproductions of the original Japanese GBA cases, and a rather swanky trio of laser-engraved glass balls with Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle inside. Putting these balls on their respective stand in the included display case, lets them light up in a fitting green/red/blue hue. <em>Oof</em>.</p>


<p>This release will be available from the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/9900000007430.html">Japanese Pokémon Center online store</a> from <strong>Saturday, 28th February</strong>. Both the FireRed and LeafGreen versions (the only difference being the contents of the download code) will set you back <strong>19,800 yen</strong> — which is roughly <strong>£95 / $127</strong>, <em>gulp</em>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, this is a Japan-only release, with TPC saying that it <em>might</em> be available at physical Pokémon Centers at a later date. So... still Japan-only. Hey, let's keep those fingers crossed for a Western launch at some point down the line, eh?</p>

			<p>This morning, <strong>KOEI TECMO</strong> and <strong>TEAM NINJA</strong> announced that <strong>Nioh 3</strong> has already become a <strong>million-seller</strong> and is, to date, <strong>the fastest-selling game in the action RPG series</strong>. We previously had a glimpse of the game's early success in its concurrent player peak on Steam, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-here-and-in-just-3-hours-it-became-the-most-played-nioh-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which far surpassed its predecessors'</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Another side is the very strong critical reception, which is being celebrated with a dedicated accolades trailer that <strong>prominently features our own review score (9.8/10)</strong>. Earlier this month, Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-3-review-rise-of-the-shogun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained in great detail</a> why he felt <strong>Nioh 3 is the Japanese developer's best work yet</strong>:</p>



<p><em>Nioh 3 is the culmination of Team NINJA’s evolution. By masterfully blending the engaging exploration of an open-field structure with a deep, dual-style combat system that bridges the gap between 'Masocore' and character-action, it has evolved into a genre of its own. While technical issues hold the game back, it is the definitive samurai fantasy and a modern masterpiece of action design.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>The only real downsides are the performance issues, although that's not exactly surprising given that <strong>KOEI TECMO and TEAM NINJA have historically always struggled in this area</strong>. In Wccftech's technical analysis and graphics tuning guide, Sebastian Castellanos <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/nioh-3-pc-graphics-tuning-guide-how-to-get-the-best-experience-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Frankly, Nioh 3 underwhelms when it comes to its achieved balance between visual fidelity and performance — and that’s disappointing for a AAA PC title released in 2026. Despite generally strong reviews for its combat systems and world design, the PC port still carries forward some of the same technical shortcomings that plagued previous Team Ninja releases: subpar optimization on both the CPU and GPU, and an engine that struggles to present a stable experience unless the game is locked to fixed framerates.</em></p>



<p><em>The Katana Engine’s sensitivity to non-standard framerates results in noticeable judder and uneven camera motion when your framerate isn't holding at a steady framerate figure, and many players are still reporting performance issues even on fairly powerful hardware. These issues are not minor tweaking details — they are foundational to the core gameplay feel, and it’s frankly unacceptable that a AAA 2026 PC release ships in this state, requiring players to lock framerates or rely heavily on upscaling/frame generation just to achieve a semblance of stability.</em></p>



<p><em>In short, while Nioh 3 unquestionably has depth and quality in its combat and systems, those strengths are strongly let down by a technical package that feels unfinished and insufficiently optimized. In the modern PC landscape — where much better-looking titles offer solid uncapped performance, smooth frametimes, and correct behavior with fluctuating framerates — Nioh 3 feels like a step backward. Until game updates from Team Ninja or community mods address these issues in a meaningful way, getting a truly impressive visuals to performance balance out of this game remains an uphill battle.</em></p>

<p>His name's Count Strahd von Zarovich and I hear his antics are fairly well known in <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Strahd_von_Zarovich">Dungeons and Dragons parts</a>. In this mod, '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/21485">Dinner With Strahd - A Curse of Strahd Story Mod</a>', this charming fellow invites Tav and their mates to his home in Barovia so he can quiz them about their brain tadpoles over tea and biscuits.</p>
<p>As part of this extra adventure, you can explore Strahd's digs in Castle Ravenloft. According to modder Ocelot, "over 600 fully voiced and animated lines of dialogue" await, as well as some battles and loot. There's also the chance to punch Strahd in the face at one point, and Ocelot's teased "something secret for the Strahd romancers". So, both camps of people who've long been fantasising about doing something to the powerful ancient vampire's body.</p><p>There are clearly a plenty of Strahd fantasisers among BG3's modding community too, since this Strahd mini-campaign is separate to <a href="https://x.com/ProjectStrahd">Project Strahd</a>, one of the many ambitious custom campaign projects for Larian's RPG which have been making some waves online for the past year or so.</p>
<p>Ocelot recommends installing Dinner With Strahd via <a href="https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager">LaughingLeader's Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager</a>. Once you've done so, the new storyline begins when you meet a woman next to a cart and ox in Rivington, the first region you pass through on your way to the city of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> in the game's third act. The modder's handily included one of their own tiefling bard saves at the start of that act in the mod's optional files, in case you lack your own and want to jump straight into the mod's quest.</p>
<p>They've also got plenty of plans to expand their creation in future, via the likes of adding more characters and rooms to Castle Ravenloft, as well as giving its vampires proper fangs.</p>
