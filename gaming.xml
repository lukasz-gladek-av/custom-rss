            <p>Is your Zone more Anomaly-rich than it should be? Are your corpses uncannily airborne? Do your comrades have dodgy teeth, and not in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-first-patch-is-coming-next-week-though-my-favourite-parts-are-still-the-imperfections">a good way</a>? Do bits of your HUD keep disappearing? Be of good cheer, for GSC Game World have released the first proper <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</a>: Heart Of Chornbyl update, which patches out over 650 different bugs and issues. These range from more significant problems such as crashing and progression-blockers in certain missions, to relatively negligible stuff like wonky NPC voice volume during storms.</p><!--more-->
<p>The update makes a few changes to the game’s NPC AI, but the developers note that they’re still “working on fixing the A-Life bugs, which will be addressed in future patches”. "A-Life" refers to the game’s sprawling NPC life simulation, whereby factions of wasteland survivors and packs of mutants move around and scrap over living space without the player’s intervention. That’s the idea, anyway. As Brendy wrote earlier in the week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-devs-insist-complex-ai-simulation-of-enemy-patrols-is-in-the-game-its-just-broken%E2%80%9D">A-Life isn’t working as desired right now</a>, to the point that some players think it’s all a massive wind-up.</p>
<p>The developers have also tweaked the balance somewhat, reducing the HP of certain enemies while pumping up limbshot damage and melee swinging distance. That’s on top of tweaks to weapon and armour pricing and repair costs.</p>
<p>You can find a partial list of the many, many changes in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455844537830474617">this Steam post</a>. In keeping with recently invented RPS tradition, I’m going to pluck the stranger bullet points from the changelog‘s shrapnel-riddled carcass and display them below as my very own Greatest Hits. It’s not quite Baldur’s Gate 3 levels of eccentricity, but I enjoy the idea of several of the below happening simultaneously:</p><blockquote><p>

- Fixed stretched or missing limbs on humanoid corpses.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed physics issues with destructible and movable objects, including those floating in the air.
</p>
<p>
- Added missing footage to TV displays in the final cutscene.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed issue when combat music was still playing while combat was finished.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed issue when NPCs would move to A-pose or start flying after death.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed issue when NPCs could not track whether a target in cover was covered from shots, which caused them to shoot into cover.
</p>
<p>

- Fixed a bug that allows to sell items to the trader for more money that they actually cost.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed issue when Burer could drop any mission items out of the player's hands.
</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/buffer-weight-stock-in-black-ops-6-guide-how-to-unlock-how-to-use-what-it-does/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Buffer Weight Stock attachment in Black Ops 6 is another in a long line of optional gear you can add to your favorite guns. It doesn’t apply to all though, and there’s confusion about how it works. This guide covers the Buffer Weight Stock unlock requirements, how to equip it, and explains its effects.</p>



<p>I yearn for the old days of CoD where attachments were limited. You relied more on your skill and the default characteristics of the weapon, rather than turning it into a bespoke beast. Nevertheless, each new Call of Duty title has a mountain of attachments available for each gun, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/">Black Ops 6</a> has added the Buffer Weight Stock to add to the possibilities.</p>



<p>This new attachment links directly to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-hit-list-event-release-date-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hit List Event</a> in Black Ops 6, and there’s plenty to dive into.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-buffer-weight-stock-attachment-do-in-black-ops-6">What Does the Buffer Weight Stock Attachment do in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sweet recoil control. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Black Ops 6’s Buffer Weight Stock offers <strong>huge increases to Vertical and Horizontal Recoil Control</strong>—making any respective weapon it’s attached to much more accurate.</p>



<p>Here’s the pros and cons of the attachment.</p>



<h3 id="h-pros">Pros</h3>



<ul>
<li>Vertical and Horizontal Recoil Control x3</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-cons">Cons</h3>



<ul>
<li>Aim Down Sight Speed x1</li>



<li>Aim Walking Movement Speed x1</li>
</ul>



<p>Stock attachments usually help ADS, hip-fire spread, and other movement stats. This makes the Buffer Weight Stock extremely unique, and along with a Barrel attachment—and other accuracy-aiding attachments—you can turn your gun into a veritable laser beam.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-buffer-weight-stock-attachment-in-black-ops-6">How to Unlock Buffer Weight Stock Attachment in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p><strong>The Buffer Weight Stock automatically unlocked</strong> once Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 players collectively <strong>reached 8 billion Community Eliminations in the Hit List Event.</strong></p>



<p>The Hist List Event is the first proper event of Black Ops 6. A bunch of rewards and bonuses await those who take part. The super-secret <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-veteran-perk-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Veteran Perk</a> is one, and the Buffer Weight Stock is another.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick look at the scoring system, and what everyone needed to do to reach 8 billion community Eliminations:</p>



<ul>
<li>A Black Ops 6 multiplayer kill counts equals one Elimination.</li>



<li>Five Black Ops 6 Zombies kills equals one Elimination.</li>



<li>One Warzone kill equals five Eliminations.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-equip-buffer-weight-stock-attachment-in-black-ops-6">How to Equip Buffer Weight Stock Attachment in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Only three guns in Black Ops 6 are compatible with the Buffer Weight Stock: The <strong>XM4 Assault Rifle</strong>, <strong>XMG Light-Machine Gun</strong>, and <strong>DM-10 Marksman Rifle</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick guide on how to add it to your gun:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the Black Ops 6 multiplayer menu screen.</li>



<li>Scroll across to the <strong>Weapons </strong>tab.</li>



<li>Press on <strong>Loadouts</strong>.</li>



<li>Choose the loadout you want to use the Buffer Weight Stock attachment with.</li>



<li>Select the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/">XM4</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xmg-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XMG</a>, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-dm-10-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DM-10</a> as your primary weapon.</li>



<li>Click on the weapon’s <strong>Gunsmith</strong> option.</li>



<li>Scroll across to <strong>Stock </strong>and press on it.</li>



<li>Finally, go down the list until you get to Buffer Weight Stock and click on it to equip it!</li>
</ol>

		<p>Slow Game Club has opened its doors today, and it is a brand new subscription venture set up by Into Games. Unlike other subscription services, Slow Game Club is more like a book club and will provide subscribers with one new game a month, plus access to a Discord channel to discuss the games, and a video podcast where the developers of each month’s game will talk about its development.</p>
<p><iframe title="Slow Game Club Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZcQh2SZYRS0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Slow Game Club will have a limit on the number of memberships available, with Into Games confirming that there will only ever be a maximum of 1500 subscribers to the service. Into Games is a non-profit organisation with all the subscription fees going back into helping young people from low income backgrounds to build a career within the games industry. There are two membership types up for sale. The first is the Noir &amp; Mystery Annual sub, which will give access to the 12 games for 2025, access to the Discord, the developer podcasts, and the bonus game of The Holy Gosh Darn. This is discounted to £29.99, but the regular price is £44.99. The Noir &amp; Mystery Gift bundle includes all of the features of the annual sub, plus a Slow Game Club tote bag and Christmas card. This is currently priced at £49.99 with a regular price of £49.99.</p>
<p>All of the games that will be part of the Slow Game Club Noir &amp; Mystery package will have a RRP of £19.99 and a 70% or more review rating. All games will only be redeemable through Steam. Into Games has also stated that if a game you receive is one you already own, there will be no refunds but you are free to gift the code to someone else. The keys will always be sent on the first of the month via email, except for January’s which will be sent on the 3rd of January.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-5m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-hits-5m.1048224/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Focus Entertainment has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>player count has hit a pretty impressive milestone just under three months after the game's initial launch.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1862442675590377854" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on social media platform X</a>, Focus says that&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>has attracted five million players since its release on September 9th. The studio specifically hasn't framed this number as sales, so it's possible it includes those who are streaming the game as part of subscription services like GeForce Now.</p>

<p>Still, five million players is pretty solid, and it's likely the bulk of that number is players who've bought the game, so Focus and Saber can rest assured that they've kept the legacy of original&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>developer Relic Entertainment (which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-relic-entertainment-layoffs" rel="nofollow">recently went independent</a>) intact.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-fight.jpg?itok=GRYEJTDP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-fight.jpg?itok=-T3M2HQp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>proves there's still an audience for good old-fashioned games.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>was originally announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" rel="nofollow">during the 2021 Game Awards ceremony</a>, alongside the likes of Bokeh Game Studio's&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>and Remedy's&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>.</p>

<p>It sees original game protagonist Captain Titus making a return, although this time, he's not battling the greenskin hordes; instead, he's fighting Tyranids, as well as Chaos Space Marines.</p>

<p>Story-wise, the game sees Titus disgraced following the events of the original game. After serving his penance, Titus is admitted back into the Ultramarines chapter, where he's tasked with exterminating a Tyranid infestation on the planet of Kadaku.</p>




<p>In gameplay terms,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>&nbsp;is, much like its predecessor, a third-person shooter that emphasises both ranged and melee combat. Titus has access to a variety of&nbsp;lore-faithful weapons, including the all-important bolter, as well as a chainsword and a range of explosives.</p>

            <p>
Six weeks after Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-pulls-11-xbox-game-pass-trial-ahead-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release">yanked its £1/$1 Game Pass trial</a> in the run-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s release, the deal has now been reinstated as part of the company's Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions - but only for PC.
</p>
<p>
As was the case prior to the offer's removal, that £1/$1 <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/xbox-game-pass">provides 14 days</a> to explore PC Game Pass' catalogue (sadly, Microsoft isn't reverting to the month-long variant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-11-xbox-game-pass-offer-cut-from-a-month-to-14-days">last seen in August 2023</a>). After that, trial members will be automatically signed up to a recurring monthly subscription unless they disable auto-renewal ahead of time.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's next big first-party release, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, arrives on 9th December, meaning it'll be available to play as part of PC Game Pass' newly revived trial. Console players, however, will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">need to pay full whack for Xbox Games Pass Ultimate</a> if they want to play via subscription on launch day.

<p>
The PC Game Pass trial is one of a number of discounts Microsoft has announced as part of its Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotion. It's also knocking <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-series-s/942j774tp9jn?icid=Cat-Xbox-CC1-XSS512GB-White-P93113-Holiday25-BF25&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">£50 off the 512GB Xbox Series S</a> and Xbox Series S Family &amp; Friends bundle, and there's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-series-x-certified-refurbished/8zj26xj5cr3q?icid=Cat-Xbox-CC3-XSXBSKU-P92988-Holiday25-BF25&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">£40 off refurbished consoles</a> too.
</p><p>
Additionally, there's 20 percent of a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/collections/xboxcontrollers?icid=Cat-Xbox-CC2-XWLC-P93114-Holiday25-BF25">selection of Xbox controllers</a> - including the Sky Cipher and Ghost Cipher variants - plus <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-series-x-console-wraps/8x08lwws1qh7">50 percent off the Xbox Series X Mineral Camo wrap</a> if you happen to live in a coral reef and are looking to try and disguise your machine.
</p>
<p>
Finally, those searching for something to play on their gently discounted new consoles can get "up to" 55 percent off a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/deals/games/xbox?icid=Cat-Xbox-CC6-XboxDigitalGames-DGS-Holiday25-BF25">variety of digital games on the Microsoft Store</a>. Mostly, these are older, lesser-known indies, but you'll find a couple of Like a Dragon titles in their too.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft notes its hardware offers will come to an end on 2nd December, but it sounds like the PC Game Pass trial will be sticking around for longer.

            <p>Back when Digital Extremes were largely known for collaborating with Epic Games on the Unreal Tournament series, they made a little game called Dark Sector. Released in 2008, it's part of the fine tradition of post-Gears double-A actioners that basically consist of taking a gruff man, throwing him into a world of grit, gravel and burning oil drums, and handing him a murderous gimmick. Dark Sector's gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The result? A pretty forgettable video game. This is the first time anybody at Rock Paper Shotgun has ever posted specifically about Dark Sector, in fact. But Dark Sector's stature, if not its quality, has swelled in hindsight - for it's sort of the 'original version' of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a>, the absurdly over-dressed free-to-play shooter that hopefully needs no introduction. If you're a Warframer who's up for a roady-run down memory lane, Digital Extremes are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29900/Dark_Sector/">currently giving Dark Sector away on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Dark Sector takes place in an approximately real-world, present-day setting, albeit one full of "Technocyte" bioweapons, but it was once envisaged as a sci-fi, outer-space affair in which you'd play a character with a fancy mechsuit.</p>
<p>Digital Extremes eventually dialled the sci-fi elements back to make the story more relatable to players of the era - this was the mid-noughties, don't forget, when every game had to vaguely resemble a less-good Bruce Willis film. But after releasing Dark Sector, they dug up their original notes and spun them out into the concept for Warframe. There are a few reverential nods to Dark Sector in the latter, including a fancier species of glaive.</p><p>If you're enticed by Dark Sector's sheer OK-ness, you'll want to get your skates on. It's free only till Saturday November 30th at 9am PT, 12pm ET, 5pm GMT and 6pm CET. The thinking behind the discount is to celebrate Warframe's forthcoming 1999 expansion, which takes the series back in time. Look out for that in December. I'm personally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframe-has-the-bones-of-a-great-action-rpg-but-im-enjoying-it-partly-because-it-feels-too-late-to-enjoy-warframe#comments">more interested in Digital Extremes' fantasy RPG Soulframe right now than Warframe</a>, largely because after 10 years of updates, Warframe feels too big and knotty to get my head around.</p>
<p>If you're unconvinced by Dark Sector, even at the low, low price of nada multiplied by nothing, I have a bonus ancient Digital Extremes game to share - The Darkness 2, which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/67370/The_Darkness_II/">is currently 80% off</a>. This one's a sequel to the Starbreeze game about the trenchcoat gangster with snake hands, and it's actually quite decent - decent enough to make Alec Meer's (RPS in peace) old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-average-action-games-on-pc">Celebration Of Perfectly Average Action Games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The release date of the upcoming Intel Battlemage graphics cards has seemingly been leaked. According to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/exclusive-intel-arc-battlemage-to-launch-december-12th" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>, the first set of next-gen GPUs from Intel are set to release on December 12.</p>



<p>The date would back up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rumors of a reveal</a> coming before the end of the year.</p>



<p>Videocardz’s report claims that the announcement of Intel Battlemage will happen on December 3. The first launch of the Limited Edition GPU along with first reviews will happen on December 12. That will be quickly followed by board partner reviews on December  13.</p>



<p>As far as what graphics cards are releasing, it’s expected to first be the Intel Arc B580 and B570. Over the last few weeks, specs for the Intel Arc B580 have regularly leaked out through various means. The GPU is expected to feature 20 Xe2 cores with a 2.8 GHz clock speed and 12GB GDDR6 VRAM. The Arc B570, on the other hand, has been relatively unknown aside from an expected core count of roughly 18 Xe2 cores. </p>



<p>While the Arc B580 and B570 are expected to be the mid-range offerings from Intel this generation, there’s been no mention of a lower-end or higher-end model from the company. Should those exist, they could either be revealed during the December 3rd announcement, or during a separate reveal altogether.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Intel for comment on the Battlemage release date claims. As of publishing, no response has been received. </p>

            <p>Yet another <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> Ultimate Raid world first challenge has been scuppered by cheaters, who were busted due to a single pixel.</p>
<p>Ultimate Raids are the toughest missions in the MMORPG, with many groups competing to be the first to complete them in an unofficial, community-led challenge. The recent patch 7.1 added another Ultimate Raid, Futures Rewritten, which became the third in a row to be impacted by scandalous cheaters.</p>
<p>The winning team was<a href="https://x.com/FrostyMog/status/1862341016126124204"> GRIND</a>, as shared by MogTalk creator and World Race tracker Frosty, at least initially. It soon transpired the team had been using a cheat hack, which was spotted due to a single pixel.</p>

<p>The incriminating pixel, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-14-world-first-raiders-busted-immediately-for-cheating-thanks-to-a-single-pixel-in-a-screenshot-making-it-the-3rd-scuffed-ultimate-race-in-a-row/">PC Gamer</a> explained, is indicative of the Pixel Perfect Plus plugin, which shows a character's exact hitbox. That's particularly useful when dodging AoE attacks in an Ultimate Raid, where the sheer number of attacks across battle arenas increases the difficulty dramatically.</p>
<p>Of course, third-party plugins are not allowed in Final Fantasy 14. As a result, Frosty has disqualified GRIND from the race.</p>

<p>Instead, <a href="https://x.com/FrostyMog/status/1862403138772189577">Kindred</a> has been awarded the world first clear of Future Rewritten. Frosty does note, however, that conversations must be had around the community-led challenge. Not all challengers stream their attempts (they wouldn't want others to copy), but that certainly makes it harder to police cheaters.</p><p>What's remarkable is that this is the third Ultimate Raid challenge in a row to be impacted by cheaters. Last year's world first clear of The Omega Protocol was revoked once it transpired the raid group was using third-party mods; the year before's Dragonsong's Reprise was a similar story.</p>
<p>After both of those challenges, director and producer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> shared his disappointment at the use of third-party mods.</p>
<p>"It is extremely disappointing for me personally to see this commotion surrounding third-party tools once again in the wake of what happened with Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)," he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-extremely-disappointed-in-final-fantasy-14-mod-use">wrote last year</a>. "As the individual who is entrusted with full supervision over Final Fantasy 14, it is my responsibility to enact countermeasures and police the use of these tools, as well as educate people to not use these types of third-party tools - this is especially unfortunate when I, as a gamer, am cheering on everyone who is learning this content by trial and error and putting in the effort to clear."</p>
<p>No such statement has yet been made following this year's controversy.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-cracks-down-on-final-fantasy-14-mods-as-director-promises-to-enhance-hud">Yoshida said the Final Fantasy 14 team</a> would "review the most prominent tools, and in order to discourage their use, endeavour to enhance the functionality of the HUD". And yet two years on, the use of these tools prevails.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencents-light-of-motiram-has-strong-we-have-horizon-at-home-energy.1048173/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tencent and subsidiary Polaris Quest have announced&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, an open-world survival-crafter coming to PC, PS5, and mobile devices sometime next year, and it bears more than a passing resemblance to a certain PlayStation franchise.</p>

<p>In a press release, Polaris Quest and Tencent describe <i>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</i>as an "open-world multiplayer survival game" set in a "lush world dominated by mechanical beasts". I'm sure that you can guess <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn" rel="nofollow">which PlayStation franchise</a> it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west" rel="nofollow">jostling against</a> from that description.</p>

<p>Said press release also promises a "dynamic, impactful combat system" in&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, as well as "saga-worthy boss fights" with elemental weaknesses you'll have to exploit alongside your "mechanimal" friends.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/light-of-motiram-tencent-horizon-creatures.jpg?itok=7HTzJn3g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/light-of-motiram-tencent-horizon-creatures.jpg?itok=Uu3FjUHb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Light of Motiram</em>'s PC and console release is on the...uh, the cards for next year.</figcaption></figure><p>It's probably worth pointing out at this stage that if you haven't figured it out already, the PlayStation franchise with which&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>seems to share its mechanical DNA is, of course, Guerrilla's&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>The game's "mechanimals" are strikingly similar to&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>'s creatures, right down to the soothing blue light that appears to represent their vision and the articulated limbs and appendages the creatures seem to have.</p>

<p>However, gameplay-wise, it seems like&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>will differ quite a bit from Guerrilla's series; it won't be a single-player action-adventure game with RPG elements, but a free-to-play survival-crafter with base-building and a multiplayer focus. Whether that's an improvement, I'll leave up to you to decide.</p>

<p>Polaris Quest and Tencent are promising "realistic physics simulation" in which every object in the game is subject to a physics engine, as well as weather systems you'll need to respond to in order to emerge victorious against the mechanimals and survive in&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>'s world.</p>




<p>Tencent's game will also differ in a few other key ways; you can enlist mechanimals to help you in combat and crafting, for instance, and you'll also unlock new crafting recipes as you take down bosses, so it looks like you can throw&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>into the mix as well. Jolly good!</p>

<p><em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on PC and "console platforms" next year. Some reports based on Chinese social media&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/mechanimal-open-world-survival-crafting-game-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">seem to indicate</a> this means PS5 only, and that the game is coming to mobile devices too, but the press release doesn't specify. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam right now</a> if you like.</p>

            <p>If you don't secretly spend most afternoons plotting an eventual career change to one where you're surrounded by animals, then I'm sorry, but you're just not welcome in the RPS treehouse. Today, Kiera is taking a definitive step forward in that plan: she's departing RPS for a new playthrough of life, one where the animal sliders are all cranked up to max. Join us in saying fare-thee-well below.</p><!--more-->
<p>Kiera joined the guides branch of the treehouse just over a year ago, and along with fellow new hire Jeremy she was promptly baptised in that familiar river of hot magma known as "this year's Call Of Duty". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023">50-odd gun guides later</a>, she solo-led our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-tips-and-tricks">Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora</a> guides coverage with a series of clear and carefully-written guides that made it look like she'd been here for years, not weeks. I'm planning a playthrough of Avatar soon and I'll for sure be dipping into her guides for that.</p>
<p>Then the new year came around, and thank goodness Kiera was around so she could help us tackle the googly-eyed mammoth that was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-tips-and-tricks">Palworld</a>. Kiera spent a brain-melting number of hours delving into that gigantic game, resurfacing only to send me a new link to another expansive guide on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-ice-pals">best Ice Pals</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-electric-pals">best Electric Pals</a>, even comprehensive lists on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-pal-list">where to find all 137 Pal types</a>... It can't have been easy, nor particularly fun I'd wager, but the quality of her work never wavered. And then she went through the same thing with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragons-dogma-2-walkthrough">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, churning out excellent guides like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragons-dogma-2-romance-gifts">this one on the game's romance and affinity systems</a>.</p>
<p>The same was true for the countless updates and refreshes of older guides that Kiera took care of over these past 12 months. Everything from our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> primers to our vast number of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> guides has been improved over the past year, thanks largely to Kiera's tireless work to keep everything as up-to-date and easy to follow as possible. Juggling new releases, old update projects, and the ever-present burden of thinking up hints every day for our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wordle">Wordle</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/connections">Connections</a> guides is far from easy, but she always got it done, and she did great work every time.</p><p>Despite the workload, she also found time for some lovely bespoke pieces on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-made-the-witchy-cottage-of-my-dreams-in-tiny-glade">making a witchy cottage in Tiny Glade</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-to-recreate-stray-in-lethal-company-with-disastrous-results">attempting to recreate Stray in Lethal Company</a>. It's a shame that 2024 dropped so many gigantic bombshells of work upon us, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-best-weapons">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-best-syndicate">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-veilguard-romance-options">Dragon Age: Veilguard</a>, because I'd have loved Kiera to have had more time to write more of these weird and wonderful posts throughout the year. That said, even in the midst of a stupidly busy and tumultuous year, Kiera still found time to write great guides on smaller games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palia-money-making-tips">Palia</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lightyear-frontier-carrying-capacity-upgrade">Lightyear Frontier</a>, games which we can't often cover but still deserve love and attention.</p>
<p>Please join me in saying farewell to Kiera in the comments below. We usually say that once you leave the treehouse you're dead to us, but in this case, we'll welcome her back every so often in exchange for some good doggo photos, and more pictures of exquisitely painted miniatures with large froggy posteriors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Calling fellow trainers, the Venusaur Drop Event has landed in Pokémon TCG Pocket. We knew it was coming, and the content drop has graciously brought unreleased Promo-A cards, the chance to open more Packs, and a whole lot more—and this detailed guide covers everything you need to know.</p>



<p>The Lapras EX Drop Event in early November was a big success in Pokémon TCG Pocket. New battles were added, and we all had the chance to earn special Promo Cards—including a very viable Lapras card. As we head to the Christmas season, Pokémon TCG Pocket has dropped an early present with the Venusaur Drop Event, and we knew it was coming thanks to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future expansion leaks</a>.</p>



<p>It has lots in common with the Lapras Drop Event but offers entirely new rewards and opportunities in Pokémon TCG Pocket. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-venusaur-drop-event-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">What is the Venusaur Drop Event in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s get these cards. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Venusaur Drop Event is a limited-time promotion in Pokémon TCG Pocket offering new <strong>Solo Battles</strong>, <strong>rewards</strong>, and <strong>Promo-A cards</strong>, that haven’t been available until now, <strong>starting on Nov. 29</strong> and finishing on <strong>Dec. 12</strong>.</p>



<p>With the Venusaur Drop Event lasting two weeks, there’s plenty of time to get involved. FOMO shouldn’t apply here, but in any case, make sure you complete the battles and try to earn all possible rewards.</p>



<p>Keep an eye on your Event Stamina, because if you run out, <strong>you have to wait to try another battle!</strong></p>







<p>Five new Promo A cards can be gotten in Pokémon TCG Pocket: <strong>Venusaur, Greninja, Haunter, Onix, </strong>and <strong>Jigglypuff</strong>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-promo-10-mewtwo-card-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mewtwo 10 Promo Card</a> still isn’t ready; however, you can grab these new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-promo-a-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Promo A cards</a> for your collection.

<p>Completing Venusaur Drop Event Solo Battles rewards you with <strong>Promo Packs</strong>, <strong>Shinedust</strong>, <strong>Shop Tickets</strong>, <strong>Event Hourglasses</strong>, <strong>Pack Hourglasses</strong>, and <strong>Wonder Hourglasses</strong>.</p>



<p>Each difficulty level in the Venusaur Drop Event grants “First-time Rewards,” “Chance Rewards,” and goodies for successfully beating Battle Tasks. Regardless of the difficulty, the Chance Rewards stay the same:</p>



<ul>

        <p>BBC investigation shows just two of Play Store's 45 highest-grossing games adhered to ASA standards.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The most popular mobile games "are being advertised without disclosing they contain loot boxes".</p>
<p>That's according to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c748ww9y9nno">BBC</a>, which said an investigation into the top 45 highest-grossing games on the Google Play store discovered just two games correctly advertised that they contained randomised in-game purchases.</p>

<p>Of the 45 investigated, 26 games were labelled in the online store as including loot boxes, 22 of which "were being actively advertised at the same time". Only two of those 22 games properly disclosed loot boxes in their advertising, with the Play Store's highest-grossing game, Monopoly Go, "among those not to mention random in-game purchases in its adverts".</p><p>"In the absence of robust regulation in gaming, it is essential for games to provide clear and transparent information about their features, allowing both parents and gamers to make informed decisions," said Dr Jane Rigbye, chief executive of Young Gamers and Gamblers Education Trust, adding the findings were "deeply concerning".</p>
<p>In a separate statement, the ASA told the BBC: "This is an ongoing area of our work, and we're closely monitoring the sector to discover the scale of compliance and act accordingly."</p>
<p>This time last year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-games-industry-to-restrict-access-to-loot-boxes-for-children">UK games industry agreed to restrict access to in-game loot boxes for children</a> via a set of industry guidelines.</p>
<p>The industry's trade association UKIE worked with the UK government to draft 11 Industry Principles as part of "improved protections for children, young people and adults following concerns raised about loot boxes". The Principles include the need to flag the existence of loot boxes in a game prior to purchase, a clear list of the probabilities for loot box contents, and the need for an easy refund policy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-inquisitions-final-expansion-originally-forced-you-to-blow-up-skyhold<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
An early plan for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>'s climactic Trespasser expansion would have seen players forced to blow up their beloved base, Skyhold.
</p>
<p>
Skyhold is where the bulk of Inquisition is set - a towering, upgradable and expandable castle that fills up with your close companions and other followers, and acts as a hub for the Inquisitor in their fight back against Corypheus. It's the game's equivalent to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>'s Normandy, and is a big reason why many fans love the game.
</p>
<p>
Newly-posted concept art from Trespasser's early days shows Skyhold was once set to be sacrificed during the events of the expansion in dramatic style - something that would have fitted the add-on's narrative arc, perhaps, though would also have been heart-wrenching for players after 100 hours building it up.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, Dragon Age veteran Matt Rhodes <a href="https://x.com/mattrhodesart/status/1862140792527085614">revealed</a> that Skyhold was due to be blown up in "an earlier version of the story". 
</p>
<p>
"Sten would arrive to arrest you for meddling with magic, but Dagna has reverse engineering their explosives," Rhodes wrote. "You leave a trap for when they return, sacrificing Skyhold in the process."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">From Inquisition’s Trespasser DLC<br>An earlier version of the story. Sten would arrive to arrest you for meddling with magic, but Dagna has reverse engineering their explosives. You leave a trap for when they return, sacrificing Skyhold in the process. <a href="https://t.co/0gTrLB4fiI">pic.twitter.com/0gTrLB4fiI</a></p>— Matt Rhodes (@mattrhodesart) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattrhodesart/status/1862140792527085614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
Long-term Dragon Age fans will remember Qunari warrior Sten from earlier games. Ultimately, he did not appear in Inquisition or Trespasser at all.
</p>
<p>
At a guess, it sounds like this might have happened at the start of Trespasser, which ultimately still does not feature Skyhold. Instead, it begins with the action moved elsewhere from the off.
</p>
<p>
The launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> has brought back a wave of nostalgia from developers who worked on the series previously, with insight from franchise creator David Gaider recently shining a light on the characters of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-writer-probably-cried-harder-than-i-ever-have-in-my-life-writing-dorians-story">Dorian</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-creator-discusses-taking-on-inquisitions-cassandra-after-original-writer-left-amidst-abuse">Cassandra</a>.
</p>
<p>
Rhodes, meanwhile, previously shared concept art showing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-had-dragon-age-the-veilguards-look-nailed-10-years-ago">BioWare had the look of Dragon Age: The Veilguard's Minrathous nailed down a decade ago</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-fortnite-chapter-6-trailer-leaks-early-shows-off-godzilla/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Fortnite Chapter 6 launch trailer has leaked early, and has revealed that Godzilla and some other bosses will be making their way into the incredibly popular Battle Royale. The trailer has yet to be officially released by Epic Games, but data miners did what they do best and found it within the game files, as seen on the <a href="https://x.com/Guille_GAG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X account Guille_GAG</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Chapter 6 Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gwo6rD62Gsc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this new gameplay trailer, you get to see a glimpse at some of the new skins and bosses that will be available in the upcoming Chapter. You also get to see Godzilla, who is walking around the map, according to the trailer. At the moment, it's uncertain whether Godzilla is a boss that you'll be able to take down in Fortnite, but considering that the new map is Japan-inspired, it seems likely that he will be. Some of the other bosses you get to see in the trailer include a samurai, a demon mask, and a giant turtle. Although considering how cute the giant turtle is, it's more hopeful that it's a form of transportation rather than something you have to take down.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 is going to be a pretty big deal in the Fortnite community, as it's set to revamp the game significantly. However, there are some features that are being brought back in this chapter that are familiar and have been in the game previously. This includes Samurai swords. From what little is seen in the trailer of them, it seems that they are used functionally the same as they were when they were previously in the game.</p>
<p>A Japan-inspired map isn't exactly new to Fortnite either, as there was a Japanese-themed biome in Chapter 4, and some of the architecture seen in the trailer feels very similar to the buildings in Chapter 4.</p>
<p>Moving on from similarities, Big Hero 6's Baymax will also be coming to Fortnite and will be available via the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-crew-grants-all-fortnite-passes-and-more-from-december-1/">Chapter 6 Season 1 battle pass</a>, where you'll get to do his signature 'Balalala' as an emote. There also seem to be some new Mask items that players will be able to get, as well as the ability to wall jump. This all seems very much to do with the Samurai vibe that they have going on in this new Chapter and will allow a new way to engage in combat as players will be able to climb over a wall and immediately start shooting or swinging their swords, as seen in the trailer.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 is set to launch this weekend, and it's likely we'll see some more details emerge about the upcoming Chapter in the next day or so.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-funding-750m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-citizen-funding-passes-750m-amid-layoff-rumors.1048107/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-funding-750m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Crowdfunding for space sim&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>has passed yet another mammoth milestone, but rumors are flying that suggest things may not be rosy at developer Cloud Imperium Games.</p>

<p>A quick look at&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen</em>'s <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">funding page</a> shows that the game has passed the eye-watering $750 million mark, meaning that cumulatively, players have given almost a billion dollars to&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>since its crowdfunding campaign began in 2012.</p>

<p>The funding page is insistent in its declaration that funding for&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>"goes directly to the game's development", although frankly, I can't quite envision a game that costs over $750 million to make and still hasn't been properly released after over a decade of development.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-citizen-funding-firefight.jpg?itok=lQpIjkE- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-citizen-funding-firefight.jpg?itok=mbon8Z5b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Believe it or not, people are still giving money to&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only is <i>Star Citizen</i>'s development continuing with no real sign of a 1.0 release, but rumors are flying that developer Cloud Imperium Games may actually be laying staff off.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloud-imperium-games-layoffs-report/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson</a>, who cites an ex-CIG employee <a href="https://x.com/Gillyburd1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on social media platform X</a>&nbsp;(whose posts are locked for non-approved followers), Cloud Imperium has let "a lot of staff go over the last two days with zero compensation" following its annual CitizenCon event.</p>

<p>That's after the developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-debacle-crunch-report" rel="nofollow">reportedly mandated</a>&nbsp;seven-day work weeks for staff in the runup to CitizenCon, promising time off in lieu in return for working the weekends of October 5th and 12th. That report didn't seem to suggest that Cloud Imperium had offered staff a choice in this matter.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Cloud Imperium has been in trouble in the last few months, either. Back in July, a tribunal found that the studio had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal" rel="nofollow">discriminated against a disabled worker</a> for mandating a return to the office without making adequate preparations for that worker's disability.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-citizen-funding-ship.jpg?itok=EpBD3f4j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-citizen-funding-ship.jpg?itok=zAZy5mdg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>is an odd project indeed.</figcaption></figure><p>In any case, if you do want to follow the development of&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>or you'd like to give money to Cloud Imperium for some reason, you can <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/star-citizen" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">do so here via the official website</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-gets-limited-chinese-closed-beta-test/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The upcoming title by Hotta Studio, Neverness to Everness, has officially launched its limited-scale Chinese Closed Beta Test that begins on November 28, 2024. This will allow players in China to explore the upcoming supernatural urban open-world RPG, and get to see some of the fresh new content that has been added by Hotta Studio. While other countries are currently unable to participate in the Closed Beta, anyone interested in the game will be able to <a href="https://nte.perfectworld.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-register for Neverness to Everness</a> on the official website. There is also the option to stay up to date with any news that is released by Hotta Studio by following them on X or joining their Discord server.</p>
<p>For those who are just hearing about this game for the first time, it is a fresh and lighthearted game that is full of comedy rather than a game with a lot of serious subjects and tones. By doing so, the developers are aiming to create a relaxed atmosphere for those who play Neverness to Everness. The game's character expressions and animations have been fine-tuned to enhance each scene that players will get to watch so that the emotional nuances of each scene and humorous details can shine through in the storyline.</p>
<p>In this game, players will get to explore the everyday life of Hethereau, a city where there are both anomalies and humans co-existing. There are three chapters of main storyline content thus far and multiple side quests that players can dive into, allowing them to explore the urban life of Hethereau and the secrets that come along with it.</p>
<p>Neverness to Everness is developed using Unreal Engine 5 to help provide beautiful realism with a ton of detail, giving the players an immersive experience as they traverse the city and get to experience the supernatural. There are drastic changes between environments, with some offering neon-lit streets and marketplaces, while others are mysterious and dark, full of anomalies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-is-a-new-gacha-open-world-rpg-from-tower-of-fantasy-devs-powered-by-ue5-with-nvidia-dlss-rtx/">initial reveal for this game was back in July</a>, and the developers have since added more characters for Beta testers to meet and try out. This includes Adler, who is a playable character, and Edgar, who is a member of the Eibon Antique Shop and will be accompanying the protagonist throughout their adventure in Hethereau.</p>
<p>Those who get the chance to participate in the Closed Beta test will get to experience some new chapter bosses, anomaly commission bosses, and, of course, new storyline content to provide them with an in-depth experience of what's to come in the full release of the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-new-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>developer Neowiz has revealed that the game's long-awaited DLC expansion will be arriving sometime during the first quarter of next year, and there's more exciting news for Neowiz fans as well.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ebn.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1644423" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> issued by the studio (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-dlc-is-coming-in-the-first-quarter-of-2025-as-developer-confirms-next-its-game/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Neowiz confirms the release window for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>DLC, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-sequel" rel="nofollow">teased last November</a> following the game's release in September 2023. We still don't know what the DLC will be about or exactly when we can expect it, however.</p>

<p>When the DLC was first teased, Neowiz showed a couple of pieces of concept art related to the expansion, including what appeared to be protagonist P exploring a shipwreck, as well as an industrial facility with a giant pillar at its center.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-fight.jpg?itok=qvKqI82K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-fight.jpg?itok=1tTr3Wc1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lies of P</em>'s DLC is coming in the first quarter of next year.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as confirming the release window for the&nbsp;<em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>DLC, Neowiz also reveals what it's working on next in the statement, although again, further details are rather scarce.</p>

<p>Per VGC's translation, the studio is working on an entirely new IP that will take the form of a sci-fi survival horror game. The statement specifically namechecks the likes of 2023's <i>Dead Space&nbsp;</i>remake and Striking Distance's&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, although let's hope Neowiz emulates the former rather than the latter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/callisto-protocol-crunch-is-problem-with-100-hour-work-weeks" rel="nofollow">in terms of development process</a>.</p>

<p>We'll likely have to wait a while for more info on the new survival horror IP being worked on by Neowiz; it's likely the studio will be focusing on the&nbsp;<em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>DLC for the immediate future. Still, a reveal at next year's Summer Game Fest might not be too much to hope for.</p>




<p>In case you haven't come across&nbsp;<em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>before, it's a Soulslike that serves as a loose adaptation of the classic children's novel&nbsp;<em>The Adventures of Pinocchio&nbsp;</em>(although the emphasis is very much on "loose" here).</p>

<p>You play as P, a puppet created by Geppetto who, unlike other puppets, has the ability to lie. You must explore the fictional city of Krat in order to discover what happened to it, why its puppets have gone insane, and what, if anything, you can do to make things right.</p>

<p><em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>proved very popular indeed, selling <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-sales" rel="nofollow">a million copies</a> within its first month on release despite being a day one Game Pass title.</p>

<p>It's still available there and on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/lies-of-p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox consoles</a> generally, as well as on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627720/Lies_of_P/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lies-of-p/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>.

Beating these gains you a clutch of awards, with extra bonuses to unlock if you re-battle each stage to complete specific missions.</p><p>And, much like the Lapras event, it’s bogged down by yet another bullshit in-game currency limiting how much you can play it, in the form of “Event Stamina (Solo)“ hourglasses. However, this time out it seems to be an awful lot more generous with the prizes it offers, throwing out handfuls of the item everyone actually wants—Pack Hourglasses—along with Wonder Stamina, Shinedust, Shop Tickets, and more Event Hourglasses to let you keep playing. Oh, and most importantly, it’s far kinder when it comes to handing out packs of the new Promo Pack A Series Vol. 2, in which you can pull a new set of stamped promo cards, including a wonderful new Venusaur full-art illustrated by Kuroimori.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-genetic-apex-best-cards-charizard-ex-1851698865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-genetic-apex-best-cards-charizard-ex-1851698865">The Best Cards from Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Genetic Apex Expansion</a></span></p><p>It’s pretty rudimentary to complete a first run through all four levels. Unlike the Lapras deck, Venusaur builds haven’t exactly entered the meta for good reason, and it’s hopelessly weak to a half-decent Fire Type build. (If you’ve got the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181">Charizard/Moltres deck built</a></span>, you’ll hammer through it in minutes.) But that’s no bad thing, given you’ll also get a total of 20 Pack Hourglasses, meaning you can tear open at least one extra pack for the day, <em>and</em> four chances to open the one-card promo packs.</p><p>My son, who blitzed the event, was grimly unlucky, although that serves him right after he got a Lapras ex first pack in the previous drop event. I, however, then made him furious by pulling the new Venusaur not just in my first pack, but my second too! Haha, that <em>that</em>, ten-year-old.</p><p>You can then keep replaying the tiers, finishing other tasks like “Make your opponent’s Pokémon Asleep 1 time,” or “Win this battle by turn 12,” which will reward you Wonder Stamina and Event Hourglasses, and given the “Win 20 or more battles” task on the top tier, also give you a new grind until the event is over on December 13.</p><p>There are five cards to pull from the promo packs, each with art that’s not been in <em>Pocket</em> before (although some familiar from the real-world cards). There’s Haunter, Jigglypuff, Onix, Greninja, and that splendid Venusaur. It’s just a shame the latter is spoiled by having the big, ugly blue box obscuring the image, madly overlapping the actual Venusaur itself. Dammit.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>STALKER 2’s massive 1.0.1 patch is here and it’s set to address 650 issues in the post-apocalyptic epic from GSC Game World. The update is live now on Xbox and PC and it effectively eradicates some of the biggest issues from the game, including controller dead zone problems, mutant difficulty, and weapon durability.</p>



<p>This is the second update of this size since STALKER 2 was released, and it stands as a testament to GSC’s desire to finesse the game as much as possible to appease the community.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stalker-2-s-1-0-1-patch-is-insane">STALKER 2’s 1.0.1 Patch is Insane</h2>



<p>The full patch notes can be found on Steam, but I’ll sum up some of the most exciting changes coming with the STALKER 2 1.0.1 patch.</p>



<p>First, weapon and armour durability has been tweaked, which means that things won’t break as quickly and when they do, it won’t cost so much to fix things. That means you won’t be paying 20,000 Coupons to fix a single assault rifle anymore.</p>



<p>Also, GSC has addressed the monetary rewards you get from ‘most’ missions, giving you a few more Coupons in your pocket to play with.</p>



<p>Mutants have been tweaked – especially on lower difficulty levels – to make them much more bearable, including the Burer and Bloodsucker, which have been giving players headaches since day one.</p>



<p>This will please Xbox players: GSC has fixed the issue with gamepad dead zones. This has been a niggling problem since the game was released on November 20, and it can finally be put to bed.</p>



<p>Amongst the 650 bug fixes sits changes to almost every aspect of the game, from combat sequences to cutscenes, and from audio elements to quests. GSC has been hard at work to fix problems with AI interactions, UI problems, and blockers that prevent players from progressing through certain missions.</p>



<p>If you were concerned that STALKER 2 launched in a terrible condition, updates like the 1.0.1 patch should be starting to change your mind. </p>



<p>I still maintain this is my Game of the Year.</p>
