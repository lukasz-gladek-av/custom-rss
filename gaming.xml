            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mindseye-review-mideye</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mindseye-review-mideye.1219083/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mindseye-review-mideye<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At this point, <em>MindsEye </em>has had one of the most bizarre tales in the industry. Originally announced in 2022 as part of "<em>Everywhere</em>", a make-your-own game-style tool like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dreams-review" rel="nofollow">Dreams</a> </em>or <em>Roblox</em>. It was then reannounced in 2023 as a standalone episodic game where each episode would take place in a different time period and link together to an overarching story. Then, IO Interactive picked it up, and it was reannounced again in 2024, this time as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v" rel="nofollow"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a> styled open world game. That's what it finally launched as. Did all these reworks amount to anything, or is this <em>MindsEye </em>rather mid?</p>



<h2>The Worst First Day Known To Man</h2>

<p>You play as Jacob Diaz, a soldier who has gone through a mysterious traumatic event and is left with an implant that he doesn't know anything about, and most of his memories are missing. He arrives in the city of Redrock and crashes on the couch of his best friend Seb. At the same time, he also gets a security job working for Silva Corp, a company that I'd joke is "Evil Tesla," but Tesla is already Evil Tesla, so I guess it's just... normal Tesla.</p>

<p>During Jacob's first shift, he puts down a robot rebellion, stalks an employee, discovers his implant was made by Silva Corp, and then guns down a bunch of highly trained mercenaries. This starts a rolling mystery where Jacob tries to find out more about his implant, while also getting tangled up in each of these groups.</p>

<p>This may sound interesting, but the sheer amount of plot strings involved in this game means some are going to be left behind. What I didn't expect is that nearly every single one of these threads got abandoned. A former member of Jacob's military unit blackmailing him to commit crimes? Forgotten. The mayor's reelection campaign is based on taking control away from Silva Corp? Who cares. The celebrity who may be manipulating the owner of Silva Corp to steal robots? The owner's personal assistant working for a mysterious person who wants Jacob dead? Literally anything involving Seb after the first couple of missions? All of them were forgotten shortly after they started. It's like playing the first quest in a chain of side quests and then never bothering to revisit them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to take a moment to note that the game has characters that are all clear parodies of Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, and Donald Trump. However, it has nothing to say about any of these people. They're just here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only plot line given any substantial time of day is the robot rebellion one, but there's nothing about it that was really that intriguing. If you've seen any sci-fi game, movie, or book in the last 20 years, then you likely know all of the twists in advance. All <em>MindsEye </em>really has to offer is a chain of cliches, none of which are done well enough to really stand out.</p>



<p><em>MindsEye </em>is also full of bizarre line reads. None of the actors are bad, but there are several times when the tone of the read doesn't fit the situation at all. Its clear lines were edited into the wrong place, or the actors weren't given the right context for the scenes. While chasing a car in a sandstorm, Jacob is told to bring in a hacker alive, and he responds with a "copy that" that sounds like he's in tears that doesn't fit the tone of the dialogue before or after at all. At other times, lines felt chopped up, like at one point when a character responds with "that's [...] news," but if it was good or bad news is unsure because the word in the middle was clearly and poorly cut from the line.</p>

<h2>Never Before Have We Been Asked "What If a Company Was Evil?"</h2>

<p>So if the plot is generic and forgettable, the gameplay shouldn't be, right? Well, bad news there too. <em>MindsEye </em>is one of the most basic third-person shooters I've ever played, and channels all the memories of a generic mid-2000s cover shooter. Not like the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/uncharted-lost-legacy-review-chloe-and-nadines-excellent-adventure" rel="nofollow">Uncharteds</a> </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gears-5-review-let-past-die-kill-it-if-you-have-to" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears of Wars</em></a>, which felt good and provided memorable and unique moments. This is closer to something like <em>Damnation</em>, <em>Quantum Theory</em>, or <em>Inversion</em>: forgettable games that brought nothing special to the table, swinging at the king and missing.</p>

<p>The only real attempt to switch up the shooter gameplay comes in the form of your drone. You get it about a quarter of the way into the game, and can either command it to perform actions, or take direct control of it and do these yourself. At first, all you can do is use it as a taser to stun humans and shut off robots. Later, you also gain the ability to hack robots to turn them friendly, and shoot grenades.</p>

<p>The grenade stands out because it's just so much better than anything else you can do that I don't know why you'd use the others once you have it. However, even with all that, none of this makes the drone anything other than a small list of abilities that don't do anything you haven't seen before.</p>

<p>While the majority of gameplay is shooting, you are sometimes pulled away for something else. There are quite a few scenes of watching people slowly walk around and talk through cameras, which isn't much fun. Sometimes you do quick time events to perform CPR or dig a hole. There's a single stealth segment that's so easy there isn't really anything to think about.</p>



<p>Not like you'll be doing much playing. Before and after every gameplay segment you'll often be placed in 10+ minutes of cutscenes. It doesn't help that a lot of these times the gameplay segments are "walk/drive from point A to B." This makes <em>MindsEye</em>'s pace sluggish, with the game really drawing out how long it can take.</p>

<p>Take "Meeting Marco Silva", the game's ninth story mission, for example. First, you take a five-minute drive from a hotel to Silva's company. Then you get a lengthy cutscene where Jacob is interrogated by his boss before she's called and told he needs to go to Silva's house. Another five-minute drive there. Another lengthy cutscene where you meet Silva company owner, Marco Silva. Then another five-minute drive to a party, followed by another lengthy cutscene to meet two more characters. Only after that do you finally get into gameplay.</p>

<p>This can work, lord knows <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-wild-wild-west-part-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></a> have similar formats, but it works because the writing and acting in those games are top-notch. <em>MindsEye </em>barely has half the budget or talent, and it shows. The characters are not as well acted or interesting, and having extended cutscenes or driving segments with them is far more painful and boring.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I noticed at one point that any time a vehicle's driver dies, the car will explode no matter what. This can be really hilarious if all it's doing is sitting still or slowly rolling forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn't help that the driving segments usually end their conversations before you get wherever you're going and promptly become filled with generic and repetitive "go faster" and "why aren't we there yet?" barks.</p>

<p>But at least there's the open world, right? if you get bored of those cutscenes and conversations, you can go wander off and do side quests or other activities? Well, there's <em>MindsEye</em>'s secret. Despite looking like an open-world game, and featuring the entirety of the fictional Redrock City, this isn't an open-world game at all. You just move from story mission to story mission, having to drive through the city without interacting with it in any way.</p>

<p>Want to explore? Once you deviate too far from the path to the next mission you get a game over. Don't like your car? Too bad, you can't steal or take any. The game has assigned you a specific vehicle for this mission and that is the vehicle you get. Think you can get assigned a new vehicle? Blowing up your vehicle is almost always a game over, even if you're not near it or don't need it for the mission anymore. You will look at <em>MindsEye</em>'s world, go "shame I can't be there", and then play the game the way it demands you play it.</p>



<p>In total fairness, there is actually a free roam mode that you unlock once you beat the game. When I loaded into it I was assigned the character model of an old man wearing a gas mask, a bra, gym shorts, and with the words "Can't drink dust" painted on his stomach. I could not figure out how to change this character model. I was also assigned a car, much like the campaign, and I could not change it. There's no map, so who knows what's out there in the city. I found a single-checkpoint race, but that was it.</p>

<p>I also had a pre-made house that I could "interact" with stuff in, but that meant playing a canned animation while nothing happened, like a <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>roleplaying experience but without the other players to actually roleplay with.</p>

<p>It's a real shame because I actually would like to look around Redrock City. In one of the few positives I have to say about the game, Redrock itself is quite pretty and well-made. Sure, it's just Las Vegas, but it really nails that entertainment city vibe, with holograms, drone shows, a big sphere, tons of hotels, and more. I want to explore this city, just the game will not let me nor does it have interest in it.</p>

<h2>Nothing, Nowhere, At No Time</h2>

<p>In what feels like a leftover from when <em>MindsEye </em>was part of <em>Everywhere</em>, there is also a system that lets you build out missions and share them with people. In-game this means you sometimes see a portal and, when you go through it, you are automatically loaded into one of the 25 side missions the developer made at launch. Don't want to wait for the portal? Then you can pause the game, hit a button that says "play", and hop into a mission of your choice at any time.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first side mission I got loaded into was set in the past during Jacob's army days. It opened with him giving a monologue declaring that covert ops has changed, before declaring that covert ops never changes. Then it plays sad country music while you shoot people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The end result, however, is a bunch of generic side missions that often have nothing to actually do with the plot of the game and usually can't be more complicated than a checkpoint race or rolling firefight.</p>

<p>It's all the disadvantages of user-made content, such as canned animations, soundtracks that don't fit, and having to stick to some very specific archetypes, without the endless amount of content that actually makes these missions worth it. It's wild that each one is marked with "made by Build a Rocket Boy" like this is a crowning achievement.</p>

<p>This is also assuming the game works. I played <em>MindsEye </em>on a PlayStation 5, and it was constantly struggling to keep up with the game. It seemed like every time a quest took me into the city, the game's framerate would chug. MindsEye also crashed several times during my playthrough, sometimes during cutscenes, sometimes during firefights, and sometimes when I had the game paused while I took notes for this review.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That isn't even getting into some of the weirder glitches I saw. At one point, I had to chase a car, but the car hit a curb and flipped over. It then just sat there for a minute, me hanging around confused, before it just teleported to where I needed to chase it, causing me to fail the mission because I was too far behind. At another point, two cars pulled up full of soldiers that I think were supposed to get out and shoot me. The doors opened, and all eight soldiers dropped dead on the spot, me not having interacted with them in any way.</p>



<p>Over the course of the game, I saw other strange things like random limbs ragdolling on living enemies, my drone not listening to my commands, random vehicles exploding for no reason, and more.</p>

<p>However, I really don't want people to think there's some hidden gem buried under <em>MindsEye </em>that some patches can help unearth. <em>MindsEye </em>is, simply, fundamentally, a poorly designed, boring game. You can't patch it better without at least a year+ of reworks. Everything is fundamentally busted from the ground up, glitches or no.</p>

<h2><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>MindsEye </em>is so monumentally bad that I have a lot of questions about&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">what happens from here</a>. I can't imagine Build a Rocket Boy continues to exist. It certainly feels like IO Interactive is going to step away from publishing. This is probably the end of <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> producer/designer Leslie Benzies' career. I don't see <em>Everywhere </em>coming out after this mess. If nothing else, <em>MindsEye </em>will at least serve for some fantastic behind the scenes stories down the line.</p>

		<p>SNK has announced that first character from Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves first season pass, Andy Bogard, will be available from June 24th. To mark the announcement of Andy Bogard’s release date, a brand new trailer has been released showing him action. He will be available to play as in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves Episodes of South Town mode with his own story, along with being available in arcade mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="FATAL FURY: CotW ｜ANDY BOGARD" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ja2ku_BwwU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Andy Bogard is the first character as part of the season pass, with four more characters to come later on. Those characters are Street Fighter’s Ken and Chun Li plus returning Fatal Fury characters Mr Big and Joe Higashi. Now to get these characters, you will have to buy the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves Special Edition because the season pass is not available to buy standalone.</p>

<p>In our Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves review, Miguel said, <em>“Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves struggles not only to understand what it wants to be, but which audience it wants to be for. While the game can be a sweat-inducing treat at its highest level of play, casual gamers might not get a lot out of it and the bevy of distracting guest characters and stage song composers in the game make it hard to see the title for its own merits.”</em></p>

            <p>Industrious Switch fans have started compiling a fan-made list that tracks which Switch 1 games have seen an improvement - or a decline - in performance when running on their new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Nintendo Switch 2</a> consoles.</p>
<p>So far, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l49teu/post_your_tested_games_compatibility_or/">over 350 games have been submitted and over 150 of them comprehensively categorised</a>, recording what performance changes players have identified, regardless of whether or not there has been a formal patch or update deployed by the publisher.</p>

<p>For instance, players who have played ARMS on their new Switch systems - for which Nintendo has deployed a free update for all players - believe they see an increased consistency in framerate, both docked and undocked, as well as dynamic resolution scaling in terms of resolution. However, they do not notice much difference in terms of loading times.</p>
<p>By comparison, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iii">Diablo 3</a>: Eternal Edition also shows increased consistency in framerates and improved loading times, but that hasn't been formally patched at all.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l49teu/post_your_tested_games_compatibility_or/">Post Your Tested Games – Compatibility or Performance on Switch 2</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wtfimdoingwithmylife/">u/wtfimdoingwithmylife</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/">NintendoSwitch</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>As the list owner admits, perceptions of what is or isn't an improvement can often be subjective, of course, and a handful of the hundreds of commenters have chimed in to say their experiences are different from those listed in the spreadsheet. However, the thread "isn't meant to decide whether a game is worth buying (now) for you", but is "purely informational".</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">Nintendo recently revealed it has sold 3.5m Switch 2 consoles</a> in its first four days on sale, becoming the fastest-selling piece of Nintendo hardware.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-and-stellar-blade-both-set-new-concurrent-user-records-on-steam-this-weekend<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> have set new concurrent user records on Steam over the weekend.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening, which released 10th June for all, and Stellar Blade, which had its long-anticipated PC debut on 11th, both launched with comparatively few problems, and their success has been underlined by the number of players getting stuck in over the weekend. At the time of writing, Dune: Awakening has secured an all-time concurrent peak of 175.5K players, and Stellar Blade 192K.</p>

<p>That puts both games in the top ten of most-played games of the weekend, with just <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, and Apex Legends attracting more players.</p>
<p>The PlayStation-published Stellar Blade made its way onto PC earlier this week and within hours of release, it was already the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-debut-welcomes-record-numbers-for-a-playstation-published-single-player-release">most successful PlayStation-published single-player game on the platform by concurrent count</a>.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In comparison, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered has a peak player count of 66,436, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Complete Edition has a peak of 56,557, The Last of Us Part 1 has a peak of 36,496 and its sequel - The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered - has a peak of 30,690. Only Helldivers 2 has attracted more players at once, but that's, of course, a multiplayer title.</p>
<p>Dune Awakening soared past 142,000 concurrent players on Steam following its full public release, quickly surpassing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-nears-100k-concurrent-players-day-one">peak established during the five-day head start</a> for those who bought the Deluxe or Ultimate edition. Within hours of the full launch, it blew past 113,000 players and currently has a concurrent record of 175K.</p>
<p>Not sure if either game is for you? In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Eurogamer's original Stellar Blade review</a>, we noted it "has a fair bit of weirdness", but " its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced". Meanwhile, Connor's having a great time with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-now-playing">Dune: Awakening thus far, writing in our review-in-progress</a>: "It's too early for a full review, but as of right now, I see little reason not to recommend giving Dune Awakening's unique offering a chance."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xboxs-next-generation-of-rpgs-unlock-the-absurd-character-choices-of-our-dreams<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Once BioShock Infinite’s protagonist Booker DeWitt arrives in the floating city of Columbia, the local police set about getting a description of the False Prophet they’ve anticipated for so long. Only trouble is, they’ve spent years whipping the populace into a frenzy of xenophobic fear. And when they speak to eyewitnesses, bigoted terror is all they’re getting back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We hear on the radio that Booker is either a mixed-race dwarf, or a French man with a missing left eye - no more than four foot and nine inches. And when DeWitt stumbles across a sketch artist putting together a facial composite, the overheard conversation is farcical.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He was taller than that… slimmer. His eyes were further apart. Bigger than that. Squinty. His hair was… hmm, red and curly? He looked Irish to me. Yes, like that. Oh, he was certainly an anarchist. You can spot them anywhere, you know.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s silly, but it’s one of BioShock Infinite’s subtlest touches - a way for developer Irrational Games to demonstrate how a backward society is undone by its own narrow belief system. And it sprung to mind during this summer’s Xbox Showcase, where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clockwork-revolution">Clockwork Revolution</a> finally got an extensive reveal.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/13/clockwork-revolution-1749831208949.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Clockwork Revolution's steampunk world is rife with absurd role-playing opportunity. | Image credit: InXile</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">BioShock Infinite was the immediate and obvious reference point for a first-person action game dealing in turn-of-the-century Victoriana and time-twisting mechanics. While we’ll be “playing in the mud”, not up in the skies, InXile’s new game depicts a society where power imbalance has led to a powder keg atmosphere. Here, shootouts are fought with old-timey rifles and temporal magic on factory floors. With a flick of your wrist, you can turn a pile of rubble back into a wall, then take cover behind it. It’s all very consistent with our memories of Irrational’s swansong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s even an early scene in which an aristocrat, fizzing with outrage in the lobby of a police station, offers an eyewitness description of a burglary suspect. “Tall… built rather slim,” the lord mutters to a mechanical constable. “Well, muscular. Was very quick, agile. With a moustache. No, larger!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This time, though, the takeaway is very different. It’s not bigotry that InXile is highlighting, but the flexibility of its character creation tools. Because at its core, Clockwork Revolution isn’t a first-person shooter, but a western RPG in the tradition of Wasteland, The Bard’s Tale and Planescape: Torment - all the games the studio has delivered successors to in the past. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the outset of a campaign, you can define your background as a Gearsmith who scavenged their way through life, or a Bookwarden who was saved from the orphanage by a wealthy sociologist. You’ll pick from traits with names like Street Stalker and Steam Whisperer, and distribute attribute points to determine your resistance to chemicals or flair for conversation. Your journeys back to the past will send ripples into the future, changing the nature of the city around you - a tantalising prospect for fans of RPG reactivity.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The over-the-top tone actually helps support the RPG systems. It creates room for character decisions that don’t just conform to the greatest hits of the genre.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, despite initial appearances, Clockwork Revolution has less in common with Ken Levine’s opus than it does with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>. Obsidian’s upcoming sequel, also featured in this year’s Xbox Games Showcase, is similarly focused on reactive worldbuilding and the many little custom quirks that make up a truly unique player character. As game director Brandon Adler explained during The Outer Worlds 2’s Direct, you’re cast in the role of an Earth Directorate agent - basically a sky marshal. But the game doesn’t lock down your character’s background or personality. You might have joined the Directorate to escape outstanding warrants for crimes you’ve committed. Or you may be a fraud, coasting on a deadly reputation you earned through an accidental killing. You can’t be a Gearsmith, but you can be a Roustabout who fails upwards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both games also share a Wizard-of-Oz quality to their art direction, with slightly garish palettes and over-ornate armour designs that look as if they could have been picked out by Jon M. Chu. They don’t scream to be taken terribly seriously - particularly not when, in Clockwork Revolution, a mechanical doll is screaming to “keep your filthy pickers off me”. In each case, that over-the-top tone actually helps support the granular RPG systems. It creates room for character decisions that don’t just conform to the greatest hits of the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a tangible example of that last point, take a look at Flaws in The Outer Worlds 2. If you take Bad Knees, you’ll move faster throughout the game - but your joints will pop every time you stand up from a crouch, signalling your position to nearby enemies. And if you’re a Kleptomaniac, your character will sometimes nab an item you’re looking at in a shop without warning - leaving you with the task of explaining yourself to the guards. Is that tradeoff worth the better prices you’ll get when selling loot? Only you can decide.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/13/the-outer-worlds-2-1749831262661.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Far from a grounded RPG party, The Outer Worlds 2's rag-tag crew will permit all sorts of oddball approaches. | Image credit: Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an unconventional power fantasy, you can choose to be Dumb in Obsidian’s RPG - allowing you not only to embarrass yourself in conversation, but to fix a computer by shoving a tin of hot dogs into the fuse box. This scope for wilfully idiotic decision-making is definitely reflected in Clockwork Revolution, too - as when, in the trailer, the protagonist repeatedly ignores an intimidating shopkeep named Uncle Alfie to talk to his underling Errol instead. A couple of unwise dialogue choices later, poor Errol is splattered across the floor, his head bashed in with a candlestick by his agitated employer. “Brains,” chuckles Alfie. “If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t have believed it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scenarios like these are laugh-out-loud surprising - rare in an RPG genre where character and conversation choices are often overfamiliar. More to the point, they simply wouldn’t belong in the more serious universes of Obsidian’s Avowed, or InXile’s Torment: Tides of Numenera. In other words, the absurdity of these settings is helping to keep the genre varied and fresh - and can perhaps even push it forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, zaniness is an acquired taste, and there’s a chance these games may overstep into tonal territory that becomes grating rather than gratifying. But the nature of choice-driven RPGs is that their most extreme aspects are optional. Nobody’s forcing you to wield the Spectrum Dance sabre, a musical sword in The Outer Worlds 2 that rewards you with damage bonuses if you can strike enemies on the beat. It’s your choice, and the tone of your experience can be tuned to your tastes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, I’m looking forward to building up a composite of my very own cockney criminal in Clockwork Revolution - with the help of a robot constable who gets suspicious as I pump points into Social skills. “Why do you think they’re so charismatic?” he asks, warily. “Are you sure this wasn’t a jilted lover?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jeremy Peel is a freelance journalist and friend to anyone who will look at photos of his dogs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-vibrant-visuals-update-finally-has-a-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Minecraft's Vibrant Visuals update finally has a release date: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPWdMDZWM4Y">17th June</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-wont-go-free-to-play-because-it-simply-wasnt-built-that-way">We've known for some time</a> that Mojang was planning on a visual overhaul for Minecraft, and yesterday (14th June), the studio released a new video not only reminding us just what Vibrant Visuals brings to the game, improving "visual elements such as directional lighting, volumetric fog, and more", but also how the team achieved it.</p>

<p>And the new feature really does elevate the world of Minecraft. As the developer explains, "every biome has their own atmosphere", so warmer biomes will look more orange and yellowish, while cooler ones will take on a crisper blue appearance.</p>
<p>"This is a visual enhancement - there are no changes to Minecraft's gameplay," Mojang said. "For example, visual shadows will not impact light levels in a game-mechanics sense, or affect where hostile mobs spawn. Vibrant Visuals will be easy to access and approachable for many more Minecraft players, as it will be available on many platforms as a simple menu toggle."</p>
<p>"This is a start on this journey of modernising the look and feel of Minecraft," explained Vibrant Visuals Lead, Dejan Dimic. "So we look forward to hearing more feedback from the players."</p>
<p>Vibrant Visuals is coming to supported devices for those running Minecraft Bedrock Edition, and if your device can run it, you can expect the new feature to be on by default once it updates. It still isn't yet available for Java, but Mojang insists it's "actively working" on it.</p>

<p>Did you catch the news that the roster of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hatsune-miku-personas-joker-and-minecrafts-steve-join-the-roster-for-sonic-crossworlds">Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is expanding outside of the Sonic universe to include other Sega characters and beyond</a>?

<p>It is, of course, a flagship year for Minecraft, thanks to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-jockeys-past-550m-at-the-box-office">unbridled popularity</a> of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">cinema-trashing</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-review">live-action movie adaptation</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Another day, another Red Dead rumour, but this one comes from John Marston himself - or, at least, the actor who brings him to life, Rob Wiethoff.</p>
<p>In his latest Red Dead Redemption livestream, as spotted by F4D3broboi on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lbextu/i_wonder_what_this_could_mean/">Reddit</a>, Wiethoff was very excited indeed about an upcoming announcement. And while he was coy about the details, he did stress that he was particularly excited playing "<em>this</em> game" - the original Red Dead Redemption - and even suggested we'll know by this time next week.</p>

By the end of this week, hopefully sooner, you're going to - not this week, I guess; probably not as soon as tomorrow, but definitely before Friday… Oh my goodness, the news that I have to share, and I won't be the only one sharing it.</p>
<p>"I cannot wait for you to know what's going on," he added. "And that's all I can say. And I'm not trying to be… I'm just telling, that's the only thing I can think about right now. And you will know soon enough. I can't wait for you to know, I am <em>so</em> excited, but I truly cannot think about anything else, especially playing <em>this</em> game, I can't think of anything else. Oh, then what I want to tell you <em>so</em> bad."</p>

<p>This latest tease comes just days after we heard another rumour that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-next-gen-update-switch-2-port-reports-suggest">Red Dead Redemption 2 may be getting a next-gen update alongside a Nintendo Switch 2 port</a>. YouTuber Nate the Hate stated the cowboy classic will receive the update and a port to Nintendo's latest console release later this year.</p>
<p>The original Red Dead Redemption released way back in May 2010. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-review?page=3">We awarded it 8/10</a>, calling it "an exceptional Rockstar game, one that successfully re-clothes the Grand Theft Auto framework in an exciting, distinct and expertly realised scenario".

These days, making sweeping declarations about something’s quality can feel like a daunting task, as the internet has lost any ability to put opinions into context. If I say something is bad, that must be me making a declarative statement that readers are required by law to agree with.

We’re five years removed from its original announcement, and Capcom is no stranger to quietly hiding a game away and never releasing it (remember <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-caves-deep-down-capcom-1851364378&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-caves-deep-down-capcom-1851364378"><em>Deep Down</em></a></span>?). So, I let the game disappear from my memory until its name showed up in my inbox. Perhaps it’s fitting then that <em>Pragmata </em>feels a bit like a game out of time, as its gruff old man protagonist, slow-moving enemies, and brutalist sci-fi aesthetic are all evocative of the over-the-shoulder shooters from the PS360 era. Given those seemingly bygone qualities, it’d be easy for <em>Pragmata </em>to feel rote and dated, but what I played was just inventive enough to feel novel. I was super impressed with it. - Kenneth Shepard </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pragmata-capcom-preview-summer-game-fest-impressions-1851784342?_gl=1*16jz1mu*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk4NDQwMzkkbzY0MCRnMSR0MTc0OTg0NTcxMCRqNTQkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pragmata-capcom-preview-summer-game-fest-impressions-1851784342?_gl=1*16jz1mu*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk4NDQwMzkkbzY0MCRnMSR0MTc0OTg0NTcxMCRqNTQkbDAkaDA.">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="68a5e24c09aade8b847d9af3d4fd0f24" data-recommend-id="image://68a5e24c09aade8b847d9af3d4fd0f24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A collage of various tie-in popcorn buckets, including Dune, Saw X, Barbie, Ghostbusters, Ant-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star Wars." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A collage of various tie-in popcorn buckets, including Dune, Saw X, Barbie, Ghostbusters, Ant-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star Wars." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->AMC Theatres / Cinemark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68a5e24c09aade8b847d9af3d4fd0f24" data-recommend-id="image://68a5e24c09aade8b847d9af3d4fd0f24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A collage of various tie-in popcorn buckets, including Dune, Saw X, Barbie, Ghostbusters, Ant-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star Wars." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As it turns out, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-part-two-sandworm-bucket-interview-1851288147&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-part-two-sandworm-bucket-interview-1851288147"><em>Dune: Part Two</em></a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-2-popcorn-bucket-sandworm-1851215982&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-2-popcorn-bucket-sandworm-1851215982">sandworm-shaped monstrosity</a></span> that AMC passed off as a popcorn bucket wasn’t the only one of its kind.

		<p>Life is complicated. No matter how much you do to make your life as easy as possible there will be moments of loss. This can be through so many avenues such as the loss of innocence, the loss of family, the loss of a bond, or the loss of your own self. Dontnod’s 2020 title Tell Me Why explores the themes of loss along with acceptance, including the impact these have on our beliefs and relationships.</p>
<p><em>As is traditional through Pride Month every year, Dontnod and Xbox have made Tell Me Why free to download and keep, available across <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tell-me-why-chapters-1-3/9NF83PRZK6K3/0010/9MVX2Z790F69">Xbox, Xbox on PC</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1180660/Tell_Me_Why/">Steam</a>.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Tell Me Why Accolades Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vYrc29kve1U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tell Me Why tells the story of siblings Alyson and Tyler as they piece together the night of their mother’s death and navigate the circumstances after having been separated for a decade. The game also explores each character’s sense of identity and we come into their journey which has been going on for years for both. Tyler’s is about his self-identity and growing into a life of being a transgender man, while Alyson’s life has been one of avoiding facing the events of the fateful night.</p>
<p>Family means different things to different people. The most common is that family who you are related to and have grown up with, but others have a much broader definition where it can be the people you have chosen to be in your life as well. Regardless of who you count as your family, the loss of a family member is devastating. A lot of Tell Me Why’s story is told through replaying memories that Tyler and Alyson have of their mother – it is likely that you would do the same when someone you are close to dies, and it is also my own experience of losing a parent. While life moves on, you will be hit by those moments when you least expect them.</p>

<p>What Tell Me Why also touches on is the fallibility of memory, and how we all remember things in our own way. The way each of us remembers things impacts how we view our relationships. In Tell Me Why, Tyler remembers his mum as being against his trans identity, cold towards him, and angry, but Alyson remembers her as more of tragic character that was falling apart and was softly spoken. The unreliability of memory is a loss in itself, because we lose a true reflection of the experiences that shape us.</p>

<p>Relationship bonds are also a key part of Tell Me Why, with the twins attempting to reestablish their own bond, while Tyler is also looking at his ties with the people that were closest to his mother. One of those characters is Tessa, their mother’s former best friend and a devout Christian. What we learn from events is that she is struggling with accepting the LGBTQ community generally, and her relationship with Tyler who she has loved as a child. We can all-too-easily lose relationships that are important to us because other beliefs come in to override them, but even without dogma coming between us, the majority of people will have had relationships that simply peter out. It can be as simple as losing touch as people move on to new pastures.</p>
<p>Where there is loss, there can be acceptance. That does not necessarily mean what you are accepting is something positive, but that you’re taking the situation for what it is. Alyson and Tyler retread their past, dealing with the beliefs of those around them, learning about the events that have surrounded their childhood and dogged them ever since. Accepting a situation that does not meet your own expectations or beliefs can be viewed as a loss, but it can be a stepping stone.</p>

<p>The ending of Tell Me Why brings Alyson and Tyler to a place where they can truly start to heal and build their lives. Right now, there are a lot of groups that have been hit by loss as societal views and politics in many countries swing towards hostility against marginalised groups. We have seen the trans community increasingly shunned by the establishment, and this shift being celebrated, we have seen asylum seekers demonised for decades, and we have seen people from ethnic minority groups get attacked and abused due to misinformation. What has to be accepted is that hateful rhetoric and punching down is a form of winning for those that perpetuate it, and that those in charge are largely okay with this. Those of us who belong to groups on the receiving end have to accept that, because once we accept this loss we can regroup and push back. On the flip side, those who back or vote for those who push the hateful rhetoric and punching down have to accept the fact that even if they view themselves as good people, fundamentally they are not. You cannot be okay with alienating, discriminating, and attacking the smallest and most vulnerable groups in society and claim to be good.</p>
<p>Life is complicated. Sometimes you will have to accept a loss in life, take the bruising, to get to a place where you can heal and be stronger. Be like Alyson and Tyler, who suffer loss but in the end, depending on your choice, accept themselves for who they are and in turn help heal the wounds in their community making life better for all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-made-with-console-first-approach-60-fps-on-xbox-series-s-will-be-extremely-challenging-to-achieve-says-cdpr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stunning The Witcher 4 demo</a> shown during the State of Unreal presentation earlier this month, Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia had the unique opportunity to fly to Poland and meet CD Projekt RED (and Epic) to discuss what went into the demo and what kind of work the studio has ahead of itself for the full game.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OplYN2MMI4Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lengthy interview</a>, Charles Tremblay, VP of Technology at CD Projekt RED, revealed that the team switched to a console-first approach to development to achieve its ambitious goal of delivering an open world game with hardware ray tracing running at 60 frames per second on a Sony PlayStation 5 console. This will be easier than scaling down, which the studio had to do with their previous projects.</p>
<p><em>When we started the collaboration, we had super high ambitions for this project. We always do PC and we push and then we try to scale down, but then we had so many problems in the past that we</em><br>
<em>tried to see, okay, this time around we really want to be more of a console first development. Then we worked with Unreal and we saw the challenge to realize the ambition that to make what we want, 60 fps on PS5, there would be work. This is why we started to talk, to figure out what needs to be done with the technology and we also decided, okay, we need to have all those things that need to be developed. Where we go from there, it's hard to say, but right now we really wanted to focus on what does it mean to make this ambition on a console. We&nbsp;really wanted to aim for 60 fps and not go back to 30 fps.</em></p>
<p><em>At this stage, we are perfectly aware that we still have a lot of work ahead of us. This is a tech demo, not the whole gameplay loop is implemented, there's no combat, there's a lot of things that don't work, but still, the ambition is set, so this is where we want to aim for The Witcher 4. It's too early to say if we manage to nail it, but we'll work as hard as we can to make it for sure.</em></p>
<p>The PS5 is not, however, the lowest of current-generation consoles when it comes to hardware performance. There's the Xbox Series S, and Tremblay admitted that the developers haven't begun to optimize The Witcher 4 for it yet, adding that it will be 'extremely challenging' to get it to run at 60 fps.</p>
<p><em>I wish we did a lot of work already on that, but we did not, so this is something that is next on our radar for sure. I will say that 60 FPS will definitely be extremely challenging on Xbox Series S. Let's just say that this is something that we need to figure out.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, Epic considers software Lumen ray tracing to be a thing of the past due to several limitations, which is why the demo created for The Witcher 4 already implements hardware RT Lumen. CD Projekt RED, on the other hand, mentioned that they'll want to scale up for a high-end PC, although the form that scaling will take remains to be seen at this point.</p>
<p>The Witcher 4 will likely be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> in 2027 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Stay tuned to Wccftech for the latest rumors and reveals.</p>

<figure><a title="Jet Set Radio - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/33a1c78fb105b/jet-set-radio-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello folks, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>.</p>
<p>Before we get cracking, let's see how things panned out last time, hm? We looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_street_fighter_iv_3d_edition">Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition</a> for the 3DS. North America and Europe joined forces on this one, and together, they managed to bag an impressive 72% of the vote. Well done, indeed.</p>
<p>This week, we're back with the Dreamcast to check out <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/jet_set_radio">Jet Set Radio</a> (originally known as <strong>Jet Grind Radio</strong> in the US). Released in 2000, it went on to spawn a sequel and became one of the finest cult classics of the modern age, with an exceptional soundtrack to boot.</p>
<p>It's a full-on three-way brawl this week, so let's get to it!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:159585,160025 @ 1750060165 -->
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Jet Set Radio - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/717ed2931d893/jet-set-radio-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30-jet-grind-radio">Sega / Launch Box</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>All three cover designs showcase the main protagonist, Beat, front and centre. North America's approach is a little darker, overall, but the purple, red, and green work really well together.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Jet Set Radio - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14eb879dbb811/jet-set-radio-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30-jet-grind-radio">Sega / Launch Box</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Europe's design is a little bit lighter and brighter, potentially leaning into the overall theme of the Dreamcast itself. Beat's striking a pretty cool pose in this one, and we like that it makes the roller blade traversal obvious.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Jet Set Radio - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cc2e7c9b41465/jet-set-radio-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30-jet-grind-radio">Sega / Launch Box</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Good lord, what's going on here? We love it! Very abstract. Beat is completely absent of any colour, and instead, the background is made up of lots of different graffiti images, with the main logo appearing just below Beat's spray can. So cool.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! We'll see you next time for another round of Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Nintendo Life’s resident horror fanatic, when he’s not knee-deep in Resident Evil and Silent Hill lore, Ollie likes to dive into a good horror book while nursing a lovely cup of tea.

<p>Get ready to "power-up" in Expeditions</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The free-to-play title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lego_fortnite">LEGO Fortnite</a> has gone down quite well with LEGO and Fortnite fans, and Epic Games continues to enhance the experience with all sorts of new updates.</p>
<p>The latest reveal is a new teaser for <strong>Lego Fortnite Expeditions</strong>. Epic has released a trailer describing how players will suit up, squad up and power up next week on <strong>18th June</strong>, but beyond this, nothing else has been revealed just yet.</p>
<p>Fans are convinced it's going to lead into an "expanded universe" or even a "multiverse" style offering. It will follow <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/lego-fortnite-reveals-gta-and-sims-style-social-roleplaying-game-mode"><strong>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</strong></a> (<em>formerly "Lego Fortnite"</em>) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/lego-fortnite-reveals-gta-and-sims-style-social-roleplaying-game-mode"><strong>Lego Fortnite Brick Life</strong></a>. When we find out more about this new mode, we'll let you know.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-3" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>LEGO Fortnite originally made its debut on the Switch in 2023 alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_racing">Rocket Racing</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite_festival">Fortnite Festival</a>, and is Epic's way of expanding the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> universe with new experiences. Epic also recently released a free Switch 2 version of Fortnite, and you can find out how LEGO Fortnite and the existing game modes run on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Switch 2 in our Nintendo Life review</a>.</p>

<p>The famous Nintendo tune returns</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/281807c674aa4/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo mentioned how there were all sorts of surprises to discover in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and a week after the game's launch it looks like Totaka's Song has been discovered.</p>
<p>As highlighted on social media and elsewhere online (via Nintendo Everything), you can hear Yoshi humming this Nintendo tune in the game's character menu. Here's a story and video shared over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1la5xcm/totakas_song_in_mario_kart_world/">Mario Kart subreddit by the user 'charizardtelephone'</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was idling on the character select screen when I noticed Mario began humming after enough time passed. I thought, “Huh, they could totally hide hidden tunes like that.” Wait. Hidden music? In a Nintendo game? With Yoshi? It was too good to be true. But after a few seconds, lo and behold, yoshi begins humming Totaka’s song like the idle yoshis do in Mario Kart 8. Very cool Easter Egg. Not sure if anyone else has noticed it yet."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>When we tried this out ourselves, Yoshi started humming the same song just seconds later. It might also be a bit harder to hear depending on the music playing in the background.</p>
<p>This famous song by the Japanese Nintendo composer Kazumi Totaka is often slipped into many of company's games. And if you're wondering why it's specifically Yoshi that hums this tune, it's because Totaka also happens to be Yoshi's voice actor, and once again voices the character in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>This Easter Egg has also popped up previously in Mario Kart 8 along with series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Zelda</a>, and was inserted into titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> back in the day.</p>

            <p>
I feel like money laundering is one of those concepts you see in a lot of crime TV shows but it's not really something that seems to come up much in games. I certainly can't think of any games that feature money laundering as an actual mechanic, but I'll be able to add one to the list next week: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game is getting a new update this coming June 17th called <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/513kao973a73ko/gta-online-money-fronts-coming-june-17">Money Fronts</a>, and is literally all about buying up small but generally lucrative businesses that you can sneak some money through.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's a few businesses you'll be able to pick up but you'll be starting off with a classic: the car wash, specifically Hands On Car Wash. You'll get passive income through this from your criminal network, eventually allowing you to pick up the Smoke on the Water dispensary and Higgins Helitours, all of which will also bring in their own money from actual, legal business operations.
</p>
<p>
However, with the pro of lots of moola, there is a big con too. Operating these businesses this way will generate heat, and if that gets too high, you'll have to actually step in as the local business owner you're pretending to be to manage these companies the way they're legally meant to be.
</p>
<p>
There's a few new rides you can pick up too, like the Karin Everon RS or the Declasse Tampa GT (Muscle). Money Fronts is also bringing in some gameplay tweaks. More than 50 vehicles will have missile lock-on jammer capability, and all sources of arena points are being doubled. A number of cutscenes will be skippable on mission replays too, though which ones that'll be weren't specified.
</p>
<p>
More details will be coming, uh, at some point, Rockstar just said "stay tuned". You only have to wait a few days for it anyway, you'll live.
