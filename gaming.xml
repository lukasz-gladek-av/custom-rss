Cards like <a href="https://zdcs.link/985ZYw?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Raging Bolt ex</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8wRO?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Crown ex</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aebk66?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walking Wake ex</a> were once among the most sought-after pulls from the set, but all three have dropped from their spring peaks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raging Bolt ex is down <strong>11%</strong> from its May value of <strong>$82.36</strong> and now trades around <strong>$73.45</strong>, while Iron Crown ex has fallen <strong>13%</strong> in the same timeframe, moving from <strong>$55.74</strong> to <strong>$48.30</strong>. Walking Wake ex has taken the hardest hit of the trio, losing <strong>20%</strong> since May, with its price sliding from <strong>$50.37</strong> to <strong>$40.45</strong>. This downturn mirrors a wider cooling in the set’s high-end singles as both players and collectors reassess their priorities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Twilight Masquerade has seen a more mixed picture, with some cards losing steam while others continue to gain. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8jGO?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perrin</a> has eased down <strong>11%</strong> from March, moving from <strong>$106.43</strong> to <strong>$94.87</strong>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbBer?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carmine</a> has dipped the same percentage since June, going from <strong>$78.70</strong> to <strong>$69.99</strong>. Both are Special Illustration Rare Supporters that enjoyed early interest thanks to their unique effects, but neither has become a fixture in competitive lists, leading to softer demand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, the set’s Illustration Rares and certain Pokémon ex cards are climbing in value as interest from both casual and competitive buyers grows.<a href="https://zdcs.link/92xnkW?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gastly</a> has risen <strong>13%</strong> since June, from <strong>$35.74</strong> to <strong>$40.99</strong>, helped by its role in Gengar evolution lines and appealing artwork. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpYV2?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greninja ex</a> has climbed <strong>17%</strong> since January, from <strong>$18.44</strong> to <strong>$21.59</strong>, thanks to its versatile attacks and solid HP. <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62r5R?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sinistcha ex</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G0Pw?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tatsugiri</a> have each moved up <strong>10%</strong> since April, now priced at <strong>$21.59</strong> and <strong>$18.48</strong> respectively, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKg3xB?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee</a> has gained <strong>10%</strong> from early August to reach <strong>$21.59</strong>. These changes highlight how certain cards can gain value steadily over months due to competitive experimentation, collector interest, or them just being stunning cards. Let's break this all down:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/pixel-9-5-1754923308215.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For cards that saw heavy demand early on, the market has cooled. Some have slipped due to a lack of tournament use, others because collectors have shifted their focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/985ZYw?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Raging Bolt ex</a> brings explosive plays with Bursting Roar to refill your hand and Climactic Descent to convert discarded Basic Energy into heavy damage. It looked set to become a staple in certain builds, but the high retreat cost and inconsistent setup have made it less reliable in practice. As competitive players experiment with more stable options, extra copies have been hitting the market. The Special Illustration Rare artwork still turns heads in a binder, but with demand slowing, Its price has slipped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8wRO?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Crown ex</a> offers useful bench support in Future decks through Cobalt Command, adding damage to your other Future Pokémon’s attacks. Twin Shotels provides a reliable way to apply pressure across the board, bypassing common defenses. Despite this, it has not found a consistent place in top tournament lists, and collector buying has eased off. Without strong competitive results to keep attention high, the price has edged down since May.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aebk66?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walking Wake ex</a> debuted with plenty of buzz thanks to Azure Wave, which ignores effects on the opponent’s Active Pokémon, and Cathartic Roar, which can hit 240 damage under the right conditions. The trick has been making those conditions happen consistently. Decks built around it have seen mixed success, and without the sustained performance to keep it in the spotlight, its Special Illustration Rare price has fallen noticeably from its early high.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8jGO?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perrin</a> gives players the option to cycle Pokémon from hand into the deck and fetch an equal number in return. It can be a valuable setup tool in certain builds, but it faces competition from other Supporters that fit more universally into current decks such as PRofessors Research. Collectors still appreciate the detailed Special Illustration Rare art, yet its price has eased back since March as demand from both has softened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbBer?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carmine</a> is one of the few cards that can be used on the very first turn when going first, letting you discard your hand and draw five cards. It can enable quick starts, but the narrow conditions for use mean it often sits unused. As the metagame evolves, it's not become a fixture in competitive decks, and its Special Illustration Rare has seen its value slip since June. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/pixel-9-6-1754923437758.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every card is moving down. Loads of Twilight Masquerade singles have been gradually climbing in value over months, thanks to a mix of playability, collector interest, and unique artwork.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G0Pw?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tatsugiri</a> is a small but effective utility card for certain strategies. Attract Customers can pull a Supporter from the top six cards of your deck if it is in the Active Spot, offering a low-maintenance way to find key cards. Its single retreat cost and light-hearted Illustration Rare artwork make it a popular pick for collectors as well. Since April, that mix of function and style has helped it hold steady gains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z62r5R?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sinistcha ex</a> benefits from Re-Brew, an attack that spreads damage based on the Grass Energy in your discard before shuffling it back into your deck. Matcha Splash offers reliable damage while healing your team, which can matter in longer matches. As Grass-focused decks see more experimentation, this Special Illustration Rare has moved upward in value since April.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QKg3xB?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee</a> is always in demand among collectors, and the Twilight Masquerade Illustration Rare shows a group of them cuddled up on a comphy chair. Ascension allows it to evolve quickly, which can be useful in certain setups, though its main draw is its place in the franchise’s history. Since early August, interest has pushed the price up slightly. I expect this card go carry on growing in value indefinately, albiet in small increments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpYV2?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greninja ex</a> offers strong offensive options in Shinobi Blade and Mirage Barrage, the latter being able to hit two targets at once. That combination of damage output and flexibility makes it appealing for a variety of decks. The stunning Special Illustration Rare artwork and Greninja fighting for the starter Pokémon top spot with Charizard adds collector appeal, and trainers are willing to pay a premium to get their hands on one of the most valuable Pokémon cards in the Scarlet and Violet era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gastly combines a distinctive Illustration Rare design, showing and also evolving into competitive Gengar deck builds. Mysterious Beam offers potential energy disruption, and Suffocating Gas gives cheap damage when needed. Its appeal has been as much about binder displays as tournament tables, and since June it has been steadily rising in value.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Week's Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week’s Pokémon TCG market update saw Paldean Fates and Hidden Fates dominating the spotlight, with several Special Illustration Rares and Shiny Vault classics making notable moves.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> was one of the biggest games of 2023, and naturally, Wizards of the Coast wants to follow it up with a sequel. We already know that the developer behind Baldur's Gate 3, Larian Studios, is moving on to a new, unrelated project, and Wizards of the Coast has confirmed that the new studio being led by former Respawn Entertainment game director Stig Asmussen--Giant Skull--won't be working on it either. Instead, players can expect something more action-packed from the newly established studio.</p><p>"Baldur’s Gate is an incredible game," Wizards of the Coast president John Hight said to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/wizards-of-the-coast-will-bet-on" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "And of course, we're going to do a successor. This is not the successor to that game. We go to Stig and his team to tell an incredible story and bring Dungeons &amp; Dragons to a very broad audience. Ideally, the game will appeal to Dungeons &amp; Dragons players because it will help them realize their imagination. But it’s also going to hopefully appeal to people that love playing action games, that love the Jedi games, that love God of War games."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Baldur’s Gate 3: The Final Patch - An Animated Short</p>
      </div>
<p>Wizards of the Coast isn't in a big rush to get Baldur's Gate 4 out-- its parent company Hasbro is planning a number of other Dungeons &amp; Dragons games set to launch over the next five years--and several potential partners are being courted for the unenviable task of following in Larian's footsteps. "We're going to take our time and find the right partner, the right approach, and the right product that could represent the future of Baldur's Gate," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/">Hasbro's Eugene Evans said last year</a>.</p><p>As for Larian, it doesn't sound like the studio will be returning to Dungeons &amp; Dragons for its next game. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/">Speaking to GameSpot at GDC 2024</a>, Larian CEO Swen Vincke said that the studio did consider making Baldur's Gate 4, but the developer decided that it didn't want to "rehash" what it has already done. Recently, Vincke teased that the studio's next major game--codenamed "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-next-game-is-codenamed-excalibur-no-idea-what-it-is-yet/1100-6523807/">Excalibur</a>"--is years away, but it'll be "plenty of fun."</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://vrgamesshowcase.com/">VR</a> <a href="https://vrgamesshowcase.com/">Games Showcase</a> is an event usually reserved for announcing new games or updates on current VR games. It's one of the few digital showcases in a year that VR enthusiasts should pay attention to in order to find out what's on the docket for VR games on PCVR, Meta Quest, and a few PlayStation VR2 games as well. Today's show however, included its very first mod, as a VR mod for popular shooter Ready or Not was revealed.</p>



<p>Ready or Not is a new tactical first-person shooter from VOID Interactive that initially launched on PC in December 2023. In less than two years following that launch, it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-surpasses-9-million-copies-sold-ahead-of-its-console-launch-this-summer/">sold 9 million copies on PC</a>, a milestone reached a little less than three months before it arrived on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, where it went on to sell another <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-hits-2-million-copies-sold-console/">2 million copies</a> just two weeks after its July 15, 2025, arrival on consoles.</p>



<p>It's unusual, to say the least, for a mod announcement to be part of a showcase like the VR Games Showcase, which also noted that this VR mod was the first time the presentation had featured a mod, but given the current popularity of Ready or Not, the mod's inclusion does make sense.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ready or Not VR Mod Annoucement Trailer | VR Games Showcase 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yt0G1J9Dcug?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The mod is being made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VirtualRealityOasis">Virtual Reality Oasis YouTuber Mike Cussell</a>, who is also a co-founder of a VR influencer marketing and game testing company, <a href="https://www.xrgamelabs.com/">XR Game Labs</a>. Cussell isn't alone in the project however, as he's developing it with modder KITT to bring the tactical gameplay of Ready or Not to life in VR.</p>



<p>When the mod is ready, it'll be available to everyone who owns the base game for free, and according to Cussell, it'll be ready "<em>soon</em>," though no actual release date or release window was confirmed. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There's also currently no indication that Cussell and KITT could work with VOID Interactive to help bring the game to VR for PlayStation players, though if the mod proves popular with PC players, it could potentially be something VOID Interactive looks into for the future. Until then, PlayStation VR2 owners are better off buying that adaptor to plug their headset into their PC and hope for the best when the mod arrives.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-mod-%E2%80%98versus-mode%E2%80%99-is-the-closest-thing-there-is-to-a-game-master-mode.1268265/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is a better game than Larian's previous title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2-new-divine-born/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, in almost every regard, with one notable exception: the former game's lack of a Game Master mode. Divinity: Original Sin 2, on the other hand, allowed Game Masters (or Dungeon Masters, as they are usually called in tabletop RPGs) to recreate the atmosphere of a pen-and-paper game, crafting brand new adventures and quests where other players, the so-called 'party of heroes', were ultimately at their whims.</p>



<p>It was the closest thing gamers could find to a videogame version of a Dungeons &amp; Dragons session. It would stand to reason that Baldur's Gate 3, a game made on the D&amp;D license, would get that as well, but it did not. Larian Studios CEO and Game Director Swen Vincke explained a few years ago that it would have taken way too much time and effort, and given that Baldur's Gate 3 ended up being a gargantuan game (even larger than Divinity: Original Sin 2), the mode simply never materialized.</p>



<p>However, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did get proper modding tools about a year ago</a>, and now modder 786r786 has uploaded a 'Versus Mode' mod on both <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/17984?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and <a href="https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3/m/versus-mode4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mod.io</a>. While not nearly as extensive as the Game Master mode in Larian's previous game, it does allow the host of an online session to gain control of monsters:</p>



<p><em>When an enemy's turn starts, the game gives control to the host player allowing players to fight against each other by controlling enemies. Make sure to click the blue enemy portraits at the start of their turn to actually control them.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>This mod is intended to be used in multiplayer with two or more players.</strong> To use this mod correctly, have the host player spectate the other players until they enter combat at which point the host will be able to control the enemies on their turn.</em></p>



<p>Hopefully, this Versus Mode can be expanded in the future to allow something even closer to the aforementioned Game Master mode featured in Divinity: Original Sin 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[How Sam And His Crew Design All The Devious Game Changer Episodes]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-changer-dropout-sam-reich-interview-season-7-comedy-design-2000617191</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-sam-and-his-crew-design-all-the-devious-game-changer-episodes.1268256/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-changer-deja-vu-video-game-dropout-tv-1851449932"><em>Game Changer&nbsp;</em>has become a popular online TV show</a>, probably because it’s fun to watch such masterfully controlled chaos. The series, which just aired its seventh season finale exclusively on Dropout, is all about forcing comedians to play different, often bizarre games, without any of the contestants being told in advance what the game is, how it works, or how you even win.</p> <p>For example, in a recent episode, three comedians were placed in velcro body suits and then forced to spin a wheel covered in modifiers and rules that they had to apply to their bodies each time they spun the wheel. Stuff like “Always be smiling” or “Be rude.” As the rules piled up, the contestants began to turn on each other, and eventually it all resulted in the game’s host becoming a contestant. It’s weird, hilarious, and unlike anything else on TV. I wanted to learn more about how it all works, so I sat down with <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-changer-dropout-video-game-sam-reich-interview-dimension-20-2000616708">Dropout CEO and <em>Game Changer</em> host Sam Reich</a> to talk about how he and his crew design multiple unique, funny, and strange games for their comedians to play each season, and all the work involved. I was shocked to learn that for most of <em>Game Changer</em>‘s run, they’ve avoided playtesting and just hoped things would work out on the day.</p>  <p>“Yeah, people, I think, would be scandalized to know that [season seven is the first time] we did any game testing,” said Sam Reich during our Zoom interview. He laughed about it and explained that there were some exceptions, like an escape room episode in 2023, but for the most part, they historically haven’t done much playtesting at all, at least before the most recent season.</p>

 <p>So if the show has mostly avoided playtesting, I asked Reich how they knew a game or an episode idea was ready for production, and once again I was surprised by how wild <em>Game Changer</em>‘s production is. Reich told me, “I think there’s probably a few different answers to that question. One is we don’t. <span>And we do it anyway.” We both laughed at the response.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>“The second [answer] is that, particularly in earlier seasons of <em>Game Changer,</em> a lot of our games were loosely inspired by games that already exist, whether they’re improv games or other games. There’s a lot of ‘this-meets-that’ going on. And in that sense, we kind of know something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EbvU8OZtqI">Like My Coffee</a> is going to work, because it’s based on a popular improv game that we’re just doing our spin on.”</p> <p><span>“The reason why game testing becomes more relevant now as the seasons climb up is because, by virtue of the show going on and by virtue of us backing ourselves into a corner where originality is more and more hard to come by, we can’t afford to be derivative anymore. Like we have to be more inventive,” explained Reich.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sam Says | Game Changer [Full Episode]" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vT-zZsjwZKk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Another common problem that Reich and his team of talented writers and creators run into when coming up with ideas for new <em>Game Changer</em> episodes is making sure an idea is funny for more than a minute and has places to go throughout a full episode. A common pitch involves having the host and others speak in a foreign or gibberish language the comedians have to figure out. But while that sounds funny, Reich says it really has nowhere to go. The same is true of episode pitches built around lots of tiny games that aren’t connected thematically, including a pitch for a <em>Conclave</em>-like episode to replace Sam Reich with someone else.</p> <p><span>[The <em>Conclave</em> idea] becomes a kind of ‘who can be the best game show host?’ competition,” explained Reich. “But, the games don’t relate to each other enough…there’s no sort of journey of competence or discovery there. This gets into game design wonkiness. I’m really big on game design and it’s rare these days…that I’ll get excited about a game that feels like it’s just a series of mini games.”</span></p>

 <h2>How Dropout’s Sam Reich became a game designer</h2> <p>Reich’s thinking on this has come a long way since he started <em>Game Changer</em> back in 2019. As he told me when I asked if he realized he was going to have to become a full-time game designer to create a show like <em>Game Changer</em>:</p> <p><span>“I loved games, but I wouldn’t say that I loved games, like, more than the average person. I wasn’t a big board gamer,” said Reich. “</span><span>I’d probably done three escape rooms in my life. And thank God, because I think if I had been–if I had started <em>Game Changer</em> as the game designer I am today, I would have had far less room to grow into the show. Like in a way, I think my competence as a game designer has sort of grown as the show has grown and the budget has grown. </span><span>So if you start <em>Game Changer</em> from the beginning, you can kind of watch my journey as a game designer, which I think is fun.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>Reich admitted to me that before starting <em>Game Changer</em>, he didn’t really know what the term “Balanced” meant in game design terms. Now, he consults often with table top, video game, and escape room designers as well as comedians to create the odd beast that is <em>Game Changer.</em> And while a lot of game design goes into the show, especially in its more recent seasons, it’s still a comedy series and the audience comes first, over rules, balance, or anything else.</p> <p><span>“Ultimately, I will break any rule in service of the audience or in service of entertainment,” said Reich. “It’s like, even if this isn’t a very well-balanced game, or even if it is a little clunky or whatever it is, we’ll plow forward with it if we think it’s going to be very entertaining. We’ve totally taken out clunky moments [in post-production].”</span></p>

 <h2><em>Game Changer</em> is falling apart, in a good way</h2> <p>And that clunky, sometimes messy, often chaotic nature of <em>Game Changer</em> is, according to Sam, one of the reasons it has connected with such a large audience. <span>“I would almost equate it to, like, <em>Saturday Night Live</em> in a way where it’s like, the fact that it’s live will always make it feel a little dangerous,” said Reich. “And that’s part of the fun.”</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sam Stole Jacob's Blood For a Trivia Question 🩸" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tpwgC1Y2NDs?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>“There is sort of an excitement to every episode of <em>Game Changer</em>, which is like the excitement of: Is this even going to work? And I think that some games sort of require that more than others,” said Reich. “</span><span>Look, at the end of the day, we’re making a show and production schedules are what they are. And <em>Game Changer</em> always feels like a trust fall by the time we’re on the shoot day. [During the episode] Beat The Buzzer, I swear to you, five of those buzzers weren’t working in dress rehearsal. </span><span>We’re hanging on for dear life to this show,” explained Reich with a chuckle and a big smile.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>He did admit that he expects future episodes and seasons will feature a lot more playtesting as ideas get bigger and games get more complicated. But he also explained that he wants <em>Game Changer</em> to avoid the “sterile” and sometimes boring feel of popular big-budget game shows that have been on the air for decades, adding: </span><span>&nbsp;“In a way our show feels sort of like, um, it’s always falling apart a little bit. Just a little bit, which is a part of the fun, you know?” So don’t worry that future seasons of the hit series will playtest the life out of everything and make sure the game is perfectly balanced. There will still be plenty of chaos in the future.<br> </span></p> <p><a href="https://www.dropout.tv/game-changer"><em>Game Changer</em>‘s season seven finale is now live on Dropout</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101"><em>Subnautica 2</em> publisher Krafton</a> has filed its answer to a complaint by Unknown Worlds cofounders alleging breach of contract. It accuses Charles Cleveland, Adam “Max” McGuire, and Edward “Ted” Gill of prioritizing a $250 million payout over the successful launch of the second-most-wishlisted game on Steam. The company said the veteran developers were fired “to prevent {them] from permanently damaging Unknown Worlds’ most valuable IP, the company itself, and its goodwill with its fans.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-unknown-worlds-delay-1851786439">In a lawsuit filed last month</a>, the cofounders claimed Krafton tried to sabotage <em>Subnautica 2</em>‘s planned Early Access launch this year to avoid paying a $250 million bonus it had agreed to at the time Unknown Worlds was sold if the studio hit certain revenue targets in 2025 and early 2026. The legal complaint alleged that Krafton violated the terms of the deal by overriding the studio’s independence and firing the cofounders without cause.</p> <p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn">In its response filed on August 12</a>, Krafton denies most of the allegations in the original complaint and argues that it was the cofounders who were trying to rush <em>Subnautica 2</em> out into the wild despite being behind on its expected content scope. When the company tried to enlist the cofounders, who were not directly involved in the game’s development, to get it back on track, it says it was rebuffed. Krafton claims it had no choice but to remove them from the studio in order to protect <em>Subnautica 2</em> and prevent a disastrous launch.</p>

 <p>According to Krafton’s response, a development director at Unknown Worlds told Gill in 2023 that “folks think…Max and Charlie are checked out as studio heads and are confused as to why.” It accuses the cofounders of being more involved in passion projects than in getting<em> Subnautica 2</em>—which suffered delays throughout 2024—ready to ship.</p> <p>“Krafton was not willing to take the risk of the resulting damage to the <em>Subnautica</em> franchise and the Company’s long-term reputation–a risk that, if materialized, would be irreversible, as shown with <a href="https://kotaku.com/olliolli-world-rollerdrome-kerbal-space-program-2-1851450223"><em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em></a>,” the filing reads. “As Unknown Worlds’ sole stockholder, Krafton had invested $500 million in the success of not only <em>Subnautica 2</em>, but also <em>Subnautica 3</em>, <em>Subnautica 4</em>, and any other future<em> Subnautica</em> franchise product.”</p> <p><em>Subnautica 2</em> is currently scheduled to arrive sometime in 2026 and Krafton has promised bonus payouts to the remaining staff at Unknown Worlds despite the delay. Many fans on the subreddit, initially incensed by the sudden upheaval at the studio, have sounded increasingly burnt out on the back-and-forth volleys of accusations. At the rate at which most legal battles unfold, they’ll likely be playing the sequel long before the $250 million dispute is settled.</p> <p>“We believe the facts speak for themselves,” Krafton wrote in a statement today. “This answer reflects our commitment to protecting both the<em> Subnautica</em> IP and the global community that has supported it for years.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A dataminer has discovered that PlayStation compatible Halo titles were listed in the API, suggesting that a release for the platform is imminent. </p>



<p>Recently, we received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-will-only-feature-a-campaign-mode-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several details</a> about upcoming Halo games, including the Combat Evolved remake, Project Ekur, and the next mainline instalment for the series. The same source has now returned with new datamined details, hinting that a Halo release for PlayStation could be on the cards. </p>



<h2 id="h-halo-datamine-suggests-a-playstation-release-is-on-the-way">Halo Datamine Suggests a PlayStation Release is On the Way</h2>



<p>The new information about Halo games coming to PlayStation comes from <a href="https://x.com/gruntdotapi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Grunt.api</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1955012440032186804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RebsGaming</a>. Rebs Gaming is known for his scoops on Halo games and has used grunt.api as a source on several occasions. The dataminer has revealed unreleased information and images of upcoming content on multiple occasions in the past. In 2021, grunt.api was able to predict accurately when Halo Infinite’s multiplayer mode would be released. </p>



<p>The Halo Dataminer can access the Halo games’ API (application programming interface), which enables them to provide such details early. According to their latest findings, a “new Halo title with PlayStation compatibilty is listed in the API”. The same title was seen linked to PlayFab last Monday, a backend platform that helps with cross-platform progression, matchmaking, and unified online services. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-playstation-compatible-halo-title-could-be-project-ekur">PlayStation Compatible Halo Title Could be Project Ekur</h2>



<p>Moreover, a beta title and a second new Halo title with PlayStation compatibility were discovered in the API; however, the dataminer has limited information on these two. According to them, the new Halo title for PlayStation could be Certain Affinity’s upcoming multiplayer title, Project Ekur. The dataminer also speculates that the two listings could be for the same game, one for its beta and the other for the full release. </p>



<p>For those unaware, RebsGaming had stated that Project Tatanka, Halo Infinite’s cancelled battle royale mode, was handed over to Certain Affinity. It was then rebranded as a separate multiplayer game using Unreal Engine 5, which is currently codenamed Project Ekur. RebsGaming also stated that the “best case scenario” would be that players receive announcements for Halo CE Remake, Project Ekur and Project Ekur’s beta at the upcoming Halo World Championship 2025, scheduled for this October. </p>



<p>Halo Studios has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-halo-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that more details about the Halo franchise and its next game will be revealed later this year. RebsGaming concluded in their post that “at least one new Halo game is releasing on PlayStation and it could include a Beta.” Regardless, players should take all of this information with a grain of salt as it doesn’t come from an official source. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In NHL 26, EA Sports is introducing updates to the ICE-Q gameplay feature that debuted a year ago. This year, however, in partnership with NHL Edge, NHL 26 will feature real-world puck and player tracking data for the first time.</p>



<p>Dubbed ICE-Q 2.0, EA says <strong>“players will notice significant differentiation between superstar athletes”</strong>. The data from real NHL teamss and players <strong>“directly influences player attributes and personal tendencies like skating speed, shot power, signature playstyles, and even goalie reactions.”</strong></p>



<h6 id="h-more-nhl-nhl-26-features-include-be-a-pro-and-gameplay-updates">MORE NHL: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-26-features-include-be-a-pro-and-gameplay-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NHL 26 Features Include Be A Pro And Gameplay Updates</a></h6>



<p>The studio says that the new integration will elevate the on-ice experience for players to increase authenticity and “strategic depth”.</p>



<p><strong>“The energy from the NHL is electric, with its diehard fans and the talent and physicality of the athletes. It’s our job to translate that energy from the ice to the screen and make it as realistic as possible,” </strong>EA Sports president Cam Weber said. <strong>“By harnessing the very same data points the NHL uses to inform all sorts of game-time strategies, EA SPORTS is doubling down on innovations and partnerships to make the most true-to-life reflection of hockey possible.”</strong></p>



<p>The ultimate goal, EA says, is to allow every player to move, think, and play like the stars they see on the ice.</p>



<p>NHL 26 launches on September 5 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S for players who purchase the Deluxe Edition. Those with the Standard Edition have to wait until September 12. The game is exclusively available on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Do you think real-world data with ICE-Q 2.0 will make a difference in gameplay for NHL 26? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

                <p>Back in 2012, the worlds of Street Fighter and Tekken collided in the 2.5D fighting game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/street-fighter-x-tekken/" data-ref-id="5000-80868">Street Fighter X Tekken</a>. This was a two-part project that would have been followed up by Tekken X Street Fighter, bringing Capcom's roster of brawlers into the 3D space of Tekken. That <em>was</em> the plan at the time, but by 2016, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tekken-x-street-fighter-no-longer-in-active-develo/1100-6438976/" data-ref-id="1100-6438976">development had been put on hold</a>.</p><p>Just how much of the project was completed before Bandai Namco and Capcom pulled the plug on it? According to Tekken series producer Katsuhiro Harada, the team behind this project was "30%" into development, and he'd love to show fans what had been produced up to that point.</p>

<p>"It’s hard to say if that's even a thing," Harada said when asked about the status of Tekken X Street Fighter by <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/harada-feels-like-making-tekken-tag-tournament-3-wouldnt-make-much-sense-and-that-tekken-needs-a-tag-mode-instead/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Destructoid</a>. "I mean, it depends on what people are wanting as well. That said, I would like to show people what we already have. That would be cool if we could do that. We were 30% into development, so fingers crossed."</p><p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tekken-x-street-fighter-might-still-happen-its-just-on-pause/1100-6493204/" data-ref-id="1100-6493204">Harada suggested that development might resume one day</a>, as the development team was waiting for the right opportunity to revive the project.</p><p>While Tekken X Street Fighter never saw the light of day, Tekken 7 did provide a look at what the project could have been. The 2015 game featured Street Fighter's Akuma as a playable character and a major part of the Tekken saga's storyline.</p><p>Like other Tekken characters, Akuma had his own unique fighting style and he could unleash several of his signature attacks in combat. Akuma didn't have a Rage Drive meter in Tekken 7, but he did have a Super Combo meter that he could burn segments from to power up his attacks into "EX" moves.</p><p>Beyond that, Street Fighter and Tekken have forged ahead with new games on PC and console. Street Fighter 6 was released in 2023 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/street-fighter-6-c-viper-character-teaser-trailer/2300-6466230/">and the next character being added to its roster is C. Viper</a>.</p><p>Tekken 8 launched in 2024, and like Street Fighter, post-launch plans for the game have revolved around new fighters being added semi-regularly. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/evo-2025-everything-announced-at-the-annual-three-day-fighting-game-fest/2900-6841/">The next season of Tekken 8 will see two more characters enter the ring</a>, as fan-favorite wrestler Armor King will be available starting October 13 and will be joined by Madagascan Miary Zo in winter.</p>

                <p>An update to the Xbox Dashboard should make big gaming libraries a lot easier to navigate through a simple addition, though only certain Xbox Insiders will be able to try out the new feature first. Per the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/xbox-insider-release-notes/console/alpha-skip-ahead/2025/08/alpha-skip-ahead-2509-250807-2200" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Support</a> site, a new Xbox Update Preview came out Monday for Xbox Insiders in the invite-only Alpha Skip-Ahead ring, and it adds a notable quality-of-life feature.</p><p>The preview build incluides "Free with Xbox" section under the Full Library tab, which separates demos and limited-time trials from the "Owned Games" section. Basically, it'll be easier to find actual video games in your collection without having to sift through several useless tiles on the menu.</p>

<p>Finally, you'll no longer have to look at relics like "Bleeding Edge Beta" and "Titanfall 2 Open Multiplayer Tech Test" alongside your full games. It's worth noting that you can manually hide these tiles already with a "Hide from list" option, but the upcoming menu update will essentially do all that work for you. Other existing tabs on the Xbox's full library menu include ones that house Games with Gold, video streaming applications, and Xbox Game Pass titles.</p><p>In addition to the new tab, the Xbox Update Preview includes the usual "stability and performance fixes" that come with software patches. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-accepting-new-insiders-for-xbox-alpha-and-skip-ahead/1100-6498490/" data-ref-id="1100-6498490">Alpha Skip-Ahead Ring of Xbox Insiders</a> receives console updates long before the general Xbox user base gets them. There are four other rings in the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/guide-to-insider-program" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Insider program, which is free to join</a>, that have access to these updates at different stages in time before their wider release.</p><p>There is no indication from Xbox that this new menu section will be added to the Xbox PC interface, but the app is still getting some significant new updates that Xbox Insiders can already try out. A June update<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-pc-app-is-aggregating-your-game-library-from-other-stores/1100-6532634/" data-ref-id="1100-6532634"> aggregates game libraries from other stores</a> to create a unified library, and a July update lets users <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-pc-app-now-lets-you-stream-your-own-games-including-console-exclusives/1100-6533503/" data-ref-id="1100-6533503">stream their console games on PC</a>.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-response</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/krafton-responds-to-subnautica-2-lawsuit-doubling-down-on-claims-that-executives-%E2%80%98abandoned%E2%80%99-development.1268205/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Subnautica 2 </em>publisher Krafton is accusing Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill of “resort[ing] to litigation to demand a multimillion-dollar payday they haven’t earned,” according to the company’s response to the former executive’s lawsuit. That lawsuit, filed in July, accused Krafton of intentionally obstructing development of <em>Subnautica 2</em>. Now, Krafton says the founders took the company to court “rather than investing the effort necessary to meet the earn-out conditions they freely negotiated.”</p><p>Worse than the multimillion-dollar payday, they say, the former executives are looking for their jobs back — “to roles and positions they abandoned years before they ever filed this action.”</p><p>The former Unknown Worlds executives filed the original complaint in the Delaware Chancery Court in July after Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill were fired and <em>Subnautica 2</em> was delayed. The dispute quickly became messy before the lawsuit was filed and after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg reported</a> that Unknown Worlds leadership intended to share a milestone bonus with the team that was called off with the game’s delay. Krafton has since extended the schedule for a “potential bonus payout,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per a Bloomberg report</a>.</p><p>Krafton’s response, filed earlier in August and of which a redacted version was obtained by Aftermath, is the company’s official legal response to the lawsuit. It lays out Krafton’s defense, beginning with the “equity purchase agreement” that Krafton signed with Unknown Worlds in 2021, when Krafton paid $500 million “in exchange for 100% of Unknown Worlds’ outstanding shares.” The purchase agreement also laid out the plan for up to $250 million in <em>Subnautica 2</em> met certain&nbsp; milestones before June 2026. Krafton says in the response that Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill “quickly lost interest in developing <em>Subnautica 2</em>” after being paid for their part of the sale — $200 million each for Cleveland and McGuire, and $60 million to Gill.</p><p>“Cleveland and McGuire abandoned their roles as studio-wide Game Director and Technical&nbsp; Director to focus on their personal passion projects and quit making games for Unknown&nbsp; Worlds entirely,” Krafton writes. “And Gill, who remained, focused on leveraging his operational&nbsp; control to maximize the earnout payment, rather than developing a successful game.”</p><p>Unknown Worlds published its breakout hit, <em>Subnautica</em>, in 2018. The underwater survival game has the player acting as a diver exploring an alien ocean after a crash. The player is tasked with surviving the harsh environment by finding resources and exploring the unknown ocean world — and, hopefully, escape. A spin-off, <em>Subnautica: Below Zero</em>, was released in May 2021 before <em>Subnautica 2</em> was announced in 2024. There was no public release date for <em>Subnautica 2</em> to be released in early access, but it was expected for 2025. <em>Subnautica 2</em> was officially delayed into 2026 <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-2-coming-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a notice on the Unknown Worlds website on July 9</a>; days before, Krafton announced that Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-loses-leadership-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had left the studio</a> and Striking Distance CEO Steve Papoutsis had taken over Unknown Worlds. Then, it got messy.</p><p>The former executives painted Krafton as a greedy company that sabotaged <em>Subnautica</em> <em>2</em>’s development to keep from paying out hundreds of millions in bonus payments, while Krafton is accusing the former Unknown Worlds leadership of taking the money and running. Krafton says that an unnamed development director at Krafton that people at the studio believe Cleveland and McGuire had checked out. (Krafton says Cleveand pursued filmmaking, something he alleged was at the behest of Krafton, while McGuire allegedly took more personal projects. Gill, Krafton writes, “condoned and sit idly by this conduct.) Krafton alleges it asked the executives to return to their duties to prevent further delays, but says that they “refused, irresponsibly stating that the project would be better off with smarter, more capable people.”</p><p>Krafton says in the document that it had to fire the three executives “to prevent [them] from permanently damaging Unknown Worlds’ most valuable IP, the Company itself, and its goodwill with its fans.” (Krafton points to <em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em> multiple times as an example of irreversible harm to a franchise. <em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em> was published in early access in 2023 by Private Division, following the successful <em>Kerbal Space Program </em>from 2015. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/too-early-access-for-early-accessplayers-react-to-kerbal-space-program-2-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Per a PC Gamer report from 2023</a>, <em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em> was “too early access for early access.”) Their behavior, Krafton says, was grounds for termination.</p><p>In over 100 pages, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900734536/Unknown-Worlds-lawsuit-via-Aftermath-Krafton-s-response" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Krafton responds to every claim made by the former executives in their complaint</a>, going over the document paragraph-by-paragraph. Most of the document is Krafton denying allegations or admitting to certain facts, like a timeline, as is standard in documents like these. The company is asking the court to deny all claims made by the former Unknown Worlds executives in their complaint, and to award Krafton costs like attorney’s fees.</p><p>“We believe the facts speak for themselves,” a Krafton representative said in a statement. “This answer reflects our commitment to protecting both the Subnautica IP and the global community that has supported it for years.”</p><p>The former Unknown Worlds executives did not immediately respond to Aftermath’s request for comment.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia"><h3>I Bloody Love The Drifter</h3></a><p>A homage to Lucasarts, John Carpenter and so much more</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-best-video-game-boats"><h3>Let’s Remember Some Good Video Game Boats</h3></a><p>"Assassin’s Creed is reinventing interest in sea shanties.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ninja-gaiden-4-to-last-15-20-hours-plus-challenge-missions-and-optional-%E2%80%98purgatory%E2%80%99-battles.1268187/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-1-hour-new-gameplay-team-ninja-explains-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release of fresh new gameplay footage</a>, Team Ninja has now also shared an estimate of how long Ninja Gaiden 4 is going to be when it releases later this year. <a href="https://next-play.com.au/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-preview-and-development-team-interview-meeting-yakumo-ryus-return-new-weapons-dlc-plans-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Australian website Next Play</a>, Game Director Masakazu Hirayama said that the first playthrough should take most players between fifteen and twenty hours, but then there are also the Challenge Missions to consider.</p>



<p><em>Your first playthrough, you can expect about 15 to 20 hours. But, like I mentioned before, after you beat the game once, you unlock Master Ninja difficulty and then, of course, outside of the story mode, there’s also the challenge missions and also chapter challenge as well … so there’s going to be a robust amount of content for players to sink their teeth into after they complete their first playthrough.</em></p>



<p>Regarding these Challenge Missions, Hirayama-san added:</p>



<p><em>In the full release, there’ll be missions outside of just boss fights. So you have to fight in groups of enemies under special conditions that differ from what you experienced in the story mode.</em></p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 also offers some optional battles hidden within the game 'Purgatory', and you can even wager before entering these fights. Hirayama explained:</p>



<p><em>It’s kind of an evolution of the Tests of Valor that were in previous Ninja Gaiden games. The idea of having players choose the level of risk for that reward, that was something we included to kind of stoke the flames of challenge.</em></p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is co-developed by Team Ninja and PlatinumGames, with Xbox Game Studios publishing the title. It will be released on October 21 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Just like all the games published by Xbox Game Studios, it will also be available for PC and Xbox Game Pass subscribers from day one.</p>

        <p>Updates planned through Winter at the least, Capcom say</p>

            <p>Still troubled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>’ stubbornly sedate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">PC performance</a>, even after multiple patches <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-two-aims-to-defeat-the-biggest-beasts-of-all-shader-compilation-and-vram-issues">claiming</a> to grease its framerate gears? The good news is that Capcom have committed to pushing through performance and stability updates into, at the very least, Winter 2025. The bad news is that Capcom also say they won’t have finished their performance and stability improvements until, at the earliest, Winter 2025.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/letter-2508/">In a post</a> detailing tomorrow’s version 1.021 update, game director Yuya Tokuda ran through Capcom’s future plans for the PC version, specifically how they intend to bring down Wilds’ CPU load. The post frames this as an attempt to protect players’ chips by reducing the stress it’s under while playing, but in theory such a change could improve overall performance by allowing CPUs extra go-fast headroom. However, Tokuda specifies that this change will be part of Title Update 4, which is currently down for release sometime between November and January – the <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.021.00.00.html">1.021 update itself</a> doesn’t include any notable performance tweaks whatsoever.</p>
<p>What’s more, this will only be phase one of the CPU optimisation plan: "Once the initial implementation is complete," the post reads, "we will proceed with a second stage of further mitigation measures."</p>
<p>That’s not all you're getting – Tokuda adds that unspecified future patches will "address GPU load reduction in a similar manner" – but if you were hoping to finally fell and skin MHW’s performance gremlins anytime soon, there is in fact little to do except watch Capcom keep scraping away at the whetstone and pray that these updates will be more successful than the last few. On that note, although some small gains have been made, Wilds still doesn’t run particularly smoothly even on higher-end <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a>, and some of Capcom’s attempts to soothe the pain (such as enabling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">frame generation</a> by default, in a tragic misunderstanding of how frame generation is supposed to work) have smacked of cheap tricks rather than clever solutions.</p><p>Will these future patches prove any more successful? I couldn’t say, though other parts of Tokuda’s post aren’t massively enthusing. "In general, increasing the native frame rate will also increase CPU usage," he writes. "If the frame rate limit is set to unlimited or a high value in the options, CPU performance will be maximized in the attempt to increase the frame rate, which may result in a very high CPU usage. Please adjust your graphics options to limit the frame rate in accordance with your hardware's specifications."</p>
<p>Ah, see, maybe low framerates aren’t the problem. It’s <em>you</em>, the feckless player, who is leaving the framerate limit too high, thus causing... bad CPU utilisation, somehow. Don’t worry, though. You only need to keep blaming yourself until we switch to Big Coat weather. Maybe.</p>

            <p>Following Itch.io's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">mass delisting of adult games</a> in response to pressure from payment processors, a new report includes claims from LGBTQ+ devs that safe-for-work titles with lesbian or yuri themes have also been affected.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing">Itch</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-point-to-mastercard-restrictions-as-the-payment-firm-deny-influencing-adult-game-removals">Valve</a> changed their rules on adult content last month, with the issue evolving into a complex pointing of fingers which traced from the storefronts, to credit card companies, and on to an Australian protest group. That group, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">Collective Shout</a>, claimed responsibility for exerting the initial pressure that got the ball rolling. Itch.io have since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/major-payment-firm-behind-itch-adult-game-cull-say-they-themselves-face-restrictions-from-another-banking-firm">allowed free adult games back onto the platform</a>, but paid ones currently remain on the naughty step as the storefront seeks new payment processors.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Naturally, that's had a substantial affect on developers of NSFW games, which this extensive report from <a href="https://transnews.network/p/i-feel-violated-queer-creators-lose-livelihoods-in-itch-io-bans">Trans News Network</a> delves into. It touches on the various situations of LGBTQ+ devs from a number of different countries, and sees a few of them claim that even safe-for-work lesbian or yuri games have been affected by the ban. For the unfamiliar, yuri is a genre of Japanese media focusing on relationships between women. These can be of a romantic nature, but aren't always.</p>
<p>Having had an NSFW demo taken down as part of the deindexing, developer <a href="https://krispycat.itch.io/">krispycat</a> claims they searched up three of their safe-for-work games (<a href="https://krispycat.itch.io/wendy">Wendy</a>, <a href="https://krispycat.itch.io/wendy">Warm</a>, and <a href="https://krispycat.itch.io/warm">Like Seafoam</a>). "However, they don't appear in the suggestions either - I suspect it's because they're yuri games," they said. "I am concerned that my audience will be severely cut. I'm already having to search for other places to release [the full game that accompanies their NSFW demo], and am worrying where I will be able to release future projects as well."</p><p>Another developer known as Maddie May AKA <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/certifydmilkboy.bsky.social">Milkboy</a> also claims that a safe-for-work project of hers has been deindexed as part of the changes. Meanwhile, the report cites writer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/deetheredwitch.bsky.social">Dee</a> as claiming that her works don't contain anything that violates Itch's content rules, but have still been deindexed. A game jam dubbed the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/toxic-yuri-vn-jam">Toxic Yuri Game Jam</a> has also reportedly seen over half of its 200 plus games delisted, with several removed from Itch.io completely.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Itch.io for comment.</p>
<p>It's worth giving the full report a read, as it features numerous tales of the effect this content policy change has had on the lives and livelihoods of affected devs.</p>
<p>"I am an older millennial queer and I remember the feelings of loneliness and the void of just not having anything like me in what I played," said developer <a href="https://taylormccue.itch.io/">Taylor McCue</a>. "I got to see Itch become a renaissance of queer works and community. I viewed it as an art movement and a potential future that I was a part of. Since my game has been de-indexed, I don’t know what to think. The pessimistic part of me knew this day would come, but I didn’t think it would come so soon. When it did come I thought Itch would at least email me or something."</p><p>If you're keen for more information as to how payment processors and similar companies can influence where adult content's permitted and what's considered as falling under the definition of it, make sure to read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">our Edwin's in-depth feature</a> on the topic.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The hit 2024 survival crafting sim <em>Palworld</em> is conspicuously absent from the Nintendo eShop amid an ongoing battle with Nintendo, which has <a href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-company-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-1851652124">accused the game of violating its patents</a>. The same can’t be said for <em>Palland</em>, a cheap knock-off that Nintendo seemed to have no problem approving for sale on the Switch eShop earlier this summer.</p> <p>Glance at the store listing for <em>Palland</em> (via <em><a href="https://nintendosoup.com/palworld-ripoff-palland-launches-on-nintendo-switch/">NintendoSoup</a></em>) and you’ll instantly clock it as a <em>Palworld </em>clone. Like much of the knock-off slop that crowds digital storefronts, it’s a simplified version of an existing game that mimics the art style and marketing more than the actual gameplay. Published on July 31 by BoggySoft, the $10 game bills itself as a base-building survival sim in which you harvest resources and kill stuff. What it doesn’t mention is anything about collecting creatures that look strikingly similar to certain Pokémon.</p> <p>“<em>Palland</em> delivers a rich and immersive experience where base-building, combat, exploration, and evolution blend into one dynamic and strategic journey,” reads the description. Gameplay footage uploaded by various people on YouTube shows the reality: an avatar who looks straight out of<em> Palworld</em> running around boring fields fighting cute creatures with incredibly low-budget animations.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Palland - Nintendo Switch / Switch 2 Compatible gameplay release" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5cgDinhbB9k?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>What <em>Palland</em> is missing that got <em>Palworld</em> in trouble are Pokémon mechanics like getting creatures to low-health, aiming not-Poké-Balls at them to capture them, and later being able to ride on their backs. Those are the gameplay loops Nintendo said <em>Palworld</em> maker Pocketpair violated its patents for, leading to a lawsuit filed last year. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/palworld-pocketpair-nintendo-pokemon-lawsuit-whats-next">As reported by <em>Game File</em></a>, Pocketpair has been implementing a series of tweaks beginning last November to each of these mechanics to address Nintendo’s legal complaints, although it remains for the court to decide if the updates go far enough.</p> <p>While Nintendo might not have a problem with <em>Palland</em> since its creatures aren’t obvious knock-offs of Pokémon and it isn’t selling tens of millions of copies, the proliferation of games like <em>Palland</em> is a clear problem for developers on storefronts like the eShop. In addition to lots of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494">other generic AI slop</a>, it’s now common to see console storefronts quickly fill up with knockoffs of Steam games after they blow up in popularity on PC. PSN is already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1mgas2z/a_popular_game_on_steam_called_peak_just_recently/">chock full of <em>Peak</em> clones</a>.</p> <p>That was part of the irony of Sony <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-tencent-sony-lawsuit-knockoff-steam-art-2000616608">suing Tencent</a> over its obvious <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> ripoff. While the publisher is quick to deal with rival companies allegedly infringing on its IP, small studios and solo devs are left to scream into the customer service void to try and get cheap cash-grab clones of their work policed on the PlayStation Store. You’ve heard of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/schedule-1-drug-dealing-sim-steam-big-hit-400k-indie-1851773695">2025 Steam sensation <em>Schedule I</em></a>, but can I interest you in some <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10015587"><em>Trippy Trader&nbsp;: Schedule &amp; Sell</em></a>? Unlike <em>Schedule I</em>, it’ll be available on PS4 later this month</p>

<p><strong>The official start times haven’t been confirmed, but unless something changes, we expect a similar start time to week one—08:00 UTC.</strong></p>



<p>The week one <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-start-times-today-explained-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 beta start times</a> might not be the same as week two. We’ve seen nothing to say it’s going to be different, but as of writing, we also don’t know if any changes are happening.</p>



<p>If you want a handy breakdown of the expected <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6</a> week two start times for key regions, take a look at the table I’ve whipped up for you.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Battlefield 6 Open Beta Week Two Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Daylight Time (PDT)</td><td data-align="center">1:00 AM—August 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Daylight Time (CDT)</td><td data-align="center">3:00 AM—August 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)</td><td data-align="center">4:00 AM—August 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM—August 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT)</td><td data-align="center">6:00 PM—August 14</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

Cold and distant, she floats above the ground, lashing out with psychic blasts and violent telekinesis. Her eyes are vacant, her voice devoid of emotion—something ancient has taken hold of her…and it’s not letting go.</p><p><strong>Super Anubis</strong></p><p>For years, whispers claimed Anubis was a fraud, a cult figure with no true power. But now, Super Anubis has emerged: levitating, glowing, and summoning dark forces beyond comprehension. The question lingers—was he a fake all along…or a prophet finally revealed?</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

Dixon spoke of what's in store for the game, and the difficulty of knowing when exactly it might be completely done. But interestingly, despite the fact the game is still yet to leave early access, the topic of a hypothetical Phasmophobia 2 came up, and Dixon shared whether he think it's possible or not.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phasmophobia-2-is-definitely-not-off-the-cards-dev-says-original-on-track-to-finally-exit-early-access-in-2026" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>, Dixon explained that Kinetic Games "definitely [has] plans for 1.0, probably in line with our Horror 2.0 update, where we feel the game is feature-complete," Dixon said. "It doesn't mean we'll stop working on it--we still want map reworks and new maps and stuff in the future, so there'll be more stuff for the game. But I think once the Horror 2.0 has been redone, which is the next thing we work on after the [2025's] <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kinetics-next-phasmophobia-updates-come-with-extensive-map-reworks-improved-seasonal-events/1100-6529369/">Player Update</a>, the game will feel finished.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Phasmophobia Devs Look Back on 5 Years of Success</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Dixon did note that it's hard to determine when Phasmophobia may exactly be finished apart from a rough 2026 window, in part because its community is constantly offering suggestions for things the game could include. "We'd love to work on it until we're really happy with it," he continued. "We haven't set a date or an update that's like: we're done. I think we'll just know: there'll be that company-wide feeling that this project is done now, we've made it the best it can be, which is what [creator] Dan [Knight] wanted Day One." Dixon noted that he doesn't think the team can plan for just when they might hit that milestone, but they'll be able to feel it when it happens.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked about a potential sequel, Dixon also said that he "wouldn't write it off," saying it would be a "fun challenge," to start over from scratch with another one. "There are a lot of things that I know we would change as a company if we went into Phas fresh. There's definitely things we would all probably say, 'Oh, let's not do that!' Or 'that would be awesome. We should do that instead.'" Essentially, don't place any bets right now, but as Dixon put it, "It's definitely not off the cards."</p><p dir="ltr">Details are still pretty slim about Phasmophobia's Horror 2.0 update, but the aforementioned Player Update due out later this year is expected to add more customization features, as well as improved character models. There's also a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobias-new-map-welcomes-ghost-hunters-to-nells-diner/1100-6533688/" data-ref-id="1100-6533688">new update</a> that just released today, bringing in a rework of Grafton Farmhouse and a number of other additions and changes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last December, PUBG Battlegrounds creator Brendan “Playerunknown” Greene announced the debut title of his new indie studio, Prologue: Go Wayback. Billed as an open-world survival game boasting dynamic environments and emergent gameplay, the game is set to debut in PC Early Access, but players can dive in now with the release of its first open beta.</p><p>Greene’s studio, Playerunknown Productions, says Prologue: Go Wayback is a survival game “where every journey is unique.” Players explore a procedurally generated wilderness modeled after the Czech Bohemia region to reach a weather tower. Accomplishing this involves using a small suite of tools, such as a map and compass, while learning how to navigate the terrain by utilizing natural landmarks and minimal direct guidance.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_hU9eG0-Ep8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_hU9eG0-Ep8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The game has no scripted path, quest markers, or instructions, giving players the freedom to explore as they see fit. Players are also challenged to manage fluctuating statuses such as body temperature, hunger, and thirst as they travel from shelter to shelter to reach the tower.</p><p>Prologue: Go Wayback leverages machine learning (ML) technology to generate realistically rendered terrain maps in Unreal Engine 5. To avoid pulling from copyrighted materials, Playerunknown Productions states it has trained its ML model to use publicly available open-source data that the studio then vets.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the game's new screenshots in the gallery below.&nbsp;</p><p>Prologue is also the first of a three-game plan to build <a href="https://playerunknownproductions.net/projects/project-artemis">Project Artemis</a>, a larger project designed to “create and deliver a technology and platform that enables massive-scale creation and emergent play.” These three games, two of which are unannounced, will represent a solution to what the studio refers to as the "three problems of scale: realistic terrain generation, player and NPC interactions, and millions of players sharing the same online space." Prologue is designed to tackle the terrain generation aspect of this initiative.&nbsp;</p><p>The open beta comes after six months of playtests by the game’s Discord community.&nbsp;It will remain available and regularly updated with new features until the game’s Early Access launch on Steam and Epic in the coming months. Green posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WYULFCO49PQ">video message</a> stating that planned updates include community-requested features such as a map editor, a world settings menu letting players set the world as they choose, and a save game function.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/12/pubg-creator-launches-open-beta-for-new-survival-game-prologue-go-wayback]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a>, the global data firm for videogame industry sales has collaborated with <a href="https://www.tebex.io/">Tebex</a>, a monetization platform that videogame studios use for in-game purchases to publish a report that dives into player spending in North America and Europe. </p>



<p>The <em><a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/trend-reports/newzoo-tebex-unlocking-games-revenue-player-behavior-and-payment-trends">Unlocking Games Revenue: Player Behavior and Payment Trends in the West</a></em> report has more than a few interesting revelations about player spending in North America and Europe, like how players in those two regions are the minority of the world's gamers but <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-of-worlds-gamers-drive-nearly-half-global-gaming-spend-north-america-europe-newzoo/">drive nearly half of all spending in the videogame industry</a>.</p>



<p>But the videogame industry is not what it was 20 years ago, where spending trends would be mostly based on players buying individual games. Microtransactions are the name of today's game in the modern videogame landscape, and there are some interesting differences between North American players spending on microtransactions versus European players.</p>



<p>At a top-level look, players in Europe spend on microtransactions than players in North America, with sports games being the top genre in Europe, while shooters are the top genre in North America. "<em>Microtransactions make up nearly half of PC and one-third of console gam revenues in Europe</em>," according to Newzoo and Tebex.</p>

<p>In both North America and in Europe, however, consoles are the only platforms where premium game purchases still account for over 50% of player spending. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo and Tebex</figcaption></figure>



<p>But when it comes to why players are spending their hard-earned cash, the reason for hitting the 'buy now' button is very different for players in North America and players in Europe. 28% of European players, according to Newzoo and Tebex, will choose to spend their money in the videogame industry if something is on sale or at what they deem to be a 'good price.' Whereas North American players top reason for buying anything is so that it gives them access to extra or exclusive playable content.</p>



<p>Buying something because it's on sale is the fifth of the top-five reasons listed for North America.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo and Tebex</figcaption></figure>



<p>As far as what microtransactions players are buying in North America and Europe, however, those lists are much closer. Four out of the top five categories of in-game microtransaction purchases are the same between North American and European players, with players in both regions prioritizing expansions, power-ups, in-game currencies, and in-game subscriptions.</p>



<p>Loot boxes or gacha, as they're listed by Newzoo and Tebex, are at the bottom of the list for both North America and Europe, but that feels at least slightly misleading, since it seemingly means loot boxes purchased directly with real money, rather than a player buying an in-game currency to then spend on loot boxes.</p>



<p>For all the new statistics and bits of information shared in Newzoo and Tebex's report, one element that isn't news to anyone is, to the chagrin of some players, microtransactions and virtual currencies are not going anywhere, anytime soon.</p>



<p>"<em>Virtual currencies and microtransactions are no longer just revenue streams</em>," writes Liam Wiltshire, head of payments and compliance at Tebex. "<em>They're becoming strategic levers for retention and differentiation</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>Last night, country-music-it-girl-turned-pop-culture-centerpiece </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-dark-souls-1851439461"><span>Taylor Swift</span></a><span> did something a little different. She announced a new album called </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span>, but not with the usual gravitas she’s become known for throughout her 20-year career. Rather than endless teases, easter eggs, or waiting until she was on stage accepting an award, Swift revealed her 12th studio album on the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@newheightshow/videos"><i><span>New Heights</span></i></a><span> podcast co-hosted by her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs. It all happened very fast, with much of the pre-announcement teasing happening in the span of less than 24 hours. But despite its brevity, Swift’s rollout felt calculated and littered with the same cheeky nods that send fans into overdrive that she’s come to be known for. Even as a casual Swift listener, I can’t help but respect her love of the literal game.</span></p> <p><span>It all started on August 11 as Swift’s publicity team, Taylor Nation, </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNN0isCNpBb/"><span>posted several photos</span></a><span> of the singer on her Eras Tour on social media. Notably, each picture shows her in an orange outfit, with orange eventually being revealed as the primary color for </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span>. Miss </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spotify-wrapped-2024-sabrina-carpenter-espresso-streams-1851714545/2"><span>“Espresso”</span></a><span> herself, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-sabrina-carpenter-icon-skin-leak-festival-1851772197"><span>Sabrina Carpenter</span></a><span>, is also in one of these photos, sparking speculation that she might be featured on the album when it launches. The post has the caption, “Thinking about when she said ‘See you next era…’” referencing a line in Swift’s book documenting the Eras Tour. All of this made it clear that Swift was nearing an announcement, but the quickness with which it came was both surprising and a bit of a relief. Kelce’s show posted a teaser for the episode that would eventually feature Swift, which included her silhouette on the thumbnail, but Swift’s usual playful microcosm of marketing came from her own website, and included a countdown that ended at 12:12 a.m. this morning. You get it? 12? Because it’s her 12th album?</span></p>   <p><span>The actual </span><i><span>New Heights </span></i><span>episode will go live on Wednesday at 7 p.m. Eastern, but the album is already up for pre-order, both as a standard CD and on orange vinyl or cassette. Fans haven’t seen the cover or heard a song, and they’re already showing up to buy the album. Right now, </span><i><span>New Heights</span></i><span> has posted a brief clip of Swift showing off the album, but its cover has been blurred out, presumably to get more eyes on the podcast when it goes up. Even when Swift is going the more straightforward route, she can’t help but make it a waiting game.</span></p>

 <p><span>Even with less than 24 hours between tease and announcement, Swifties are hard-wired to start the guessing games the second they get a whiff of a hint. Sometimes it sends them down a rabbit hole with a dead end, such as when they spent a year looking for clues about a coveted </span><i><span>Taylor’s Version </span></i><span>re-recording of her 2017 album </span><i><span>Reputation</span></i><span>, only for the singer to reveal that she </span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-reputation-taylors-version-not-releasing-1235351379/"><span>had barely done any work on it</span></a><span>, and now doesn’t really need to after she </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/31/nx-s1-5418406/taylor-swift-buys-back-master-recordings-now-she-controls-all-of-her-music"><span>bought back her masters</span></a><span> and could leave the </span><i><span>Taylor’s Version </span></i><span>project behind. The fact that no re-recorded version was even imminent makes creative decisions like Swift changing up her outfit for the </span><i><span>Reputation </span></i><span>set of the Eras Tour </span><a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a62658289/taylor-swift-new-reputation-bodysuit-eras-tour-photos/"><span>after months of wearing the same thing</span></a><span> feel like trolling meant to throw off the most detail-oriented fans looking for any hint that the album might be on the way.</span></p> <p><span>Swifties have been trained to view every creative decision, big and small, as a reference to what’s next. Not everything is a misdirect, and fans have felt vindicated when what seemed like small nods ended up being clues to major reveals. The music video for “Bejeweled,” for instance, has a scene in which Swift’s Cinderella-like character enters an elevator, and each of the buttons has a different color scheme, with each one seemingly corresponding to one of her albums, all of which have noted “main” colors. Fans noticed that the last button on the elevator had the same purple as her third album </span><i><span>Speak Now</span></i><span>, which seemed to hint that she would be re-recording that record next as part of the </span><i><span>Taylor’s Version </span></i><span>project. Lo and behold, the remade album was released the following July.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Taylor Swift - Bejeweled (Official Music Video)" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b7QlX3yR2xs?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Some of these nods are more subtle than Swift literally pointing at a representation of the next album to be re-recorded. When she announced her 11th album, </span><i><span>The Tortured Poets Department</span></i><span>, at the 2024 Grammys ceremony, she put up a “V sign” with her hand when she said that she’d been keeping the album a secret for two years. However, in retrospect, it’s clear this was a knowing nod to </span><i><span>TTPD</span></i><span>’s status as a double album, which was a closely kept secret until it was released that April and the second half was published on streaming platforms and digital stores two hours later.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Taylor Swift Announces 'Brand New Album' 'The Tortured Poet's Department'" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/REqdODABGXo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>To be a Swiftie is to spend every day looking and listening for clues like you’re exploring an elaborate, decades-old escape room, only to decide with each door you open that you’re content to go deeper into the vault, never actually escaping. She notoriously weaves her personal life into her music, crafting a story people are invested in on both a narrative level and a parasocial one. Each album is like a new chapter in an ongoing story, and even when albums like </span><i><span>Folklore </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Evermore</span></i><span> are presented as fictional concept albums, they mask reality, with fans theory-crafting what nuggets of truth might lie behind each song. Swift crafts lore and legacy like a dungeon master spinning a tale for a party waiting with bated breath for the next session. Even if you’re not a fan of her music, you have to respect the game design at the heart of her work.</span></p>

<p>Fortnite’s Shock N’ Awesome is giving a very Helldivers 2 vibe, and Arrowhead has finally addressed it. </p>



<p>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 ‘Shock N’ Awesome’ went live <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-shock-n-awesome-season-details-revealed-new-enemies-weapons-pois-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last week</a>, introducing new enemies, POIs, weapons, cosmetics and more. Talking about new enemies, Fortnite Island is now facing a bug invasion, with players teaming up to take down hordes of creepy crawlies. Many players feel that this type of bug invasion was already seen in Helldivers 2. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-devs-aren-t-worried-about-fortnite-s-new-season">Helldivers 2 Devs Aren’t Worried About Fortnite’s New Season</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/helldivers-2-dev-new-fortnite-season-feels-very-we-have-helldivers-at-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Videogamer</a>, several players in the Helldivers 2 Discord are asking developers about their views on Fortnite’s new season. The Arrowhead CEO, Shams Jorjani, was the first to respond, stating that Fortnite’s latest season “feels very democratic”. Jorjani has also mentioned previously that he doesn’t play Fortnite as the building feature can be frustrating for him. Jorjani’s go-to shooters are Helldivers and Battlefield. </p>



<p>The community manager at Arrowhead, Katherine Baskin (aka Baskinator), also weighed in on Fortnite’s new season, stating, “it’s giving ‘we have helldivers at home”. When asked if this new season could impact their player numbers, Baskinator stated that she’s “not worried” as “Fortnite is Fortnite” and “Helldivers is Helldivers”. She also praised Fortnite, stating, If the kinds of video game drip think our drip is cool enough to… inspire them… then that’s super cool.” At same time, she adds that both game “couldn’t be more different from one another” and that there’s “room for us all at the king’s table.”</p>



<p>In other news, the new Helldivers 2 trailer features <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-new-helldivers-2-trailer-halo-3-odst-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Halo 3 ODST teaser</a>.
