            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's developer CyberConnect2's 30th birthday, and to celebrate this milestone, the studio has announced <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O.</em>, a brand new installment in the long-running <em>.hack </em>series over which the company has full control.</p><p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/cc2information/status/2023355425437921703" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a social media post</a> (and via an accompanying trailer), <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O. </em>will be "fully self-published by CyberConnect2, from planning to development to release", with usual publisher Bandai Namco granting CyberConnect2 permission to fully manage the project itself.</p><p>According to a newly-revealed <a href="https://www.cc2.co.jp/hackzero/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">official teaser website</a>, <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O. </em>will be a "novel RPG experience" that will blend the franchise's "trademark duality of fantasy (game world) and reality (real world) with modern expectations", and not only that, but it'll also feature "100% pure CyberConnect2 spirit".</p><figure role="group">

<p>The new project's music will be composed by legendary Japanese violinist and composer Taro Hakase, whose "dexterous...violin" helped to "kick-start the project", according to CyberConnect2.</p><p>Outside of these details, we don't know too much about <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O.</em>, but we do know it'll be the first full <em>.hack </em>RPG since 2010's <em>.hack//Link</em>, which was released for the PSP (which should tell you just how long it's been).</p><p>In the interim, a fighting game, <em>.hack//Versus</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hackgu-last-recode-hits-north-america-on-november-3rd" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a8c65b9d-94a0-406f-9822-3dd79877c7ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a remaster</a> of the <em>.hack//GU </em>trilogy have been released, but <em>.hack </em>fans have been waiting quite some time for the continuation of the core series.</p><p>If you're not familiar with the <em>.hack </em>series, the games revolve around a game-within-a-game known simply as <em>The World</em>. It's not dissimilar to anime and manga properties like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2cb237f6-edfc-48d7-83cb-b6bc1d2f5bf9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Solo Leveling</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Sword Art Online</em>, although it predates both.</p>
<p>We don't yet know when we can expect <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O. </em>to launch, although if the game wants to arrive in time for CyberConnect2's 30th anniversary, then a release this year would probably be advantageous. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-dlc-console-sales-steam-edmund-mcmillen-2000669404</link>
            <guid>1437163</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Mewgenics</em>, the new roguelite RPG battler from <em>The Binding of Isaac </em>developer Edmund McMillen and&nbsp;<em>The End Is Nigh</em>‘s Tyler Glaiel, has proven to be an extraordinary success. Launched February 10, during less than a week on sale has hit the #2 spot on Steam’s bestsellers and seen an extraordinary 115,428 simultaneous players—extraordinary because this is a single-player, offline game. At the time of writing it has more people playing than&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>. Given this, McMillen has announced that the game will be coming to consoles <em>and </em>receiving DLC. Oh, and it’s incredible soundtrack is now available to buy.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><em>Mewgenics</em></a> is the bastard child of <em>Slay the Spire</em>, <em>X-COM</em> and&nbsp;<em>Rogue Legacy</em>, a game about taking a team of cats on an adventure to fight in a series of turn-based RPG battles, then breeding the victors to create your next crew. And while we don’t know officially sales numbers yet, it’s fair to say they’re not small. On launch day, just three hours after the game came out, Glaiel posted that <a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-steam-best-seller-strategy-roguelike-2000667706">the seven-year development budget</a> had already been recouped. Glaiel has also posted that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tylerglaiel.com/post/3mermwjydf22m">650,000 people had played the game by Friday</a>, and assuming those are all legitimate sales, that’s over $12 million&nbsp;<em>after</em> Steam’s cut.</p>   <p>There was also a moment of excitement for the pair when the game showed more players than&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>.</p>   <p>All this means there’s budget and an assumed audience to bring the game to consoles. There are no specifics yet, with updates promised for later, but given the game works well with a controller it’ll be a natural fit for Xbox, PS5 and Switch. I also cannot fathom why this isn’t already on mobile, given it’d be the perfect medium.</p>

 <p>The success also means DLC is in the works, and that’s no small feature either, given the core game is so big that the developers reckon still no one’s finished it.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mewgenics updates: <br>-OST is live on the steam page <br>-it’s coming to consoles ( updates later )<br>-there will be dlc <br>-update with some bug fixes soonish<br>-mewgenics merch here &gt; <a href="https://t.co/lKGyqrsAU8">https://t.co/lKGyqrsAU8</a></p> <p>— 🜏 Edmund McMillen 🜏 (@edmundmcmillen) <a href="https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2023170140435796357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Certainly not least, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4415490/Mewgenics_ULTIMATE_Original_Soundtrack_Of_All_Time/">the OST is now up on Steam</a>. It contains an astonishing 82 tracks, and only 27 of them are instrumentals. That means you can hear all the originally recorded songs that pop up while playing, with all their barmy lyrics, even if you can’t reach the second act.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The creator of the God of War series has shared his views on the recently released Sons of Sparta title, and it is evident he is not pleased with the game. </p>



<p>Fans of the God of War franchise had an exciting State of Play event last week. Santa Monica Studio not only confirmed that a God of War <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trilogy Remake is in development</a> but also revealed that <span>it&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank">shadow-dropped</a>&nbsp;a</span> game exploring Kratos’ childhood. However, the newly released title is facing harsh criticism from the series creator.</p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-trashed-by-original-series-creator">God of War: Sons of Sparta Trashed by Original Series Creator </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/god-of-war-creator-david-jaffe-sons-of-sparta-reaction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, God of War series creator, David Jaffe, has gone off on Sons of Sparta on two separate occasions. The first time was after playing the game for just an hour, where he ended up saying things like “this is not God of War”, “who the f**k greenlit this”, and “who thought this is what the audience wants”. Jaffe also went on to say that the “production quality is not very good,” comparing it to games like Ninja Gaiden, Ragebound, and Neon Inferno.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The series creator released a 32-minute video echoing the sentiments expressed in the previous video. In this new video, he critiques the gameplay using clips from the title. It’s evident that the creator is dissatisfied with this installment, particularly because he feels that the character of Kratos, beloved by fans, is not accurately represented. Instead, players are presented with a different character. </p>

"The market has broadened tremendously across both consoles and PC. The FF7 Remake series has sold very well on platforms like Steam and the Epic Games Store, so we develop assets with the broad PC market in mind. In fact, our 3D assets are created at the highest quality level based on PC as the foundation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When FFVII Rebirth launched, there was talk about how the PC version looked better than the PS5 version, and our philosophy will not change for the third instalment," he concluded.

Based on a comment from Insomniac itself, Xbox owners shouldn’t hold their breath.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A fan replied to a tweet from Insomniac celebrating Valentine’s Day to ask about the possibility of Spider-Man swinging onto Xbox, and <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2022752405444505766" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the developer’s response</a> was pretty clear: “Not likely.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, you might say that’s obvious. But, as the replies have pointed out, once upon a time Insomniac ruled out Marvel's Spider-Man ever coming to PC, and it ended up making the jump from PlayStation exclusivity to personal computers.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">it will never appear on Xbox or PC. It's a permanent PS4 exclusive publisher by Sony Interactive Entertainment</p>— Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/879913482845511681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 28, 2017</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, nearly nine years after that tweet, Sony not only publishes games on PC, but on Xbox and Nintendo Switch. Arrowhead’s record-breaking Helldivers 2, for example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-officially-getting-halo-odst-content-but-its-first-legendary-warbond-is-going-to-cost-you">launched on Xbox Series X and S complete with a Halo crossover</a>. And Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> is coming out on Xbox as well as PC and PlayStation. The times have changed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spider-Man, though, does feel like it would be crossing a thicker line to get to Xbox, and Insomniac’s tweet suggests that to be the case. In the shorter term, Insomniac’s Marvel’s Wolverine is due out later this year — exclusively on PlayStation 5. Meanwhile, Insomniac fans expect another Spider-Man game eventually, a continuation of the story as set out in 2023’s Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which launched on PC in January last year. (Last year, Yuri Lowenthal suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-3-actor-says-peter-parker-wont-be-relegated-to-the-couch">Marvel’s Spider-Man 3 will see Peter Parker doing his Spider-Man thing</a> despite what the ending of Spider-Man 2 suggests.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Spider-Man Games</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s approach contrasts with that of Microsoft, which has fully embraced multiplatform for pretty much all its first-party video games. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-set-in-japan-launches-2026"><u>When Microsoft finally announced Playground’s Forza Horizon 6</u></a> and confirmed it would launch on PlayStation 5 <em>after </em>Xbox and PC, it came as a surprise. Nowadays, Xbox Game Studios is one of the most prolific and successful publishers on PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-idea-of-locking-it-to-one-store-or-one-device-is-antiquated-for-most-people-xbox-president-says-microsoft-is-seeing-players-evolve-way-past-big-blockbuster-exclusive-games">Microsoft said the idea of a video game exclusive locked to a single storefront had become “antiquated for most people,”</a> but Sony still refuses to launch its big single-player games on anything other than PlayStation day-one (the latest example of this is Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei). Multiplayer games, however do tend to launch on PC at the same time. Guerrilla’s recently announced co-op action game Horizon Hunters Gathering is set for PS5 and PC. Marathon’s day-one multiplatform launch is something of an outlier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

In this new sale, an unknown buyer placed the winning bid of $13 million to secure the card, with the further $3.49 million added in auction fees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why has it sold for such a huge amount? Well, at a base level, the Pikachu Illustrator is one of the rarest Pokémon cards out there, and its eyebrow-raising PSA 10 grading makes it truly unique and technically flawless. But Paul himself has done a lot to personally try and raise the card's value — and very successfully so. Minus the auction fees, Paul likely stands to make more than $7 million in profit.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/16/maxresdefault-1-1771237895791.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Logan Paul and the $16.49 million card. Image credit: Logan Paul.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Paul has mounted the card in a $70,000 jewel-encrusted necklace (also included in the auction) that he then wore for his WWE debut at WrestleMania 38. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/logan-paul-says-hell-hand-deliver-the-most-expensive-pokmon-card-if-you-buy-it-from-him-at-auction-and-the-price-is-already-more-than-2-million">Announcing the auction last month</a>, Paul then promised to hand-deliver the card — which he billed as "the Mona Lisa of collectibles" —  to its eventual owner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the course of the auction, several other incidents ensured the card (and Paul) remained in the public eye. A brief, bizarre drama involving OnlyFans content creator Emmie Bunni — including a phantom $10.2 million bid and an AI photo of her holding the card — prompted a claim by Paul that her actions had put off further interest. Last week, the influencer-wrestler also got involved in the controversy surrounding Super Bowl LX half time show artist Bad Bunny, and at loggerheads on the issue with his brother Jake Paul. Just days later, the auction reached its climax with a flurry of late bids.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And in general, there's the fact that Pokémon cards have rarely been hotter. This auction has been well-timed, in the run-up to Pokémon's big 30th anniversary celebrations. (Fans are expecting the future of the franchise to be announced on the series' actual anniversary next week, on February 27, alongside more details of the promising-looking Pokémon life simulation spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Logan Paul.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

"This approach is expected to both introduce the title to new players and gradually build anticipation for the next chapter in the series," Shift Up continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That "next chapter" is, of course, sequel <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-confirms-sequel-plans"><u>Stellar Blade 2</u></a>, which is now in development. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We expect 2026 to be a year in which more users experience the existing title while momentum and anticipation builds toward the next phase of the Stellar Blade franchise," Shift Up added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shift Up is also working on <a href="https://in.ign.com/project-spirits" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Spirits</a>, to be published by Level Infinite.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/16/gear-club-unlimited-3-review/</link>
            <guid>1437109</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch was not home to many great racing games, especially ones that didn’t feature karts and moustachioed drivers. So far, that’s continued to play out for the Switch 2, but there are some key signs of change with the arrival of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/27/grid-legends-switch-2-review/">GRID Legends</a> last month. Drafting directly behind it is Gear Club Unlimited 3, an arcade/sim-cade racer that also boasts its own storyline, licensed vehicles and updated visuals, hoping to snatch its own place on the podium. While it puts up a valiant effort, it feels like it’ll remain firmly in the middle of the pack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gear.Club Unlimited 3 | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v6KrxPMV8Wg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As we’re seeing more and more on Switch 2, Gear.Club Unlimited 3 gives you the choice between a 30fps Graphics option and a considerably smoother Performance mode with a 60fps refresh rate. Ideally, racing games need to be 60fps – though 30fps is fine if its stable – and it’s definitely snappier and more responsive. The Graphics option here targets 30fps, but it does not manage it by quite some margin. Stutters and lag happen throughout races in this setting, so much so, that I’d say it’s currently unusable. It doesn’t really seem to make all that much difference to the visuals, either, other than the quality of tyre smoke at the start of races.</p>


<p>In the world of Gear.Club, winning is everything. The story mode sees you joining the organisation as a rookie, before trouncing one of the old pros and stealing his slot on the tour to Japan. Thankfully, everyone is thoroughly amiable, and he comes along as your mentor instead, narrowly avoiding some genuinely interesting conflict and drama. All the story dialogue is told via text boxes and static character art, which serves to emphasise the game’s budget leanings, while the suit and shirt-wearing bigwigs feel completely out of place in a tournament of underground racers. The story is, at best, a fairly forgettable frame to the racing action. At worst, it’s just explaining the next menu you’ve unlocked.</p>


<p>The cars make a better first impression. They are extremely well modelled, shining and glistening in their metallic glory, and striking a tone that will have you feeling pretty positive about Gear.Club Unlimited 3’s chances, though with a roster of 39 cars, it’s relatively slim pickings.</p>
<p>Actually racing them isn’t quite as positive. Gear.Club Unlimited 3 offers a couple of options to tailor your experience, with different levels of brake assist and anti-skid. Whichever option you go for, the cars are relatively well grounded, and pretty reliable in the way they manoeuvre, if a bit lifeless, though there’s still a nagging sense of worry and uncertainty if you go for Expert settings and turn off anti-skid. </p>
<p>Where it comes unstuck is drifting. At no point does this become natural, easy, or enjoyable, and you’ll find you can launch it round curves like a terrible NASCAR driver without losing too much time. That’s all exacerbated by the lack of analogue triggers. We can lay some of that at Nintendo’s door, but when GRID Legends gives you right analogue stick throttle control, and supports the Gamecube controller’s analogue triggers, there’s little excuse for not having it in place. </p>
<p>It all doesn’t come together very well. Rubber banding in races sees you fly past the entire pack, only to have them inexplicably reappear in your mirrors and pass you at the last moment. There’s a Kudos-like scoring system for keeping it clean, and achieving various other feats of vehicular control, but it feels pretty perfunctory and uninvolved.</p>
<p>Gear.Club Unlimited 3 is at its best when it’s trying to emulate Tokyo Xtreme Racer. Battles and duels that take place on packed Japanese highways are the most fun events here, and nipping your way through traffic is a blast. Well, it’s a blast till you clip somebody and invariably end up facing the wrong way.</p>

<p>Upgrading your Club is a pleasant little diversion. You’ve got a massive garage to work with, filling it with technicians as well as designing areas to relax in, and stuffing them full of arcade machines. Upgrading your cars is tied to which workshops you’ve unlocked, and then adding engineers to unlock higher tiers within each one, and that’s interesting enough, giving you a reason to take part in an additional race or two, to fill things out.</p>
<p>The problem is that the engineers and upgrades dry up at points, with little to do but persevere with the ‘story’ mode, and just keep on racing across a map that you can barely tell has changed.</p>
<p>Gear.Club Unlimited 3 is a largely solo experience, with the main story mode taking you from a rookie to the leader of the Gear Club Japan arm of the racing company, while taking in time racing across the roads of France. It’s a shame that progress feels so slow, and the upgrade system so lacklustre, because there are elements of the game that work pretty well. There is a Free-Roam mode too, which I hoped might suddenly turn Unlimited 3 into an open-world racer. Unfortunately, it just lets you – or you and a friend – drive the tracks without any constraints, or you can do some two-player racing, which is a nice thing to have. Being able to explore the world might have been more impactful, if there were more sights to see, beyond the occasional train racing by.</p>

<p>The music is horrendously repetitive. I managed about an hour before I turned off in the races, and maybe a couple more before wanting to cull it in the menus too. Besides that, it hard crashed at points too, dumping you back to the Switch 2’s main menu. It’s just another thing to chip away at Gear.Club Unlimited 3’s potential.</p>

While this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-will-reportedly-be-multiplatform-on-launch-no-timed-playstation-exclusivity/">multiplatform pivot</a></strong> has been welcomed by Switch 2 and Xbox players, many have voiced concerns that the final part of the trilogy will have to make some compromises in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">visual quality</strong> due to the lower specifications of the Nintendo Switch and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox Series S</strong>, besides continuing to use <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4/"><strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong></a>.</p>



<p>However, this will not be the case, as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong> development team's approach takes platform differences into consideration while scaling down from the lead version of the game: the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC version</strong>.</p>



<p><em>"The quality of the trilogy will not be diminished, and that's not the kind of development structure we have in the first place,"</em> said <strong>Naoki Hamaguchi</strong> in a fresh interview with <strong><a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/interviewsjp/ff7f-20260216-421552/">Automaton</a></strong>. <em>"I think I have no choice but to keep saying this."</em></p>



<p>Realizing that the concerns may be justified, as he never went in-depth on why <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 won't be dragged down</strong> by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series S, Hamaguchi-san provided a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">thorough explanation</strong> on why this won't happen, breaking things down by component, starting with potential <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ROM limitations</strong> deriving from the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges</strong>. As the game will launch at retail on a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Game-Key Card</strong>, file size will not be an issue on the other platforms.</p>

<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RAM</strong> is among the biggest difference between modern consoles, but this too won't be a concern for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The Nintendo Switch 2 has plenty of RAM, so it shouldn't be affected. It's true that it will struggle with the Xbox Series S, but that's been addressed by fine-tuning each platform to the utmost. So, RAM issues won't restrict other platforms,"</em> Hamaguchi-san explained.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-npc-density-will-be-critical-for-cpu-optimization">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 NPC Density Will Be Critical For CPU Optimization</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-part-3-NPCs-Density.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3's world may feel a little less lively on lower-end platforms</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The differences in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CPU</strong> between the systems are unlikely to be a cause for concern. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The way we currently make games is that if a game runs at 30fps on PS4, Nintendo Switch 2, or Xbox Series S, then it should be able to run at 60fps on a high-end platform. In other words, we don't design games with the assumption that it will run at 30fps on a high-end CPU and use all of its available capacity,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said. </p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"For hardware with CPU power to spare, we use a method of scaling only the density of NPCs in towns, such as the number of NPCs. This means that towns may feel more lively on high-spec hardware, while the number of NPCs may be lower on other hardware."</em> As such, the director of Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 believes the team is unlikely to encounter <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CPU-related issues</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-gpu-optimization-and-asset-reduction-from-leading-pc-platform">GPU Optimization and Asset Reduction From Leading PC Platform</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-Part-3-PC-leading-platform.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Those with high-end PCs will be able to enjoy Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3 at their best, according to Hamaguchi-san.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The final concern fans have, and the one Hamaguchi-san recognizes is the biggest, is related to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">GPU</strong>. Even in this case, however, the Final Fantasy VII Remake series director believes there won't be issues, thanks to <span>the team's development approach, which&nbsp;<strong>scales down from the leading PC version</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>focuses on&nbsp;</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">optimization</strong>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The FFVII Remake series has been purchased by a huge number of customers on Steam and the Epic Games Store, so we are also conscious of creating assets for the wider PC market during development. That's why we create 3D asset data with the highest asset quality based on PC,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said. </p>



<p><em>"As a basic data design, we don't conform to low standards, but create assets for even higher-end use. We call this reduction, and the design involves adjusting and tuning the asset level to suit each platform. In that sense, it's a design philosophy that basically doesn't affect high-spec platforms. This isn't just something we do, but is a relatively common way of thinking in game development environments these days."</em> As such, those with high-end platforms will be able to enjoy the game at its best, while console players will still have a <strong>great experience tailored to their hardware</strong> of choice.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-is-now-playable">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 Is "Now Playable"</h2>



<p>After the end of this exhausting explanation, Naoki Hamaguchi provided a small <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">update on the yet-to-be-revealed Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Development is proceeding almost exactly on time, according to the schedule and milestones set at the beginning of development, and the game is now playable.

              <p>Given the current extended wave of Pokémon card lunacy began with Logan Paul in 2020, perhaps this weekend’s sale of the YouTuber’s Illustrator Pikachu card for a completely deranged <strong>$16.49 million</strong> could be the end of it? Bookend this nonsense with the same awful man.</p> <p>Logan Paul’s Illustrator Pikachu is without doubt one of the rarest Pokémon cards in existence. The special card, created in 1997 as part of an illustration contest in Japan, has a unique image of Pikachu with a paintbrush and saw only 41 printed. Of those, only one has ever been graded by PSA (a company that grades all sorts of memorabilia by incredible high standards) to be a 10—a card in perfect condition—and this is the one Paul bought as a stunt in 2022. He paid, in total, $5.275 million, of which $4m was in cash, and the rest in the form of a PSA 9 version of the same card. He then, infamously, <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633">wore the card around his neck for his appearance at Wrestlemania</a> in 2022.</p>

 <p>This was not the first time Logan Paul had pulled this stunt. In 2020, as the world collectively lost its mind during covid, Paul began spending millions on Pokémon packs for attention-seeking streams. At one point he bought a Gem Mint 10 1999 first edition holo Charizard (one of the most sought-after cards) for $150,000, then wore it around his neck to one of his pretend boxing matches against Floyd Mayweather, <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-paul-wore-a-pokemon-card-to-mayweather-fight-say-1847044171">claiming at the time that this act had caused it to become worth a million dollars</a>. Thankfully that wasn’t true, and despite the massive hike in prices across the rest of the hobby, you can still pick up the same card in the same quality <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-4-charizard-psa-gem-mtvzj4m">for not much more</a>.</p> <h2>Illustrator Pikachu’s peculiar path</h2> <p>Since 2022, the fate of the Illustrator Pikachu has been bizarrely mixed. In 2022 an Las Vegas Raiders linebacker sold a CGC (rival grading company to PSA) 9.5 for $672,000 <a href="https://kotaku.com/rare-pokemon-card-illustrator-blake-martinez-nfl-retire-1849803410">and celebrated by resigning from the NFL</a>. He’s likely kicking himself still, given in the same year <a href="https://kotaku.com/illustrator-pikachu-pokemon-card-most-valuable-record-s-1848598145">someone bought a poorer quality PSA 7 version for $900,000</a>, which at the time made it the most expensive Pokémon card sale ever, before Logan Paul got one later that year. However, a year later in 2023 a PSA 8 went up for auction at $480,000 and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-illustrator-pikachu-charizard-ebay-auction-1850200024">didn’t receive a single bid</a>. Then last year, all sense was lost as <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-psa9-auction-2000625686">a PSA 9 Illustrator Pikachu sold for a ludicrous $4,000,000</a>. Why was this card suddenly worth nearly four times more than Paul had sold his for three years earlier? Or six times more than the CGC 9.5? Because these small pieces of floppy cardboard are only ever worth what someone is willing to pay for them.</p>

 <p>But forget all of that now, because <a href="https://www.polygon.com/logan-paul-pikachu-illustrator-pokemon-card-auction-final-sale-price/">as&nbsp;<em>Polygon</em> reported this weekend</a>, Logan Paul just sold his one-of-a-kind PSA 10 Pikachu for $16,492,000.</p> <p><a href="https://goldin.co/buy/?Auctions=202512-1918-3018-925819e2-7bfc-4e60-a624-05d1e2f2d4a3&amp;page=1&amp;sort=Featured&amp;number_of_lots=24">Auctioned by Goldin</a>, alongside Paul’s PSA 10 1999 Charizard, a matching Blastoise, and a factory sealed box of Base Set 1st Edition cards, and a whole bunch of others, they all sold for wildly inflated prices. The headline is obviously <a href="https://goldin.co/item/logan-paul-personally-owned-1998-pokemon-japanese-corocoro-promo-raretua0w?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjAsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">the Pikapainter which went for that $16.5 million</a>, but everything else is equally ridiculous. The Charizard, as described above usually worth $150,000, <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-logan-paul-break-4-chajdvc5?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjEsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">went for $954,800</a>; the Blastoise sold <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-logan-paul-break-2-blaejo67?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjIsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">for $138,880</a> despite another identical card <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/397613597277">selling for $2000 on eBay yesterday</a>; the matching Venusaur <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-logan-paul-break-15-vegq3n7?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjMsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">fetched $75,640</a>; and that box of Base Set went for nearly half a million, <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-factory-sealed-booster-box-36-packsmrlo2?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjQsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">$496,000</a>. So why did the Base Set starters fetch so much higher? Because for some reason PSA agreed to mark the labels on these gradings with “1ST ED—LOGAN PAUL BREAK,” thus in the eyes of collectors making them unique. As for the Pikachu, there’s no rational explanation.</p>

 <p>Obviously this $16.5 million sale smashes all previous records to pieces, and surely—<em>surely—</em>will never be beaten. There has to come a point where humanity recognizes that shiny cardboard is of limited value. At approximately 1.85 grams, this card is worth 55,370 times the price of gold. Which is silly. It’s all incredibly silly.</p>

<p>The ongoing shortage of memory chips has reportedly led Sony to consider delaying the PS6’s release to 2028 or 2029.</p>



<p>The shortage of memory chips is impacting the gaming industry significantly. We have already seen GPU manufacturers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-reportedly-raising-graphics-card-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raise prices</a> or even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-reportedly-no-longer-in-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discontinue</a> certain products. <span>It seems <span>the impact will reach next-gen consoles as well, as first reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ram-prices-next-gen/" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a>&nbsp;and now corroborated by Bloomberg: RAM price increases will delay the next-gen console of PlayStation</span>.</span></p>







<h2 id="h-ps6-could-be-pushed-to-2029-and-switch-2-price-increase-being-contemplated">PS6 Could be Pushed to 2029 and Switch 2 Price Increase Being Contemplated</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> states that “people familiar with the company’s thinking” have revealed that Sony Group has thought of “pushing back the debut of its next PlayStation console to 2028 or even 2029.” That’s not all; people familiar with Nintendo’s plans have also stated that the company “is also contemplating raising the price” of the Switch 2 in 2026. However, neither Sony nor Nintendo has officially commented on these plans. </p>



<p>When <span>discussing the impact of memory prices on current-gen consoles, Nintendo has already stated that it will “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-will-carefully-evaluate-switch-2-price-increase-as-memory-costs-rise/" target="_blank">carefully” evaluate</a>&nbsp;Switch 2’s price amid&nbsp;</span>rising memory costs. Sony, on the other hand, has stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5s-holiday-stock-wont-be-impacted-by-ram-shortages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 stocks won’t be affected</a> by memory shortages until the end of the holiday 2026 season. At the same time, PS6 and PlayStation handheld are claimed to have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-specs-playstation-handheld-impressive-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impressive memory specs</a>, so Sony seems to be in a pickle for their next-gen console. </p>

<p>There was never any doubt that the <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> would bring some heat in the merch department on the run-up to launch. Nintendo may have its Talking Flower primed and ready to go as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Mario Wonder Switch 2</a> tie-in (brand synergy, and all that), but we dare you to take one look at the 'Nintendo The Super Mario Galaxy Movie: Hatchin' Yoshi Interactive Toy' (catchy, right?) and <em>not</em> tell us that it's adorable.</p>
<p>The name is pretty self-explanatory on this one. Hatchin' Yoshi is an interactive toy that sees our beloved dino 'hatch' from his eggshell casing and then respond to touch and voice commands. He can rock back and forth, shake his little head, say his name — come on, what else do you expect from the little fella?</p>
<p>All of this cuteness doesn't come cheap, mind you. The Yoshi toy is now available to pre-order from <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smythstoys.com%2Fuk%2Fen-gb%2Ftoys%2Ffashion-and-dolls%2Finteractive-pets%2Fnintendo-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-hatchin-yoshi-interactive-toy-egg%2Fp%2F254238&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Smyths Toys</a> here in the UK for <strong>£59.99</strong>, with <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/205546/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FYSH-INA-Interactive-Hatching%2F17692502283" rel="sponsored noopener">Walmart</a>'s <strong>$49.88</strong> pre-orders opening in North America soon. According to the Smyths listing, the toy is expected to launch in early April, which perfectly lines up with the Galaxy Movie's new release date.</p>

<p>This is the latest 'hatching' toy from Spin Master, the company behind the similar '<a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smythstoys.com%2Fuk%2Fen-gb%2Ftoys%2Ffashion-and-dolls%2Fhatchimals%2Fc%2FSM06010426&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Hatchimals</a>' and '<a href="https://www.spinmaster.com/en-US/brands/primal-hatch/">Primal Hatch</a>' ranges. Hey, the kids are clearly all about eggs these days.</p>
<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will arrive in cinemas on 1st April. Nintendo came in hot with some fresh posters last week, and short TV spots and official trailers continue to show us more of what's in store. Let's hope Nintendo and Illumination still have a few surprises up their sleeve in time for the premiere.</p>

            <p>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has become the latest game to have its initially listed recommended RAM requirement yanked down by a substantial amount, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-gets-updated-system-requirements-with-iois-apologies">following in the footsteps</a> of fellow 2026 release 007: First Light.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Developers TT Games announced in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215200/view/509605417596223740">Steam post</a> that the recommended RAM number for da bat's latest adventure now sits at 16GB rather than the initially announced 32GB.</p>
<p>"Please note, our PC specs at this stage are not final," the studio added, citing this revision as being the product of some ongoing testing. "We will be continuing to optimize and make improvements as we move closer to launch." The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215200/LEGO_Batman_Legacy_of_the_Dark_Knight/">rest of the specs</a>, including an Intel Core i7-12700K or AMD Ryzen 7 7700X CPU and GeForce RTX 3080 with 10GB or Radeon RX 6800 XT with 16GB, remain as they were for now, An SSD is also still listed as a hard requirement in both the recommended and minimum specs.</p>
<p>The RAM revision comes amid what our hardware and occasional kitchenware guru James has dubbed RAMnarok. Basically, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">RAM prices have gone through the roof</a> thanks to vast swaths of it being hoovered up for AI-related uses. So, those selling RAM for use in consumer PCs have had to jack up their prices to offset the beefier sums they're having to fork over to fill up their parts conveyor belts during this RAM shortage or simply to take advantage of the scarcity meaning you'll struggle to get ahold of some at a cheaper price elsewhere.</p><p>It's bad, especially when the knock-on effects for hardware like the recently delayed Steam Machine are taken into account. Hence games like Legacy of the Dark Knight dropping their RAM requirements where testing reveals they can, making them a more attractive proposition to folks who don't want to face the potential of paying through the nose for an upgrade to their existing rigs just to play. If RAM prices weren't soaring, such tweaks wouldn't be as big a deal, but they are, so here we are.</p>

            <p>Happy this week, all! It’s time once again to load the Maw up with new PC games, that we may stave off the apocalypse till next Monday. This week covers a wide spectrum of flavours and textures: papery, Dodo-ish, ducklike, inky, formaldehyde-y, pasty, furry, feculent, and fishy. Once you’re done throwing up, get back here and run your protesting eyes over the full list. As ever, we welcome your urgent suggestions.</p>
<h2>Monday 16th February</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2720940/Book_Smugglers/">Book Smugglers</a> is a point and click adventure about circulating forbidden texts in 19th century Tsarist Lithuania.  </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3362750/Stormbridge/">Stormbridge</a> is a strictly horizontal blend of tower defence and city builder in which you stretch out a settlement rightwards, while raising defences against an encroaching tempest on the left.</li>
<li>For people who want more randomisation and playdough faces in their Ogre Battling, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622820/Dobbel_Dungeon/">Dobbel Dungeon</a> is a turn-based tactics affair in which characters roll dice each turn to determine the moves they can perform.</li>
<li>Out this day in early access, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2720920/ASTROBOTANICA/">Astrobotanica</a> is a somewhat Crash Bandicoot-esque puzzle ‘n’ survival game in which you are an extra-terrestrial botanist making sense of prehistoric Earth, feat. Neanderthals and Dodos.</li>
<li>Let’s savagely rebut the chonky ‘take me to your chief mammoth hunter’ bonhomie of that last entry with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3885910/Alien_Morgue/">Alien Morgue</a>, in which you do autopsies on little green men. (You don’t appear to be playing a Neanderthal or a Dodo.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 17th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Time to once again dust off those parched and abraded Zelda memories with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1583520/Under_The_Island/">Under The Island</a>, a top-down island dungeon puzzler featuring six biomes replete with grass you can slash to reveal health hearts.</li>
<li>Friendslop’s bottomless chum bucket has claimed Cthulhu in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3140720/Ritual_Party/">Ritual Party</a>, which is about four buds (or <em>are</em> you?) trying to perform a hellish ritual. Please, somebody help me think of a non-pejorative word for “friendslop” that rolls off the tongue as easily. The best I have are “Overcookie” and “Lethalcomp”.</li>
<li>No time for friendslop, actually, for today marks the dawning of duck-builders. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510020/Placid_Plastic_Deck__A_Quiet_Quest/">Placid Plastic Deck: A Quiet Quest</a> (pictured) is a deeply suspicious card-battler.</li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3514630/Roach_Post/">Roach Post</a> is a cheery roguelite puzzler in which you stick together postage stamps with the help of an army of cockroaches.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2059570/Forgotlings/">Forgotlings</a> is a posh-looking, VA-heavy action adventure set in a world of discarded sentient objects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 18th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nice cavernous origami world you’ve got there, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4240550/Blank/">Blank</a>. Shame if somebody were to platform all over it.</li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2781470/The_Killing_Stone/">The Killing Stone</a> is an Inscryptic confection from the makers of The Blackout Club. You are in the Arctic, playing a cursed boardgame to save the souls of a noble family from the Devil.</li>
<li>The criminal absence of licensed music notwithstanding, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a> looks to be a pleasant “what if”-driven strategy management port of TV’s definitive trip to the Delta Quadrant. Off to the Transporter room with you, Neelix - you’re doing a one-man-raid on the Borg Cube.</li>
<li>People who pre-fur the Star Foxy breed of space sim might want to throw their pennies at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2674650/FUR_Squadron_Phoenix/"> FUR Squadron Phoenix</a>. Neelix’s tufty mug wouldn’t look out of place here, now that I think of it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 19th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today brings quite the haul. Let’s barge through them at pace. Firstly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701440/PARANORMASIGHT_The_Mermaids_Curse/">PARANORMASIGHT: The Mermaid's Curse</a> is a sun-baked mystery horror novel in which an ensemble cast wrangle with some ghastly fishwomen.</li>
<li>The N64-to-Gamecube era lives on in “expressive” platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585890/Demon_Tides/">Demon Tides</a>, which casts you as a transforming devil princess.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">Styx: Blades Of Greed</a> is your latest helping of putrid and snarky open world goblin stealth.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010610/LOVE_ETERNAL/">Love Eternal</a> is an introspective horror platformer we might blithely summarise as Playdead X Celeste. </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878580/Key_Fairy/">Key Fairy</a> is a “hand-drawn, pacifist, folkloric, bullet-hell” game in which you grapple past monsters, salvaging their shattered stars, and solve riddles in a forest of scratchy blood and ink.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4341390/Nightsoil/">Nightsoil</a> is possibly the first turd collection game I’ve covered, and certainly the first emotive turd collection game I’ve covered.</li>
<li>Get the sense that all is not well on this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3622230/MOONROT/">particular gas giant moon</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 20th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Just a couple more before we go gently into that good Friday night. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3949290/Ys_X_Proud_Nordics/">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> is an updated version of a 2023 entrant in the sprawling Ys series, best known (to me, anyway) for popularising the concept of bumpslash combat.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3525970/Horripilant/">Horripilant</a> is an incremental dungeon clicker about an old knight in a world of Junji Ito-esque filthbastards.</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s going on in the Treehouse this week? James is biffing several larger hardware stories, and threatening to educate the rest of us about teraflops. Mark wants to walk the desert – hurting, longing, dancing to disco music. Julian may have an awkward tale to tell about a PC game he shouldn’t admit to have played. I am thinking about open worlds and city builders, because I am nothing if not shackled to genre. Callum is biding his time before the Requiem, and Ollie is eyeing the months ahead through a telescope (and also, possibly playing more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>). Jeremy ain’t in yet. How about you?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Become is a Ballsy Indie Game That Has You Play as Sperm]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/become-game-ballsy-indie-sperm/</link>
            <guid>1437082</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>That’s right, the game you always wanted but never knew it is about to be made by two people. It’s called Become, and it tells the tale of a single sperm (called a spermatazoon) seeking to make his mark and fertilize an egg, accomplishing what he was put on this Earth (or in a pair of balls) to do.</p>



<p>It’s a third-person adventure-survival game that has been created by two developers, and it’s set to launch on Steam later this year. Needless to say, it’s <strong>ballsy</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-become-one-of-millions">Become One of Millions</h2>



<p>Become is a unique game that takes players and throws them into the role of a spermatazoon, hellbent on beating hundreds of millions of competitors to achieve the ultimate goal, kick-starting a new life. It has a few customization elements, a two-to-three-hour story, and impressive visuals, considering the whole game takes place inside… Well, you know.</p>



<p>Per the game’s blurb on Steam:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Experience life’s fantastical journey as one of millions of sperm. Survive the microcosm dangers, wiggle, dash and compete through the human reproductive system and create new life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Become, players must navigate treacherous terrain, swimming through currents and upgrading themselves through the collection of sugars and proteins, all with the goal of being the hardiest and most efficient little swimmer.</p>



<p>It’s educational, too. The duo of developers has stressed that Become allows players to ‘learn about the reproductive microcosm’. However, it’s done in a way that isn’t as crude as you might think, as the disclaimer mentions nothing more than ‘humorous references to sperm and conception.’</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for Become:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Become - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hb4Pjyfs6IQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In a world of gargantuan AAA (and AAAA) games, Become might just be about to prove that size doesn’t matter, and you can still get a nice amount of bang for your buck by shooting out and giving this game a go. Who knows? The price for Become hasn’t been revealed just yet, but it shouldn’t be too much, all things considered.</p>







<p>How much would you pay to give the gift of digital, animated life? Let us know if you’re interested in Become on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony is ‘Considering Pushing Back’ the Debut of the PlayStation 6 to 2028 or Even 2029; Nintendo Switch 2 Price Could Increase in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-delay-2028-2029-nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-2026/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you have been following tech news <span>over the past few months, you are well aware of how the&nbsp;<strong>widespread adoption of AI</strong>&nbsp;is causing many</span> issues for consumers, with <strong>prices of components</strong> such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ram-prices-are-flattening-out-over-the-past-few-days-but-dont-be-fooled/"><strong>RAM</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sandisk-wd-black-sn7100-sn8100-1-tb-ssds-have-risen-to-246-366/">SSDs</a></strong> <strong>skyrocketing</strong> in a matter of days. </p>



<p>These price increases and the limited availability of components for anything that is not supposed to be used in an AI data center is making things difficult even for console manufacturers, so much so that <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Sony is reportedly actively considering a delay of its PlayStation 6 system.</strong></p>



<p>In a new report posted today on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a></strong>, according to people "<em>familiar</em>" with the company's thinking, <em>"Sony Group Corp. is now considering pushing back the debut of its next PlayStation console to 2028 or even 2029."</em></p>



<p> While this isn't the first time we have heard of a possible <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-likely-to-be-delayed-longer-than-many-expected-leaving-prices-the-only-things-that-will-keep-evolving-and-not-for-the-better/">delay for the PlayStation 6</a></strong> beyond the expected 2027 release window, the number of reports in the past few weeks suggests <strong>this is no longer a last-case scenario but a concrete possibility.</strong></p>



<p>Things are not any easier for the manufacturers who managed to release their hardware before this <strong>chip crisis</strong> showed its ugly head. According to people familiar with the company's plan who spoke with Bloomberg, Nintendo is also <strong>contemplating raising the price of the Nintendo Switch 2</strong> in 2026. </p>



<p>Again, this isn't very surprising. Back in November, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa revealed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-remain-stable/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 price</strong></a> was expected to remain stable in the immediate future unless "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">significant changes in external factors, such as a shift in tariff assumptions, or other unexpected event</em>." Still, this is an unfortunate turn of events that will eventually <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">price many gamers out of current-generation systems.</strong></p>



<p>The PlayStation 6 may not be the only next-generation console to see a consistent delay over its expected release window. The <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/amds-semi-custom-soc-thatll-power-the-next-gen-xbox-is-progressing-well-to-support-a-launch-in-2027-says-amd-ceo/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">next-generation Xbox may launch in 2027</strong></a>, but that is reportedly a <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-gen-might-launch-2027-but-its-best-case-scenario/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">best-case scenario</strong></a>, and with the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-cost-double-playstation-6/">Magnus APU being more expensive</a></strong> than the chip powering Sony's systems, the system would be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">commercially</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">doomed</strong> if it launched at a very high price that would be in complete contrast to the concept of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">affordability</strong> that makes <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">consoles enticing to consumers.</strong></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> is one of those multiplayer games that continue to thrive without making much noise outside their core communities. In fact, last year brought a number of substantial changes to the game through the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rainbow-six-siege-x-update-detailed-as-game-goes-free-to-play">Rainbow Six Siege X update</a>. Shame about those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rainbow-six-siege-still-struggling-after-ubisoft-was-forced-to-briefly-intentionally-shut-it-down-following-third-party-hack">massive attacks from hackers</a> though.</p>
<p>In any case, a new year brings new opportunities, and this next content drop had probably been brewing for a long while. The rumours were true: Solid Snake as seen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> is coming to the game on 3rd March. Yep, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-finally-frees-mgs4-from-the-ps3-with-august-release-date-sony-state-of-play">Konami has gone beast mode</a> and is even doing a huge collaboration now with a publisher that was a major competitor years ago.</p> <figure>

Time-travel back to the mid-2000s with this trailer and you'd blow the gaming industry's collective mind. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>-ification of every franchise big enough is real, but if that's the future of entertainment, we might as well enjoy team-ups that always were destined to happen.</p>
<p>Fisher joined Rainbow Six Siege a few years back, when it was starting to embrace the potential of crossovers with other IPs. Of course, it's far more shocking when those big collabs happen with different publishers, and even more special when we're talking about stealth game legends. And if you were thinking Solid Snake is just a skin or a lazy operator design, you'd be wrong:</p><figure>

<p>As thoroughly described by <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/7wYca8Fw674NP93tZe9uDe/solid-snake-joins-rainbow-six-siege-in-operation-silent-hunt">the blog post on Operation Silent Hunt</a>, "Solid Snake excels at tracking down Defender positions and scavenging supplies on the battlefield to adapt to any situation" thanks to the familiar Soliton Radar MKIII gadget and an "On-Site Procurement ability." The battle pass for this season instantly unlocks Snake and includes cosmetics for other operators, like the Psycho Mantis outfit for Smoke. Later, a mystery new mode will be added alongside more MGS outfits and the long-awaited team-up with Sam Fisher, which is a limited-time mode of sorts.</p>
<p>Beyond the fan excitement surrounding Snake's arrival to R6 Siege, it's safe to say this new addition to the roster will shake the meta up in big ways, as the stealth legend is a master of controlling movement in the battlefield and can carry more secondary gadgets. Can he be a lore-friendly <em>and</em> balanced operator? Let's hope so.</p>

			<p>The core concept of Aerial Knight’s Dropshot is utterly bonkers. You and your opponents leap from a plane, circling hundreds of miles above the ground. None of you have parachutes though, and instead you willingly freefall to your doom. As you plummet, you must shoot your fellow plummeters with your magic finger gun – yes, really. Your objective is to kill them all before you hit the ground. Oh, and your player character is called Smoke Wallace. He has purple skin and magical powers because he was bitten by the same radioactive dragon that ate all of his family. You see? Bonkers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Aerial_Knight's DropShot - Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/akOVT_R3QXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bright and garish, the visuals are all acid-soaked kaleidoscopic weirdness. It’s not my kind of thing, but this game certainly has a striking and attention-grabbing look. Gameplay is structured around small levels that last for sixty seconds, Dropshot is gaming for the TikTok generation. Each level is intended as a dopamine hit but to be quickly forgotten. As you fall from a first-person perspective, you’ll need to dodge floating islands, laser traps and your opponents’ return fire to stay alive, and with only two lives, this can be challenging. Kill efficiently and stylishly and you’ll rack up points and a high grade, the idea being to return to each level numerous times to hit a high score and achieve a perfect run. The problem is, that despite the bonkers premise and over the top visuals, the gameplay itself is rather pedestrian, leaving me with little interest in returning to a level once it was done.</p>



<p>The biggest issue is speed; there’s little sense of any. As you hurtle through the sky, it should be an adrenaline rush, like knee-sliding in Platinum Games’ Vanquish, or hurtling round a tight corner far too fast in F-Zero. Instead, it’s more akin to strolling to the shops to buy some bread. This is an oddly muted experience, rather than dodging floating islands and traps by the skin of your teeth, you seem to have a veritable age to gently steer yourself out of the way.</p>

<p>Achieving a high score amounts to little more than the eye-straining task of having to spot your tiny freefalling opponents in the distance, slowly line up a shot, and take them out. You’ll likely fail to spot them all on the first attempt, forcing you to attempt the level numerous times to catch them. Often your foes will kill you first, but you’ll have little idea that a bullet is coming. One moment you’re alive, the next you’re dead, with little to no visual clues that an attack is incoming. Worse, the collision detection isn’t great – possibly due to the challenges of basing the game around a first-person view – meaning sometimes you die, sometimes you survive, and you’re really not sure why.</p>
<p>There are two other game modes. The first is a boss battle that sees you fighting an enormous dragon, a nasty fella who can absorb a whole lot of damage, forcing you to conserve your ammo and keep a look out for ammunition drops to fall through. This is certainly more enjoyable than the main game. Primarily because it resolves the issue of the irritating unseen enemy attacks, as the dragon blasts you with big obvious fireballs that must be quickly shot from the sky, bringing some old-school light gun game shenanigans to proceedings.</p>

<p>The final mode is a straight up race between you and your rival to catch a golden egg before you hit the ground. This does, finally, get the pulse racing, as due to numerous speed boosters things end up fast and frantic. Darting through arrays of laser beams, narrowly avoiding chunks of rock, finally I can see what the development team were going for. If these thrills and spills could be replicated throughout the rest of the game, then Aerial Knight’s Dropshot would be an absolute indie banger. As it is, there’s just too many of the boring levels getting in the way of the good stuff.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Just like with its bizarre setting and over-the-top visuals, the overall experience of Aerial Knight’s Dropshot is uneven. There’s complete brilliance in places, such as the thrilling races, but they come alongside some rather uninspired and borderline frustrating combat. If I could just have a game full of the rival chases, and get rid of the fighting, this would be terrific. As it is, it’s alright.	</p></div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/layers-of-fear-3-announced-franchise-10th-anniversary/</link>
            <guid>1437043</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This weekend, Polish developer <strong>Bloober Team</strong> unveiled <strong>Layers of Fear 3</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pASWkDkyaY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a special event celebrating the horror franchise's 10th anniversary</a>. Bloober Team founder and CEO <strong>Piotr Babieno</strong> appeared to discuss <strong>the great importance of Layers of Fear for the studio</strong>:</p>



<p><em>For Bloober Team, Layers of Fear isn't just a title from our past. It marked the moment when we understood what kind of studio we want to be, what type of games we want to create. Tonight, we want to honor that legacy and show you that Layers of Fear is still alive, still evolving, and still finding new ways to haunt.</em></p>



<p>Then, Creative Director and Lead Designer <strong>Mateusz Lenart</strong> spoke about the philosophy behind these horror games:</p>



<p><em>Layers of Fear was imagined as a tribute to artists and a thin line between inspiration and obsession. Creativity can be both beautiful and destructive while shaped by ambition and the fear of failure. Our goal was to show that by placing the player inside of an artist's unraveling mind, we invite empathy rather than judgment, changing horror into a deeply human experience.</em></p>



<p><em>When we started making the game in 2015, we were a team of around 20 people. It was a very personal project for us, and everyone put their own inspirations and experiences into the game's art style and narrative themes. We are extremely grateful that the game resonated with so many people throughout the years. Layers of Fear is the game for the artist within you. And as every artistic journey, the deeper you go into it, the more you discover about yourself. </em></p>



<p>Babieno then announced that the original soundtrack <strong>will be made available on both CD and vinyl</strong>. Moreover, they unveiled a partnership with <strong>Foksal Publishing Group</strong> to create <strong>novels</strong> based on the Layers of Fear franchise, starting with one written by <strong>Marta Bijan</strong> and scheduled for release in <strong>late 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>However, for gamers, the juiciest announcement came right at the end of the livestream: a teaser for Layers of Fear 3.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's clearly early days still. The studio recently released <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: New Dawn</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is remaking Silent Hill 1</a></strong>, after <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doing a great job with Silent Hill 2</a></strong>.</p>

            <p>There's nothing more spooky than having to neatly get your message across in a limited number of words which may or may not have to rhyme or stick to iambic pentameter.

<p>The folks behind 2024's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-2-review">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> used this reveal to close out a Valentines' weekend showcase commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Layers of Fear series, which kicked off with 2016's Layers of Fear. In this cinematic teaser for the next entry, a creepy bloke creepily read through Blake's The Sick Rose while sitting in a creepy chair surrounded by creepy portraits, one of which was of a strange hairless creature with no nose and two pointed fangs. The poem goes <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43682/the-sick-rose">as follows</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>O Rose thou art sick.</p>
<p>The invisible worm,</p>
<p>That flies in the night</p>
<p>In the howling storm:</p>
<p>Has found out thy bed</p>
<p>Of crimson joy:</p>
<p>And his dark secret love</p>
<p>Does thy life destroy</p></blockquote>
<p>Midway through the creepy bloke's reading, one of the paintings falls off the wall. Rather than blaming shoddy sticking apparatus, the man instead said: "Don't you worry about my little friend there, he tries to help. But the poor thing hasn't quite got the hang of the afterlife yet."</p><p>The teaser ended with the creepy bloke getting creepily serious for a second and turning over an hourglass. Sadly, there was no indication of when Layers of Fear 3 might arrive, so it remains to the release dateless void for now.</p>
<p>"Layers of Fear is an effective scare 'em up but the sense of dislocation and the lack of character development left me feeling as if I'd enjoyed a thematically messy series of shocks rather than a cohesive horror story," Adam Smith (RPS in peace) wrote in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layers-of-fear-review">his review</a> of the first game in the series. "It's a collection of scary things that are tangentially related to the idea of creative blocks and familial cruelty rather than an exploration of the artist or his personality flaws. By the time the credits rolled, I knew very little about this particular painter that I couldn't have learned by reading a brief synopsis."</p>
<p>Here's hoping Layers of Fear 3's spooks delve a bit deeper and deliver an undeniably through scarening.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Someone Just Completed Tarkov With the Worst Weapon Possible]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/someone-completed-tarkov-worst-weapon/</link>
            <guid>1437034</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Since November came around and Escape from Tarkov hit 1.0, hundreds of people have shared their accomplishments on social media regarding the game’s completion. With the introduction of 1.0, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlestate-games/" id="1450">Battlestate Games</a> added a campaign to Escape from Tarkov, which means the game can literally roll credits and give players one of four endings.</p>



<p>Recently, one user shared an intense revelation. They’ve managed to get <strong>the best ending </strong>in Escape from Tarkov while using what might be the game’s <strong>worst weapon</strong>, as long as you don’t count the Blicky as a true contender.</p>







<h2 id="h-terminal-toz-style">Terminal, TOZ-Style</h2>



<p>Hours ago, a YouTuber by the name of ‘Freakatoid’ shared the news that they’d completed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a> with the ‘Humanity’ ending <strong>while using a TOZ bolt-action shotgun</strong>. That’s right, the memeable weapon that’s typically wielded exclusively by the most bargain-basement, bottom-of-the-barrel scavs.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It took Freaktoid more than five weeks of consecutive attempts (51 in total) to punch through Terminal while using the TOZ-106. Midway through the attempt spree, Freakatoid shared screenshots of their progress, including an insane image of a <strong>PvE run </strong>on Woods with the TOZ-106 that included the taking down of at least two PMCs, Partizan, Shturman, and his guards.</p>



<p>Okay, so it was in PvE, but it was with a gun that’s widely considered the worst weapon in Escape from Tarkov, which makes it commendable.</p>



<p>For reference, here’s the gun:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>However, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/" id="161469">completion of Escape from Tarkov</a> <strong>with </strong>the TOZ, a 20-gauge shotgun that at the most can be fitted with five-shot magazines and a range of 20/70 shells, was done on PvP. As you might know, Terminal is <strong>exclusively </strong>PvE right now, so it might render that concept moot, but nobody else is out here completing the game like this.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape From Tarkov: Toz Terminal Completion (Unedited)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q3ZgGQyl764?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>To get it done, Freakatoid used a dual-TOZ loadout, one loaded with a Vortex Razor scope and slugs for picking off enemies at range, while the other was stock with five-shot magazines and heavy buck shells for close-range encounters. He went in loaded for bear with a Ronin respirator mask and a 6B45 vest with tier-five plates, and a rig filled to the brim with heals and magazines.</p>



<p>In the comments under their post, Freakatoid was challenged to complete the game with a PM pistol, a small Marakov handgun that might work a little better as it can be fitted with an 84-round magazine.</p>



<p>Maybe that’s his next challenge; he certainly seems open to it.</p>







<p>Is this the most impressive Escape from Tarkov completion you’ve seen? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>So, we know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-hour-with-pokopia-suggests-itll-might-be-the-best-pokemon-spin-off-ever-and-its-more-viva-pinata-than-minecraft-or-animal-crossing">looking impressive</a> so far, and we've also been told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-director">it's a pretty long game</a> even if you aren't planning on sticking around after the credits roll. With so much to do and a multiplayer option that's promising one of the most relaxing experiences of the year, how do its online functionalities work exactly?</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66124">Famitsu's big interview</a> with key Pokémon, Game Freak, and Koei Tecmo figures (hat tip to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kano01.bsky.social/post/3mexpgsz4t22m">Kano on Bluesky</a>), we've found out about another bit of info that should please everyone who was already looking forward to the game, especially those who spent way too much time playing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> with friends on private servers back in the day.</p>
<p>Before getting into how the multiplayer actually works in Pokopia, game director Takuto Edagawa revealed the project is Omega Force's largest to date: "I can't give you a specific number of people, but this is the largest number of people involved in any title developed by ω-Force (Omega Force)* to date." Moreover, creative work on the game wasn't one-sided with Game Freak and The Pokémon Company only approving submissions; new Pokémon designs were created and iterated on together all the way through.</p>
<p>About multiplayer, Edagawa says it indeed works as explained in the trailer released so far: You can either visit a host's main island or develop a "blank" one that's completely separate from the story mode progress. That second one allows players to "work together" in order to fully develop and reshape it into the peaceful village of their dreams.</p><p>The important bit here is that "even if the host (island owner) isn't playing, everyone can join in and play." The team is calling this system "Cloud Island" and it essentially works like you were thinking: Minecraft's private, persistent servers. This potentially means it's the sort of online feature that will one day go offline, but it opens up many possibilities and should make Pokémon Pokopia immensely more attractive for those of us whose schedules rarely line up. In fact, Edagawa basically states <em>that</em> was the driving force behind the functionality.</p>
<p>With only a little over two weeks to go, Pokopia is looking like one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>'s strongest exclusives yet, and I'm personally thinking it's going to be among 2026's biggest hits. Are you excited by the news on how multiplayer works or are you going full solo?</p>

            <p>If learning that the next entry into the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> series was going multiplatform had you worried about the graphical quality of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s upcoming narrative rollercoaster, a recent interview with director Naoki Hamaguchi should put those fears to rest.</p>
<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-will-not-compromise-on-graphics-whatsoever-despite-multiplatform-shift-director-naoki-hamaguchi-addresses-co/">Speaking to Automaton</a>, Hamaguchi reassured fans concerned about the graphical quality of FF7 Remake, when asked whether recent ports to the Xbox Series S or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> had any impact on development.</p>
<p>"Both the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox versions have been incredibly well received and generated a lot of buzz online," Hamaguchi said. "That attention has also made me realize how many people are worried about this issue. However, our decision to go multiplatform with the FF7 Remake series will not in any way lower the quality of the third installment. Our development structure simply doesn't work that way to begin with. ...I suppose I'll just have to keep saying it (laughs). "</p>
<p>Later in the interview Hamaguchi explained that due to the gradual explosion of PC popularity in Japan, and the faster rate of PC adoption in the West, the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series is being built with PCs in mind, reducing the quality of assets for medium-end platforms like the PS5 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, then lower still for other platforms.</p><p>"While PC gaming is gradually expanding in Japan, overseas growth has been even more rapid," Hamaguchi  explained. "The market has broadened tremendously across both consoles and PC. The FF7 Remake series has sold very well on platforms like Steam and the Epic Games Store, so we develop assets with the broad PC market in mind. In fact, our 3D assets are created at the highest quality level based on PC as the foundation.</p>
<p>"When FFVII Rebirth launched, there was talk about how the PC version looked better than the PS5 version, and our philosophy will not change for the third installment. As our fundamental principle, we do not design assets to meet the lowest baseline. Instead, we create them for high-end environments first. "</p>
<p>As of March last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-series-has-now-sold-over-200m-copies-worldwide">the Final Fantasy series had sold over 200m copies worldwide</a>, while the Final Fantasy 7 Remake sold 8.7m copies at the time. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">Its sequel, as well as Final Fantasy 16 did not meet expectations according to Square Enix</a>.</p>
