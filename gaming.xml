Darrington Press' deck-building game of subterfuge, combat, and royal politics' newest expansion, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-review-im-prettiest-princess" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Queen by Midnight</a>: Quarter Past</em>, will build upon the original with new features and gameplay twists, courtesy of the original design team.</p>
<h2>The <em>Queen by Midnight: Quarter Past</em> announcement</h2>
<p>According to an <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/announcing-queen-by-midnight-quarter-past/">official post</a> on Darrington Press' website, <em>Queen by Midnight: Quarter Past</em> is a standalone expansion to the original game. It is a deck-building battle royale game where three-to-six players take on the roles of Princesses following the passing of the Queen of Midnight.</p>

Players will scheme, plot, and fight to see who will wear the crown.</p>
<p>This new expansion includes new features for veteran players and newcomers. It includes four new playable Princesses, each with their unique playstyle, brand new Bazaar cards to mix up deck strategies and an easy-to-assemble Clock Board. Lastly, the expansion will include rules for 2-player mode.</p>
<p>Have these four Princesses face-off, or see how they fare against the six in the base game. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>Co-creator and designer (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-and-third-person-announce-moonward-experimental-storytelling-miniseries" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Critical Role</a> Producer) Kyle Shire and artists Ameera Sheikh Mike Pape have returned to work on <em>Queen by Midnight: Quarter Past</em>. The team is joined by designers Aaran Shaw and Alex Uboldi (<em>Gladius</em>), Zoe Rosenfeld, Darcy Ross, and Eric Engstrom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you pre-order a copy of the expansion at an official Darrington Press Guild store or Critical Role shop you will receive several foil promo Princess cards while supplies last. The game will also be available at local gaming stores and online retailers.</p>
<p><em>Queen by Midnight: Quarter Past</em> is available for pre-order now. It is being sold at an MSRP of $39.99 and will be available November 13.</p>

A significant part of the update aims to make it easier to kill one another in PvP, as well as general balance adjustments and changes to Armaments.</p><p>Going forward, poise damage will be increased for Light Great Swords, Backhand Blades, Hand-to-Hand Arts, and Beast Claws whenever someone plays PvP. The same applies to dual-wield attacks, which includes weapons like Straight Swords, Thursting Swords, and Curved Swords. In addition, whenever players use Miriam's Vanishing, they'll have a decreased invulnerability window against other players when they attack.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/30/deadlink-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Sometimes a game doesn’t need an engrossing story or compelling main characters. Sometimes, you just want to go from virtual arena to virtual arena and take out enemies with an assortment of weapons, tools and abilities. This is what Deadlink offers. It is a roguelike first-person shooter set in a cyberpunk world where corporations are more powerful than governments, and have the violent means to hold onto that power. You are a brain in a jar that can be transferred to different combat shells, using their skills in a VR setting to test their capabilities against those corpo assets.</p>
<p><iframe title="Deadlink - Console Launch Trailer (PS5/Xbox Series)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bZd4WHh0VAs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From the off, you can see Deadlink has a lot of depth to it. You’ll be repeating runs to earn experience and points, allowing you to unlock new skills and abilities while making progress across levels to unlock the other three ‘shells’ to shove your brain into. The default Soldier shell is not all it’s cracked up to be, and while it suits the first area it is the least fun to use. It comes equipped with a shotgun and rocket launcher, while the abilities include a rappel that can hook onto surfaces and enemies, and a Scrambler that marks and staggers foes. The Hunter shell is more entertaining to use, coming equipped with a Hand Cannon and Arc Cannon, as well as the translocator ability, which swaps your position with a normal enemy as well as marking and stunning them. The next shell is the Decoy which leaves behind a hologram that enemies target while you stay invisible for a bit, but it’s far from being the most fun to use.</p>


<p>That title goes to the Engineer, which comes equipped with a Gauss automatic rifle and a grenade launcher. The Engineer’s deeply enjoyable abilities include being able to deploy a turret, and use a wormlink that can link to enemies marking and incapacitating them. Finally, there’s the Juggernaut, armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a flak cannon, with a Graviton Punch ability which can destroy some enemies in one hit, and Stray Redirector which makes the shell invulnerable for a bit, but sacrifices movement speed. While I did experiment with all the shells, it was Engineer I kept going back to, though Hunter, Juggernaut, and Soldier all offered something different to enjoy.</p>


<p>The combat shells are just one small part of what Deadlink offers. Once you’ve selected your shell, you’ll eventually have three modes open up. The Campaign challenges you to move through four stages, each made up of rooms and with a boss waiting at the end. Time Attack offers courses that will test your reactions, and there’s the Extant Existence mode which is an unlimited wave mode, where you try to survive against enemies for as long as possible. Unlike many Roguelikes, the rooms themselves are set so you can learn enemy spawn patterns, but the challenge will always be different due to your implants. Implants and room transitions is where the Roguelike elements of Deadlink come in.</p>
<p>Deadlink’s implant system is the anchor of the Roguelike, making &nbsp;you consider their strategies on every run. As you progress through each arena you may get the chance to equip an implant, or make adjustments to weapons and the shell. These can be anything from adding fire or toxic damage to your gun, making your abilities more powerful, or improving the amount of health and shield you have. You won’t know what implant will be offered so you really are coming up with your approach on the fly. The implants themselves have different tiers, and need different amounts of power, which you can see in the equip screen. Legendary implants require the most power as they offer the best advantages, for example, providing a combat drone to assist.</p>
<p>The power management is easy to figure out, as rows on menu show how much battery power is needed for a slot to be used. Furthermore, implants are split into active and passive. Active implants demand action being taken by you, like activating an ability, or breaking the C-balls that are floating around the arena, while passive implants are always on in the background. There are dozens of implants to find and unlock, with more being made available as you level up. I have to say, my best run came from having a majority of passive implants, as then I could just focus more on running and gunning.</p>

<p>The levelling up system has its own depth with upgrades available for individual shells, as well as general upgrades that improve health, shields, unlock new tiers of weapon mods, upgrades, and more permanent buffs or abilities, such as the defibrillator which will revive you once on a run. Some upgrades require experience points to unlock, while others require Turing Tokens, with the better ones requiring both. Experience is earned through playing the levels, while Turing Tokens can be found as one of the offers at the end of an arena, or through defeating bosses.</p>
<p>All of these in-depth systems of implants and levelling feed into the main experience. Deadlink only has four overall stages, split into combat arenas, but with the challenge you will not get past the first two, Tora and Watts, without significant experience and upgrades. The action is very fast paced, and you are almost always moving to avoid incoming attacks while firing off your own, but it does start to feel a bit repetitive as you go through the same levels trying to move further. There are no surprises waiting for you in the initial runs most of the time, though occasionally you will need to survive for 45 seconds, which isn’t a huge challenge, or break corrupt C-Balls. To unlock the higher difficulties you also need to complete runs on the lower difficulty, which does give something to aim for but also risks you burning out.</p>

"Survive the heat of battle with lifesaving armour; and burn brightly across the cosmos with fresh emotes, capes, and skins."
</p>
<p>
If it's <em>specifics</em> you want though, Freedom's Flame includes the SG-451 Cookout as a new primary weapon capable of unleashing a "burst of incendiary phosphorus pellets" at enemies. It also features the FLAM-66 Torcher lightweight flamethrower as a second primary.

As for secondary weapons, there's the P-72 Crisper pocket flamethrower - essentially a handgun that can spew fire over short distances - and it's joined by the Fiery Drop – Firebomb Hellpods on the booster front. "Scorch the earth (and anything else) below," Arrowhead explains, "as you touch down with attitude and ignite the dropsite."
</p>
<p>
Freedom's Flame also brings two more armour sets - the blood-red I-09 Heatseeker and the silica fibre foam I-102 Draconaught - while the new Inflammable! armour passive grants 75 percent damage resistance to fire. Other new Warbond unlocks include the Fire Safety Officer title, and the Safety Orange skin for the Shuttle, Hellpod, and Exosuit.
</p>
<p>
Emote-wise, there's the Big Stretch, Deep Reflection, and Thoracic Collision Exultation Manoeuvre Co-emote, and cape fans get the Purifying Eclipse to swish about in. And finally, there's The Breach card, commemorating the final mission of the 361st Freedom's Flame, which saw the squad deployed into the heart of a Supervolcano - for freedom!
</p>
<p>
All the above is available to anyone that coughs up the Super Credits required to purchase the Freedom’s Flame Warbond when it releases on 6th August - which also happens to be the day Helldivers 2's hotly anticipated free <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-announced-with-higher-difficulty-new-bugs-and-more">Escalation of Freedom update</a> arrives.
</p>
<p>
Described as the game's "biggest update yet", it introduces the likes of new mission objectives and bigger enemy outposts, a new Combat Rating 10 difficulty, plus new enemies including the Impaler, Spore Charger, Terminid Alpha Commander, and Rocket Tank. Players can also expect a makeover for swamp worlds, and, finally, changes intended to deal with grief kicking. You can <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-drops-august-6/?sf274009068=1">read a bit more about all that on the PlayStation Blog</a>.

Players on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and macOS (we see you; you’re valid) all connect to the same servers, so your platform of choice won’t limit who you can play with. <strong>However, you and your friends <em>will </em>need to at least connect to the same datacenter</strong>, so to learn more about picking the best server in <em>FF14</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-which-server-to-pick-guide-1851466180&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-which-server-to-pick-guide-1851466180">you can check out our guide here</a></span>.</p><p>Cross-progression, on the other hand, is where things get decidedly less straightforward.</p><figure id="" data-id="4a2f06f5d3cb63eef8cc95493c05f48d" data-recommend-id="image://4a2f06f5d3cb63eef8cc95493c05f48d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows different platform options for FF14." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows different platform options for FF14." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4a2f06f5d3cb63eef8cc95493c05f48d" data-recommend-id="image://4a2f06f5d3cb63eef8cc95493c05f48d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows different platform options for FF14." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h87"><a id="cross"></a>How Cross-Progression works in FF14</h2><p><strong><em>FF14 </em>supports cross-progression, but it does not support cross-buying</strong>. That is to say, if you purchase <em>FF14 </em>on PC, you would need to purchase it again if you want to play it on PlayStation. <strong>Expansions in <em>FF14 </em>do not support cross-buying either</strong>, so keep that in mind if you’re considering double-dipping on the game to play it on separate platforms.</p><p><em>FF14 </em>considers each of the following different platforms:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Windows</li><li>Mac</li><li>Steam</li><li>PlayStation (this includes PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5)</li><li>Xbox Series X|S</li></ul><p><em>FF14 </em>does <em>not </em>distinguish between different devices of the same platform. So if you own the Steam version of <em>FF14</em>, you can play it on PC and on Steam Deck without any issues (though Steam Deck might present some UI navigation challenges). </p><p>Fortunately, regardless of how many versions of <em>FF14 </em>you own, <strong>you still only need to pay one subscription fee</strong>. The $12.99 USD entry subscription fee will work just fine in this case. Additionally, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-free-trial-starter-edition-best-1851570741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-free-trial-starter-edition-best-1851570741"><strong>purchasing the Starter Edition</strong></a></span><strong> of <em>FF14 </em>on an additional platform will still add an extra 30 days to your current subscription</strong>. It’s kind of like the Starter Edition is a $5-$7 purchase alongside another month of playtime.</p><h2 id="h88"><a id="steamwindows"></a>What’s the difference between the Steam and Windows version of FF14?</h2><p>You may understandably feel confused about why the Steam version of <em>FF14 </em>is considered a different platform than the Windows version? Aren’t they exactly the same?</p><p>Well, yes. But technically no.</p><p>Both of these versions of <em>FF14 </em>function almost identically by default. But perhaps most importantly, <strong>the Steam version of </strong><em><strong>FF14 </strong></em><strong>will only recognize expansions that are purchased through Steam</strong>. Conversely, expansions purchased on Steam will <em>not </em>work on other platforms.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-free-trial-starter-edition-best-1851570741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-free-trial-starter-edition-best-1851570741"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>: Should You Buy The Starter Edition Or Play The Free Trial</a></span></p><p><strong>The Steam version of <em>FF14 </em>also allows players to purchase Game Time via the Steam Wallet</strong>. For many people, this may be nothing more than a novelty. However, <strong>depending on the country you live in, you may wind up paying less for a <em>FF14 </em>subscription through the Steam Wallet due to how Steam calculates regional pricing</strong>. For example, players in Brazil can typically save a significant chunk of money per month by purchasing subscriptions via the Steam Wallet.</p><p>Additionally, while both the Windows and Steam versions of the game will run on Steam Deck, the Steam version will naturally require a bit less setup to launch by default.</p><p>For players in North America and Europe, you’ll typically find the base game and its expansions on sale more often if you purchase the general Windows version. Just keep in mind that <strong>the Steam and Windows versions of the game are mutually exclusive, so buying one will lock you out of the other</strong>. Neither option is wholesale better than the other, so weigh the pros and cons and decide which version is right for you.</p><h2 id="h89"><a id="expansions"></a>What if you purchase the expansions on one platform but only the base game on the other?</h2><p>In the event that you don’t want to totally invest in purchasing <em>FF14 </em>and its expansions on a secondary platform, you <em>can </em>still play the game in this state with your current account. However, you naturally can’t warp to zones that you don’t “own” on that platform, even if they still show up as fast travel destinations. Additionally, you’ll lack the ability to earn EXP on jobs that have exceeded the level cap available to you.</p><figure id="" data-id="f0f6d7c10c1210280e2f670dd4b22fcd" data-recommend-id="image://f0f6d7c10c1210280e2f670dd4b22fcd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1484" data-height="317" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A warning sign in FF14 tells the player they don't have access to certain expansions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A warning sign in FF14 tells the player they don't have access to certain expansions." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f0f6d7c10c1210280e2f670dd4b22fcd" data-recommend-id="image://f0f6d7c10c1210280e2f670dd4b22fcd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1484" data-height="317" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A warning sign in FF14 tells the player they don't have access to certain expansions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That said, you can somewhat circumvent the limitations you’d typically find by not owning the game’s expansions. So if you only intend to do some crafting or chase down older content on a secondary platform, you can get away with only purchasing the Starter Edition of the game.</p><p>As an aside, <strong>purchasing the latest expansion of <em>FF14 </em>unlocks all the other expansions in the game as well</strong>. However, <strong>if you’ve preordered an expansion that’s yet to come out, you won’t gain access to any additional expansions until that expansion’s launch date</strong>. </p><div><h4>Does Cross-Progression work for free-trial players?</h4><p>Unfortunately, no. Those who play the critically acclaimed free trial cannot access their account on different platforms.  </p></div><p>So while you can technically play <em>FF14</em> on two different platforms, the restrictions on expansion access will make that process tricky.</p><h2 id="h90"><a id="uihotbar"></a>How to transfer your UI and hotbar to different devices</h2><p>Whether you’re swapping from PC to PS5, or you’ve just upgraded your computer, you quickly encounter one quirk of <em>FF14</em>: Your UI, hotbars, and saved equipment sets will revert to their default state. This is because these settings are actually saved locally, so they won’t automatically make the leap to whatever device you switch to.</p><p>While you can manually copy these files, <em>FF14 </em>thankfully offers a streamlined way to transfer these settings, regardless of which device or platform you play on.</p><figure id="" data-id="dac23226222504344da7e82075f45b11" data-recommend-id="image://dac23226222504344da7e82075f45b11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the character selection screen in FF14 shows options to backup client settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the character selection screen in FF14 shows options to backup client settings." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dac23226222504344da7e82075f45b11" data-recommend-id="image://dac23226222504344da7e82075f45b11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the character selection screen in FF14 shows options to backup client settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To transfer over your UI configuration, log in to <em>FF14 </em>on your primary platform. Select “START” on the main menu to go to the Character Selection screen. <strong>To transfer Client and Character Configuration settings, select the cog icon on the top right side of the screen. Press the “Proceed” button on the window that pops up, and then press “Upload.”</strong> After a short wait, you should be able to press the OK button.</p><p>This will save settings such as your UI size, macros, and display settings to the game’s servers.</p><figure id="" data-id="5b6385c4112f50936ed201a4064fa7a1" data-recommend-id="image://5b6385c4112f50936ed201a4064fa7a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the character selection screen in FF14 shows options to backup character settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the character selection screen in FF14 shows options to backup character settings." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5b6385c4112f50936ed201a4064fa7a1" data-recommend-id="image://5b6385c4112f50936ed201a4064fa7a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the character selection screen in FF14 shows options to backup character settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Next, select the cog icon next to the character you intend to play as. Repeat the same steps as above, which means pressing Proceed &gt; Upload &gt; OK. </strong>This will upload settings pertaining to your hotbars and gearsets to the game’s servers (among other things).</p><p>Now, log in to whatever device you have the game installed on. Repeat the above steps, except select the <strong>Download </strong>option in both cases. As you’d expect, this will save your freshly uploaded settings to your new device, letting you seamlessly pick up exactly where you left off.</p><p>Do note that, when transferring settings to devices with different resolutions, things can get a little messy. For example, the settings from your PC running the game at 4K is going to look very silly on the Steam Deck (and vice versa). <strong>Second, you can only upload settings in both categories once every 24 hours</strong>. So if you’re frequently switching which device you’ll play on, you’ll be best off doing any minor adjustments to your gearsets or hotbars manually.</p><hr><p><br><em>Final Fantasy 14</em> offers an incredible wealth of gaming experiences to be had, regardless of which platform you choose to game on. While it can be tricky to play the game on the same account across different platforms, you won’t need to worry about playing with friends. Happy questing! <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Second, the mass adoption of day-and-date digital releases didn’t really get underway until the Xbox One era, which is when Microsoft originally proposed DRM that would have effectively ended disc sharing and GameStop’s then-lucrative used game business. Finally, you can still buy most Xbox 360 games digitally on the Xbox One and Series X/S through Microsoft’s backwards compatibility program. Owners and fans wallowing in nostalgia for the Xbox 360 days made these points and more.</p><p>“I traded them all in to y’all,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/TeslaEnthusist/status/1818030106314747967&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/TeslaEnthusist/status/1818030106314747967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> back one person. “You literally don’t sell physical games in your stores anymore, just junk you call ‘collectibles,’” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/TheyCallMeDSP/status/1818102262163710175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/TheyCallMeDSP/status/1818102262163710175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fired back</a></span> another.

It’s impressive how much people, from customers to employees, love games but hate GameStop. </p><p>It’s a testament to how much the chain dropped the ball on physical game sales, retro curation, and special edition pre-orders, that smaller indie stores and mom-and-pop shops have sprouted up to fill the gap. You can still buy Xbox 360 games from GameStop, but you’ll probably get a better deal somewhere else. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Fartbuckle appears to be an NPC the dungeon master suddenly introduced at a climactic moment, where the party was in life-threatening danger, so they could prove their worth. Boy, did they do it.</p><p>Tumbleweed2319’s post is, in a word, epic. It’s composed of a bunch of illustrations, beginning with the <em>D&amp;D </em>party despairing at being on the verge of getting wiped by an encounter with a magic crystal. Just as everything seems lost, the DM brings up a goblin companion named Fartbuckle, and just as the realization of what’s about to happen hits the players, the goblin jumps in the way of a fatal attack. The final moments of the video show Fartbuckle being blasted to bits, and with his last breath he says, “I…save…friends…Fartbuckle…is…happy.” Cut, end of scene, cue the waterworks.</p><p>As dramatic as the events of the video are, I think what’s really made it take off is its triumphant score. The post, which is set to a new Childish Gambino song named “Lithonia,” feels like a heroic climax. Though the song begins on very airy synths, it eventually picks up the pace with a backing piano before erupting into a guitar-heavy anthemic riff.</p><p>As Fartbuckle makes his sacrifice to save his friends, Gambino growls the line, “I feel liberated,” and the lyrics could not feel more intrinsically tied to the actions on screen, which is of course completely accidental. Gambino, who’s abandoning the moniker and rap persona in favor of using his given name, Donald Glover, definitely <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@jordyjoestartv/video/7397111940998384942&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jordyjoestartv/video/7397111940998384942" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">did not write a song about a goblin named Fartbuckle</a></span>, but someone made a video so good that it almost feels like he did.<br></p><p>Within a few hours of first noticing tumbleweed2319’s post on my For You page—an algorithmically organized feed on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tiktok-band-house-of-representatives-bill-pass-games-1851332769&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tiktok-band-house-of-representatives-bill-pass-games-1851332769">TikTok</a></span> that provides videos the app thinks I’ll like—I was suddenly inundated in similar posts. Sometimes, I’ll like one cat video and get on what I affectionately call CatTok, where TikTok believes I’m part of a cat-loving community of users that needs to see every cat video ever made. Every now and then, I’ll wind up on BookTok, and then quickly try to escape it. My absolute favorite is FoodTok, because then the algorithm serves me up local New York eateries with incredible-looking food.</p><p>This time around though, I had informally been inducted into FartbuckleTok, which was filled with similar animatics reinterpreting the brave goblin’s last moments, and all set to “Lithonia.” And just like that, a meme was born. Other videos I saw featured some animation about Fartbuckle, or a video of someone pretending to cry and mourn the loss of Fartbuckle, a character nobody knew existed a week prior.</p><p>The Fartbuckle trend has become a celebration of the trope of the noble sacrifice from the most unexpected and meager characters. Fartbuckle <em>was </em>kind of no one until he took one for the team, and because nobody expected it, they didn’t expect to grieve him. The beat draws an uncanny parallel to how grief manages to come from unexpected places, and how it makes one appreciate things and people they might’ve taken for granted. Evidently, it’s striking an especially resonant chord with folks who are now grafting the Fartbuckle archetype and meme onto other properties and characters, such as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tag/elden-ring&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tag/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Final Fantasy XIV Online</em></a></span><em>.</em></p><p>To make things even better, Glover, who’s terminally online despite his repeated ire for the internet and all things relating to social media, has even shared his own post about Fartbuckle. Clearly, he’s aware his song has now become synonymous with the goblin, and though he may not understand exactly why, it doesn’t seem to have stopped him from endorsing it. Long live, Fartbuckle.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - Official Season 5 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">A small change is made to how players can customize the attachments on the RAM-9 submachine gun. The Bruen Heavy Support Grip underbarrel attachment is no longer able to be equipped on the gun without a compatible barrel attachment.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 5's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-new-season-5-weapon-attachments-in-cod-modern-warfare-3-and-warzone/1100-6525298/" data-ref-id="1100-6525298">new Quartermaster Suppressor</a> has quickly become a popular attachment for reducing a weapon's recoil, but this option is now restricted in Modern Warfare 3's Ranked Play mode.</p><p dir="ltr">The patch notes also address a stability issue in Zombies mode, which previously caused some players to encounter an inventory timeout error.</p><p dir="ltr">The Warzone side of the update is much smaller, with one of the most-notable changes being a nerf to the popular Superi 46 submachine gun. The maximum damage range is decreased from 13.97 to 12.7 meters. The developer also says the gun's mid-damage range has been removed, and the weapon's minimum damage of 25 now starts at 25.4 meters instead of 34.3 meters.</p><p dir="ltr">Other battle royale weapon changes include the same changes to the COR-46 and RAM-9 as mentioned above for multiplayer.</p><p dir="ltr">Warzone's in-game scoreboard was broken at the start of Season 5, but the patch notes confirm the issue is fixed and players should once again be able to see the scoreboard or stats tab when opening the Tac-Map.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/07/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-season-5-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/07/call-of-duty-mwiii-warzone-season-5-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be seen below, as shared by Activision.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 5 launched on July 24 with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/see-call-of-duty-season-5s-new-weapons-wwe-skins-blackcell-items-and-more-from-the-battle-pass/2900-5628/">new battle pass and WWE crossover</a>.

Developer Squid Shock Studios revealed that last week's sudden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/humble-games-devs-told-company-is-shutting-down">closure of publisher Humble Games</a> has adversely affected its ability to provide timely support to those versions of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5u5ptgu1PRU" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>In a statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/squidshock/status/1817973044826226968?s=46">Twitter</a>, Squid Shock Studios states that Humble Games' apparent closure last week, which saw its entire 36-person staff laid off by owner Ziff Davis in what it calls a “restructuring,” has adversely affected its ability to provide post-launch support for the console versions of Bō. The studio states that this is due to the game’s porting and QA support being tied to its deal with Humble. The PC version doesn't appear to be affected, with the studio currently working on updates for that version. Here’s Squid Shock Studios’ full statement:</p>



<p>We want to give you an update on Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus. We’re really proud of how the launch went and it has been great hearing all of your feedback on our game.</p>

<p>That being said, our launch hasn’t been without its challenges. Most of you will know that our publisher, Humble Games, has effectively shut down, laying off all 35 team members. This took us completely by surprise and, for a small development team like us, it was a critical blow to our post-launch support.</p>

<p>We are now in a difficult situation when it comes to updating the console ports, as both Porting and QA Support was tied into our deal with Humble. We are actively pursuing all available avenues to allow us to roll out updates to console versions, but we regret to say this may take some time to put in place.</p>

<p>We just want to reassure players that we will get this resolved. We are working on updates for the PC version and we want to assure you that these updates and fixes will come to consoles in the future.</p>

<p>Thank you for your understanding and support.</p>

<p>Given the number of games Humble published, both released and upcoming, this likely isn’t the only game or studio to have this kind of wrench thrown into the works due to the sudden layoffs. If you're planning on picking up&nbsp;Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, PC seems like the best way to go for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus is inspired by Japanese folklore, with players controlling a warrior named&nbsp;Bō who descends from Heaven to fulfill an ancient prophecy. Armed with his shapeshifting Bō staff, players traverse a dreamlike, Metroidvania-inspired world battling monsters.&nbsp;Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Revenant has released a previously unseen cinematic of Phoenix Labs’ canceled Game ‘Project Dragon’, which was set to be called ‘Everhaven’.</p>



<p>The game was canceled earlier this year after three years of development and internal struggles to save the game. But as a part of the game’s cancelation, Pheonix Lab’s lifted the projects NDA’s, meaning that footage and images of the project can be shared. Revenant has decided to release a cinematic cutscene from the game.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Everhaven / Phoenix Labs" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/972939497?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="1200" height="675" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write"></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In addition to the cinematic, Revenant has also released some previously unseen images of the project on <a href="https://revenant.tv/work/everhaven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">its website here</a>.</p>



<p>In a press release, Luke Angus, Head of Animation at Revenant, said, “As an animator, this was one of those dream projects that doesn’t come along very often. It’s full of fantastical creatures, a gorgeous art style, and lore as deep and realised as it was beautiful. Getting to work on seven different films in this world provided an opportunity to explore a range of animation styles, each one inspired by the rich narrative of the character at its core.”</p>



<p>Revenant would like to give credit to the following artists for their work on Project Dragon, also known as Everhaven.</p>

In June 2024, following a number of reports, Beahm admitted he exchanged messages in 2017 with a minor via Twitch's now-defunct Whispers feature that "sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate." <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-twitch-employee-says-dr-disrespect-knew-he-was-sending-sexually-explicit-messages-to-a-minor-report"><u>Subsequent reports alleged</u></a> the minor had informed Beahm they were underage, and Beahm continued to send "sexually graphic" messages to them regardless.</p><p>Twitch and Beahm have so far failed to respond to IGN's requests for comment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/gettyimages-1555295895-1722349469625.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Guy Beahm, aka Dr Disrespect.

Bowling said Beahm’s “job as an influencer was to bring eyeballs and community to it [Deadrop].” He added: “having some initial marketing in the beginning we wouldn’t have otherwise definitely helped.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/variants-in-the-rain-1536x863-1722349646265.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Deadrop.

Clearly, that will not happen. The question now is whether Deadrop will find success in an increasingly competitive live service shooter market, one that has already claimed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-troubled-development-revealed-in-new-report">a number of high-profile victims in recent months</a>.</p><p>Midnight Society was just one of a number of companies and brands to distance themselves from Beahm following the allegations. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rogue-company-dev-pulls-all-dr-disrespect-content-offers-rogue-buck-refunds-rather-than-real-money">Hi-Rez Studios pulled all Dr Disrespect content from Rogue Company</a>, and partners and sponsors like Turtle Beach, 2K, and the San Francisco 49ers <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dr-disrespects-sponsors-and-partners-are-responding-to-twitch-ban-allegations-updated"><u>cut ties with the streamer</u></a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Beahm hasn't issued a comment since his last stream, in which he played Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree, at the end of June.</p><p><em>Image credit: Matt Thomas/San Diego Padres/Getty Images.</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/maybe-a-lousy-mobile-game-is-the-perfect-game-for-the-olympics.940497/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/olympics-go<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The summer Olympics are here. During the last summer Olympics, I had just quit working at Kotaku and had a lot of free time, so I got a trial cable subscription and woke up at 4am to tweet about the climbing while pretending I was hanging out with <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/12/rock-climbing-changed-my-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Serrels</a>, which was clearly a healthy and normal way to be. This time around, I’ve only been able to watch it by peering through the windows of neighborhood bars that are playing the events on television, and this missing out has made me wonder if I can get my Olympics fix through video games.&nbsp;</p><p>But these Olympics are apparently the first summer Olympics <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/paris-2024-is-the-first-summer-olympics-in-30-years-to-have-no-console-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not to have a console game tie-in</a>. This includes there being no <em>Sonic &amp; Mario</em> game, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olympics-ditched-mario-sonic-series-to-explore-nfts-and-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurogamer</a> reports is due to the International Olympic Committee not renewing its license with Nintendo and Sega in 2020, according to a long-time veteran of the series:</p><blockquote><p>"[The IOC] wanted to look at other partners and NFTs and esports," Lee Cocker, who worked on almost every entry in the series, told Eurogamer. "Basically the IOC wanted to bring [it] back to themselves internally and look at other partners so they would get more money."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>That partner is developer nWay, who created the mobile game <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-launches-innovative-paris-2024-mobile-game-ahead-of-olympic-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Olympics Go! Paris 2024</em></a>, which you can also play on PC on the Epic store. (As part of this, nWay has also created an Olympics <a href="https://olympicsgo.nway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NFT</a>, which in 2024 is a simply embarrassing choice.) I checked out <em>Olympics Go</em> on PC last night, looking to get my Olympics game fix. There are 12 sports with unlockable difficulty levels; the shooting, archery, rowing, and cycling felt the most tolerable to me, with click-based controls that translated the best from touch to mouse. But all the sports are pretty simple mechanically, mostly clicking and swiping until your avatar crosses a line. Nothing in the game is particularly exciting, though it might feel a little more engaging on your phone while riding the bus than sitting at your desk.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the trappings of Olympic competition like medals and leaderboards, the game feels mostly focused on the kinds of microtransactions and incentives to spend you’d expect from a free-to-play mobile game. There’s a city management layer, where you upgrade and add outbuildings to various Olympic stadiums. It’s an interesting idea, or would be if its whole purpose wasn’t to generate the in-game currency of “fan points.” You spend these points on more buildings, as well as “training” your athlete to level them up. There are other currencies as well: energy, which you spend to compete in events and which regenerates over time, or gems that can be used to buy outfits or more energy. I spent a lot of my time in the game clicking on my buildings to harvest their points, while the game occasionally reminded me that its paid store existed. <em>Olympics Go</em> feels more like a mobile game attempting to cash in on Olympics hype than a celebration of the Games themselves.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Olympics™ GO! Paris 2024 | Official Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yhcPryGi5tM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>My experience playing <em>Olympics Go</em> stood in stark contrast to the one other Olympics game I’ve played, which is <em>Winter Olympics: Lillehammer '94</em> for the Game Gear. I don’t remember why I owned the game–that might have been the year young me was obsessed with Olympic speed skating and used to pretend-skate along with the TV–but I played the hell out of it for years. In my memory, my runs through its slate of events were epic journeys, full of all the highs and lows I imagined real athletes experienced. The game’s feeling of competition and achievement (as well as its visuals, like the trees in the biathlon level and the moguls in the skiing events) are still the first things that come to my mind when I think of the word “Olympics” 30 years later.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Olympic Winter Games - Lillehammer' 94 (Mega Drive/Genesis) - Longplay" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtmY8rd7uh8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Played so intensely at a young age, my positive associations with <em>Lillehammer 94 </em>are surely what an official Olympic video game intended me to feel about the Olympics themselves. Video games play a role as a marketing arm of what <a href="https://defector.com/the-lies-the-olympics-tells-about-itself-have-never-rung-more-false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defector</a> called “the illusion of the Olympics as an apolitical gesture of peace and unity.” The Olympics are notoriously <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/07/29/olympics-is-disaster-people-who-live-host-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad for their host cities</a>, as well as for the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00696-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">environment</a>. They’re our highest profile example of <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/israel-olympics-soccer-paris-palestine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sportswashing</a>– this will soon include <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-enters-a-new-era-with-the-creation-of-olympic-esports-games-first-games-in-2025-in-saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esportswashing</a> too, in the form of the Olympic Esports Games to be held in 2025 in Saudi Arabia. There’s a history of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/Olympic-Games/Corruption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bribery and politicking</a>, and this is to say nothing of the weirdness of nationalism generally. And training and competing<a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9935785/weight-of-gold-hbo-olympics-documentary-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> take a toll</a> on athletes’ physical and mental health, with <a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/covid-olympics-2024-rcna164070" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covid</a> adding a whole new level of risk.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a way in which the disappointment of <em>Olympics Go</em>, with its microtransactions and NFT, captures my relationship to the Olympics themselves as an adult. I need to embrace a certain <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/08/ending-the-olympics-tokyo/619666/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naivete</a> to enjoy the Games these days, and I wrestle with the individual human achievement of the Games against their context. Maybe the crassness of <em>Olympics Go</em> is good, actually, in that it’s a more accurate rendition of some of the truth of the Olympics. Maybe my rosy childhood memories of <em>Lillehammer 94</em> are just propaganda for an event that is itself already propaganda.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m not here to be a downer who demands you not enjoy the Olympics; like everything these days and also throughout history, they have good aspects and bad aspects. Maybe video games are the perfect place for the Olympics fantasy, where I can see the Games as I wish they were, removed from the cost of that fantasy in real life. Or maybe the shabby reality of <em>Olympics Go</em>, and the dearth of Olympics games to take its place this year, is the kind of wakeup call I need.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Star Wars Outlaws certainly has the weight of expectation behind it. The first truly open-world single player Star Wars game, it’s been shorn of the Skywalkers and Palpatines, and instead aims to give us a story that focuses on the criminal underworld of the galaxy far far away. I didn’t even see one lightsaber during my four hours with Outlaws, and it’s much more interesting to discover what this game is, rather than what it isn’t.</p>
<p><iframe title="Oulaws" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5OP8kx00hmY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is set after Empire Strikes Back, which, as anyone knows, is peak Star Wars. The Empire still has a Force stranglehold on the galaxy, but inbetween the cracks, criminal syndicates are rising to power. Our hero Kay Vess, and her adorable companion Nix, dream of a life of freedom, and they’re convinced into taking part in a heist. It does not go well.</p>


<p>We hopped in early to Kay’s story, where she’s just crashed a very important and rare spaceship that she has… acquired. You’re now stuck on the planet of Toshara, an all-new creation designed collaboratively by Massive and Lucasfilm, adding to the Star Wars canon. Mirogana City is the capital of this attractive, Mediterranean-esque landscape, and it’s where you’ll run into plenty of new characters to run jobs for and stab in the back.</p>


<p>At the start of our demo we meet Waka, a worryingly helpful Rodeon who offers to fix up your newly trashed ship, sending us out to get parts from in and around Mirogana City, which just so happens to be the hub for the three major crime syndicates who’ve set up shop here. There’s the Empire knocking around too, and given that this is when they’re at the height of their power, it’s probably best to avoid them.</p>
<p>Mirogana City is a classic Star Wars dive of a place, a city built beneath, and within a mountain, leaving only the mountain’s peak and a core to hold it up. Beneath it is a grimy, deeply insalubrious place, filled with unsavoury characters, and just as George Lucas intended, it feels realistic and lived in. You’ll believe that you could turn a corner and run into Han Solo – and perhaps you will, as you can take on tasks from Jabba the Hutt – and that’s about as good as it could get.</p>
<p>Your first task is to make your way into Pyke underboss Gorak’s antechamber, and while there appear to be different ways you could do this in the main game, from buying your way in with a broker to bribing a technician to let you through an access hatch, here we snuck out way in utilising your Data Spike. Once there, it’s a short stay, as it turns out crime bosses don’t really like you sneaking into their back rooms…</p>

<p>The Data Spike, like every good unlocking device, utilises a mini game, with you having to listen to the rhythmic audio pattern and pressing the trigger in sync with it. If your rhythm sucks there’s a visual overlay you can add to help you out. It isn’t the cleanest of mechanisms, and four hours in I was still struggling to nail the timing. Still, it made it all the sweeter when I did. Kay also boasts a grappling hook for, well, grappling to things and a blaster for shooting stuff. The blaster has multiple mode types, with our demo allowing you access to both a destructive blaster or one that’s capable of stunning enemies. Nix, your constant companion, also offers some useful skills that every slightly shady bounty hunter will find useful, being capable of distracting or attacking guards, or accessing switches and devices that are out of Kay’s reach.</p>
<p>That’s far from Kay’s only skill, as she’s a pretty dab hand at slicing data from computers,&nbsp;with another mini game letting you feel fairly clever about yourself, by choosing from the correct combination of glyphs – or numbers if you prefer.</p>
<p>With a focus on lawlessness, reputation looks to be everything. Whether it’s the Pykes, Crimson Dawn, The Ashiga Clan or the Hutt Cartel you choose to work for, you’re going to have to balance out the jobs you do, and the way you do them. It’s fair to say that Outlaws will see you regularly switching sides, or angering another, and Kay has the Han Solo-esque moxy to get away with it. Or end up in carbonite. It’s hard to tell right now.</p>

<p>It’s not just the syndicates either, your reputation plays into how everyone else perceives you, including the different merchants you’ll find in the world. Depending on their affiliation you might get a better price if you’re on the up with their chosen group, or they might fleece you if you’re on the wrong side of things. If you sell them the right things, you just might improve how they think about you either way.</p>
<p>There’s so much to get involved in here, from the steadily growing number of places you can visit, areas to explore on the map, and then a host of different systems and bits of equipment to upgrade, including your ship.</p>
<p>Once you’ve repaired the Trailblazer – the opening of our demo saw it stuck firmly in the ground – you can shoot off into space, leaving the atmosphere and engaging in some space combat. The Trailblazer is certainly nippy enough, but there’s a lock-on here that makes shooting Tie Fighters out of the sky feel a little too easy. Hopefully, it’s something that can be tweaked before release, or that there’s difficulty levels let you customise the challenge.</p>

<p>The close of our time with Outlaws saw us hop a little way forward in the story, and a little further into that far, far away galaxy to arrive at Kijimi, in search of a safecracker. For anyone that’s seen The Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker, some of this may be sounding mildly familiar, but this is safecracking not codebreaking, so it’s absolutely different. Similarities aside, visiting a location we’ve seen in feature films just cements Outlaws’ place in the Star Wars universe, but ties it to the criminal underworld and shady dealings we’ve seen in The Mandalorian and Andor. Arguably, they’ve been the most interesting things out of Disney’s fairly scattershot approach to Star Wars, so, it’s a good thing.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws pulls together a host of different inspirations when it comes to gameplay, with aspects of Ubisoft’s own Assassin’s Creed series nuzzling up to some Uncharted-style exploration and gunplay. These don’t feel disparate elements though, and I’m totally sold on Kay Vess as a central character, her array of rogueish skills, and the way the Star Wars universe is being brought to our screens by the teams at Massive and across Ubisoft. If you’re a Star Wars fan, Outlaws feels like the perfect video game representation of the seedier world we’ve found in Andor and The Mandalorian, and it continues to sow the idea that maybe, just maybe, we don’t need lightsabers to have a fun time.</p>
