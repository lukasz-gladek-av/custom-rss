            <p>A game based on the Terrifier film series is set to be released next year.</p>
<p>Terrifier: The ARTcade Game will be a beat 'em up inspired by classics like Streets of Rage and Double Dragon, in which players take the role of the films' iconic Art the Clown.</p>
<p>The ultra-gory Terrifier 3 is currently out in cinemas terrorising audiences - it's the highest-grossing film in the series so far, beating rival clown Joker: Folie à Deux at the box office.</p>

<p>The Terrifier game, though, takes on a more cartoonish appearance for its blood-soaked antics.</p>
<p>It's being developed by Relevo and published by Selecta Play, both known for their colourful, retro-inspired games.</p>
<p>The game will see Art the Clown destroying movie sets in over the top, pixel art action. It will also feature local co-op for up to four players, as well as six different game modes to vary gameplay.</p>
<p>It's set for release in 2025 across Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>For a horror experience right now, check out the remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, described as a "bloody triumph" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">our Silent Hill 2 Remake review</a>.</p>

            <p>
Remember when Nintendo posted a photo of someone in a Mario costume peering creepily around a curtain?
</p>
<p>
The now-iconic image, posted by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> on Twitter back in October 2016 to hype the upcoming reveal of Nintendo Switch, was instantly turned into a meme and reposted everywhere - including, multiple times, the pages of this very website. 
</p>
<p>
But what was the story behind that photo? Where did it come from, and why was it so odd? Well, former Nintendo staff Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang have now discussed the incident on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeYuGHAYke8">podcast</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/random-kit-and-krysta-pull-back-the-curtain-on-nintendos-controversial-switch-teaser-photo">Nintendo Life</a>) - and the whole thing sounds as last-minute as it looked.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Erogamer Newscast: New Nintendo Hardware, don't be alarmed it's not Switch 2." data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GdNKD3U-4AY?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<figcaption>Nintendo has announced new hardware, but it's not Switch 2 - so what's the point of Alarmo?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNKD3U-4AY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
"This was very controversial," Yang explained. "The person that had this idea was the former head of social. This person commissioned a photoshoot for the Mario costume character in the office to go... they basically staged the Mario costume character going behind the curtain and doing the thing. 
</p><p>
"It caused some concern actually because, of course, Nintendo doesn't want to <em>not</em> manage people's expectations and this was too much in the zone of speculation - what could it be? [Is] it too much of a tease for something as big as a console reveal? So it didn't go over too well. Then, of course, it got memed into oblivion and people were kind of upset about it, honestly."
</p> <div>

<p>
Ellis suggested the photo was only necessary as there had been no other images provided by Nintendo for that particular marketing beat - something that had left their team's social media boss scrambling.
</p>
<p>
"Here's the thing with these <em>big</em> beats and moments like this," Ellis said. "You always need more assets than you think you do. And in this case, there was clearly no asset to pair with this news and nobody wants to put out a tweet that has no image with it. So it's like, well what can we do? 
</p>
<p>
"There's always some spreadsheet that's like: here's every single asset we need, every single sizing, every single use. And I think in that case they must have missed out, because why else otherwise would they be taking a last-second picture of Mario in the shower, you know?
</p>
<p>
"Peeping Tom Mario in the shower," Yang chipped in.
</p>
<p>
"They'll be on top of it this time," Ellis concluded. "It won't happen again."
</p>
<p>
Fingers crossed for Birdo behind a shower curtain for the reveal of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>?

            <p>If I could extend my arm forty times its normal length, while also granting it the flexibility of a sock filled with mince, I’d probably just use it to take the bins out without leaving my chair. But what if someone were to use this power... for <em>evil?</em> That’s the gist of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-arms-are-longer-now">My Arms Are Longer Now</a>, a cartoony "stealth-comedy" game about worming a single stretchy limb into people’s valuables, which has a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a> demo out now.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The stealth aspect is, in fact, very light. Most NPCs seem unbothered by the meat monstrosity snaking around their feet, wrapping around their shoulders, or repeatedly slapping their heads just for the funny sound effect. Even dragging off a beloved pet in full view of the owner will elicit only the meekest of verbal protests, possibly because they’ve taken one look at this thing and concluded it cannot be defeated by mortal means.</p>

<p>Instead, it’s more a combination of soft puzzler – some target items require you find certain passes or keys first – and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octodad-dadliest-catch">Octodad</a>-style physics wrangler. Lifting your hand up off the floor requires you to build some momentum. Combined with the isometric viewpoint and the slightly surreal mix of a 3D arm on a 2D background, this makes precision pickpocketing trickier than it looks. There’s no failure state, mind, so any clumsy hand-wibbling and/or ropes of excess arm left lying around can only add to the laughs. Speaking of which, My Arms Are Longer Now does well to ground its weirdness in a kind of mumbly, matter-of-fact British wit, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathbulge-battle-of-the-bands">Deathbulge</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thank-goodness-youre-here">Thank Goodness You’re Here!</a> do, though I’m not sure why your haul is measured in dollars when everyone looks and sounds like they’re from Slough.</p><p>That aside, this demo – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2646170/My_Arms_Are_Longer_Now/">which you can grab on Steam</a> – is a cheery way to spend 15 minutes, and I’ll be keeping a much closer eye on the full game's progress than my victims did on their stuff.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-lawsuit-activision-blizzard-players-settled/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Microsoft has settled an antitrust lawsuit with players over its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p>



<p>The final verdict was given on Monday, October 14th, 2024. Both sides notified the court to discuss the lawsuit “with prejudice,” meaning that it couldn’t be refiled (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/microsoft-settles-gamers-antitrust-lawsuit-seeking-divestiture-activision-blizzard-1236031977/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollywood Reporter</a>). Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed to the public; however, each party will bear its own costs and fees regarding the lawsuit.</p>



<p>Players from multiple US states filed the lawsuit following Microsoft’s proposal to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68 billion. Players argued that this would potentially see Microsoft hike prices and make Call of Duty exclusive to its platform.</p>



<p>“As time passes, Microsoft continues to increase its market power, prices have increased, games continue to be canceled, development capacities continue to diminish, and Game Pass continues to trend towards a monopoly,” wrote Joseph Saveri, a lawyer for the players who filed the lawsuit. </p>



<p>After two years of battling, though, those players were seemingly unable to uphold their complaint despite exploring all avenues, including trying to get the lawsuit seen by the US Supreme Court.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard was finalized on October 13, 2023.</p>



<p>In May 2024, Microsoft announced that Call of Duty’s latest premium title, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-game-pass-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be available on Xbox Game Pass on Day 1</a>. The move marks the first time that a Call of Duty game has made its way to the Xbox subscription service on Day 1.</p>

It makes changes to the remaining weapons and stratagems the developer wasn’t able to finish for the game-changing patch released on September 17, with the hope that they’re now “more interesting and effective.”</p><p>Elsewhere, Arrowhead said it’s “fine-tuned the Automaton experience to hopefully make them feel less frustrating to play against.” It’s also adjusted the Helldivers durability “to make your armor choices feel more impactful.”</p><p>Some items now have new functionality to give players “more depth in mastering their equipment.” Arrowhead singled out the GR-8 Recoilless Rifle and the AC-8 Autocannon, which now have programmable ammunition, and drones that come with backpacks which can be toggled on or off for added control.</p><p>Separately, game director Mikael Eriksson issued <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4551541857552166131" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a note to fans</a> summing up the work Arrowhead has done as part of the 60-day plan, and insisted Arrowhead remains committed to updating the game.</p><p>“On behalf of the team at Arrowhead, I want to thank you for your patience, your insights, and your passion for our game. We’ve genuinely enjoyed seeing your reactions to our latest updates, and we’re excited to continue developing the game while ensuring that it delivers on its core fantasy and remains a game we all love to play.</p><p>“Together, we are shaping the future of Helldivers 2, and we can’t wait to show you what’s next for the core game experience and the next chapters of the Galactic War.”</p><p>There is no mention today of the potential addition of a third alien faction to fight against, with the community expecting the Illuminate to arrive sooner rather than later. Nor is there any word on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-psn-review-bomb-cape-mia-as-arrowhead-awaits-clarity-on-game-being-sold-in-more-countries">Helldivers 2's PSN review bomb cape</a>, which Arrowhead is still sitting on.</p><p>Helldivers 2 received a shot in the arm last month with the release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2s-crucial-01001100-update-completely-reworks-weapons-adds-new-galactic-war-feature-and-changes-much-more-in-bid-to-make-the-game-easier"><u>update 01.001.100</u></a>, a patch that completely reworked weapon balance, added a new Galactic War feature, and made loads more changes aimed at making the game easier and more fun (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-helldivers-2s-game-changing-update-made-everything-easier-some-hardcore-fans-want-a-new-harder-difficulty-and-the-devs-agree">some Helldivers 2 players and even some of the developers wondered whether it was too easy</a>).</p><p>The update came after a troubling period for the game and for developer Arrowhead that saw its disgruntled playerbase complain that nerfs had gone too far and as a result had stripped the fun out of Helldivers 2.</p><p>The patch seems to have done the trick and brought fans back on-side. It even sparked a modest increase in concurrent players on Steam (Sony does not make PlayStation player numbers publicly available).</p><h2>Helldivers 2 update 01.001.104 patch notes:</h2><p>Balancing</p><p><strong>General changes</strong></p><p>Additional Supply Items are now visible on the minimap</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Exosuits</li><li>Support Stratagems</li></ul><p>Removed ricochets from Orbital Stratagem projectiles, Eagle-1 bombs and FAF-14 Spear missiles</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>They can no longer ricochet off of targets</li></ul><p>Helldiver armor tweaks, both Heavy and Light armor are now more effective</p><p>Heavy armor reduces damage taken by 25%, up from 20%</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>5% more damage reduction</li></ul><p>Light armor increases damage taken by 25%, down from 33%</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>8% less damage taken</li></ul><p>Stratagems and Weapon tag description updates, they now show more information and are also categorized</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Armor penetration 2 is classified as Light armor penetrating</li><li>Armor penetration 3 is classified as Medium armor penetrating</li><li>Armor penetration 4 is classified as Heavy armor penetrating</li><li>Armor penetration 5+ is classified as Anti tank</li></ul><p><strong>Primary Weapons</strong></p><p>Plasma projectile behavior</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>We’ve standardized the behavior of Plasma projectiles, which previously had varying characteristics in how they traveled through the air.

            <p>An unannounced Death Note game based on the popular anime and manga series has been rated in Taiwan.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/10/death-note-killer-within-rated-for-ps5-ps4-in-taiwan">Gematsu</a>, the rating is for both PS5 and PS4, with the full game name as Death Note: Killer Within. Bandai Namco is the publisher.</p>
<p>No further details have been revealed at this time, including its story or release date.</p>

<figcaption>Nintendo has announced new hardware, but it's not Switch 2 - so what's the point of Alarmo?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNKD3U-4AY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Further, it's unknown if this is related to the forthcoming live-action TV series produced by Stranger Things creators The Duffer Brothers, which currently does not have a release date.</p>
<p>This wouldn't be the first Death Note video game either, although the previous games from Konami were all Japanese-only - most notably, Nintendo DS game Death Note: Kira Game.</p>
<p>Should Death Note: Killer Within be released globally, then, it would be a turning point for the series in video game terms. The English title suggests that's the case.</p>
<p>For the unfamiliar, Death Note's story follows a highschool student who discovers the titular notebook with the supernatural ability to kill anyone written on its pages and his attempts to kill anyone he deems immoral to create a crime-free society. He's thwarted by an elite detective force.</p>
<p>So, would this game be a detective story-focused game? An action game? An RPG? What do you think?</p>
<p>With its anime basis and Bandai Namco publishing, Death Note: Killer Within would follow the recently released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a>, which released recently to critical acclaim. "Sparking! Zero is everything Dragon Ball fans will have wanted, but it's also just a blast for those unbothered by its extensive fan-service," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">reads our review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is just two weeks away, and its spoiler-filled Trophy/Achievement list has now popped up online. 
</p>
<p>
Anyone waiting a decade for BioWare's Dragon Age Inquisition follow-up and wanting to go in blind should now be careful where they click online, as The Veilguard's launch nears. 
</p>
<p>
We won't be covering any story details or spoilers from the Trophy list here, though for those who do want to look, there are awards for each of the game's missions. These offer some big hints at what happens within them, and name several locations the game will visit. We also now know how many main missions the game will offer.
</p>
<p>
A specific Trophy for the game's final mission appears to be a particular spoiler.

<p>
There are other Trophies for aligning with each of the game's characters and many factions. It will be interesting to see if you can unlock them all in one playthrough!
</p>
<p>
And unusually, for a BioWare game, there does not seem to be any award for completing a romance storyline. So feel free to go romance-less and still pick up that Platinum.

If you do want to go gaze into your future, <a href="https://www.exophase.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard-xbox/achievements/">Exophase</a> has the full Dragon Age: The Veilguard Trophy list.
</p>
<p>
As the launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard nears, BioWare has been sharing plenty on the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-five-difficulty-settings-and-a-further-option-to-customise-it-all">accessibility settings</a> and explaining why the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-wont-have-an-arachnophobia-mode-because-it-doesnt-have-a-single-spider">doesn't have an arachnophobia mode</a>. We've also been treated to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/listen-now-to-hans-zimmers-dragon-age-the-veilguard-main-theme">snippet of the game's soundtrack</a>, which is composed by Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe.
</p><p>
"After playing it all day, Dragon Age: The Veilguard feels like the series' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-2">Mass Effect 2</a> moment," Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-playing-it-all-day-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feels-like-the-series-mass-effect-2-moment">Eurogamer's recent Dragon Age: The Veilguard hands-on preview</a>.

			<p>The PC version of Red Dead Redemption will sport better lighting and shadows, among other things, over the PlayStation 5 release, as highlighted by a recent video.</p>
<p>The early comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1">Cycu1</a> does an excellent job highlighting how the PC version will be superior to the PlayStation 5 version, which is actually the PS4 version played in backward compatibility mode, in several regards, including the aforementioned lighting and shadows, but also draw distance, detail and more. Ultimately, the PC version seems like it will represent the original game's atmosphere the best, which should be more than enough to make it the true definitive edition of one of the best open-world games ever made.</p>

<p>The wait has been incredibly long, but it is almost over, as Red Dead Redemption will finally release on PC 14 years after its debut on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-is-out-on-october-29-system-requirements-nvidia-dlss-frame-generation-confirmed/">October 29th</a>. Developed by Double Eleven, the PC port will come with plenty of exclusive features, including Ultrawide and Super Ultrawide support, HDR10 support, keyboard, and mouse controls support, NVIDIA DLSS 3.7 Super Resolution and Frame Generation support, AMD FSR 3.0 support, and more. This new version of the game will come complete with the Undead Nightmare expansion, but will lack any multiplayer feature, just as the PS4 and Switch port do. More information on the port can be found on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668510/Red_Dead_Redemption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam store page.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-settles-lawsuit-from-players-attempting-to-block-activision-blizzard-acquisition.1009680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-settles-lawsuit-from-players-attempting-to-block-activision-blizzard-acquisition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Microsoft has settled the antitrust lawsuit from players attempting to block its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-near-deal-to-buy-call-of-duty-maker-activision-blizzard-report">acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $69bn</a>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/small-band-of-gamers-team-up-to-sue-microsoft-over-activision-blizzard-deal">originally filed in California in 2022</a>, after Microsoft announced its intention to acquire the Call of Duty and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> maker. The legal action was begun shortly after the FTC filed its own lawsuit, (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-wins-crucial-ftc-case-on-activision-blizzard-acquisition">Microsoft crucially won back in 2023</a>).</p>
<p>On Monday this week, a deal was struck to dismiss the lawsuit "with prejudice", so it cannot be refiled. In a court filing, lawyers agreed "each party shall bear their own costs and fees" - beyond this, terms of the agreement have not been disclosed (thanks <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/microsoft-settles-gamers-antitrust-lawsuit-seeking-divestiture-activision-blizzard-1236031977/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p>Players from multiple US states filed the lawsuit, unhappy with the supposed monopoly Microsoft would gain from acquiring <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>. This would potentially mean raising prices, reducing consumer choice, and making certain games exclusive - Call of Duty specifically.</p>
<p>At the timing of the lawsuit's filing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-responds-to-re-filed-gamers-lawsuit-against-activision-acquisition">Microsoft responded to say the legal action was based upon "unsupported and implausible claims"</a>. Undeterred, the defendants continued, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/supreme-court-denies-gamers-last-ditch-effort-to-block-microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal">tried to get the lawsuit seen by the US Supreme Court</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition deal was signed off on 13th October 2023 - with this week marking its one year anniversary.</p>
<p>A year later, then, and players were seemingly unable to uphold their complaint, leading to the settlement of this case.</p>
<p>Since the acquisition, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-12-months-since-microsoft-purchased-activision-blizzard-so-whats-changed">Eurogamer reported yesterday</a>, much has occurred, least of all a string of layoffs and studio closures. Blizzard president Mike Ybarra left the company at the start of this year, following the departure of controversial Activision Blizzard CEO <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a> in December 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-wont-have-campaign-early-access-even-if-you-pre-order">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, the next game in the series, is set to release on PlayStation consoles as well as Xbox and PC, with Microsoft therefore upholding its decision to release the game across multiple platforms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div>



            
<p>My earliest memory of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/commandos-behind-enemy-lines">Commandos</a> series of tactical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth games</a> was my dad bringing home a box copy of the original. “The missions take months. Months!” his mate had told him. Get less shit mates, thought I, for I had already played it elsewhere, and knew that the missions took mere minutes if you put the game on easy then rushed your objectives, bonking nazis along the way. I did not rush the new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1479730/Commandos_Origins/">Steam demo</a> for Kalypso’s revival, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/commandos-origins">Commandos: Origins</a>, but it’s still doable inside half an hour. I had expected a little more, but what’s here has certainly given me some optimism that the full game might well be worth sinking - if not months - at least more time than it takes to wildly lunge at a few nazis en route to your objective.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Before loading in, I was offered the following option:</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/commandos-origins-flag.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kalypso/Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I went with non-historical, mainly because I was worried I was going to get a pop up later like “oh, so you like NAZI flags, do you? You know who <em>else</em> liked Nazi flags?!” (“Crispian Mills” - Graham). The graphics options seem robust enough. I went for high, and the introductory flyover to the demo’s single mission was very pretty, if a lil’ stuttery.</p><p>Even if you’ve never played a Commandos game, you might be familiar with the basics here from one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-gambit-studio-mimimi-are-closing-down-to-prioritize-our-well-being">sadly defunct Mimimi</a>’s absolute belters, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/desperados-iii">Desperados 3</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew">Shadow Gambit</a>. Those games, despite their own wonderful twists and map designs, could fairly accurately be described as spiritual sequels to this series, since the fundamentals bear such strong resemblance. You control a small team of specialists with RTS controls, sneaking around by avoiding enemy vision cones. The vision are divided into ‘don’t walk here’ and ‘don’t crawl here’ sections. You crouch in bushes, perform stealth kills, hide bodies, use gadgets and special abilities, and sometimes coordinate spectacularly gif-worthy team plays.</p>
<p>Even the controls felt immediately intuitive, despite me not having played a Commandos game in years - right down to the soon-to-be-worn-to-nubs quick save and load keys. A very small gripe: the quick save is a little slow, even briefly pausing the game. I feel like a donkey responding to a quick save option with, ah, but how quick are we talking? But here we are.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/commandos-origins-barrel.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>The green beret can also carry barrels, though this one was perfectly placed. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Kalypso/Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You start the mission as just the green beret, who’s sort of the thick-armed poster boy for the series. I swear he even runs the same, like someone recently injected a sharp needle filled with testosterone into his bottom. The first gadget I find is a radio, which you can plonk down then remotely activate to lure enemies. Combined with a shovel he can use to bury himself in the dirt, this is a disgusting bit of kit, highly abusable.</p><p>Also slightly broken are the marine’s throwing knives. He turns up shortly to help me deal with a higher tier of guard who’s heard it all before, especially radios, and so won’t move from his spot. The knives do have a fairly short distance, but I should point out that kit being abusable is kind of the point with these games. Once you get a full team together, you’ve basically got access to superpowers. When done well - like in Mimimi’s case - the meat of the game is having to stretch all these overpowered combinations to their absolute limit to deal with seemingly impossible scenarios. For obvious reasons, this is something a demo can’t really explore too much - although there were enough instances packed with guards it'd be worth going through twice, I reckon.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/commandos-origins-widdle.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kalypso/Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I accidentally amber-alerted an inqusitive grunt at one point, trying to sneak my marine up a ladder to push a wardrobe on top of two chatting guards. Am I going to snark the wardrobe for being much more pristine than the only other two pieces of furniture in the bombed-out house <em>and</em> being conveniently placed in the only position that would allow me to do this? No. That’s some early 2010’s game crit shit. Now we ponder the liminality of the space between the house and the guards. Anyway, the guard ran about for a bit, doing a pretty unconvincing but still thorough check of local hiding spots. The nazis don’t strike me as geniuses, but I did notice they’ll sprint backwards while shooting if you try to quickly rush them down with a knife after fumbling stealth.</p>
<p>After clearing out the area, my next stop is the radio tower I’m supposed to take down for my objective. There’s two guards covering each other with view cones between me and it, so I try a little “time shifting”, which is the game’s fancy way of saying “pause”. I have the marine use a throwing knife, and the green beret use his special “holding knife” to take them down. I then lob a grenade I found on a guard - they drop loot sometimes, medikits and the like - at some barrels surrounding the tower, and that’s the mission and also the demo done.</p>

<p>All in all, it seems very solid. The question, of course, is how Claymore’s scenario design will eventually stack up. Abilities are one thing, but it’s how I’m coaxed into using them that really matters here. Based on the most recent gameplay trailer, it does seem to be saving some of its best toys (tanks!) for later, but that’s par for the course. While it does feel a little strange to call a game primarily about throat-slitting ‘comfy’, that’s about where I am with this. It’s doing everything right by not really doing anything wrong, and when you’ve got a formula that works this well, that’s good enough for a wishlist from me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest?snr=1_4_4__118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Steam Next Fest</a> for October 2024 has begun and as usual, there's a veritable treasure trove of demos available for upcoming PC games. The downside is that some gems might slip through the cracks, given how many demos are released at the same time. In this article, we'll try to give you an overview of the five games (plus another bonus five) we believe are worth checking out.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/8e31e7492372aa052c2caa93f48a0fbc2c9e4cd3-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2507950/Delta_Force?snr=1_614_615_nextfest_100718" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Force</a></h2>
<p>Let's start from the top. So far, the most played demo is the latest playtest of Delta Force, TiMi Studio's upcoming tactical first-person shooter game based on the historic franchise. Back in June, we were <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-qa-early-access-in-october-release-window-in-q1-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> the developers planned to launch early access in October, although that schedule appears to have been delayed. Anyway, this new playtest also features Asia and South America servers in addition to North America and Europe, allowing more players to jump into the fray with a decent latency. Across the Steam Next Fest week, Delta Force players will be able to check out four Havoc Warfare modes (Attack/Defend, King of the Hill, Siege, and Blitz) across two maps (Cracked and Ascension), while the extraction mode Hazard Operations has three maps available. This playtest also includes 45 weapons, 9 vehicles, and 12 props.</p>

<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/490110/The_Precinct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Precinct</a></h2>
<p>Do you miss the old days of Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2? If so, there is no better cure than The Precinct, even though the game in development at Fallen Tree flips GTA on its premise and puts you in the shoes of a rookie beat cop who just graduated from the Police Academy.</p>
<p>The Precinct mixes action with sandbox elements. In the game, you'll patrol the streets and respond to calls to take on criminals, from drug dealers to bank robbers, choosing your own approach in car chases and shootouts. As a cop, you can get various forms of backup, from spike strips to roadblocks and fellow police cars. A full-fledged day/night cycle with dynamic weather should make you even more immersed in the fictional city of Averno, set in the 1980s East Coast.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb6bb931255d1fca75c8cd7009d8bfc28b6eeedd-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2407270/AI_LIMIT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Limit</a></h2>
<p>Fans of games like NieR: Automata and Code Vein should definitely check out AI Limit, which has a demo out now on PC for the Steam Next Fest and on PlayStation 5.&nbsp; As in many Japanese games, the setting of the debut title from Sense Games is post-apocalyptic Earth, following various wars and disasters. Players will venture out into the dangerous world from the last human refuge of Havenswell, trying to uncover the truth behind all the destructive events. The AI Limit demo lets players experience the first level in its entirety for an estimated two hours of gameplay.</p>
<p>Enemies include elite and boss battles, and the level has several secret paths that hide weapons and items. Once you finish the demo, there's also a Boss Challenge mode.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/a42b03f27152499b9a48439eb89a5b6b563913f1-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287330/Empire_of_the_Ants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Empire of the Ants</a></h2>
<p>This impressive looking Unreal Engine 5-powered real-time strategy game is based on the novel from best-selling saga sci-fi novel originally published by French writer Bernard Werber in 1991. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-launch-lineup-also-includes-the-ue5-rts-empire-of-the-ants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game</a> expects you to build up your economy, manage your units, gather information on the battlefield, gain new powers, and strengthen your defenses. When you run out of space, there's always the option to conquer other nests. The full game, out on November 7, also includes a 20-hour campaign and even multiplayer modes.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/731ce7b790f7b4960cf6b2e52ad7990eef03bf52-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458310/New_Arc_Line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Arc Line</a></h2>
<p>Our final pick is New Arc Line, the intriguing magic-meets-steampunk cRPG in development at Dreamate Games. In the Steam Next Fest demo, players can pick from two classes (either a Voodoo Shaman or a Diesel Engineer) and two races (Human or Elf). The events of the demo take place a little further into the main story, in a small part of the Harbour Slums, where players are tasked with investigating the Leprosarium and finding out why a doctor is not making her rounds to help the poor community affected by the deadly Iron Plague epidemic. For more about New Arc Line, check out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-gamescom-first-look-and-qa-a-crpg-about-magic-vs-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamescom 2024 Q&amp;A</a>.</p>

		<p><span>In fashion, it’s said that trends return every 20 years. But it seems technology has started to repeat itself at the same cadence, too. Can you identify what things happened in 2004, 2024, or in some cases, both?</span></p>

								<p>Two decades ago, the EU handed down a fine of over $600 million for not offering versions of Windows that did not come with Windows Media Player preinstalled. Microsoft still has antitrust problems in Europe at the moment, and last year, the EU attempted to block the company’s acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard. But Microsoft has paid no fines this year… so far.</p>

								<p>The very first Razr, called the Motorola Razr V3, was released in November of 2004. At the time, it cost <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/29/22857413/motorola-razr-internet-button-flip-phone-data-cellular-charges">$500 with a two-year contract</a>. That was expensive then, and it’s expensive today. The current model of Motorola’s revival model, the Razr Plus, comes unlocked at nearly the same price.</p>

				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>Steve Jobs introduced the company’s Cinema Display in 2004 at WWDC. The price of the 30-inch model was $3,299 — adjusted for inflation, that’s over $5,400 today.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>At the end of last year’s film adaptation of the Mattel product, Barbie discovers her independence. But in 2004, Mattel announced that <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/barbie-ken-splitting-after-43-years-1c9485747">the couple had split</a>. Drama in doll lore existed long before Greta Gerwig scripted it.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>Google famously launched Gmail on April Fools’ Day 2004 — at a time when promising one gigabyte of free storage surely must have been a joke. Google did introduce Inbox a decade ago in 2014 but shuttered that in 2019.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="both">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>The 2024 film is actually an adaptation of the 2017 stage musical, which was adapted from the 2004 film, which was originally adapted from a 2002 book titled <em>Queen Bees and Wannabes</em>.</p>

								<p>He hates Mondays but loves reboots. In 2004, it was called <em>Garfield: The Movie</em>; in 2024, <em>The Garfield Movie</em>. How times have changed.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p><em>Spider-Man 2</em> opened on June 30th, 2004, breaking the previous opening-day box office record held by its predecessor. Though there were <em>Spider-Man </em>sequels released in 2019 and 2021, none are slated for this calendar year. (We’re not counting <em>Madame Web </em>since it is not a direct sequel and also barely counts as a movie.)</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>Microsoft released the SPOT watch — short for “smart personal object technology.” Given that you don’t hear that acronym much anymore, you can probably guess that the watch never took off, despite the fanfare over the device’s ability to read headlines, send instant messages, and give weather forecasts. The SPOT watch also wasn’t even the company’s first attempt at a smartwatch: as early as 1994, it partnered with Timex to release the Datalink, arguably the world’s first smartwatch. But here in 2024, it’s been a while since Microsoft tried to make wristwear happen.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>In 2004, Beyoncé won five Grammy Awards — her first as a solo artist. Though this year’s <em>Cowboy Carter</em> is a likely favorite come awards season, she did not release an album in 2023, which means nothing that qualifies for this year’s Grammy Awards.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="both">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>US consumers loved trucks in 2004 and have continued to love them for the past two decades. Ford’s F-series remains the bestseller even today, and it has little to do with the addition of the electric version — in 2024 so far, the Lightning makes up less than 5 percent of total F-series sales.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>First identified in January 2004, Mydoom became the fastest-spreading email worm ever. As of 2024, its speed record has not been surpassed, and its origin is still unknown.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>In June of 2004, the Supreme Court ruled that the Child Online Protection Act was unconstitutional, a violation of the First Amendment. Though it was designed to prevent minors from seeing pornography on the internet, the Court ruled 5–4 that the law itself was too broad. Similar echoes are happening this year, though. Age-verification laws at the state level are blocking porn sites for minors or, in some states, blocking them entirely; and this July, the similarly named Kids Online Safety Act passed with bipartisan support.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="both">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>The original <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door </em>was released for the GameCube in 2004, and its remake was released for the Switch almost exactly 20 years later.</p>

						
					</div>


				<div data-answer="both">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>One of Hollywood’s biggest tabloid magnets, the couple called off their engagement and broke up for the first time in January 2004. Lopez and Affleck got back together many years later, finally marrying in 2022. That union officially ended again in 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/hunt-showdown-1896-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Hunt: Showdown 1896 is a big revision of the original Hunt: Showdown, which was released way back in 2019. For those not familiar, it’s a PvPvE extraction shooter featuring zombies, hunting down a selection of bosses, and a bunch of gunslinger types who want to kill all the aforementioned things as well as you. It’s also got some very cool ideas behind it, such as a heavy reliance on audio cues and spatial sound to pinpoint where other players are, but alas, some of these cool ideas fall apart in a multiplayer game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hunt: Showdown 1896 I Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16vBsmpcxh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The set-up is fairly straightforward, as you and up to two other hunters head into a zombie-filled map to find clues that will lead you to a big monster to kill. You must then banish that monster and collect its bounty tokens, which takes time and gives other hunters your location so they can hunt you down, and steal your bounty tokens – very rude, if you ask me. It’s an extraction shooter, except the things you’re extracting are, I guess, bits of a giant spider, or whatever boss you were lucky enough to get instead. I honestly love the idea, but the reality is a bit less exciting.</p>


<p>The first boss I encountered was the aforementioned spider, and what a spider it was – taller than me, nine feet long, hairy, and scuttling all along the ceiling and walls at a horrific pace. The sounds it makes are the worst part, accurately giving the impression it’s crawling around you when you’re wearing headphones.</p>
<p>The spatial audio is vital throughout, as while you’re finding these clues and fighting this boss, the gunshots and explosions will make an awful lot of noise and draw other groups of players to you. The quieter you are, the safer you are. In addition to shooting and your footsteps, they can also hear any noise traps you might trigger – things like dying horses in the road, flocks of crows, and dogs in a kennel all make noise if they notice you, giving your position away. With a pair of headphones, you can pinpoint the direction they come from and know that there’s likely enemies over there well before you see them. The sound design and the use of spatial sound in this game is truly excellent.</p>

<p>As great as it sounds, it has mostly led to frustration. You can keep your distance from noise traps to avoid triggering them, but there’s often many of them clustered together directly in your way, and sometimes they trigger from further away than you thought they did last time, somehow. This, combined with certain zombies, can make sneaking around more of a chore than a thrill.</p>
<p>The Hive, a zombie with a beehive stuck in its chest that attacks from range demands you have a silent ranged weapon with you or you will be forced to shoot and draw attention to yourself. Its bees also deal poison damage, which prevents you from healing until it stops taking health away from you, which you either have to wait out or heal with an antidote. Meanwhile, the Immolator is a zombie that explodes into flames and charges once pierced by bullets or knives, but I don’t know how many blunt strikes it takes to kill with my fully charged melee because I got to four before it had taken three quarters of my health and then just shot it out of sheer frustration. Fire and bleed both need to be stopped by holding square before they kill you, which just isn’t engaging. Just yet another thing passively draining my health and slowing me down as if the movement speed wasn’t abysmally slow as it is.</p>

<p>Every piece of your equipment costs Hunt Dollars. I started with 8000 Hunt dollars I believe, but now have about 3000. Each time you die you’ll lose all your equipment and, once you reach level 11, you’ll lose your character and all the traits you’ve unlocked from levelling them up as well. Once I run out of Hunt Dollars, I’ll be without ammo packs, med kits, fire bombs, antidotes, and dynamite, not to mention being stuck with basic free characters and their similarly bare-bones weaponry. In short; a very severe disadvantage. Bounties don’t even reward that many Hunt Dollars, with the best way to earn some being killing other players or engaging with the event that sometimes appears in the center of the map.</p>
<p>To counter this disadvantage, you could hang back collecting stuff whilst you wait for the other groups to kill each other, then swoop in and take out the survivors. Unfortunately there isn’t that much stuff to collect, with most of it marked on the map and most buildings just being completely empty, making exploring feel pointless. Many players are also content to just sit in the building they fought the boss in forever. They’ll wait until they’re sure they’ve murdered everyone with their much better sight lines whilst you’ve got to see them through a window and headshot them in the split second they’re visible or try to navigate through all the noise traps and actual traps they have placed.</p>
<p>I’ve been hunting down someone only to find that they were just camping inside a large bush where they simply can’t be seen from outside. They were there for almost five minutes whilst I painstakingly snuck my way over to them, completely still, next to their team mate who I had already downed, and invisible to me because all I could see was their bush.</p>

<p>That’s the issue with this type of cool gameplay idea. When there’s lots of players it gets abandoned because it’s not efficient to play that way. If you sneak you won’t make noise, but you’ll spend fifteen minutes slowly making your way around and then you’ll either have to dash madly towards bounty holders anyway or keep sneaking and lose them. You’re much better off sprinting around because being careful and engaging properly with the sound mechanics is too large of a disadvantage, especially since there’s horses and cows constantly going off anyway because everyone else <em>is</em> sprinting around.</p>
<p>The shooting itself has its share of issues as well. Now, reloading is extremely slow. If someone were to reload like this in real life I’d suggest they switch to using swords or something, it’s so slow it almost feels passive aggressive. But beyond that, there’s also some latency and hit detection issues. In addition to having played a few matches with a big red lag warning in the corner of my screen though without any actual signs of lag like rubber banding and desync, I’ve also aimed directly at a player’s head whilst they were completely still and missed. Additionally, I’ve very obviously missed shots only to find that they mysteriously still connected. This could be part of the lag, it could be poor hit detection, I don’t know, but I do know it’s annoying and quickly converts the tension in gunfights into frustration.</p>
<p>On top of this, there’s a lengthy list of issues with the game’s UI and menus, despite it being overhauled with this update. Navigating around the menus is always a pain, sometimes it’s unclear where things are, where you’ll end up when you press a button, what a button will do, or even what UI elements mean. When choosing traits for your characters, there are a few icons on some of them that we could not find an explanation for in-game. You can’t highlight them, there isn’t a key, eventually we had to google them because we thought they would tell us why we couldn’t equip them. It turns out you have to find them in-game before you can equip them, something the game didn’t tell us outside of an icon without a description. They’ve even removed the Encyclopedia, which had all the background information about types of zombies and the world and so on, so that just isn’t in the game it belongs in anymore apparently.</p>

<p>Speaking of removing things, this new map – Mammon’s Gulch – is pretty nice, though not as nice as you might expect from Crytek. It’s got quite a few distinct areas, though two of those are both burned out wastelands, and a lot of verticality with all the hills, mountains, and mines/caves. It looks good, it just doesn’t have the wow I’ve previously associated with Cryengine. But they’ve also removed the other three maps from the game temporarily for some reason, initially for a month but now for an undisclosed time longer than that. That means you get one map for more than a month, ensuring less variety in the game than there was before this revitalising patch.</p>
<p>Then there’s bugs and frustrating traversal issues. In addition to walking painfully slowly and sneaking/crouching being even more painful, you can usually vault over things in this game, but I guarantee whilst you’re sneaking through the undergrowth you’ll come upon a waist high rock or ledge that you inexplicably can’t vault over. This totally ruins the sneaky vibe and your immersion as you have to go around or stand and jump to get up it, exposing yourself to anyone you might’ve been sneaking up on. Hunters also sometimes leave some chunks of their guns floating in the air around extraction points once they’ve been extracted, whilst sometimes the gun models don’t load even whilst playing, which is poor and a minor disadvantage to other players as that gun sticking up off their back could give away their position if they were, as a random example, hiding in a bush. And <em>then</em> there’s slow matchmaking and even occasional failures when inviting another player into my party, the only reliable way around this being to restart the game for both of us.</p>

<p>In a clip captured during a recent stream, Jesse ‘bubu dubu’ Moeller explained that he and his squad are being dropped by Sentinels in the Halo Championship Series. He also explained that the organisation is uncertain of its future in the Halo scene, prompting concerns from fans.</p>



<p>Sentinels has yet to make a comment about these claims, but the organisation is notorious for being radio silent where the Halo ecosystem is concerned.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-moving-on">Moving On</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bubudubu/clip/ObeseUninterestedGooseWholeWheat-zxlkrP0WNdjt18G6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a short clip</a> captured while broadcasting a ‘Health &amp; Fitness’ stream, Sentinels’ bubu dubu said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Sentinels pretty much told us that we are all – like my entire team – are unrestricted free agents, and we are available to explore. They’re pretty much undecided if they’re going to field a team for year four, you know?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sentinels is far from being one of the winningest teams in the Halo space. In 2022, the organisation won the Kansas City Major, beating Cloud9 in a 4 – 0 sweep in the grand finals to secure a $140,000 prize. Since then, not much has happened for the organisation.</p>



<p>Most recently, the team finished in fifth place at the Halo World Championship tournament in Seattle.</p>



<p>Regardless of the team’s stature, it would be a blow to the Halo Championship Series to see the organisation cut away and move on. Sentinels has had a place in the HCS since it was reborn a few years ago, and it has shared the stage with some of the biggest names in gaming, like FaZe Clan and OpTic Gaming.</p>



<p>It has been a rocky few years for the Halo esports scene, despite 343 Industries (now Halo Studios) and Esports Engine trying to set up a solid competitive ecosystem and attract fans worldwide to attend a series of high-profile events.</p>



<p>Would you be sad to see the back of Sentinels in the Halo Championship Series? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It's the first mainline entry in the series with Princess Zelda in the leading role, and it plays a lot differently than previous top-down iterations starring Link. Zelda's ability to create echoes (copies) of objects and monsters to solve puzzles, cross gaps, and fight offers a fun new spin on the classic formula. Just like Tears of the Kingdom, there are many ways to solve puzzles. Echoes of Wisdom also has key components of the classics, including traditional dungeons and Heart Pieces.</p><p>All long-time fans should play Echoes of Wisdom, but it would also make for a great first Zelda game for newcomers.

Ultimate is rarely discounted below $50 at major retailers.</p><hr><hr><h3>PSA: Woot's new approach to selling Nintendo Switch games</h3><p>Note: Woot recently reconfigured its Nintendo Switch listings to note that physical games ordered from the retailer are region-free editions. This means that you aren't guaranteed to get a North American edition of the Switch games you order from Woot. All Nintendo Switch consoles are region-free, and Nintendo includes multiple language options in most games, including English in all of the Switch games listed in this article. If you get an international import, the only visible difference is the ratings board logo on the box, which is always ESRB for North American releases.</p><p>When it comes to actually playing the game, you won't notice any differences between the North American, UK, Japanese versions, etc. The one potential snag is with DLC. For example, if you buy the UK edition of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, any DLC you purchase in the future must be from the UK eShop. North American Switch owners can easily create UK and Japanese eShop user accounts on Switch, so this is more of a potential annoyance than anything else, but it's worth keeping in mind. That said, most of the games above--and first-party Switch games in general--are fully self-contained and don't offer DLC.</p><p>Of the games on sale at Woot, four of them have notable add-on content: Smash Bros., Luigi's Mansion 3, and Pokemon Sword and Shield.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="340367439" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

			<p>In a new announcement, Microsoft has announced that three major Call of Duty games will be available for <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-to-let-you-stream-your-own-games-next-month/">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> via <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6?ef_id=_k_Cj0KCQjwgrO4BhC2ARIsAKQ7zUnPqwr0nqsAi0fDZv1FPmufzq9uHWa6WGu-XD0qK8yySUy4burJP8MaAne7EALw_wcB_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmmm3j0z1q0_SEM__k_Cj0KCQjwgrO4BhC2ARIsAKQ7zUnPqwr0nqsAi0fDZv1FPmufzq9uHWa6WGu-XD0qK8yySUy4burJP8MaAne7EALw_wcB_k_&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwgrO4BhC2ARIsAKQ7zUnPqwr0nqsAi0fDZv1FPmufzq9uHWa6WGu-XD0qK8yySUy4burJP8MaAne7EALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a> Ultimate from 25 October 2024. This is a huge occasion for those who want to play Call of Duty but don't want to pay the hefty price tag that often comes along with the games. As we already know, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a day-one release for Xbox Game Pass, but having these games available via Xbox Cloud Gaming means those with less powerful rigs will be able to dive into them.</p>
<p>Alongside Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone, all of which will be available to stream via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. This update will be rolled out as of 10 AM PDT / 1 PM EDT / 6 PM BST. For a lot of Game Pass Ultimate users, this update won't matter too much, as Modern Warfare III has been available since July, and Warzone is equally available and free to play regardless of what platform you play it on. However, these games were not previously available for streaming, which is what makes this announcement a big deal, especially as Microsoft is now trying to push more for Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>
<p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is available on Xbox consoles, PC, Android, iOS, Amazon Fire TV, Meta Quest, and finally, select Samsung TVs. To be able to stream these games in the first place means that Microsoft will have had to make a deal with Ubisoft. Although they had made a <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-resctructures-activision-blizzard-deal/">deal in the past</a>, it was actually in the reverse order. Instead, Microsoft sold the streaming rights of Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft, allowing them to stream the games for 15 years. Completing this deal means that Ubisoft has the right to stream games like Call of Duty through the Ubisoft+ service.</p>
<p>Because of this deal, they likely had to create a new deal that allowed Microsoft to have some form of power again over the contract so that they could equally stream the games of a company that they outright acquired.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 isn't too far away, with the game set to release on 25 October, meaning that those eager to play the game using Xbox Cloud Gaming will be able to stream it on the day one release of the highly anticipated title.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mythic-games-files-for-liquidation-marking-end-of-controversial-company.1009491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mythic-games-files-liquidation-end-controversial-company<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mythic Games has filed for liquidation (aka bankruptcy). This final note in the board game developer's history is an unsurprising one. Their history is a long one of miscommunication with customers, delays, troubled crowdfunding campaigns, and lawsuits.</p>
<h2>The Mythic Games Liquidation Announcement</h2>
<p>The liquidation of Mythic Games was made public by a news report by French website <a href="https://annonces-legales.leparisien.fr/annonce/23cba43f-8a82-48c1-8f57-6a2285e239c3">Le Parisien</a>. According to the report, the decision was made on October 1, 2024. Mythic's co-founder, Leonidas Vesperini, will be acting as liquidator.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/darkest-dungeon-board-game-miniature-artwork.jpg?itok=zKfFF1Ct 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/darkest-dungeon-board-game-miniature-artwork.jpg?itok=qVVg8gbN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Mythic Games was founded in 2015 in Luxembourg and started as one of the most successful crowdfunding board games in the industry.&nbsp; But this reputation was quickly soured by production delays, miscommunication, and financial mismanagement.</p>
<p>These controversies and issues are numerous. They include underwhelming or unsatisfactory miniatures and components for expansions to <em>Super Fantasy Brawl</em> and legal action <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2348051/right-of-reply-from-pascal-bernards-ip-dispute-aut">regarding royalties</a> in <em>Time of Legend: Joan of Arc</em>.</p>
<p>This history includes their landmark achievement: a crowdfunding campaign for an officially licensed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/darkest-dungeon-board-game-wont-ship-unless-backers-pony-up-more-money" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Darkest Dungeon </em>board game</a>. By all accounts, it was a major Kickstarter success raising more than $5.6 million. But after two years of production issues, the studio asked for more money from their backers to ship the game. This was done after backers had paid shipping costs.</p>
<p>This behavior was frequent with Mythic Games. Products arriving significantly late. Games made with inferior or inconsistent materials. While forces outside of their control did play a factor such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Mythic was synonymous with development issues before such hardships exacerbated their troubles.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-fantasy-brawl-board-set-up.jpg?itok=gfwTtme- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-fantasy-brawl-board-set-up.jpg?itok=ue1QzB7p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Financial struggles were so dire for Mythic Games that they sold some of their board game IP <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/01/27/mythic-games-fails-to-deliver-on-two-kickstarter-projects-worth-3-2m-sells-ip-to-cmon/">to CMON</a> in January of this year. This sale included <em>Hel: The Last Saga</em> and <em>Anastyr</em>, which was done to get both projects into production.</p>
<p>By contrast, CMON has a more steady hand on the wheel. They have experience with crowdfunding platforms <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-announces-future-games-coming-exclusively-to-gamefound" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like Gamefound</a> and have shepherded many beloved tabletop series like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/zombicide-dceased-brings-anti-life-to-table" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Zombicide</em></a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the fate of Mythic Games' outstanding board game projects is unclear.</p>

Game Freak — which develops the main lineup of <em>Pokémon</em> video games — <a href="https://www.gamefreak.co.jp/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/info20241010.pdf">confirmed the breach</a> in a statement, saying (per a machine translation from Japanese) that it was the result of “unauthorized access to our servers by a third party” and dated back to August of 2024.</p><p>Game Freak said the leaked personal information — which it characterizes as names and company email addresses — included around 2,600 items. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/465710/pokemon-game-freak-leak-hack">As <em>Polygon</em> notes</a>, however, the breach appears to include much more than employee information. Redditors and others say they’ve unearthed source code from previous games as well as unused pokémon designs and other things that were scrapped during the development process of those games. They’ve allegedly found more limited detail about future projects, including some codenames for future games.</p><p>There are no apparent reports of direct leaks from the other companies involved in <em>Pokémon</em> as part of this breach, including Nintendo, Creatures Inc., and the jointly owned Pokémon Company.</p><p>Game Freak’s statement, which is dated to October 10th but, according to <em>Polygon,</em> appeared on the 13th, says the server has since been secured and that the company is taking steps to bolster its security measures. Here’s the full machine translation:</p><div><blockquote><p>October 10, 2024</p><p>Game Freak Inc.</p><p>Notice and apology regarding the leak of personal information due to unauthorized access</p><p>Game Freak Inc. (Headquarters: Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, CEO: Satoshi Tajiri, hereinafter referred to as “the Company”) has discovered that the personal information of our employees and others was leaked in connection with unauthorized access to our server by a third party in August 2024.</p><p>We sincerely apologize for the great inconvenience and concern caused to all concerned parties.</p><p>1.

Response to those whose personal information has been confirmed to have been leaked</p><p>We are contacting the relevant employees, etc. individually.</p><p>For those who cannot be contacted individually due to resignation, etc., we will notify them through this announcement and set up a hotline to handle inquiries regarding this matter.</p><p>3. Measures to prevent recurrence</p><p>We have already rebuilt and re-inspected our servers, but we will work to prevent recurrence by further strengthening our security measures.</p><p>4.

<p>From Warcraft to Resident Evil, the world of video game film adaptations runs the gambit. They’re either downright terrible, like one we’ll mention briefly below, or they’re serviceable adaptations that prove entertaining to watch; there’s very little in between. But 2025 brings about a handful of new video game movies and television series that could fall on either side of the fence, and we’re down to find out which.</p>



<h2 id="h-upcoming-video-game-movies-and-tv-series-in-2025">Upcoming Video Game Movies and TV Series in 2025</h2>



<p>While it’s still early days, there are currently nine planned video film films and TV series scheduled for 2025. They include straight-to-Netflix series, anime, and feature films that’ll hit a movie theater near you throughout the year. They include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Colorful Stage! The Movie: A Miku Who Can’t Sing (Film)</strong> – January 17, 2025</li>



<li><strong>A Minecraft Movie (Film)</strong> – April 4, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Devil May Cry (Series) </strong>– April 2025</li>



<li><strong>Mortal Kombat 2 (Film)</strong> – October 24, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 (Film)</strong> – December 5, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers (Anime)</strong> – TBA</li>



<li><strong>Kamitsubaki City Under Construction (Anime)</strong> – TBA</li>



<li><strong>Summer Pockets (Anime)</strong> – TBA</li>



<li><strong>Untitled Raiden Anime (Anime)</strong> – TBA</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-highest-rated-video-game-movie-of-all-time">What is the Highest Rated Video Game Movie of All Time?</h2>



<p>Did you know the film <strong>Werewolves Within</strong>, starring Milana Vayntrub and Sam Richardson, is based on a video game of the same name? I didn’t know that, despite absolutely loving the movie. The game was a multiplayer VR title developed by Red Storm Entertainment and published by Ubisoft, in which players would need to use social deduction to figure out which player was the werewolf before they could slay everyone.</p>



<p>Well, the movie is considered one of the best video game film adaptations of all time, and I agree somewhat. It’s exceptional!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-lowest-rated-video-game-movie-of-all-time">What is the Lowest Rated Video Game Movie of All Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Postal</strong>, the 2007 film by Uwe Boll, is often considered one of the worst video game film adaptations ever made, and yeah, it’s terrible. Starring Zack Ward and Chris Coppola, Postal follows a trailer park resident who helps a cult leader while dealing with terrorist plots. It’s an absolute mess of a film that somehow comes across as offensive in all the worst ways.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pc-gamer%E2%80%99s-headlines-have-been-mostly-excellent.1009479/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/pc-gamer-games-media<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/its-exhausting-trying-to-read-video-game-website-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wrote a piece last year about video game website headlines, and how the quest for SEO prominence and a reliance on "clickbait" was making so many of them borderline unreadable</a>. I think about that story almost every day as I scan the internet for news, because almost every day I am forced to read terrible headlines that are quite frankly exhausting to try to decipher.</p><p>As I hack through my feed like a Victorian-era explorer tripping through a jungle with a blunt machete, there are always exceptions. And a lot of those exceptions come from one website: PC Gamer. So in the interests of balancing out my criticisms, I thought I'd give them a little shout out here.</p><p>While other sites engineer their headlines like the villain of a narrative-based puzzle game, and render the subject matter so opaque you're forced to click through just to find out what the hell they're talking about, lately it seems like PC Gamer's heds have simply gone the other direction, using entire sentences to spell out a story's content with as much detail as possible, clickbait be damned.</p><p>Take some recent headlines:</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/satisfactory-1-0-finally-has-mod-support-and-the-revamped-mod-manager-now-supports-dedicated-servers-too/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satisfactory 1.0 finally has mod support, and the revamped mod manager now supports dedicated servers too</a></strong></p><p>This one would probably have appeared on another site as something like "Steam's Strategy Smash Gets A Big Update", or "Fans Of Steam Game Rejoice At Online Feature News". Here, though, it just...says it all.&nbsp;</p><p>As does this one:</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/former-gta-dev-says-gta-6-has-no-competition-so-wont-release-until-rockstars-100-percent-happy-before-cracking-a-joke-about-the-pc-version-2027-for-you-im-afraid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Former GTA dev says GTA 6 has 'no competition' so won't release until Rockstar's '100% happy', before cracking a joke about the PC version: '2027 for you I'm afraid'</a></strong></p><p>Not sure it's news, to be honest, but I appreciate the clarity on the blog's subject matter regardless. If I <em>had </em>clicked on it, I'd have known exactly what I was getting myself in for.&nbsp;</p><p>A third headline from last week reads:</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/thanks-to-its-all-encompassing-randomizer-mod-deus-ex-has-gotten-a-festive-halloween-update-with-game-modes-and-modifiers-to-turn-it-into-a-survival-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thanks to its all-encompassing Randomizer mod, Deus Ex has gotten a festive Halloween update with game modes and modifiers to turn it into a survival horror game</a></strong></p><p>Again, thank you, I was fully prepared for everything this blog was going to cover, and upon reading it was not disappointed in the slightest.</p><p>For a slightly more recent example, how about this one from Saturday, which reads...uh...:</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/theres-a-future-where-you-and-your-graphics-card-decide-what-a-game-looks-like-not-the-developers/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">There's a future where you and your graphics card decide what a game looks like, not the developers</a></strong></p><p>OK, well...yikes, you can't win 'em all I guess. Look, I said <em>most </em>headlines have been excellent, not <em>all </em>of them. </p><p>I have no idea how this is going for the site's traffic, or why PC Gamer's editorial team decided to buck an industry-wide trend (I contacted them a few times but they never got back to me), but as someone who spends most of his time reading websites instead of writing for them, I just wanted to publicly say how appreciative I am of a website that doesn't treat me like some chud who has to be tricked into reading any of its (quite often very good) blogs.</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong> <strong>6:26pm, October 14</strong>: Some background! PC Gamer's Strategic Director Evan Lahti tells Aftermath:</p><blockquote><p>It's not typically great writing hygiene to make a headline really long, but in most cases it gives us enough room to achieve this kind of conversational voice we've come to enjoy, that lets us get a piece of hard information down and then sarcasm alongside it, or some setup/payoff combination like that. So I guess it's mainly a voice thing, in many of those stories. But from a reader behavior POV longer headlines do occupy more space on some platforms, like Google Discover - obviously they get cut off at a certain character count, but in some cases we think that an ellipsis at the end of a HL can be a source of curiosity, not that we're engineering that or something.</p><p>The other broad thing we think about is the homogeneity of the media environment at large, wanting to find ways to become and remain distinct, not just to our peers in gaming but the internet at large. Everyone's been playing from the same playbook for roughly a decade, as you note the best SEO techniques are known, and any new ones are immediately recognized and dispersed, "SEO voice" absolutely sucks, and in that environment where everyone's chasing that (I'm sure you can relate), you have to have a special sauce.</p><p>It's definitely not a silver bullet or something, we still feel the changes in the the sudden, arbitrary shifts in the algorithmic sea like everyone else, of course. But we're having fun, and clearly you are too, which is great to see.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>It <em>is </em>great!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Bungie and Netease Games have partnered up for Destiny: Rising, a mobile phone based shooter that will be playable in third and first person. To avoid issues with the years of lore that has been built up through Destiny and Destiny 2, Destiny: Rising will be set in an alternate timeline. There will be a Destiny Rising closed alpha taking place as well from November 1st, though it will be limited to North America.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny: Rising Developer Preview | &quot;What is Destiny: Rising?&quot;" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQPomw5UBCU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The alternate timeline is based in a time way before the setting familiar to those who have played the main Destiny Games, with it being set before the Last City has been built. Players will take control of various characters from a roster that will keep growing, but they will not be based on the classes of Hunter, Titan, and Warlock. Instead these characters will have their own abilities. Some of the characters players will get to use include Ikora Rey, Iron Lord Jolder, and Kabr. The main protagonist will be a character called Wolf that players will be able to customise.</p>
<p>The closed alpha for Destiny: Rising will contain both PvE and PvP. PvE modes will include campaign missions,&nbsp; free roam exploration, Haven Ops Strike missions, and raid-like Gauntlet Ops. There are also new modes which are Morgran’s Prey, Legacy, and Realms of the IX, which will be detailed when the closed alpha is launched. The PvP mode will have a Destiny: Rising exclusive mode called Shifting Gates, though again details released later. The recommended specs and devices include:</p>

<ul>
<li><u>Android Devices:</u>&nbsp;Snapdragon 845 or newer</li>
<li><u>iPhone:</u>&nbsp;iPhone 8 or newer</li>
<li><u>iPads:&nbsp;</u></li>
<li>iPad (8th generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2nd generation) or newer</li>

<p>The 2024 PGL Wallachia Season 2 officially ended this weekend, with some of the best teams in Dota 2 competing against each other. The event not only gave fans their fix of competitive Dota action but even had some altercations between players.</p>



<p>So, who won the 2024 PGL Wallachia Season 2 tournament series?</p>



<h2 id="h-2024-pgl-wallachia-season-2-winner">2024 PGL Wallachia Season 2 Winner</h2>



<p>The winner of the PGL Wallachia Season 2 tournament was HEROIC. The team walked away with $300,000 in prizing. The entire prize pool as a whole was $1,000,000.</p>



<p>The event took place in Bucharest, Romania, and featured 16 of the best Dota 2 teams.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-placements">All Placements</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here is the official list of placements for the 2024 PGL Wallachia Season 2 tournament:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>1st:</strong> HEROIC</li>



<li><strong>2nd:</strong> Team Falcons</li>



<li><strong>3rd:</strong> Tundra Esports</li>



<li><strong>4th:</strong> Natus Vincere</li>



<li><strong>5th:</strong> Nouns Esports</li>



<li><strong>6th:</strong> beastcoast</li>

</ul>







<h2 id="h-altercation-between-avulus-and-team-falcons">Altercation Between AVULUS and Team Falcons</h2>



<p>The event did not go as smoothly, though, as some may have thought it would. On October 6, just before Team Falcons and AVULUS were set to compete against each other, players from each team got into an altercation in the hotel lobby.</p>



<p>Team Falcon’s ATF and AVULUS’s SoNNeikO went at it, which resulted in a Level 3 Draft Penalty (110 seconds time lost in draft). This overtly led to AVULUS’s loss, as Team Falcons beat the team 2-0.</p>



<p>Team Falcons then released a statement claiming that SoNNeikO approached ATF in the hotel lobby and threatened him with physical violence. SoNNeikO then came forward claiming that ATF took their interaction the wrong way.</p>



<p>Regardless, the altercation resulted in a penalty that, in the end, hurt AVULUS on the battlefield.</p>
