			<p>I love a good action game. Heck, I love a lot of middling action games so long as they’ve got one or two really cool things about them. The First Berserker: Khazan is definitely not a middling action game though, and has a lot of style along with a lot of substance that makes it a blast to play from start to finish, along with a gorgeous art style and some very edgy but entertaining writing.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Berserker: Khazan | Demo Accolades Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aU6bt8ArKY8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Khazan describes itself as a “hardcore action RPG,” which is a fun way to say that while it definitely evokes the Soulslike subgenre, it’s not quite a Soulslike. I actually really like that it’s not gunning to be a Soulslike, because while the weighty combat and the checkpoint system definitely mean a lot of players will be reminded of ye olde Dark Souls, it’s got a lot more in common with action games in general. It feels a bit more like a slower-paced Nioh, and that’s wonderful.</p>


<p>The main distinction here, for me at least, is that it’s just a little bit more easygoing in terms of difficulty, but also that there’s a lot more loot. Outside of the three main weapon categories, which are dual blades, big old sword, and spear, you’ve then got loads of armour sets to muck around with that have unique stats and properties, as well as set bonuses. It means there are a lot of ways to upgrade Khazan as he marches down the path of revenge and anime.</p>


<p>There are a load of little touches that allow the game to be a little more chilled too. While it’s always challenging, there’s little touches like gaining experience just from hitting bosses, skills unlocking as you play instead of at set points, and also an easy difficulty if you just want to smash things up. It all adds up to make a game that’s not holding your hand, but also isn’t actively trying to shoot you in the foot.</p>
<p>Wrapped around the gameplay is an art style that I absolutely adore. A lot of games go for an anime look using cel shading, but there’s plenty examples where that doesn’t work out. The style of The First Berserker: Khazan, both visually and in terms of the setting and story, means it all feels a lot more cohesive. This is an over-the-top story of revenge and battling through the underworld, and the visuals that render the regions you visit and the beasts and enemies you battle just help sell the whole thing.</p>

<p>The story kicks off in a fun way too – well, not “fun”, but certainly interesting. Khazan is a heroic character, that’s for sure, but he’s been condemned to death. You get to not only uncover why as you play through, but also see Khazan grow into something a bit different as he’s warped by the spirit possessing him and by the world around him. It’s just different enough to actually be worth paying attention too.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The First Berserker: Khazan is a great action game that's not reinventing anything by any means, but is consistently fun to play. The visuals are lovely, the action is a lot of fun thanks to ever-evolving skill trees, and the boss designs are great too. If you're after a Soulslike challenge, it can fit that bill in some ways, but it should also have a broader appeal thanks to the easy mode and more.	</p></div>

			<p>Dungeon &amp; Fighter, or Dungeon Fighter Online, is one of the most played video games of all time, having managed to even surpass massively popular games like League of Legends in terms of gross revenues at times, but it is not a well-known game in the West. Starting with the fighting game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dnf-duel-broken-but-in-a-fun-way/">DNF Duel</a>, Korean developer Neople, however, has decided to try and bring in more people to their franchise with multiple titles set in the Dungeon &amp; Fighter Universe, such as The First Berserker: Khazan, an extremely competent action role-playing heavily inspired by the first few entries in FromSoftware's Souls series and Team NINJA's most recent ARPGs like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/">Nioh series</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin/">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin.</a></p>
<p>As I was told a few months back during <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-interview-discussing-setting-gameplay-pc-features/">Gamescom</a> by game director JunHo Lee, The First Berserker: Khazan has been created as a starting point for newcomers to the Dungeon &amp; Fighter universe, and in this regard, the game does an excellent job making players interested in the harsh world where the MMO is set. The First Berserker: Khazan stars the titular Khazan, once the Great General of the Pell Los Empire who, in the 89th year of the Empire, is accused of treason and exiled to the Stru Mountains to live out his days in shame. The war-hardened veteran, however, is not an easy man to kill, as he manages to survive an avalanche that struck the carriage that was carrying him into exile. A fateful meeting with a crazed spirit called the Blade Phantom completely heals the Great General, whose tendons were severed as punishment for his treason, and grants him the power to exact vengeance on the emperor that exiled him. Power, however, comes at a heavy price, and Khazan will have to help this emissary of Charon restore balance in the universe by banishing the undead back to the Netherworld and finding the reason for this unbalance, all the while furthering his own vengeance. A bloody journey that will eventually turn him into the first Berserker of the Dungeon Fighter Online world.</p>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan's story isn't particularly deep or anything, but it does its job of getting players interested in the Dungeon &amp; Fighter universe rather well, introducing the setting slowly without overpowering newcomers with terms and convoluted concepts. It also does a great job keeping players engaged, with some unexpected twists here and there and multiple endings that provide more information on the events that led to Khazan being branded a traitor and some of the game's central characters. The way the story is delivered, much like the gameplay, is definitely in the Souls series fashion, with some nicely choreographed short cutscenes, environmental storytelling, and dialogues with characters met during missions in The Crevice, the main hub, which is very reminiscent of Demon's Souls' The Nexus. All in all, the story provides a decent backdrop for all the action, of which the game features quite a bit.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250315120822_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Right from the very first mission, it's very clear how The First Berserker: Khazan is a Soulslike through and through. The game ticks all the boxes of the ARPG subgenre spawned by FromSoftware's series; stamina-based combat with light and heavy attacks, dodging and blocking, hard-hitting enemies, and tricky enemy configurations scattered all over a multitude of different locations sporting a few secrets, shortcuts and bonfire-like checkpoints, Lacrima experience points that can be used to level up Khazan's stats but also craft and purchase gear and consumable items and so on. When the game doesn't tick the Souls series boxes, it more closely resembles Team NINJA's Nioh series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a> and Final Fantasy series spin-off Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin with its focus on parrying, enemy stamina depletion and more complex moveset, which is expanded via different skill trees, for a limited number of weapon types that seem more to act as different playable characters with plenty of nuance and depth, rather than weapons with similar movesets and only a few remarkable differences like in FromSoftware's games. Level and world design are also closer to Team NINJA's games rather than FromSoftware's, as the game is comprised of a variety of main and side missions set in linear stages which are accessed via a main hub, and each location is a separate stage with no direct connection to the others. The ability to fight Spirits using Khazan's moveset and the ability to summon a Spirit of Assistance before boss battles, and the Phantom System, which allows Khazan to equip one among many different Phantoms that provide beneficial effects like increased stamina recovery, Spirit regeneration to allow the Great General to use powerful skills more often, have also been clearly lifted from the Nioh series.</p>
<p>Considering how The First Berserker: Khazan doesn't even attempt to try something different in an established gameplay formula, is it a game worth playing? It most definitely is, in my opinion, as I have found the game to be one of the most accomplished recent soulslike, alongside <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/">Lies of P</a>. For starters, Khazan feels very good to control, thanks to amazing animation work and very responsive controls. The three weapon types available - Dual Blades, Greatsword, and Spear - all have some very different movesets and heavily determine how the player should approach combat, and all feel very satisfying to use. The defensive options, which include blocking, evading, and their perfect forms, a parry called Reflection with very strict timing and a Counterattack that can be unleashed when stronger enemies are about to use some powerful attacks, similar to Nioh 2's Burst Counters, not only all have their uses, but synergize well with some passive skills and attributes attached to gear, providing plenty of depth to the combat experience while also giving players a reason to go with gear other than the one providing the highest defense or stat increase.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250317192310_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>All of the offensive and defensive mechanics The First Berserker: Khazan offers wouldn't mean much with bad or average enemy design, but that is not the case here, as the game fully delivers in this regard, sporting a decent amount of regular enemies sporting different movesets and weapons, including plenty of ranged fighters, more powerful enemies that require a bit more effort to take down, Elite enemies that essentially function as mini-bosses, and proper bosses located at the end of each mission. Unsurprisingly, bosses are the stars of the show in The First Berserker: Khazan, coming with memorable visual and combat designs, effective movesets, and multiple phases that require players to always be on their toes to win. Unlike the current tendency FromSoftware has shown in its boss designs, with movesets with absurd range and areas of effect that are extremely unfair, I have found The First Berserker: Khazan's bosses to be quite challenging but also very fair. If you know when to attack and how to properly defend against their varied movesets, fighting bosses will be, for the most part, a frustration-free experience. In addition, every time Khazan dies while attempting to take down any of the bosses, the game not only rewards the player with some Lacrima but also allows the lost experience points to be recovered before entering the boss arena once again, which is a nice touch that reduces the need for grinding for Lacrima, although dying in the game is most often due to having used the wrong strategy, rather than being underleveled.</p>
<p>Even so, if anyone finds The First Berserker: Khazan too difficult but still wants to play through the game to experience the Great General's tale, they can decide to play the game in Easy Mode, which is considerably more approachable than the regular difficulty setting. Once Easy Mode is selected, however, there's no turning back, and some achievements will no longer be unloackable, so think hard before making the jump to the reduced difficult mode the game offers. While not as effective as picking the easier difficulty mode, it is possible to make The First Berserker: Khazan slightly easier by taking full advantage of the gear system. Like in more traditional action role-playing games and the Team NINJA Souls series-inspired games, gear comes in different rarity levels, which determine their stats, and has different random attributes and set bonuses, which not only grant significant advantages but also include skills not available on the regular skill trees. A few hours into the adventure, it becomes possible to increase the level of gear and alter its random attributes, so the game definitely provides everything a player may need to bring difficulty down a bit. Make no mistake, however. As much as the developer says that they didn't want to make a challenging game just for the sake of it, The First Berserker: Khazan is still a challenging game. Perhaps not when fighting the vast majority of mobs, but when fighting bosses, you will probably die a lot as you try to figure out their attack patterns and how best to deal with them using any of the numerous defensive options available.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250319181545_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>With its well-animated cel-shaded character models, detailed environments featuring a rather oppressive atmosphere that well suits the game's story, and all sorts of flashy special effects for even regular combat maneuvers, The First Berserker: Khazan is as great to look at as it is a joy to play. Performance is solid on PC, as the game had no trouble running at high framerates on my machine (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM). Locking the game to my monitor's max refresh rate, 120 Hz, the game had no trouble running at solid 120 FPS most of the time at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode and max setting. A system configuration like mine can even push beyond the 120 FPS cap, as the game ran at an average of 152 FPS, 85 1% low during a benchmark session conducted in the Nadin Quarry stage. These numbers, however, don't tell the whole story, as there's some light traversal stuttering in certain areas, but thankfully it is not major. Before the release of the latest patch during the review period, the game also suffered from some massive shader compilation stutters during boss battles every time the enemy performed a special move for the first time, but the issue seems to have been fixed, as I have not experienced it again after the game was updated.</p>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan is one of those games that gets better and better the more you play it. What in the beginning feels only like another Soulslike becomes a very engaging experience with deep combat, lots of complementary gameplay systems, and a great visual style that make it a game worth playing for all those who are looking for an engaging, combat-focused action role-playing game and are not too bothered by the almost complete lack of innovation. In the 40 or so hours required to complete the main campaign once, I know I wasn't.</p>

				<p>With its excellent combat system, complementary mechanics, solid level and enemy design, and engaging story, The First Berserker: Khazan stands out as one of the best action RPGs in recent years. While its heavy inspiration from FromSoftware and Team NINJA’s latest titles is a little too evident, and PC performance issues occasionally impact the experience, the tale of Great General Khazan is a compelling one that makes for a great game and the perfect introduction to the world of Dungeon Fighter Online.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-steam-player-count<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series of stealth action-adventure games, has launched to the franchise's highest Steam player count of all time.</p>

<p>As spotted by the folks at <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-sets-huge-franchise-record-with-growing-player-count-3168000/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dexerto</a>,&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>' peak player count on Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hit 64,825</a> over the weekend. At time of writing, that's still the game's peak; 43,263 players are currently enjoying&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>, which still isn't bad considering today is a Monday.</p>

<p>That figure puts&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>slightly ahead of Greek epic&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</em>, which managed to achieve a peak player count of 62,069 around the time of its release. There's not much in it, but&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is officially the series' biggest Steam launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-steam-player-count-sneaking.jpg?itok=4STrPyMk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-steam-player-count-sneaking.jpg?itok=kuspaO07 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is officially the franchise's biggest Steam launch.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering how the game stacks up against other Ubisoft releases, it still can't quite hold a candle to the publisher's biggest Steam launches ever, at least not according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/publisher/Ubisoft/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB's numbers</a>.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's biggest Steam launch ever was the crunchy melee brawler&nbsp;<em>For Honor</em>, which achieved an impressive 225,831 peak player count in August 2018. It's followed by&nbsp;<em>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</em>'s peak of 201,933, with&nbsp;<em>The Division</em>'s 114,228 (a very satisfying number) putting it in a comfortable third.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>can't reach those lofty heights, its success will doubtless come as a relief to Ubisoft, given that the game hasn't exactly had an easy time of it in recent months.</p>

<p>Announced last year,&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>was originally set to launch in November, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">subsequently delayed to February</a> as Ubisoft announced it would rethink some of its business practices (including releasing PC games on Steam on day one in future).</p>




<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">then delayed again</a>, with publisher Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">closing down</a> three of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">locations</a>&nbsp;and revealing its intention to pursue <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-cost-cutting-q3" rel="nofollow">further cost-cutting measures</a> after a pretty dire third-quarter performance.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>can single-handedly turn Ubisoft's fortunes around, but the game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> mod that aims to recreate the entirety of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>'s map based on "leaked" data and guesswork is no longer in development, after Rockstar parent company Take-Two had videos of the project banished from Youtube.</p>
<p>Titled Project Vice and <a href="https://x.com/Dark_SpaceYT/status/1902865326804701386">released</a> to the public on 20th March, the playable GTA 6 map mock-up in question is the work of Youtuber Dark Space. In a <a href="https://youtu.be/7LmLfJAuR_U?feature=shared">response video published yesterday</a>, Dark Space says Take-Two sent him a copyright removal request over his Youtube videos of the mod last week. He's now removed all download links to the mod, without any further prompting from Take-Two, and says he's no longer working on the project.</p>
<p>"I spent months building a fan-made GTA 6-inspired map inside GTA 5--something purely made out of passion, not profit," reads the intro to the response video. "But shortly after uploading a video showcasing the project, Take-Two Interactive took it down. No warning. No conversation. Just gone."</p>
<p>Dark Space has since been chatting to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-map-in-gta-5-mod-suffers-inevitable-take-two-takedown-creator-believes-it-was-probably-a-little-too-accurate-and-could-have-ruined-the-surprise">IGN</a> about this reversal, which he says wasn't unexpected (an unsympathetic soul might ask why, given that knowledge, he decided to work on it in the first place). "I expected this would happen based on their past takedowns," he said. "I went into this project knowing it was a possibility, and the fact that it happened does not surprise me." </p>
<p>Take-Two have yet to share their reasoning for the takedown request, so we're left with Dark Space's own explanation for events. The mod forms part of a loose community GTA 6 mapmaking initiative, largely operating out of Reddit, which deploys a bunch of speculation and alleged leaked information to plot out the game's geography. That said, Dark Space claims that "most" of his map is based simply on shots from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-first-trailer-reactions">the first GTA 6 trailer</a> from back in 2023.</p>

<p>"I think my map could have ruined the surprise of their map, which I get," he told Ian Games. "If you spent years building out this amazing game world just to have some YouTuber spoil the experience of the map's shape, size, and vibe... I'd want it removed too."</p>
<p>As for why he's decided to junk the whole thing despite not being commanded to by our insect overlords at Take-Two, Dark Space observed that "well they clearly do not want this project to exist. So it's not just under threat, it's eliminated. There's no point putting more time into something that goes directly against what they're willing to allow."</p>
<p>All of this naturally makes me much more curious about Project Vice. Is this just a corporation's lawyers auto-firing at anything that smells remotely like an infringement, or is the mod, as Dark Space suggests, "a little too accurate" in its portrayal of GTA 6? I mean, it's probably the former, but please don't let my growing deficiency of wonder ruin an <a href="https://x.com/zapactugta6/status/1904151003290566681">emerging conspiracy theory</a>. I've dug up a bunch of screenshots of Project Vice for your eyeballs and insights.</p>

<p>All of this continues Rockstar and Take-Two's rather torrid relationship with the GTA modding scene, which has seen them <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-5-ai-mod-shot-down-by-take-two-even-as-rockstar-relax-policy-on-modding">recruit some modders</a> to work on the series while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-v-and-rdr2-vr-modder-receives-dmca-takedown-from-take-two-interactive">giving others the ole DMCA blunderbuss</a>. It'll be intriguing to see how things change or don't change after the release of GTA 6, given that the game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-may-let-you-modify-its-own-map-using-roblox-style-user-creation-features-claims-report">rumoured to let you modify its own map using Roblox-style features</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not only is the survival crafting game moving to more frequent feature drops, it’s also getting flying mounts and a big boost to its more than  decade-old graphics.

The first of these is Vibrant Visuals, a visual overhaul coming the the Bedrock edition of Minecraft this year on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC. </p><p>The developers say the update adds “thousands of individually crafted elements while preserving what makes Minecraft unique.” Alongside the tweaked appearance, volumetric lighting is the other key feature of Vibrant Visuals. Instead of the world looking flat, the new lighting will bring more depth and also improve reflections. Water shimmers and cast shadows look more stark. It all makes <em>Minecraft</em> look a lot more appealing, especially at sunset. </p><p>Happy Ghasts are another big deal. They’ll be able to carry small groups of players through the world, making survival mode more accessible. Players will find dried ghasts in the netherworld, bring them back to the overworld, re-hydrate them, and then poof: a cute, cloud-like chariot awaits. My kids are going to love it, until they start fighting over them. </p><p>What they won’t be fighting over is the new  Player Locator bar that Mojang also briefly touched on during the event. Announced earlier this month, the new UI feature will make it easier for players to find one another across the map. No more looking around for striking landscape features and going, “I’m kinda, sorta, maybe 100 yards Northeast of the oak tree by the beach.” Instead, players will appear as color-coded blips on a horizontal bar near the bottom of the screen. This one is gonna save me a ton of time. </p><p>As with all of the other features, there no specific release date for this, but all of them should be coming in the next few months. Maybe by then we’ll also hear about any upgrades coming to a Switch 2 version of <em>Minecraft</em>. The <em>Minecraft Movie</em> is also out April 4, just two days after the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As we <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> at The Game Awards 2024, Korean developer Pearl Abyss finally nailed down a release window for Crimson Desert. The game was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> at G-Star 2019, and back then, it was still billed as an MMO that was not too dissimilar from the studio's premiere game, Black Desert. Not long afterward, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a genre change from MMO to single-player open-world action/adventure, albeit still with optional multiplayer support. Back then, the game was still tentatively headed toward a Winter 2021 launch, but in July 2021, Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the project had been indefinitely delayed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert Time of Day Timelapse" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BrtH_Kwto94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Crimson Desert only <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-at-gamescom-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resurfaced</a> at Gamescom 2023 with a gameplay trailer. Multiplayer appears to have been silently cut, but other than that, communication has been constant, and there have even been limited hands-on opportunities at various conventions. At the recent Game Developers Conference 2025 in San Francisco, Pearl Abyss put the spotlight on the game's BlackSpace Engine. According to the team, the proprietary technology can render vast, sprawling, and seamless open worlds with great detail. In the game, Kliff and his fellow Greymanes will traverse a variety of landscapes, including lush forests, medieval-inspired cities, snow-capped mountains, and vast deserts.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert GPU based Cloth and Hair Simulation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HcY56F6o1V0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The simulations running under the hood of the BlackSpace Engine augment the realism of the environments: trees, grass, cloth, and hair are all naturally affected by wind movement. The environments featured in Crimson Desert also support real-time physics and destructibility, not to mention volumetric fog, real-time lighting, detailed atmospheric scattering effects, and dynamic weather. Optionally, ray tracing can further enhance visual realism. The engine also supports highly realistic water effects thanks to the usage of FFT Ocean simulation and Shallow Water simulation, creating realistic waves, currents, and ripples.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert Fluid Simulation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i48sVUmiuuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, the BlackSpace engine also improves combat encounters thanks to the detailed hit reactions and physics-based interactions.&nbsp;Object destruction can vary depending on the force applied, and enemies can dynamically collide with the environment, adding depth to combat. Pearl Abyss has shared several brief videos of the technology. You can find them embedded throughout this article.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, Crimson Desert promises a great variety of traditional content (quests, puzzles, dungeons), 'life' content (cooking, hunting, mining, gathering, fishing, crafting, horse taming), and a fairly complex combat system that combines parrying, blocking, dodging, jumping, and even some wrestling moves. The players will create their own unique combos.</p>

<p>Crimson Desert is slated to launch this Fall on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/Crimson_Desert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a> and Mac, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

                <p>Minecraft is one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#10" data-ref-id="2900-4814">most successful video games ever</a>, but no one should expect Mojang to release a "Minecraft 2" anytime soon, or ever. Ingela Garneij, executive producer on Minecraft Vanilla, was asked recently if the company could ever come out with a straight-up sequel.</p><p>Garneij responded to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mojang-rules-out-minecraft-2-do-you-think-were-going-to-have-an-earth-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>: "Do you think we're going to have an Earth 2? No, no, there's no Minecraft 2."</p><p>This response is no surprise at all, as Mojang and Microsoft have said for years that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-2-not-happening-anytime-soon/1100-6429533/" data-ref-id="1100-6429533">there will not be a Minecraft 2</a>, at least not soon. Mojang CEO Jonas Martensson previously said, "I can't promise forever there'll never be a Minecraft 2, but for the foreseeable future there won't be."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zcZJcXRdw0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5zcZJcXRdw0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Xbox higher-up Matt Booty, meanwhile, said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-2-not-happening-anytime-soon/1100-6429533/" data-ref-id="1100-6429533">sees Minecraft instead as a platform that gets updated over time</a> as opposed to being replaced by a numbered sequel.</p><p>That's also what Garneij said when asked about the future of Minecraft. "We've existed for 15 years. We want to exist at least 15 years more so we actually, Agnes [Larsson, Minecraft Vanilla's game director] and I, we work as a team. We set the vision and strategy for our game for what can we do beyond that," Garneij said.</p><p>Garneij did admit, however, that Minecraft's aging technology base "slows us down" when it comes to development. "So other new games have new engines, and they can run really fast. So I would say the technology and our age [are our biggest challenges]," they said.</p><p>As part of the Minecraft Live event this past weekend, Mojang announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecrafts-vibrant-visuals-update-is-a-massive-step-forward-for-the-14-year-old-game/1100-6530266/" data-ref-id="1100-6530266">Minecraft's Vibrant Visuals update</a> that makes significant changes to the popular game with regards to its visuals.</p><p>In other news, A Minecraft Movie comes to theaters on April 4, starring Jack Black and Jason Momoa.

		<p>Racoon Logic are, quite understandably, out for revenge. Founded by former members of the Journey to the Savage Planet team after Google decided that, nah, games just weren’t their thing and streaming is stupid, they resorted to exact their vengeance by making Revenge of the Savage Planet even bigger, better and indulging in even more excess. Sucks to be us, I guess?</p>
<p><iframe title="Revenge of the Savage Planet Co-op Preview –&nbsp;Goo for two?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nv_vBAA7d2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Call me a 90s gamer all you want, but there’s something special about FMV in games. Revenge of the Savage Planet takes it to RoboCop levels of weirdness, from adverts for what’s basically Huel in binliners, to the introductory video by a VP of the space megacorp Alta Interglobal having just the right amount of bizarre camera framing, zooms and crazy eyes. I love how over the top they go, and look forward to seeing all the barmy creations sprinkled through the full game.</p>


<p>And that strangeness, that sense of silly fun is fed through into the rest of the game as well. Crash landing on another alien world, and stepping out for the first time, your character looks around for you in first person… until they’re shocked into the camera shooting out the back of their head to reveal the third person camera for this sequel. Journey was a first-person game, and while Racoon Logic considered the switch to third-person, it was too close to release. So the sequel gives them the chance to set that right.</p>


<p>One of the first things you’ll notice is just how excessive all of the animations are, almost like they’ve been lifted straight out of some early hand-drawn animated movies. There’s a wonderful cartoonish tone to simply running around the world, kicking your co-op buddy up the butt, knee sliding down slopes, and run-wading through water. It brings a huge amount of expressiveness to the game that goes together with the vibrant and equally imaginative alien worlds you can explore – yup, worlds plural this time, which obviously doesn’t quite work with the title’s singular planet, but let’s not complain too much about that.</p>
<p>Accompanied by your rather sardonic AI EKO, it doesn’t take long before you’ve unlocked a double jump, a blaster, dipped a hand into the orange goop bubbles that give you extra stamina and health, encountered your first goo type, and reach the abandoned space habs of Nu Florida. These were sent to the planet ahead of you, giving you a home base to return to and customise as you adventure through the solar system. Of course, you’ll pop back to visit the 3D printer and spit out some new gear and upgrades, needed to explore new parts of the world and strip back some early limitations.</p>

<p>The opening world of Revenge of the Savage Planet is gorgeous, a green and verdant planet that has lovely blankets of foliage to scamper through. You’ll be using your visor constantly as you reach each area, scanning all of the different flora and fauna that you find. And that fauna is heckin’ strange, including what amounts to just a giant racoon head with tiny legs, and which splat into puddles of green blood and some bulbous eyes when you shoot them. Or there’s the oversized dung beetle like creatures that try to flip their bodies over on you, or diminutive little ball of angry teeth that just want to chase after and explode at your feet. Some creatures will need tricks to defeat –&nbsp;the beetles have weak spots you can shoot to stun them, while green gelatinous cubes can be blasted with water…. or lava – but there’s also a goal to capture animals like it’s Metal Gear Solid V and beam them back to a sanctuary at your home base.</p>
<p>Jumping ahead to a later save file, we got to sample some of the extra abilities and new twists for this game. There’s still a grappling hook, there’s also now a hang-glider and some underwater gear to help you explore, going really nicely with the shift to third person, but the big new hook are the multiple coloured goos that you can squirt out around the world. The first you stumble across – well, slip ‘n’ slide across – is the green slippery goo, which feels like as much of a hindrance as a help, to be honest. You can use it to spray creatures and enemies to make them lose their footing… but then you’ll slip around on it too. It’s a good thing that you’ve got a water hose for some PowerWash Simulator action.</p>
<p>Or do the opposite. You’ll also get a Lava tank to fire out grenades of flaming magma, which is great fun when you manage to nail an arcing shot at a flying enemy, but is even more fun when you discover that green goo is extremely flammable. Just, uh, try not to blast it when you or your buddy is stood in it? Rounding out the options we saw was the Ferro Goo, an electrically conductive and super sticky paint.</p>

<p>All of this is playable in co-op, whether with online multiplayer or local split screen. I’ve already mentioned giving your co-op buddy a hefty boot, an immediate reaction to see if friendly fire is turned on like it’s Halo or something. It’s not, but the goo can have an explosive side effect that does affect your partner (and it’s invariably amusing). There’s a few kinks still to workout with the build we played, things like objective markers only playing on one side of the split screen, and cutscenes also being shrunk to half screen, but hopefully Racoon Logic is working through those ahead of launch in May. Having this possibility is honestly fantastic to see, and no doubt a real technical challenge given the open worlds.</p>
<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet takes that delightfully off-beast tone of Journey to the Savage Planet and ramps everything up a few notches. The shift to third person exudes a toon-like silliness through the character animations, the FMV adverts are a bizarre delight, and blasting creatures as you rampage through the world messing with all kinds of goop promises to add a lot to the Metroidvania-like exploration.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/winkeltje-little-shop-followup-faire-trade-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/winkeltje-the-little-shop-followup-faire-trade-announced-for-2025.1143075/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/winkeltje-little-shop-followup-faire-trade-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cozy shop sim&nbsp;<em>Winkeltje: The Little Shop&nbsp;</em>is getting a followup by the name of&nbsp;<em>Faire Trade</em>, and developer and publisher Sassybot's new game is coming to PC via Steam Early Access sometime later this year.</p>

<p>Sassybot says that while&nbsp;<em>Faire Trade&nbsp;</em>may bear a new name, it will have the "same charm of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/winkeltje-little-shop-10-update-finally-arrives" rel="nofollow">its predecessor</a>", as well as boasting "more depth and customisation options than ever before".</p>

<p>Just like in&nbsp;<em>Winkeltje</em>, you'll be running your own cozy little shop, and you'll grow it from humble beginnings into the lifeblood of a bustling fantasy town with plenty of repeat customers to get to know.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/faire-trade-winkeltje-followup-shop.jpg?itok=Sh5og0-D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/faire-trade-winkeltje-followup-shop.jpg?itok=yICd1HQL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Faire Trade&nbsp;</em>asks you to manage your very own bustling fantasy shop (or perhaps that should be "shoppe").</figcaption></figure><p>Your goal in&nbsp;<em>Faire Trade&nbsp;</em>is to "stay ahead in a shifting economy" by selling everything your customers might need, "from fresh goods to enchanted armor". If you can imagine a less anime-styled&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/recettear-hd-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale</em></a>, then you're probably not a million miles away.</p>

<p>Sassybot is also promising plenty of "eccentric" characters to meet in&nbsp;<em>Faire Trade</em>, each of whom will have their own "secrets" to uncover. You'll get to know them across shifting seasons, which will bring new challenges and new opportunities for your shop.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to create many of the items you're looking to sell, from forging armor yourself through to growing and sourcing your own fresh produce.</p>

<p>Of course, since this is a shop sim, you'll also need to pay attention to your balance sheets; you'll need to hire employees, make sure you're paying them fairly, and "make tough business decisions" in order to ensure the smooth day-to-day running of your store.</p>




<p><em>Faire Trade&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via Steam Early Access sometime later this year. Sadly, we don't have a more specific release date for the game than that, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2526560/Faire_Trade?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam here</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

Battlefield's lead producer, David Sirland, has now reacted to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-dev-reacts-to-games-many-leaks-i-am-not-ok-with-leaks/1100-6530040/" data-ref-id="1100-6530040">many leaks</a> that have come out of the Battlefield Labs test, saying he doesn't plan to discuss specifics of the private test. He added that while fan feedback is appreciated and helpful to DICE, this feedback isn't the sole driver of changes planned for the game's release.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/with_replies" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Posting on social media</a>, Sirland reminded fans that Battlefield Labs "exists for a reason," and that reason is to allow the developers at DICE to refine the experience ahead of launch. Any footage that has leaked out of the tests is not necessarily representative of the game that fans will one day play.</p><p>"This BF may look to play one way, but I assure you it also has many layers you need to play to perceive," Sirland said. "A key reason (outside of making a BF everyone wants to play) to use something like Labs. Allowing us as devs to find the best possible outcome of our designs--together."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1148521242" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

The team is now working on a single-player action-adventure game called Crimson Desert, which uses the same custom Black Desert game engine specifically designed for the first game. Crimson Desert sees you play as Kliff, a mercenary who finds himself repeatedly dragged into conflicts that threaten to plunge the world of Pywel and its people into chaos.</p><p dir="ltr">During the GDC conversation with Pearl Abyss, the studio gave me an under-the-hood look at the Black Desert engine in action, showcasing how it manages to recreate how fire, water, light, wind, and a whole lot more work in the real world.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="643984829" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

high fantasy continent called Pywel. My tour through the open world via a dev kit included examples of cloth and hair reacting to changing wind direction, shadows moving in conjunction to multiple light sources of various intensities, and various degrees of severity when it came to different weather conditions, all of which influenced NPCs and certain elements (like water and wind) to behave in a believable way.</span></p><p dir="ltr">You'll laugh, but the aspect of the walkthrough that impressed me the most was watching a horse get drenched in water. I haven't seen anything like either before in any video game. As I watched protagonist Kliff ride through a stream while on horseback, Pearl Abyss showcased how only the parts of the horse that actually touched the water remained wet after leaving the stream. I've seen plenty of video game characters enter water and leave with their clothes still drenched, but I've never seen a game reflect whether only a horse's hooves got wet, or only the legs--I even saw the horse only get partially submerged, and the game accurately reflected on the horse how drenched they got instead of reverting to a fully-drenched state.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4463511-ss_debaa53e71b6890d00bcc19254c453d997d333b1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463511" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4463511-ss_debaa53e71b6890d00bcc19254c453d997d333b1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463511"></a><figcaption>This is just a remarkably pretty game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4463511-ss_debaa53e71b6890d00bcc19254c453d997d333b1.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Does any of this have anything to do with how fun Crimson Desert will be? Presumably not, and since I didn't get a chance to play the game, I can't speak to what the gameplay feels like--I saw a smidge of combat and exploration in action, though, and both looked pretty cool). But the Black Desert engine is a lot more detailed than Black Desert Online led me to believe, and it feels like Pearl Abyss is really pushing it through its paces for this game to create as immersive an experience as the team can. For those who like to just <em>exist </em>in the world of an RPG and appreciate how even the smallest of details are considered, Crimson Desert might be the game to watch this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Crimson Desert is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC in late 2025. The game sees you play as Kliff, a mercenary who finds himself repeatedly dragged into conflicts that threaten to plunge the world of Pywel and its people into chaos.</p>
