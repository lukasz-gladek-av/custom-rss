		<p>I’ve enjoyed a Welsh break with my family, and while there’s been lots of swimming, paddleboarding and building sandcastles, I’ve got my trusty Switch for a dose of gaming in the quieter moments, though, and so I’ve embarked on Warframe – not least because I’m intrigued by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/13/digital-extremes-drop-more-tennocon-2024-details-for-warframe-fans/">Warframe 1999</a> – and the Switch version holds up really well. It does have me asking the question why we’ve never been able to get a Switch version of Destiny 2, but that’s a question for another day. Besides that, I’ve been playing Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble for a future review.</p>
<p>Tuffcub has been playing Destiny 2. And he finished up his <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">The Final Shape</a> review where you can find out what he thinks about it. Does he like the shape it is? Is it the last one or is this more ‘Final Fantasy’ than it is the end of everything? Find out now!</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> would like to have been playing something, but he isn’t playing something, and this has irked him. So much so that I’ve had to work out that he’s played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/12/demons-mirror-is-like-two-games-for-the-price-of-one-and-it-actually-works/">Demon’s Mirror</a> because he didn’t tell me that.</p>
<p><strong>Nic B</strong> did much better with his gaming, despite having a newborn, and he’s been played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/12/shin-megami-tensei-5-vengeance-review/">Shin Megami Tensai 5 Vengeance</a> for review. I’d take a click and see what he thought of it – will it be enough to get me to rebuy and replay the game?</p>


<p><strong>Aran</strong> has finished his playthrough of SteamWorld Dig, saying, “It was fun!” as well as dipping back into Assassin’s Creed Mirage. He tells us, “I’m still enjoying and wandering around ancient Baghdad, stealing treasure and getting into scraps.”</p>
<p><strong>Nick P</strong> doesn’t entirely understand why he’s spent the week in the WWE 2K24 MyGM mode, while sneaking in a little bit of DBD and Street Fighter 6. If it helps, Nick, I don’t understand either.</p>
<p>More explicable is <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> playing of Rogue Trader,&nbsp;saying, “Inspite of its crashes and slightly frustrating movement it continues to be absolutely phenomenally good, provided you love CRPGs. I imagine it’s quite hard to get on with otherwise.” That’s not been all though, as he’s also played some Dredge, which he loved, as well as some local multiplayer in Rocket League.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/14/tails-of-iron-2-whiskers-of-winter-preview/">Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter</a> for preview, which he did like, and then he gave V-Rising a go which he didn’t really like, “It left me cold – like an undead blood-sucker – so I played more X-Defiant instead.” He continued, “While I was playing that though, I suddenly realised that other than the Splinter Cell lot, I had no frame of reference for the other factions, having never played their games. So, I decided to correct that by playing Far Cry 6, which I am enjoying!”</p>
<p>And to round out his <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/13/best-places-to-visit-final-fantasy-xiv/">prep for Dawntrail</a>,&nbsp;<strong>Reuben</strong> finally caught up on the Main Scenario Quests for Final Fantasy XIV. He says, “I really enjoyed the last dungeon and trial of Endwalker, and I’m now putting all my time into levelling Paladin despite not liking tanking.”</p>

<p>Finishing things off for this week is <strong>Tef</strong>, who played some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/luigis-mansion-2-hd-preview-revisiting-one-of-the-best-3ds-games/">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a> for a preview, dabbled with a touch of Cat Quest 3, and something else that he can’t tell you all about just yet. He’s also been watching things before he lets his subscriptions expire, trying to finish off the most recent season of For All Mankind, and racing through the excellent X-Men ’97.</p>
<p>That’s it from us, what about you? What have you played?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/14/thq-nordic-has-two-secret-games-theyre-taking-to-gamescom-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>THQ Nordic has partially announced the line up of games that they’re taking to Gamescom 2024 in August, with three previously revealed projects and two mysterious unannounced games that they’re teasing us with.</p>
<p>Thos two secret games will be announced during the THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2024 on 2nd August, but will then all will be playable at Gamescom, which runs from 21st to 25th August. They’ll be found in Hall 7.1.</p>


<p>The five games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</li>
<li>Gothic Remake</li>
<li>Titan Quest II</li>
<li>_ _ _ _ _ _ (“Unannounced Game #1” – one word / six letters)</li>
<li>_ _ _ (space) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (space) _ _ _ _ (space) _ _ (space) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (“Unannounced Game #2” – five words / 23 letters)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any guesses? For Unannounced Game #2, I’ve had a look back through THQ Nordic’s back catalogue and The Valiant and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/12/05/the-dwarves-review/">The Dwarves</a> would both fit the letter counts. Unless it’s a brand new property, I’d put money on The Dwarves: Something of Something.</p>

<p>For the rest, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/21/epic-mickey-rebrushed-ps5-xbox-switch/">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a>&nbsp;is a remaster of the 2010 Wii game, directed by the legendary Warren Spector, producer of Wing Commander, Deus Ex, and System Shock. The game follows Mickey as he breaks in to a world of “forgotten things”, concept art and animations for cartoons that never made it to the screen. The levels are loosely a based on locations at the Disneyland theme park, and Mickey will be tormented by Shadow Blot, a creature he created but based on the Phantom Blot, an antagonist to Mickey his original comic strips.</p>
<p><iframe title="Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UrPQ6L1nXlM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Gothic Remake is far more ambitious. This remake of the cult classic fantasy action RPG&nbsp;was greenlit off the back of some canny marketing by THQ Nordic, first commissioning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/14/gothic-remake-playable-teaser-steam-download/">a playable teaser</a> that was made and released in 2019 to show what a Gothic remake might be able to offer, and then gathering what ended up being<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/19/next-gen-gothic-remake-development-unambiguous-feedback/">&nbsp;“unambiguous feedback” from fans</a>. Off the back of this, they founded Alkimia Interactive in Barcelona specifically for the remake, and they’ve been plugging away at it ever since. We’ve had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/11/gothic-remake-old-camp-trailer-in-engine/">occasional check-ins</a> with the game since then, but a first playable public demo is an exciting milestone.</p>
<p>And rounding things out is Titan Quest 2. This was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/11/titan-quest-2-announcement-tugs-on-the-threads-of-fate/">announced during THQ Nordic’s showcase last August</a>, and promises a more tactical approach to the top-down action RPG style. Also giant crabs.</p>

            <p>Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Côté has spoken on the discourse surrounding Assassin's Creed Shadows' co-lead character Yasuke, an African samurai.</p>
<p>When Ubisoft unveiled Assassin's Creed Shadows in May, there was backlash directed at the inclusion of this historical character, with many overly-vocal individuals on the internet affronted by the game's supposed 'wokeness'.</p>
<p>This discussion was amplified when controversial owner of social media platform X Elon Musk joined in. Replying to one user suggesting Ubisoft should delay its release of Shadows "in response to widespread backlash over the game's injection of DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion]", Musk quipped: "DEI kills art."</p>

<p>Of course, this exchange was not missed by the Assassin's Creed team. However, Côté chose not to rise to Musk's post, and instead ignored it.</p>
<p>"That tweet generated emotions, that...the first thing I wanted to do was go back on X - that I had deleted - and just tweet back," Côté told Stephen Totilo's <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File</a>. "And I just took a step back. I have a mindfulness app on my phone. And I did a bit of mindfulness to try to explore the emotions that this tweet created.</p>
<p>"For me, Elon, it's sad, he's just feeding hatred. I had a lot of three word replies that came to mind."</p>
<p>Côté said he knew that replying to Musk at that moment would not help Ubisoft's case. "By attacking someone like Elon... I will not convince people about our point of view as a team," he said, before adding: "Yasuke is very, very grounded in the history of the franchise and how we make our choices."</p>
<p>The Assassin's Creed developer added when the Shadows' team did their initial research, "Yasuke kept surfacing", and soon things clicked into place. "We've got a super-mysterious historical character from which not much is known about. And for us, it was what we want in [Assassin's Creed]," he explained.</p>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>X</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"What Elon says is not the game that we're building," Côté continued. "People will have to play the game for themselves. And if, within the first 11 minutes and 47 seconds, they are not convinced of what we're doing, we can have the discussion."</p>
<p>The developer did not state why this particular moment in the game will be so crucial, simply adding: "I was reviewing the game very recently, and I was like, 'The answer is there!' I just hope and wish that people can keep an open mind about this and see the game for what it is.</p>
<p>"It's an Assassin's Creed game, and I believe the best one we've ever built."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Ubisoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In addition to talking about Yasuke, Côté also revealed Assassin's Creed Infinity - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">series' upcoming video game-adjacent experience</a> described by Ubisoft as an interactive hub - has got itself a new name.</p>
<p>Côté said the next series entry Shadows will launch from the Animus, revealing the hub's new name in the process - the rather apt 'Animus hub'. This hub is where the series' modern day segments will now be accessed from going forward. The studio exec promised we would get more details on this "later", so stay tuned.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-extended-gameplay-reveal-shows-off-its-stealthy-and-not-so-stealthy-styles">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> launches for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 15th November 2024.</p>

            <p>Back in February, Graham <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-with-a-quarter-of-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy">wrote about</a> potential redundancies at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> studio ZA/UM following the cancellation of a standalone expansion to that game, codenamed X7. Now, PC Gamer’s Ted Litchfield has spoken to 12 current and former employees about the circumstances surrounding the cancellation, notably the details of the layoffs, the expansion, and the “humiliation campaign” suffered by writer Argo Tuulik  as apparent retaliation for his participation in last year’s extensive <a href="https://youtu.be/JGIGA8taN-M">People Make Games documentary</a>. You can, and should, read PC Gamer’s report <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/for-a-while-it-seemed-like-miracles-were-possible-and-with-them-redemption-a-follow-up-to-the-legendary-disco-elysium-might-have-been-ready-to-play-within-the-next-yearzaums-devs-loved-it-management-canceled-it-and-laid-off-the-team/">here</a>.</p>

<p>To get you up to speed in as few links as possible. Disco Elysium released on October 15th 2019.<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-review"> Alice Bee liked it</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-offers-a-dark-mirror-to-my-mid-life-crisis">Alec liked it</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysiums-hardcore-mode-is-just-one-way-games-can-meaningfully-explore-poverty">I liked it</a>. Everyone liked it. Nothing bad ever happened again. Then, inexplicably, bad things did start happening. Setting creator and lead ideasman <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-dev-files-lawsuit-against-the-studio-that-allegedly-kicked-him-out">Robert Kurvitz got booted from the studio</a>, other leads followed him, insults were thrown, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fired-disco-elysium-devs-allege-fraud-at-studio-zaum-say-civil-and-criminal-charges-are-on-the-table">fraud was alleged</a>,  things <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zaum-resolves-legal-dispute-with-disco-elysium-producer-kaur-kender">got resolved but also not really.</a> It was such an incredibly messy situation you could make, well, a two-and-a-half hour PMG video out of it.</p>
<p>Some key creative talent from Disco Elysium did remain at the studio however - such as writer and narrative designer Justin Keenan - and more projects were in the works. A full sequel to Disco Elysium was canceled after Kurvitz, Rostov, and Hindpere left the studio, and an unrelated sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG </a>was put on pause in 2023, but has since been cancelled. X7, a standalone expansion to the original DE, was canceled in February. “Nearly a quarter of the studio's staff” were also laid off at this time, including the X7 lead writer Argo Tuulik.</p>
<p>"I felt that a strong resentment developed towards Argo for growing too big for his shoes, so to speak," fellow X7 lead writer Dora Klindžić told PC Gamer. “I got the sense that there was resentment for the fact Argo was getting so much support from fans, while [ZA/UM CEO Ilmar Kompus], Tõnis, and the company weren't.”</p>
<p>"They put Argo through a humiliation campaign,” Klindžić continues. “They made him apologize to people for what he said in the [People Make Games] interview. They undermined his confidence and tried to make him doubt himself. They told him he was incompetent, unqualified, and unfit to lead his own project, demoted him and made him invisible inside the studio."</p>
<p>Klindžić had left their job as an academic physicist and space mission scientist in 2022 to work on the sequel to Disco Elysium. “I felt I had just abandoned my entire life and career only to end up in a studio where the people I had come to work with were fired, and the project I was meant to work on shelved with no reason given."</p>
<p>The X7 project itself could have been released around 2025, although timelines differ with the staff Litchfield spoke to. Again, the original article is well worth your time. I won't bother pointing out the eyeball-scooping irony that the most radical and inspiring mainstream game in recent memory has continued to be surrounded by so much baffling greed and spite, although I suppose I just did. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-trailer-wasnt-rendered-in-real-time/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As rumored ahead of the Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended</a> its big June event with Gears of War: E-Day, the next game from The Coalition.</p>
<p>The debut trailer looked fantastic, but since it aired on the show fans have debated whether it was rendered in real time or not. A spokesperson from The Coalition has now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-trailer-was-done-entirely-in-engine/1100-6524152/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> to Gamespot that the footage was indeed not in real time.</p>
<p><em>The Gears of War: E-Day trailer was made in collaboration across The Coalition, Blur Studios and GNet developed using in-game models, textures and environments--all captured in Unreal Engine 5. It was not captured in real time as some have suggested.</em></p>
<p>Having said that, The Coalition (the first AAA studio to transition to Unreal Engine 5) clarified it has big ambitions for the game's visuals, including ray tracing support for lighting, reflections, and shadows. Studio Technical Director Kate Rayner <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> to Xbox Wire:</p>
<p><em>With the advancements in Unreal Engine 5, the leap in technical capabilities is tremendous. Our ambition is to, once again, set a new standard in technical excellence. We have fully modernized Gears from the ground up, infusing the DNA of Gears with the full capabilities of modern gaming technology. Every character, environment, and animation in Gears of War: E-Day has been completely rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5, allowing us to portray the Gears universe with unprecedented detail and fidelity. The original ‘Mad World’ trailer made a real statement by using in-engine footage. We’re pushing that even further with Unreal Engine 5. Our goal with the announcement trailer was to highlight our commitment to pushing the boundaries of both storytelling and technology in gaming.</em></p>
<p>The Coalition is confident in the prequel not just because of the visuals, either, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-story-will-show-the-coalitions-tech-the-best-creative-director-says-will-be-the-best-f-gears-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promising</a> it will be the best game in the franchise yet. According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-q4-2025-gears-of-war-e-day-before-that-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a>, it might launch next year on PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

        <p>Remake of the 2004 GameCube title sold over 115,000 units in three days</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door topped the Japan charts in May, moving 115,649 units in the three days after its launch on May 23.</p>
<p>It nearly matched the success of the original GameCube title released in 2004, which shifted 138,000 copies at launch, according to the latest data from Famitsu. That said, the remake is also available digitally via the Nintendo eShop, and those sales are not accounted for here.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade was the second-best selling title last month with 46,424 copies sold, followed by new entry Endless Ocean Luminous at 42,847 which launched on May 2.</p>
<p>The charts were dominated by Nintendo in May, with Stellar Blade being the only title not released on Switch. Games such as Ring Fit Adventure and Animal Crossing: New Horizons also returned to the Top 10, sitting alongside other Nintendo titles such as Super Mario Bros Wonder and Princess Peach: Showtime.</p>
<p>Nintendo was also the biggest selling publisher accounting for 48.5% of sales, having generated ¥2.6 billion ($16.5 million) in revenue. This was driven by the success of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door and Endless Ocean Luminous.</p>
<p>Switch remained the best selling format accounting for 79.9% of sales with 769,886 boxed games sold, followed by PS5 at 144,005 accounting for 15%.</p>
<p>As for hardware, Switch remained at the top with its three models selling a combined 192,824 units. Switch sold an additional 193,000 units in May, bringing its lifetime sales to 32.9 million units. Both models of the PS5 sold 89,207 units, once again led by the disc drive version.</p>
<p>Here are the top ten best-selling boxed games for May 2024:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/bloodborne-on-pc-still-isnt-happening-but-its-director-isnt-opposed-to-the-idea/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bloodborne-on-pc-still-isnt-happening-but-its-director-isnt-opposed-to-the-idea<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="412" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Despite it being over nine years since <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-bloodborne/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloodborne</a></em> launched on PlayStation 4, fans have not given up on demanding that Sony port the game to PC. If not Sony, then developer FromSoftware and the game’s director Hidetaka Miyazaki. In fact, Miyazaki was recently pressed on his own feelings on a PC port and while he’s not opposed to the idea, he stopped short of saying if he himself wants it to happen.</p> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hidetaka-miyazaki-knows-for-a-fact-other-fromsoftware-devs-want-a-bloodborne-pc-port-if-i-say-i-want-one-ill-get-in-trouble-but-its-nothing-im-opposed-to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a> recently got to interview Miyazaki about the upcoming <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hands-on-elden-ring-took-me-to-the-shadow-realm-in-its-expansion-and-it-ruled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC</a>, and so it took the opportunity to quiz Miyazaki once more on <em>Bloodborne</em> for PC. In past interviews, Miyazaki has <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hidetaka-miyazaki-responds-to-bloodborne-remake-requests-during-elden-ring-dlc-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refrained from discussing <em>Bloodborne</em> specifically</a> since FromSoftware doesn’t own the IP. But when asked if he personally wants <em>Bloodborne</em> on PC, Miyazaki admitted that other members of FromSoftware are certainly keen on it.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="638" data-current-count="938" data-injectable="true">“I know for a fact these guys want a <em>Bloodborne</em> PC port,” answered Miyazaki, referring to producer Yasuhiro Kitao and interpreter Bobby Simpson. As for his own feelings, Miyazaki remained cagey, explaining he would “get in trouble as well” if he said he wanted it to happen. If Sony were to ever greenlight the port, though, Miyazaki would at least be up for it, saying, “It’s nothing I’m opposed to.” He added he’d love for more people to be able to play and enjoy <em>Bloodborne</em>, especially with it becoming “one of those games of the past that gets lost on older hardware.”</p>
 <p data-characters="623" data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true">It really seems like the only thing preventing a <em>Bloodborne</em> PC port from happening is Sony itself, yet it’s a topic the company has otherwise refused to chime in on. Sony is most certainly aware of the demand for it, though that might be why it doesn’t like talking about it. Any acknowledgment of <em>Bloodborne</em> just invites non-stop comments about a PC port or gets people thinking an announcement is on the way. In 2022, Sony’s official Twitter account <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-tweets-about-bloodborne-then-promptly-deletes-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made a post featuring the <em>Bloodborne</em> box art and subsequently deleted it</a>, possibly because it sparked assumptions that it was teasing a port or remaster.</p>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">More recently, it was revealed pre-orders for the upcoming <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/astro-bot-gets-a-brand-new-mission-in-a-self-titled-adventure-this-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a></em> platformer will include a <em>Bloodborne</em> costume, and a new <em>Bloodborne</em> cameo was added to <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-astros-playroom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro’s Playroom</a></em>. Unsurprisingly, developer Team Asobi confirmed with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-secret-meaning-behind-bloodborne-in-astro-bot-says-creative-director" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> that there’s “no secret meaning” behind these; they’re just part of the wider PlayStation celebrations.</p> <p data-characters="714" data-current-count="1082" data-injectable="false">Personally, it is bizarre that Sony hasn’t ported <em>Bloodborne</em> to PC yet, especially considering it’s been embracing the platform in recent years, with several PlayStation exclusives making the jump. Unfortunately for Sony, it can’t say it won’t ever port <em>Bloodborne</em> because then it’ll just be met with angry comments from fans who will keep demanding it anyway. So, there’s really no winning for Sony unless it ever announces a PC release. In the meantime, the only bit of new <em>Bloodborne</em> content fans can enjoy is the fan-made <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nightmare-kart-the-legally-distinct-gothic-horror-kart-racer-is-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightmare Kart</a></em>, which was meant to be an unofficial <em>Bloodborne</em> kart racer <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/after-warning-from-sony-bloodborne-kart-is-dropping-references-to-the-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">until Sony stepped in</a>, forcing the developer to make it more legally distinct.</p>

            <p>
After the reveal of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-announces-new-astrobot-game">Astro Bot on PlayStation 5</a> at the recent State of Play, Astro's Playroom received an update adding iconic Bloodborne boss Lady Maria and an associated trophy. That's on top of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-bloodborne-on-ps5-but-its-astro-bot-in-disguise">Bloodborne costumes as a pre-order bonus</a> for the new game.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this led to speculation from Bloodborne fans that something was afoot. Alas, it appears that's not the case.
</p>
<p>
"There's no secret meaning," Team Asobi studio head and creative director Nicolas Doucet told Eurogamer. "It's just a celebration of the whole PlayStation history."
</p>

<p>

Doucet discussed further how in Astro Bot the team will focus on cameos from PlayStation characters, instead of the hardware references in Astro's Playroom.
</p>
<p>
"Instead of the hardware we put our attention towards the characters," he said. "And that's why we push these cameos. Before they were quite primitive, but now they feel much richer looking. It's over 150 [cameos], so it's going to go really deep and everybody should have their favourite ones."
</p>
<p>
The Astro's Playroom update, then, appears to be simply hinting at what we can expect to see in Astro Bot.
</p>
<p>
Still, Bloodborne fans are desperate for a re-release of FromSoftware's game, particularly on PC. And, it turns out, creator Hidetaka Miyazaki isn't opposed to the idea either.
</p>
<p>
"I know for a fact these guys want a Bloodborne PC port," Miyazaki told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hidetaka-miyazaki-knows-for-a-fact-other-fromsoftware-devs-want-a-bloodborne-pc-port-if-i-say-i-want-one-ill-get-in-trouble-but-its-nothing-im-opposed-to/">PC Gamer</a>, referring to FromSoftware producer Yasuhiro Kitao and interpreter Bobby Simpson. "If I say I want one, I'll get in trouble as well. But it's nothing I'm opposed to."
</p>
<p>
He continued: "Obviously, as one of the creators of Bloodborne, my personal, pure honest opinion is I'd love more players to be able to enjoy it. Especially as a game that is now coming of age, one of those games of the past that gets lost on older hardware - I think any game like that, it'd be nice to have an opportunity for more players to be able to experience that and relive this relic of the past. So as far as I'm concerned, that's definitely not something I'd be opposed to."
</p>
<p>
This mirrors a previous comment from Miyazaki to Eurogamer, concerning the benefits of newer hardware to give remakes value - especially with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware">possible Bloodborne remake</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Things you weren't able to achieve on previous generations of hardware, ways you weren't able to render specific expressions - [new hardware] sometimes makes it possible," he said.
</p>
<p>
"I think purely from a user perspective, modern hardware also allows more players to appreciate all the games. And so, it ends up being a simple reason, but as a fellow player, I think that accessibility is important. I think that can be the driving force between bringing an old game to a new platform."</p>
<p>It seems the ball is in Sony's court, then, as it owns the rights to Bloodborne - not FromSoftware. That's why a cameo in an Astro Bot game is possible, even if a PC port isn't on the cards.
</p>
<p>
If you want to find Lady Maria for yourself in Astro's Playroom, she can be found in the GPU Jungle. Any excuse to listen to that banger of a song, right?

            <p>The impenetrable wall of crossover fiction known as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iii">Kingdom Hearts</a> has come to Steam. The games have <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/discover/kingdom-hearts">been on Epic Games Store</a> since 2021, so they're not new to PC folk. But this does open them up to players who shy away from Epic's storefront. I use the term "open up" loosely, because Kingdom Hearts is popularly regarded as a tangle of criss-crossing JRPG confuse-o-plots that require diagrams and multiple explainer videos to follow. I don't know if that's true, having never followed Alice down this Buster Sword-shaped rabbit hole, but it is the popular joke. And, looking into Goofy's cold, dead eyes, I find I am afraid to question it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The games are being packaged together in a bundle as "Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece" that will set you back £85, for anyone who wants to take a wild run at the series at full speed. But you can also buy them singly, with the slow and reasonable patience of a true Donald Duck appreciater. Here's the list of games that have come to the store:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts Xero Pre-maxio VII.7: The Bebludgeoning 2.Z</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, I made that last one up. You got me. I just get carried away sometimes, you know how it is. Video games as an art form have long been bastardised by bizarre naming conventions driven by neurotic marketing, but this series really takes the biscuit in terms of opaque numbering, no? Anyway, none of that helps explain what the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> games are about, which is loosely this: Disney characters meet Square Enix characters and go on a loopy, touching adventure. The next entry in the series is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-hearts-4-announced-and-some-think-its-hinting-at-a-star-wars-crossover">teasing the introduction of Star Wars characters</a> too. As a genre, we may call this "mashocore". </p>
<p>Each of the items listed above aren't technically games in themselves but packages of multiple titles. There are about ten games in total, if you buy the whole lot. But to understand exactly what you're getting in each package, it's best to check <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-pc">Squeenix's own post breaking down what's included</a>. Don't worry, they won't make stuff up like I do. At least, I hope not.</p>

        <p>World of Warcraft general manager "excited to explore new opportunities" following departure</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>John Hight has left Blizzard Entertainment after being with the company for over a decade.</p>
<p>Hight, who joined Blizzard in 2011, announced the news on <a href="https://x.com/JHight_Gamer/status/1801330355204722933">social media</a> in which he shared he is "excited to explore new opportunities."</p>
<p>"After 12 incredible years at Blizzard, I've decided to step away and start a new quest," Hight wrote. "It was a tough decision, but I feel like now is as good a time as any: Warcraft is in an amazing position as the universe turns 30. I've been so honoured to serve all of the heroes of Azeroth."</p>
<p>He continued: "As for what's next in my journey, I don't have any specifics to share quite yet, but I am excited to explore new opportunities and challenges in the industry, and continue making great games with talented people."</p>
<p>Hight joined Blizzard as senior producer on World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria. He became executive producer and vice president of the franchise during his tenure, before becoming general manager in November 2021.</p>
<p>He also directed production on Diablo 3 and its Reaper of Souls expansion.</p>
<p>Hight started his career in 1993 as creative director of internal development startup The 3DO Company. He joined Electronic Arts in 1996 as executive producer and director of design before moving to Atari in 2002 in another executive producer role.</p>
<p>In 2005, Hight joined Sony as director of product development, working on God of War 3 and the launch of the PlayStation Network.</p>

UK national treasures Inkle - they who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/80-days">looped the globe in 80 days</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavens-vault">vaulted the heavens</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-highland-song">sang of the highlands</a> - are making a brand new investigation-ma-jig called Miss Mulligatawney's School For Promising Girls, though the presskit notes that this might not be the final title. It's set in a 1920s boarding school, where you can expect "tuition in Latin, Geometry and a wide range of team sports, all within the beautiful setting of our isolated country estate". Also some murders, possibly.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's no trailer yet and there are no screens of the game, but an accompanying brochure hints at a kind of Enid Blyton reworking of Persona, in which you carry out chores by day under the eye of senior prefects, and seek after strange events at night, at peril of being caught by the Matron and her tyrannous owl (disclaimer: owl possibly heraldic in nature). There's mention of a Scriptorium, too, which reminds me of Umberto Eco's The Name Of The Rose - also a tale of investigation after dark. I hope there's a labyrinth. Perhaps the owl can live there.
</p>
<p>
Who are you? Well, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2963890/Miss_Mulligatawneys_School_for_Promising_Girls/">the Steam page</a> notes that "one scholarship place is available to a promising candidate from a lower-class background", which suggests you might spend a fair portion of the dialogue dealing with toffee-nosed snobs, toffee being the preferred means of cleansing aristocratic nostrils back in the roaring twenties. The school building itself used to be a 17th century nunnery, which was "dissolved in disrepute", perhaps because one of the nuns had a child. Her statue yet stands in the school quad, "as a reminder to the girls of all they can achieve". The brochure also describes a "miraculous" rose window in the school's main tower - I'm guessing it's the one in that final slide, there, with somebody falling out of it.

Ugh, this would have been one for Alice B, who has written whole bloody mystery books reminiscent of this, and who deemed Inkle's most recent game, A Highland Song, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-highland-song-review">"a beautiful snapshot of wild places that stumbles a little" but is nonetheless "trip worth taking"</a>. What's Alice B up to these days? We can only speculate.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-port-miyazaki-not-opposed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>FromSoftware's president Hidetaka Miyazaki is not opposed to the release of a Bloodborne PC port, but it seems like the ball is in Sony's court for it to happen, judging from some recent statements.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hidetaka-miyazaki-knows-for-a-fact-other-fromsoftware-devs-want-a-bloodborne-pc-port-if-i-say-i-want-one-ill-get-in-trouble-but-its-nothing-im-opposed-to/">PC Gamer</a> about the PlayStation 4 exclusive action role-playing game developed in conjunction with the now-defunct Sony Japan Studio, Hidetaka Miyazaki revealed that other people at FromSoftware, such as producer Yasuhiro Kitao, would want a PC port. He added that he would get in trouble if he said he wanted it as well, but he is not opposed to it. Elaborating further, he added that, being one of the Bloodborne creators, he would love more players to be able to enjoy it, especially as a game that is now "coming of age" and is stuck on older hardware.</p>
<p>Judging from these statements, it's clear how the release of a Bloodborne PC port almost entirely depends on Sony. In the past few years, we have heard multiple times that either a port, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-playstation-5-remaster-sequel/">remaster, and even a sequel</a> are in the works, and even that<a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-port-remaster-can-be-done-at-any-time-without-from-softwares-support-japan-studio-had-a-working-pc-build/"> Japan Studio had a working PC build</a> at some point, but nothing has been officially announced so far, and the silence on the matter seems to suggest that there is no interest for a port so far. As such, the only way to experience one of the best action role-playing games released by FromSoftware is to play the original PlayStation 4 version, which was enhanced to run at 60 frames per second a while back with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-patch-released/">unofficial patch.</a></p>

            <p>The orcs and goblins of the Greenskins, the sizeable gourmands of the Ogre Kingdoms, and the angry Christmas ornaments of Khorne are the next three factions to get new units, lords, and campaigns as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>’s next DLC. The news comes via official  posts by developer Creative Assembly on both <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1df0wyz/karanak_with_update_51_at_the_end_of_this_month/#lightbox">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://x.com/totalwar/status/1801253295664590915">X</a>.</p>

<p>They’ll be more info on the 26th of June, when senior game director Rich Alridge will be dishing the toenail fungus on the fresh batch of toys. The Reddit post (which is where all the detail is, if your doctor told you to only click one link a day or summin) also says that Kharnak, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-mechanicus-is-getting-a-sequel-and-total-war-warhammer-3-is-getting-a-big-red-dog">the free canine legendary hero for Khorne</a>, will be available at the end of the month. This irritates my soul, because I’m not going to play a Khorne campaign when I know new Khorne goodies are right around the corner, but there you go. And <em>that’s</em> how you find a way to complain about freebies!</p>
<p>As regular readers might know, I’ve been known to dabble in a little Twarhammer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/conquering-total-war-warhammer-3-as-a-pirate-with-a-pathological-aversion-to-ever-touching-grass">here and there</a>. The broccoli-like fact portion of this news dinner is over, and now is the time for some greasy speculation. Welcome 2 greasetown, pals.</p>
<p>For the Ogre Kingdoms, no real contest here. Dataminers recently discovered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1cjqy67/golgfag_animations_found_in_wh3_files/">animations</a>, which they linked to a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1cjeftl/found_a_new_ogre_model_in_the_game_files_it_is/">model</a>, labeled ‘Golfag’. That’ll be <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Golgfag_Maneater">Golfag Maneater</a>, then. A legendary ogre mercenary, so renowned that all other ogre mercenaries took the name ‘Maneaters’ in tribute. Maneaters themselves are some of the most fun and diverse ogres out there, each adorned in the raiments of their individual conquests and adventures. As for units, both <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Yhetee">Yhetees </a>and <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Thundertusk">Thundertusks</a> seem like reasonably safe bets.</p>
<p>As for Khorne and the Greenskins, I’m less certain, although the <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Colossal_Squig">colossal squig</a> is already floating around on Reddit as a ‘want plz’. And yes, I also want, plz. Squig but big?! What more do you need honestly. As it happens, the promise of more Greenskins were the biggest pleasant surprise for me from this announcement. The Warden And The Paunch is a well-loved bit of content, and a personal favourite. You can cook a horrible pizza that gives you melee defence for some reason! While I’m not sure if any of the potential remaining orc lords have quite the same panache as Grom, more green is certainly no bad thing.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-panache-game/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-panache-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox is said to have secured a deal with Panache Digital, the studio from the mastermind behind Assassin's Creed and Prince of Persia: Sands of Time.</p>
<p>That's what reputable leaker 'eXtas1s' <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/xbox-signs-agreement-with-panache-assassins-creeds-creators-studio-for-new-project.124/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> on the eXputer forums. According to the leaker, outlet eXputer has seen "graphical evidence" that Xbox has signed an agreement with Montreal-based Panache Digital Games and its founder Patrice Désilets for a new project. Additional details about this project haven't been shared, but 'eXtas1s' does mention that the project will run in Unreal Engine 5, and going by an insider source from the leaker, the project is targeting a 2026 or 2027 release. Of course, release windows are, more than ever, subject to change.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Panache Digital Games released Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey in 2019. Be sure to read<a href="https://wccftech.com/interview-with-patrice-desilets-on-ancestors-playing-badass-character/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> our 2019 interview </a>with Désilets about the third-person survival game. In 2019, we also <a href="https://wccftech.com/patrice-desilets-interview-ancestors-1666-amsterdam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published an interview</a> with the talented designer about his plans for '1666 Amsterdam'. Whether the new Xbox project is related to this project from Désilets is unknown at this point. We've included a part of that interview below:</p>
<p><em><strong>During your talk you briefly mentioned still wanting to make 1666 Amsterdam. To clarify, is that something you’re actively moving forward on now?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>I dunno...I've been talking about [1666 Amsterdam] since I got the rights back to it. Yeah, I want to make that game. The chances that it's my next one are really, really high. In my head, I started it. I went back to what I designed in 2011 and 2012 and said, what do I want to do? Now it's the game after Ancestors and not Assassin's Creed II. I'm a different person and designer and have a new team, so it's going to change.</em></p>
<p><em>Ancestors is going to be how Panache does games in the future. That's our signature. So...1666 will not be an easy game. Eventually I'll announce it for real. The elevator pitch is really simple -- do you want to play the devil in 1666 Amsterdam by the guy who did Assassin's Creed and Ancestors?</em></p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about this rumored Xbox deal with Panache.</p>

        <p>Private equity firm within group that is considering cash offer for services empire has until June 28 to formally announce</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The potential acquisition of Keywords Studios has been delayed as the company is granted an extension to the period in which its prospective buyer must make its offer.</p>
<p>As reported last month, a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/private-equity-firm-in-talks-to-buy-keywords-studios">private equity firm within the EQT Group is considering a cash offer</a> at £25.50 per share to acquire the games development services firm. In a regulatory notice, Keywords confirmed it has been in advanced discussions with its potential buyer.</p>
<p>EQT was required to make a formal offer, or announce that it would not make an offer, by 5pm on June 15. Keywords has requested an extension to this deadline, and this has been approved by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers.</p>
<p>The private equity firm now has until 5pm on June 28 to state its intentions regarding the acquisition of Keywords Studios. This deadline may be extended further if requested by Keywords, providing the Takeover Panel consents.</p>
<p>Originally a localisation provider, the 26-year-old Keywords Studios has expanded its services over the years via more than 60 acquisitions since January 2014, now offering art, audio, game development, PR, marketing, and more.</p>

<p data-characters="339" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Between the likes of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/castlevania-nocturne-gets-renewed-for-a-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Castlevania</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lets-take-a-closer-look-at-arcane-season-2s-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arcane</a></em>, and upcoming projects like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/among-us-animated-series-gets-a-monstrous-trailer-with-star-studded-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Among Us</em> cartoon</a>, we really are living in a golden age of animated TV shows based on video games. And now we can add fighting game <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-guilty-gear-strive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> </a>to the list as developer Arc System Works has announced its own anime series titled <em>Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers</em>.</p> <p data-characters="680" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">Details are incredibly slim, with <a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggstdr/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the teaser website</a> only showing new artwork of series protagonist Sol Badguy and Sin Kiske, while a mysterious new character looms over them in the background. What we do know is that <em>Guilty Gear</em> creator and character designer Daisuke Ishiwatari is involved, and the show is being made at Sanzigen, a studio that specialises in 3D animation. Sanzigen was also responsible for <a href="https://youtu.be/gp4-n_u-qM0?si=JAZq5k6Z1CeVwafg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this incredible looking one-year anniversary short</a> for <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em>, so <em>Dual Rulers</em> is certainly in safe hands. <em>Strive</em>‘s animation remains one of its best qualities and the thought of an entire TV show with the same level of visual fidelity is very exciting.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="【Official】 GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE- &quot;Find Your One Way&quot; MV 【1st Anniversary】" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gp4-n_u-qM0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="782" data-injectable="true">Fortunately, we won’t have to wait much longer to learn more. Arc System Works will have a panel at this year’s Anime Expo, and has promised to share further details about <em>Dual Rulers</em> on July 4. Ideally, this will include a trailer or at least a plot synopsis. Since<em> Guilty Gear Strive</em>‘s story mode is literally over four hours of non-stop cutscenes, it’s probably safe to assume <em>Dual Rulers</em> isn’t an adaptation and will instead tell an original story.</p>
 <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="true">I’m honestly a bit surprised <em>Guilty Gear</em> has never seen an anime adaptation or even an OVA in its 26-year history. There have been spin-off manga, novels, audio dramas, and comics, so a full anime series was frankly overdue. I’m also curious if <em>Dual Rulers </em>will make a good jumping on point for newcomers who are unfamiliar with <em>Guilty Gear</em>‘s lore or if it’ll be something that only established fans will be able to understand and enjoy.</p>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">Whatever the case, <em>Guilty Gear</em> fans have plenty to look forward to in the near future besides the anime. <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> recently wrapped up its third season pass of DLC with the inclusion of Slayer, but a season four is already confirmed to be in the works too. So, fans should expect a few more playable characters either later this year or in 2025.</p>

			<p>The eagle-eyed folks at Reddit's GameLeaksAndRumours channel have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1dfftlq/unannounced_games_found_in_actors_resume/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> potential release windows for several games, including Clockwork Revolution, Ace Combat 8, and Squadron 42, on an actor's resume.</p>
<p>This is a very busy actor in the gaming space in the last few years, having appeared in some capacity in games like Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint, Enlisted, Crossfire X, Chernobylite, The Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me, Sea of Thieves, Xenoblade Chronicles 3: Future Redeemed, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, War Thunder, Warhaven, Undecember, Ready or Not, PAYDAY 3, Front Mission 1st: Remake, Fallout 76: Atlantic City, Diablo Immortal, Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat, Atomic Heart, Alien: Dark Descent, and Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader. He's also working on upcoming titles like Unicorn Overlord, The Division: Resurgence, World of Warcraft: The War Within, Age of Mythology Retold, The House of the Dead 2 remake, and some sort of expansion for Hearthstone.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, though, the most interesting mentions are for next year's games, starting with inXile's first-person steampunk roleplaying game Clockwork Revolution. The actor plays a 'Smudger /Zealot' in the game, which is listed for a 2025 release. Neither inXile nor Microsoft have ever committed to a release window yet; while the game was notably absent from last week's Xbox Games Showcase, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-is-inxiles-first-person-steampunk-rpg-game-is-still-early-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared</a> at last year's event with actual gameplay rather than a mere trailer. Moreover, rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2024-show-will-be-big-xbox-insider-says-plenty-of-stuff-wasnt-shown-during-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggest</a> Microsoft might have been holding back some games for gamescom. If that's the case, we could be only a couple of months away from an official confirmation that Clockwork Revolution is coming out next year.</p>
<p>The actor's 2025 list also includes Ace Combat 8 from Bandai Namco, where he'll play a 'Cope /Cargo Pilot'. The Japanese publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/ace-combat-7-3-million-copies-sequel-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> in 2021 that they were working on a new installment in the long-running flight action series, though we don't have any other details at the moment.</p>
<p>Another major surprise is 'Star Citizen', where he plays a character named 'Jimmy', listed for a 2025 date. Chances are the actor is referring to Squadron 42 instead, as the single player campaign mode is much more likely to get a full launch next year than the persistent universe mode. As you might remember, Squadron 42 has been feature-complete and in polishing mode <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-feature-complete-polishing-phase-no-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since</a> last October. Then there's a project codenamed Oahu in development at Gearbox. It is unclear whether this is Borderlands 4, though.</p>
<p>The 2025 list is rounded up by Fable 4 from Playground Games, The Dark Pictures Anthology: Directive 8020 from Supermassive Games, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion from Marvelous, 63 Days - Warsaw Uprising from Destructive Creations, <a href="https://wccftech.com/narrative-driven-action-adventure-game-echoes-of-the-end-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Echoes of the End</a> from Myrkur Games, a project codenamed Mayhem from Anshar Studios (Gamedec), and Infinitesimals from Cubit Studios.</p>
<p>Which of these 2025 games (assuming the release windows are eventually confirmed) are you most looking forward to? My vote might go to Clockwork Revolution.</p>

			<p>At the beginning of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance/">Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</a>'s Canon of Vengeance is not particularly different from the regular Canon of Creation story introduced in the game's original release. Soon enough, however, you will get to meet some powerful enemies that cannot be found in the other Canon, powerful enemies that can give you a lot of trouble if unprepared.</p>
<p>Among them are Glasya-Labolas and Naamah of the Qadištu, the mysterious group of demons at the center of the Canon of Vengeance story. Thankfully, taking them down is not too difficult if you have certain demons with the right skills for you.</p>
<h2>How to Beat Glasya-Labolas and Naamah in Shin Megami Tensei V's Canon of Vengeance</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240602135005_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For starters, Glasya-Labolas is weak to Thunder while Naamah to Physical, so make sure to bring demons that can use the Zio family of skills and that can unleash powerful physical attacks. The best strategy is to get rid of Naamah first, as she can charm your party members. To do so quickly, enter the battle with full Magatsuhi, use Omagotoki: Critical, and go all out on her with physical attacks. If you have Ippon-Datara with you, use Beatdown at full HP for the best effect. The Bestial Bite skill works rather well, too, as it is stronger when it deals critical damage, which is guaranteed under the effects of Omagotoki: Critical. In case you are charmed, use the Patra skill to heal the altered condition as quickly as possible. Once Naamah has gone down, dealing with Glasya-Labolas is rather easy. Unleash your Zio skills, keep your health up, and use buffs and debuffs as needed.</p>
<p>As for the demons that can make this <a href="https://atlus.com/smt5v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</a> boss fight much easier, besides the aforementioned Ippon-Datara, you should bring Andras and Shiisaa. The first is resistant to charm, and if it has the Patra skill, you will be able to get a reliable status-condition healer for this fight. The second comes with an innate skill called Guardian Beast that counters with Thunder-elemental attacks when attacked with an element the demon resists or can null. As Glasya-Labolas uses Force attacks, against which Shisaa is resistant, the skill will activate multiple times during the battle, dealing damage with an element against which Glasya Labolas is weak.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/14/tails-of-iron-2-whiskers-of-winter-preview/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s a hard life, being a rat. First off, no one thinks you are cute. Secondly, the bubonic plague is on you. Thirdly, you have a tendency to get embroiled in vicious blood-thirsty wars with rival armies of animals. For an example of the latter, take the first Tails of Iron, which pitted hero Redgi and pals against ferocious bands of fearsome frogs. Now, with the frog menace having taken their last ribbit, it’s the turn of some undead Bats to invade a Ratty Kingdom. Thankfully for Redgi, this is not the southern kingdom that he rules over, instead, it’s the Rats of the North who get brutally murdered by an invading army. And they do, in outstandingly gory fashion, during our hands-on preview with Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c4S1aPj_ip4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those who didn’t have the good fortune of playing through its fantastic forebear, Tails of Iron 2 is best summed up as a 2D Souls-like. The diminutive player character – a bearded and surprisingly cute rat named Arlo – must hack and chop their way through a vast environment, taking on hordes of massive foes. The foes are glorious to behold, painted and animated with arresting hand-drawn visuals. In our preview, we took on what can only be described as an enormous mutant porcupine, as well as a nasty bat warrior who rode a wyvern into battle. They were both utter pests, killing poor Arlo many times before we were able to identify their attack patterns and finally emerge bat-tered (pun absolutely intended) and victorious. The satisfaction this hard-earned triumph earned resulted in quite the squeak of exultation.</p>


<p>Just like its prequel, Tails of Iron 2 doesn’t pull any paws. This is a tough, yet eminently fair, game. Arlo has the same precise skill set as Redgi before him; a nimble roll to dodge unstoppable attacks and a deeply satisfying parry to open foes up to a world of hurt. And Arlo can certainly dish out the punishment, wielding swords, spears, and – our favourite – a particularly devastating axe. The attacks can be dished out with light and heavy swings, as well as a deadly charged strike that, whilst it leaves you vulnerable to counter-attacks, can slice through most minor foes with gleeful abandon. In short, it’s the same tight combat that made Tails of Iron such a critical darling.</p>


<p>There are some neat additions to the formula though. Weapons must be sharpened as they are used, requiring a frantic tap of the button – and the pause of a nail-nibblingly tense animation – before you can resume combat. It’s a heart-in-the-mouth moment as you are left completely vulnerable, demanding deft timing and the offer of an additional level of challenge that will test even the most experienced players. Then there’s the grappling hook, which proves a tantalising tease. Whilst its uses are frustratingly limited in the demo, this tool could well prove a thrilling addition to exploration and combat, giving Arlo an additional level of mobility and the environment he explores the opportunity of greater height and scale.</p>
<p>Also teased is a much deeper hunting experience. Enemies can be hacked up to provide all sorts of goodies to upgrade and customise weapons and armour. Whilst the preview didn’t offer much more than the basics of this mechanic, it could become a fantastic feature to allow players to make their own unique Arlo with accompanying combat style.</p>

<p>In short, Tails of Iron 2 is more of the same, though this time with an arresting Game-of-Thrones-Winter-is-Coming aesthetic. Quite frankly, that’s more than enough to leave us very excited to get our teeth sunk into the full game upon release.</p>

			<p>The brief appearance of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake during the Ubisoft Forward conference certainly made fans happy, since they <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-releases-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got</a> a commitment from the publisher on the release year: 2026.</p>
<p>Following that brief teaser, Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5bpvgE64gxlTtkBULl98XT/first-details-on-the-remake-of-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> more details on the long-awaited game in an interview published on the official blog. The Creative Director and Game Director explained that the project is taking so long partly because other game remakes (likely a reference to Final Fantasy VII, first and foremost) have raised the quality bar.</p>
<p><em><strong>Bio</strong> <strong>Jade</strong> <strong>Adam</strong> </em><em><strong>Granger:</strong></em><em>&nbsp;The landscape of remakes has evolved a lot since the first inception of the remake of Sands of Time. There have been some big players that clearly redefined the bar. We made some big changes to the 3Cs (Character, Camera, Controls), and had to build prototypes to make sure that our new controls still feel good with the old gameplay, and sometimes we need to change them.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Michael McIntyre:</strong> I think combat is a good example. The original combat, for a lot of players today, would feel quite dated. Combat in games like Prince of Persia has advanced a lot in the 21 years since that game, and certain recent games, like Dark Souls and God of War, have really elevated even more casual players' competency in combat. It is an area where modernity really needed to be injected.</em></p>
<p>The developers also said one of the main improvements from the original game's story is that Farah will be more present throughout the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake.</p>
<p><em><strong>Michael McIntyre: </strong>Probably the biggest development that we've done is to make Farah more present. We're able to add more interactions between her and the Prince, so you can get more from their relationship. They will simply spend more time beside each other.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Bio Jade Adam Granger</strong>: One of the things that's very dear to me is modernizing Farah. While she was a great character in the original, I think she lacked agency and depth as a person. So we really make her a true companion; she has reasons to be there, she's a true ally, but also a full-fledged person with a background, wants, needs, desires, and tastes. We really want to revamp her as a great character, even if she's not playable.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Ubisoft Montréal is being <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-dev-team-adds-ubisoft-toronto-far-cry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported </a>by the Toronto studio as well as other studios such as Bucharest, Paris, and Pune. While they wait for this remake, Prince of Persia fans can check out the progress of the roguelike spin-off that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in early access a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>We haven't written much about <em>Ara: History Untold</em>, a new historical turn-based strategy PC game that's been in the works for a few years now. Part of that's because its publisher, Xbox Game Studios, hasn't put much fanfare behind it; it wasn't even mentioned in Microsoft's not-E3 extravaganza last week.</p>
<p>But perhaps both we and Microsoft should be putting more of a spotlight on it, given that it now has a release date: September 24, 2024. The game will be released on Steam and Xbox Game Pass for PC simultaneously.</p>
<p>The date was announced during an Official Xbox Podcast interview (and accompanying <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/12/ara-history-untold-release-date-multiplayer-details/">blog post</a>) with Marc Meyer, president of Oxide Games, the studio developing <em>Ara</em>. The podcast covered more than just the release date, though, with Meyer offering up some new gameplay details—particularly about how multiplayer will work.</p>
<p>But first, here's a quick primer on exactly what Ara is since we haven't covered it previously. Essentially, it's a new spin on the classic PC game <em>Civilization</em>. As in that game, you lead a society from sticks and stones to the modern age. You explore a randomly generated world, build cities, research technologies, manage armies, and conduct diplomacy turn by turn along the way.</p>
<p>The game promises a mix of familiar mechanics and new ones. You can generally assume most of the familiar mechanics will come by way of<em> Civilization</em> or other popular 4x genre titles like <em>Stellaris</em>—things like leaders with different traits and building specific structures within cities, including wonders of the world.
</p><p>In terms of what's different, the game offers a more robust simulation of what the citizens of your society are doing as they trek around the map and react to phenomena like weather or illness. In fact, the game's evolutionary approach to AI was the topic of a dense but compelling if-you-understand-the-concepts talk at the Game Developer's Conference earlier this year.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p><em>Ara</em> also features a sophisticated crafting economy, a non-linear tech tree, and the ability to zoom in and out from a global level to see individual citizens going about their business in the streets and fields.</p>
<h2>New multiplayer gameplay details</h2>
<p>During the podcast, Meyer shared details about how multiplayer will work, and that promises some improvements over <em>Civilization</em> as well. The game runs in the cloud, and is persistently going on whether you're logged in or not. That blurs the lines between the old play-by-email games and live multiplayer. When multiple players are logged in at once, it has a system that allows them to perform most of the tasks for their turns simultaneously. Alternatively, players can just log in, make some moves, log out, and come back to it later, allowing for asynchronous play without much hassle.</p>
<p>Meyers described the simultaneous turns this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>The way that works is you submit your actions, and everyone else in the world submits their actions at the same time, and then they all get resolved together. It's not a situation where if you go first, you get to get the claim; the person who goes second doesn't get the claim. In this model, everyone goes at the same time. So, in multiplayer you really have a fair chance at everything.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also noted that players may optionally cede control to an AI if they decide to stop playing a multiplayer match, allowing other players to finish.</p>
<p>There have been some other challengers to the <em>Civilization</em> throne—Amplitude's <em>Humankind </em>comes to mind—but so far not many have managed to fully compete. With <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/leaked-logo-points-to-imminent-civilization-vii-announcement/"><em>Civilization VII</em></a> also just announced, <em>Ara: History Untold</em> is going to have to stand out. We'll find out just how much it does this September.</p>
<p>Fortunately for <em>Ara</em>, it'll have room on the stage to itself for a while, as <em>Civilization VII</em> isn't expected to launch until next year.</p>

<p>Gamers of a certain age may remember Nintendo's Game &amp; Watch line, which predated the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/game-boy-20th-anniversary/">cartridge-based Game Boy</a> by offering <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/play-tamagotchi-mc-hammer-and-more-lcd-handheld-wonders-in-your-browser/">simple, single-serving LCD games</a> that can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/rare-nintendo-game-watch-unit-fetches-9000-at-auction/">fetch a pretty penny at auction today</a>. But even most ancient gamers probably don't remember Mego's "Time Out" line, which took the internal of Nintendo's early Game &amp; Watch titles and rebranded them for an American audience that hadn't yet heard of the Japanese game maker.
</p><p>Now, the Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) has helped preserve <a href="https://gamehistory.org/mego-time-out-commercial/">the original film of an early Mego Time Out commercial</a>, marking the recovered, digitized video as "what we believe is the first commercial for a Nintendo product in the United States." The 30-second TV spot—which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xVT5i1muxE">now available in a high-quality digital transfer</a> for the first time—provides a fascinating glimpse into how marketers positioned some of Nintendo's earliest games to a public that still needed to be sold on the very idea of portable gaming.</p>
<h2>Imagine an “electronic sport”</h2>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/game2.jpg" data-height="700" data-width="537" alt="A 1980 Mego catalog sells Nintendo's Game &amp;amp; Watch games under the toy company's &quot;Time Out&quot; branding."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/game2.jpg" data-height="700" data-width="537">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> A 1980 Mego catalog sells Nintendo's Game &amp; Watch games under the toy company's "Time Out" branding.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Founded in the 1950s, Mego made a name for itself in the 1970s with licensed movie action figures and <a href="http://www.2xlrobot.com/index.html">early robotic toys like the 2-XL</a> (a childhood favorite of your humble author). In 1980, though, Mego branched out to partner with a brand-new, pre-<em>Donkey Kong</em> Nintendo of America to release rebranded versions of four early Game &amp; Watch titles: <em>Ball</em> (which became Mego's "Toss-Up"), <em>Vermin</em> ("Exterminator"), <em>Fire</em> ("Fireman Fireman"), and <em>Flagman</em> ("Flag Man").</p>
<p>While Mego would go out of business by 1983 (long before <a href="https://megofigures.com/">a 2018 brand revival</a>), in 1980, the company had the pleasure and responsibility of introducing America to Nintendo games for the first time, even if they were being sold under the Mego name. And while home systems like the Atari VCS and Intellivision were already popular with the American public at the time, Mego had to sell the then-new idea of simple black-and-white games you could play away from the living room TV (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microvision">Milton Bradley Microvision</a> notwithstanding).</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4xVT5i1muxE?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>The 1980 Mego spot that introduced Nintendo games to the US, now preserved in high-resolution.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's where a TV spot from Durona Productions came in. If you were watching TV in the early '80s, you might have heard an announcer doing a bad Howard Cosell impression selling the Time Out line as "the new electronic sport," suitable as a pastime for athletes who have been injured jogging or playing tennis or basketball.</p>
<p>The ad also had to introduce even extremely basic gaming functions like "an easy game and a hard game," high score tracking, and the ability to "tell time" (as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/639593-far-out-in-the-uncharted-backwaters-of-the-unfashionable-end">Douglas Adams noted</a>, humans were "so amazingly primitive that they still [thought] digital watches [were] a pretty neat idea"). And the ad made a point of highlighting that the game is "so slim you can play it anywhere," complete with a close-up of the unit fitting in the back pocket of a rollerskater's tight shorts.</p>
<h2>Preserved for all time</h2>
<p>This early Nintendo ad wasn't exactly <a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Home">"lost media"</a> before now; you could find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p49nY1dyq2M">fuzzy</a>, video-taped <a href="http://www.fuzzymemories.tv/m/v/4640/">versions</a> online, including variations that talk up the pocket-sized games as sports "where size and strength won't help." But the Video Game History Foundation has now digitized and archived a much higher quality version of the ad, courtesy of an original film reel discovered in an online auction by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2021/07/collectors-are-as-confused-as-you-are-about-that-1-56m-super-mario-64-sale/">game collector</a> (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/04/the-secret-history-of-super-mario-bros-2/">former game journalist</a>) Chris Kohler. Kohler acquired the rare 16 mm film and provided it to VGHF, which in turn reached out to film restoration experts at <a href="http://www.movettefilm.com/">Movette Film Transfer</a> to help color-correct the faded, 40-plus-year-old print and encode it in full 2K resolution for the first time.
</p><p>This important historical preservation work is as good an excuse as any to remember a time when toy companies were still figuring out how to convince the public that Nintendo's newfangled portable games were something that could fit into their everyday life. As VGHF's Phil Salvador <a href="https://gamehistory.org/mego-time-out-commercial/">writes</a>, "it feels laser-targeted to the on-the-go yuppie generation of the '80s with disposable income to spend on electronic toys. There’s shades of how Nintendo would focus on young, trendy, mobile demographics in their more recent marketing campaigns… but we’ve never seen an ad where someone plays Switch in the hospital."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/akimbot-preview-straight-out-of-the-ps2-era-of-platformers-in-all-the-best-ways<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Old-school Ratchet and Clank would approve, we think. </h2></div><section><p>Nostalgia is one of the most powerful, over-weaponized forces in the video game industry. But it also opens up avenues for cool takes on classic ideas. Hearkening back to PS2-era action platformers, Akimbot already seems like a great example of nostalgia done right. Full of homage to classics from that era like Ratchet and Clank, I had so much fun jumping, shooting, and air-dashing through an early version of Akimbot’s first level.</p><p>As it turns out, action-platformers are French indie studio Evil Raptor’s bread and butter. 2021’s Pumpkin Jack was a cult hit among platforming fans when it hit back in 2020, and if my half-hour demo with Akimbot is any indication, it seems like it’s poised to scratch the same itch with a charming world, responsive platforming controls, interesting character designs, and well-designed levels. I just wish my demo was longer.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Akimbot Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>You’ll play as Exe, a tacit, mysterious robot with some platforming and combat chops. Shipset, your considerably more talkative, floating companion, used to work as an accounting bot who grew tired of his job and broke out, seemingly throwing a grenade behind him and angering all the wrong people. Starting in a spaceship, imprisoned by intergalactic mobsters, our lead duo breaks out after their traveling prison crash-lands on a tropical beach planet.</p><p>This opening cutscene did a great job of setting up both the odd couple-like dynamic between the leads and Akimbot’s overall tone. The quippy and charming cutscenes felt like watching a favorite Saturday morning cartoon that never was. Exe and Shipset continued chatting after I set out, continuing to flesh out the characters. Thankfully, their bickering evolved quickly enough that it never got annoying.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While Akimbot nails the look and aesthetic of the PS2 era, it is undoubtedly a modern game. Gorgeous lighting and particle effects paint the beach planet with ray-traced warm, chill, inviting vibes. From what I could tell, the quality of life is all there too; I didn’t find any of the occasionally frustrating clunkiness that so often keeps platformers from that era from aging well.</p><p>Exe, meanwhile, controls like a dream. He deftly jumped from platform to platform, with movement options that felt immediately natural to me as a big fan of 3D platformers. I had so much fun just messing around with his moveset – like the double jump and air dash he’s got from the get go – as I learned how to make the most of a jump. His air dash ends with a little extra air time and height, and once I figured out how to perfectly time my second jump at the apex of that dash, I started really cooking with Exe’s moveset. Soon, I was clearing multiple platforms at a time with relative ease.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Even his melee abilities give some extra oomph to his movement. While using his slashing melee attack on the ground is satisfying enough in its own right, doing it midair lets him perform a spinning, rising attack that adds yet another means of catching some extra height. The movement was far and away my favorite and the most exciting part of Akimbot. In fact, based on what I’ve played so far, I have a feeling Evil Raptor is going to really stretch what’s possible with Exe’s moveset as the game progresses. Even in Akimbot’s first level, which is pretty easy by most standards, I found ways to have fun and push my own abilities. To me, that’s the hallmark of a good 3D platformer.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The movement was far and away my favorite and the most exciting part of Akimbot.</p></div><p>Don’t get me wrong, though, the shooting also feels really good. Once you get a hang of Exe’s movement, Akimbot presents you with a choice between four different guns. I went with the all-around option: a pair of semi-automatic pistols that crack with just the right amount of punch as their bullets connected with my mechanical foes. I also picked up a more traditional machine gun along the way, which also felt great as I dispatched far-off foes during an on-rails sequence. I also found options to upgrade and level up each of these special starting weapons. I didn’t get to dive too deep into that, unfortunately, but it’s nice to see that there’s going to be some tangible progression for each gun.</p><p>Akimbot’s movement and shooting both get high marks based on the demo I played. Now we just need to see what Evil Raptor manages to accomplish with the moveset it’s created. But if the first level is any indication, Akimbot’s sure to be a hit with 3D platforming fans.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To start, you’ll choose from various scenarios which will determine the map setup. Similar to the beloved open-world RPGs by Bethesda, tabletop players will uncover the map, build upon numerous skills, fight irradiated enemies, interact with different factions, and complete quests, all while battling for influence over the Wasteland. Very immersive and detail-oriented, this game is great for long-term sessions. </p><h2 id="slay">Slay the Spire</h2><div id="202036"><p><h3>Slay the Spire: The Board Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Players</strong>: 1-4</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 12+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 45 minutes</li></ul><p>Probably the one video game on this list most deserving of a board game tie-in, Slay the Spire takes after its digital roots by having players take on the role of one of the provided heroes and go on a Roguelike <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck-building</a> climb through the Spire. Like the video game, players will choose from a number of different rooms each with their own characteristics that will affect their game; encounters, where you’ll fight regular enemies, elites, where you’ll fight even stronger ones, events, campfires, treasure, the merchant, and finally the boss. By the nature of Roguelikes, Slay the Spire is sure to give players hours of enjoyment as they try different characters, builds, and items each time.</p><h2 id="blood">Bloodborne</h2><div id="202037"><p><h3>Bloodborne: The Board Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Players</strong>: 2-4</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 14+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 60-90 minutes</li></ul><p>The Bloodborne board game sees players take on the role of Hunter as they fight to vanquish the evil stirring within Yharnam. As a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign board game</a>, Bloodborne offers players endless replay value, as no two sessions should be too alike with its modular map tiles. Featuring hundreds of various cards, tokens, and game pieces, this macabre adventure will test players’ skill and decision making as they uncover the secret to the unyielding plague and fight to stop it. Immersion is at the forefront here, and the game’s highly detailed miniatures ensure that you truly feel in their shoes. </p><h2 id="resident">Resident Evil 2</h2><div id="202038"><p><h3>Resident Evil 2: The Board Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Players</strong>: 1-4</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 12+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 90-120 minutes</li></ul><p>The success of the Resident Evil 2 tabletop adaptation paved the way for Steamforged Games to create similar experiences covering both the original Resident Evil and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis’ stories. However, much like the video games, Resident Evil 2 is arguably its best entry. Faithful to the source material, the game has players work <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperatively</a> as they take control of either Leon S. Kennedy or Claire Redfield as they fight their way through hordes of zombies to make their escape in multiple available scenarios. Collect weapons, healing items, and keys as you navigate the environment, evade the undead, and solve puzzles. You can even use the iconic ink ribbons and typewriters to affect your sessions!</p><h2 id="pac">PAC-MAN</h2><div id="202039"><p><h3>Pac-Man: The Board Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Players</strong>: 2-5</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 10+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 30 minutes</li></ul><p>From Buffalo Games, the arcade classic makes its triumphant tabletop return. Enjoyed in both cooperative or competitive modes, the player in control of Pac-Man aims to navigate the maze, chow down on pellets, and collect fruit while the players controlling the ghosts do their best to avoid or catch Pac-Man. Played on four metal tiles that make up the game board, it requires some initial assembly and setup, but repeat games are quick and easy to get started. The electronic Pac-Man figure even makes his iconic “waka waka” sound!</p><h2 id="tetris">Tetris</h2><div id="202040"><p><h3>Tetris Board Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Players</strong>: 2-4</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 8+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 20-30 minutes</li></ul><p>Also made by Buffalo Games, Tetris is a competitive head-to-head game where players maneuver, rotate, and drop their tetriminos to get the highest score. Just like the video game, the next up piece is on full display, represented by a card, so players can plan their strategy accordingly. You earn points by completing lines, matching pieces to symbols on their tower, and completing specific achievements. Quick setup and play time makes this a great pick for parties and younger players. </p><h2 id="dark">Dark Souls: The Board Game - Tomb of Giants</h2><div id="202041"><p><h3>Dark Souls The Board Game: Tomb of Giants</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Players</strong>: 1-3</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 14+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 90-120 minutes</li></ul><p>Originally envisioned as content for the original Dark Souls board game Kickstarter campaign, the Tomb of Giants core set is a standalone adventure that’s great for newer players, and got its namesake from the infamous location familiar to players of the video games. Each player starts the game by choosing a class and gear, then starts navigating the catacombs, taking on skeleton archers, or resting at the bonfire. Actions are limited, so choose wisely. This game is very faithful to its source material, with its punishing combat and RPG elements that shine from the level up system. Tomb of Giants also features new playable characters and over a hundred new cards, all compatible with existing Dark Souls board game products. </p><h2 id="cup">Cuphead: Fast-Rolling Dice Game</h2><div id="159028"><p><h3>Cuphead: Fast Rolling Dice Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Players</strong>: 1-4</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 8+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 30-45 minutes</li></ul><p>Much like its digital counterpart, Cuphead: Fast Rolling Dice Game is an extremely fast-paced cooperative game where the object is to take out all the bosses using dice-heavy mechanics to deal damage. Setup is a breeze, as the structure of the boss deck never changes. The game begins with each player picking one of the four available characters: Cuphead, Mugman, Ms. Chalice, or Elder Kettle, and is then played through multiple rounds consisting of five phases, where players will set up their attacks and take on the boss. Rounds are timed, so pick your dice rolls carefully! Cuphead sports high replay value in that you can reup to beat your score and upgrade your abilities that carry over to future runs. See our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cuphead-fast-rolling-dice-game-review">Cuphead: Fast Rolling Dice Game review</a> for more info.</p><h2 id="oregon">The Oregon Trail</h2><div id="202042"><p><h3>The Oregon Trail Card Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Players</strong>: 2-6</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 12+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 30-45 minutes</li></ul><p>Dying of dysentery has never been so fun. In this quick to setup and play card game, players work together to make it to Oregon without perishing. Sessions are relatively quick, as you will die hard and fast from the various Calamity cards waiting to spell your doom. Oddly challenging and very luck based, you win by making it to the end of the Trail by playing fifty trail cards. One downside is that if a player dies on the first turn (which is more common than you’d think), they have to sit out that entire session until the party either wins or all die. Regardless, it’s a great recreation of the source material and is sure to steal a few laughs.</p><p>For deeper dives into specific board games, check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aeons-end-board-game-buying-guide">Aeon's End buying guide</a>, as well as our surprisingly huge <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/carcassonne-board-game-buying-guide">buing guide for Carcassonne</a>, one of the earlier board games to bring serious gaming depth to the populace.</p><p><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance commerce writer for IGN.

Others were tweaked to make their performance more consistent, such as the Eagle 110mm rocket pod stratagem. </p><p>The update also makes the supply lines that connect worlds visible on the galactic map, allowing players to see where an invading faction is launching an attack from. Super Samples have also been made available during ‘extreme’ difficulty 6 missions, which will give players who are uncomfortable playing at higher difficulties the opportunity to upgrade ship modules using the resource.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Extreme weather events have also been adjusted on some planets, making fog less dense, and the paths of fire tornados more random, which will hopefully prevent them from transforming extraction points into a burning hellscape. Artificial lighting surrounding human outposts has also been adjusted to make it less distracting to the player, who also now has the option of hiding in large patches of vegetation to make themselves less visible to enemy patrols. On that note, patrol spawning has been rolled back to how it worked prior to patch 01.000.300 following feedback from the community. </p><p>Invite only lobbies have also been introduced, alongside a slew of fixes that address UI issues, crashes, and gameplay bugs, including one that allowed players to throw an infinite number of grenades by pressing the quick grenade button after closing the stratagem select menu. The devs have also remedied a bug that allowed the shuttle to take damage during extraction at the end of a game.</p><p>Arrowhead's mysterious game master - known only as Joel - recently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2s-latest-major-order-presents-players-with-a-moral-dilemma-save-sick-kids-or-unlock-a-new-stratagem?_gl=1*u16d6*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTE5MzQ0Nzc1My4xNzE4Mjg0MTAx*_ga_736S6FVMCL*MTcxODI4NDEwMC4xLjAuMTcxODI4NDEwMC4wLjAuMA..">handed down a new major order to Helldivers 2 players on the behalf of Super Earth that came with a serious moral dilemma</a>. Players have been given the choice of saving the world of Marfark, which would unlock the MD-17 Anti-Tank stratagem, or of protecting the planet Vernen Wells, which would net them zero stratagems but would ensure the safety of the digital civilian survivors that are trapped inside a childrens hospital. With two days left to go, it would seem that the overwhelming majority of players have opted to save the children, with Vernen Wells currently sitting on a 41 percent liberation rating, relative to Marfark's 0.14 percent.</p><p>This week has also seen the release of the new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-reveals-jungle-themed-premium-warbond-viper-commandos-heres-what-to-expect?_gl=1*lee4bm*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTE5MzQ0Nzc1My4xNzE4Mjg0MTAx*_ga_736S6FVMCL*MTcxODI4NDEwMC4xLjEuMTcxODI4NDM2Ny4wLjAuMA..">jungle-themed Viper Commandos premium warbond</a>, which adds new armor and weapons to Helldivers 2, while also introducing the first cosmetic skins that can be used to customise hellpods, exosuits, and extraction shuttles. Arrowhead recently announced that it had chosen to "focus on quality over quantity" when it comes to upcoming warbonds, opting to slow its release cadence in order to ensure more time to polish designs prior to release.</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4150709804553746157?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a> below for a full list of all the changes introduced in the new update.</p><h2><strong>Helldivers 2 update 01.000.400 patch notes in full:</strong></h2><h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2><p>For this patch, some of the major areas of interest are</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Visible Supply Lines &amp; Attack Origins in the Galactic War.</li><li>Stratagem, weapon, planet, and enemy balancing updates.</li><li>Various crash fixes, stability improvements, and other updates.</li><li>Invite-only lobby creation.<br>The right most option in the Lobby settings. Currently only localized in English. Additional languages coming in the next patch</li></ul><h2><strong>Balancing</strong></h2><p>Goal with stratagem balance changes this patch:</p><p>With these balance changes we wanted to buff up some of the weaker stratagems to make them more viable and add more possibility for variety in the loadouts. We also changed a few to make them more consistent, but the goal was to keep a similar or higher power level.</p><p>We are looking into the stratagems more to see if there are any other stratagems that might need some buffs or changes to make them more viable. We also want to be better at explaining what our goals are with the changes, please see the linked blog post for more information.</p><p>A/MLS-4X Rocket Sentry</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Decreased spread</li><li>Prioritize larger targets</li><li>Increased target distance from 75 to 100m</li><li>Decreased Rockets per salvo 2 to 1 (to get a better ammo economy)</li><li>Increased explosion radius from 1m to 4m</li><li>Decreased explosion armor penetration (Explosion can no longer damage heavy armored enemies.

Almost all of them will improve the recoil and only a two have been made worse (and only by 10%).</li></ul><p>See the blogpost for a more detailed description.</p><h2><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2><p>General</p><p>Removed operation modifier AA-Defenses: Reducing the stratagem slots by 1</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>We want to look over the operation modifiers in the future. Right now there are too few of them which become repetitive and the ones we have do not create variety or promote different playstyles. For now, we removed this one because it only encourages the players to bring the best stratagems and does not promote variety</li></ul><p>Disabled the Retrieve Essential Personnel defend event mission for the time being</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>This is to give the mission the proper attention and care that it deserves as it is now deemed not fun enough or performing as we want it to.</li></ul><p>Super Samples</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Super samples now spawn on difficulty 6. The reason for this change is that we feel that their existence only on difficulty 7+ forced some players to play the game on a harder difficulty than they wanted to comfortably play on. We do however still want a gating of them but a less punishing one.</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>The SEAF Artillery stratagem is no longer blocked by stratagem jammers or Ion Storms, and is available after the mission timer ends and the destroyer leaves close orbit.</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>Enemies in melee range of the gates in the Evacuate High-Value Assets mission will now attack it more consistently.</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added the ability to chat from in-game menus and mission loading screen.</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>Updated some first person crosshairs to improve readability.</li></ul><p>Social</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Invite-Only lobbies are now supported</li></ul><p>Armors</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>New armor passive Peak Physique (+50% melee damage, +30% weapon ergonomics)</li></ul><p>Planets &amp; Hazards</p><p>Spike Plant</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The spike plant that appears on certain planets has been reworked.</li><li>No longer causes bleed or stamina drain if hit by the plant explosion or spikes.</li><li>Now “pops” three times sending spikes everywhere, dealing increased damage.</li></ul><p>Fire Tornados</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fire tornados have had their behavior changed, they should no longer feel like they actively respond to player movement, and should move more randomly.</li><li>While a fire tornado storm takes place, enemy vision is reduced. Player vision is unaffected.</li></ul><p>*Fire tornados being more random should result in more variance in situations players find themselves in. Tornados are significantly less likely to pile up and overlap on extraction points or objectives, and will generally be a bit easier to deal with.</p><p>Tremors</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Tremors have had their spawning tweaked to be slightly more random.</li><li>Tremors have had their epicenter size and effect range increased.</li></ul><p>*These changes should result in more situations where enemies away from the player get stunned, as well as reducing how consistently the player has a tremor occur next to them.</p><p>Ion Storms</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added additional VFX for Ion Storms.</li></ul><p>Visibility</p><p>A lot of planets have had their fog amounts tweaked to be a bit less harsh and dense, to provide less fatigue from constantly fighting on planets with bad visibility. We still intend there to be foggy planets with worse visibility, but the balance was a bit off.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Desert planets such as Erata Prime, Chort Bay, Hellmire, and similar.</li><li>Highlands planets such as Varylia 5, Matar Bay, Oshaune, and similar.</li><li>Artificial light sources have had their intensity rebalanced and reduced across the board to fix situations of lights completely blinding the player.</li></ul><p>Unexploded Hellbomb</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The unexploded malfunctioning hellbombs that can sometimes be found on planets will now explode immediately if hit with strong explosions or heavy weaponry. They will still have the same delay if hit by small arms fire or weaker attacks.</li></ul><p>Vegetation</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Vegetation that’s large enough to slow the player now has an extra function. When inside the vegetation helldivers will be harder to detect, reducing their detection range by enemies. This effect stacks with other detection reducing effects such as nighttime, being crouched or prone, or things such as the scout armor passive.</li></ul><p>Enemies</p><p>Acid Effect</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The acid effect applied by hunters, bug mines, etc. now allows you to sprint while under the effect and slows you by 30% instead of 50%. Duration has been increased from 3 to 4 seconds. These changes are intended to make it less punishing for players to be slowed while fighting the Terminids, This allows us to use it in more places without making the experience very punishing, for example the Bile Spewers.</li></ul><p>Armored enemy balance</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>We have toned down the amount of heavily armored enemies like Bile Titans, Chargers on higher difficulties and instead spawn more hordes of smaller enemies, the difference should be quite noticeable and the amount should be at least 30% less than before during bug breaches. We have also toned down slightly how many Hulks that spawn for the Automatons. Our intent is to ease up on the demand of anti-tank weapons and by having more of the other enemies give a better incentive for the group to bring stratagems and weapons that take care of hordes.</li></ul><p>Patrols</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Patrol spawning is now back to how it worked before patch 01.000.300 with some slight tweaks so that the levels are less empty if you are far away from important locations with enemy presence.</li></ul><p>Stunning</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Medium and large sized enemies now don't get stunned as easily. This will not affect the stratagems that stun, and will mostly just affect how easily the Pummeler can stun larger enemies</li></ul><p>Terminids</p><p>Bile Spewer and Nursing Spewer</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spewers will now get slowed if they lose their legs.</li><li>Spewer puke now applies the acid effect.</li><li>Spewer puke now can only damage helldivers up to 4 times per second and the helldiver cannot take damage multiple times from the same projectile. This should reduce instances where you are instantly killed by it.</li></ul><p>Bile Titan</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Bile Titan’s head is slightly less durable against weaker anti-tank weapons. It's not a large change, and will mostly matter for weapons like the railgun.</li><li>The Bile Titan’s puke can now only damage the helldiver 4 times per second and the helldiver cannot take damage multiple times from the same projectile. The damage is still very deadly so running through their puke is not recommended. Their puke now also has a bigger spread.</li></ul><p>Charger Behemoth</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Charger Behemoth is now joining the battle on higher difficulties, it can now also take more damage than before. This enables us to spawn fewer chargers but still retain the difficulty.</li></ul><p>Chargers</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Will now only show bleedout effects from the body if the bleedout state has started. It can still show bleedout effects from the mouth without having started the bleedout state.</li></ul><p>Automatons</p><p>Hulk Scorcher</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Hulk’s flamethrower now does less damage and cannot damage helldivers more than 4 times per second. In addition, the helldiver cannot be damaged multiple times by the same flame projectile. This should reduce instances where you are instantly killed by it.</li></ul><p>Automaton Tanks</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Tank armor value on the front has been lowered to be the same as the non-vent sections on the rear of the tank. The intent was initially that it was supposed to be more armored in the front, but the visual language did not show that.</li><li>The vents on the back of the Tanks turret still has the same armor value as before, but will check for explosion directions correctly now.</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>The damage of exploding automaton jump packs has been decreased by 50%, it will still set you on fire though.</li></ul><h2><strong>Galactic War</strong></h2><p>Introducing Supply Lines &amp; Origin of Attacks</p><p>Supply lines were previously not shown on the Galactic War map to reduce clutter and improve readability. However based on the feedback from our community we have made an implementation showing them on the map. This solution tries to maintain the general readability while still exposing the system to players in game.</p><p>You will now also be able to see which planet an attack is originating from, potentially allowing for the community to stop the attack at its source. We have also updated visuals in the sector and planet info pop-ups.</p><h2><strong>Fixes</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>The FAF-14 Spear targeting has been reworked and should now function much better. However it has lost the ability to target Automaton Spawners, this is not intended and will be fixed in the future.</li></ul><p>Intense Heat and Extreme Cold environmental modifiers will now affect the Quasar Cannon’s reload speed and will show correctly in the HUD.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reload speed on Cold planets -2.5 sec</li><li>Reload speed on Hot planets +2.5 sec</li><li>The radar pulse that detects enemies on the mini-map is now visible.</li><li>Most of Automatons weapons have now gotten tighter limits to how much the projectile they shoot can deviate from its weapons muzzle angle. What this means is that situations where devastators shoot sideways and similar should be fixed.</li><li>The weapons of the Exosuits are now allowed small adjustments in the angle they fire their projectiles versus their muzzle angle. This should make their weapons more accurate.</li><li>Ballistic shield now collides with grenades.</li><li>The unblock button should no longer disappear from the social menu.</li><li>Blocked players can no longer join the blockers lobby through recent players.</li><li>Fixed a bug where enemies killed, missions played, and missions completed stats would not be properly displayed in armory.<br>
</li><li>Fixed issue where the player can throw an unlimited amount of grenades by pressing the "Quick grenade" button right after closing the Stratagem menu.</li><li>Helldiver now also switches to the last active weapon when out of grenades, fixing the issue where they would be holding a stratagem ball without the stratagem menu being open.</li><li>Fixed some text overlap in various locations.</li><li>The burning effect applied to the player when a combat walker dies is now a normal burn. The intent is that you should be able to escape it alive. But you will be on fire so hit the ground!</li><li>The extraction shuttle can no longer take damage preventing extraction. New high grade materials directly from Super Earth R&amp;D have been utilized.</li><li>On PC you can now navigate the super credits menu with “WASD” keys</li><li>Fixed an issue where sample count in missions were incorrectly displayed</li><li>Levels no longer generate with blocked areas preventing player progression.</li><li>Your Ships bridge is no longer cast in perpetual shadow.</li><li>Reduced situations where blue stratagems would bounce when placed next to the detector tower.</li><li>The warbond menu now displays correct emote &amp; victory poses in the thumbnail.</li><li>War Medals cap is now displayed in the UI.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the Helldivers armor could appear invisible for other players.</li><li>Refined player reporting UI.</li><li>Fixed issue where Helldivers could be launched into the air if close to a Bile Titan or Factory Strider corpse.</li><li>Fix for Factory Strider sometimes spawned an extra model after being destroyed.</li><li>Reduced situations where helldivers could spontaneously die while walking into seemingly walkable valleys on some planets.</li><li>Fixed rare issue on arctic planets where players could spontaneously die close to large bodies of water.</li><li>Fixed Pelican-1 sometimes leaving immediately after any player gets onboard.</li><li>Fixed bug where helldiver could get stuck in grenade idle state after throwing grenades</li><li>Fix Superior Packing Methodology not working for other peers.</li><li>Recent Players list will now include hot-joining players.</li><li>Relaxed disconnection policy for PC users.</li><li>Fixed an issue where previous sessions' player names might not be saved correctly when restarting.</li><li>Defend event attack origin now visualized when hovering the planet with the defend event or the attack origin planet.</li><li>Implemented outlines for previously poorly readable texts.</li></ul><p>Crash Fixes</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>General crash fixes.</li><li>Fix for a crash that could occur when applying wounds to multiple enemies.</li><li>PlayStation Only: Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause a crash when switching between Quality and Performance mode.</li><li>Fix for a crash when a player leaves after all their railguns have exploded.</li><li>Fix for crash that could occur when rejoining a previous session</li><li>Fix for crash that occurred when trying to throw a snowball in ADS mode</li><li>Fix for potential crash when loadout is aborted during hotjoin.</li><li>Fix for rare crash linked to leaving a session while aiming a weapon.</li></ul><h2><strong>Known Issues</strong></h2><p>These are issues that were either introduced by this patch and are being worked on, or are from a previous version and have not yet been fixed.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Sending friend requests via friend code in game currently does not work.</li><li>Players may be unable to be joined or invited to the game.</li><li>Players added to the 'Recent Players' list will appear in the middle of the list.</li><li>Players may experience delays in Medals and Super Credits payouts.</li><li>Spear targeting is unable to target Automaton Spawners.</li><li>Enemies that bleed out do not progress Personal Orders and Eradicate missions.</li><li>Arc weapons sometimes behave inconsistently and sometimes misfire.</li><li>Most weapons shoot below the crosshair when aiming down the sights.</li><li>Plasma Punisher is unable to shoot out of the shield generators.</li><li>Stratagem beam might attach itself to an enemy but it will deploy to its original location.</li><li>Helldiver may be unable to stand up from crouching when surrounded by enemies.</li><li>"Hand Carts" ship module does not reduce Shield Generator Pack's cooldown.</li><li>Bile Titan sometimes does not take damage to the head.</li><li>Charger’s butt does not take damage from explosions.</li><li>Players may become stuck in the Loadout when joining a game in progress.</li><li>Reinforcement may not be available for players who join a game in progress.</li><li>Planet liberation reaches 100% at the end of every Defend mission.</li><li>"Raise Flag of Super Earth" objective does not show a progress bar.</li><li>Mission count in the Career tab is being reset to zero after every game restart.</li><li>Some weapons’ descriptions are out-of-date and don’t reflect their current design.</li><li>BR-14 Adjudicator has incorrect recoil values</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><em>Anthony is a freelance contributor covering science and video gaming news for IGN.

I got to play a solid dozen matches (against the CPU) of Battle Mode, one of a few different modes in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, the upcoming fighting game built around DBZ’s most famous and recognizable heroes and villains. Here’s the key sentence: it absolutely feels like getting to play a battle from the legendary anime. That is both the most obvious thing I can say about it and the exact sentence I imagine that most DBZ fans want to hear.</p><p>After choosing your fighter – and there are dozens of variations of well-known characters here – you choose one of over half a dozen stages to battle on, study up on your special moves, and then enter the arena. And once you get there, you’d be forgiven if you thought you were watching an episode of the anime. The cel-shaded visuals are note-perfect to the show, and the animation equally helps sell the idea that your eyes are looking at a pre-baked episode of television and not a real-time interactive experience. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero - June 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Once you start moving around and attacking, it really locks in as a Dragon Ball battle versus being a traditional one-on-one fighting game on a 2D plane. Not only can you fly anywhere you want – including launching yourself quite high in the air with the press of the left shoulder button – but you can quickly and easily unleash environment-destroying attacks like Goku’s Meteor Smash that will reduce half a cliffside to a pile of dust in an instant. The goal, the Bandai Namco folks told me, was to make players feel as powerful as possible. </p><p>If you choose Custom Battle, you can set very unique victory conditions, lending an extra bit of opportunity to recreate your favorite confrontations from the anime, whether you’re fighting Piccolo, Radditz, or one of dozens of other characters. I scrolled through the list and there is truly an insane number of options here. Also, Bandai Namco was also quick to point out that local multiplayer will be available on day one for both Early Access and DBSZ’s formal 1.0 launch. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Even after just a dozen or so matches against the CPU, it became clear to me that Dragon Ball superfans who are exceptionally good at fighting games – or those who intend to practice a lot with Sparking Zero – are going to find themselves having a great time crushing their competition. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whether you're jumping back into the base game before release or starting from scratch altogether, the hype is slowly building. Shadow of the Erdtree will release on June 21 and costs £34.99 -- but if you're on PC, there's already a tantalizing saving on offer to you. Fanatical, trusted PC and Steam code sellers, currently have the <a href="https://zdcs.link/4AGJL" target="_blank">Elden Ring: Shadow of The Erdtree expansion listed for $30.79. </a>That's 12% off one of the most anticipated DLCs ever.

For now, at least. Tony's Chocolonely is pretty great but often too pricey to even consider. With it down to £2.50 that's a lot easier to stomach.

Bank Switch to Santander Edge and you can bag a free £175, 7% easy-access savings, 1% bills cashback &amp; a top overseas debit card. It costs £3/month, and within 60 days of switching your account, you’ll need to set up 2 active Direct Debits and pay in £1,500 to qualify for the offer.</p><h2>Best UK Easy Access Saver Account: 5.1% From Chase</h2><div id="201874"><p><h3>Chase: 5.1% Easy Access Saver</h3></p></div><p>I don't try to make a habit of financial advice (despite all the deals talk), but this is a great chance to secure one of the best UK easy access saving accounts right now.

You've come to the right place. This is a complete list of all the codes available in June 2024. You'll usually find new Blade Ball codes on the game's official <a href="https://twitter.com/Blade_Ball" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter account</a>, where the devs post them alongside updates for the game, or you can also head over to the game's Discord server and check the <strong>Codes</strong> channel.

Set your game to AFK to ensure you don't hop into a round of Blade Ball while redeeming your rewards, then select the extras menu and pick <strong>Codes</strong>.</p><p>From here, a text bar will appear in the centre of the screen. Type any codes you have into the bar and, if they're still valid, you'll get a message confirming your input was successful. If the code is no longer available, it will inform you that the code has expired.</p><h2>What Can You Get With Blade Ball Code Rewards?</h2><p>By redeeming Blade Ball codes, you'll get your hands on a bunch of resources. Here's a quick list of what you can do with all the rewards you earn:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Spins on the Wheel</strong> - Allows you to spin the wheel in the centre of the lobby for free to earn coins and occasionally new abilities and skins.</li><li><strong>Dungeon Runes </strong>- A currency you can use to buy items in the Dungeons server.</li><li><strong>Event Crate Tickets</strong> - Allows you to open an event crate for free, where you can earn new cosmetics.</li></ul><h2>How to Get Other Free Rewards in Blade Ball</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/31/roblox-blade-ball-afk-world-1717167862644.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Between codes and looking to get additional rewards in Blade Ball? There are a few free ways to get new resources while you play. First up, you can always hop into <strong>AFK World </strong>to get free rewards and new bonuses. To access AFK World, head to the left-hand side of the lobby and look for a portal to the left of the server area. Inside the portal, you'll see your avatar floating in the air in a sitting position. Walk up to the portal and <strong>Hold E </strong>and you'll enter AFK World.</p><p>As you enter, you'll access a menu that shows your avatar floating in the centre of the screen with a timer below them. From here, leave the game on and, over time, you'll accumulate free rewards. These include crystals, coins, and stars.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/13/roblox-blade-ball-daily-login-rewards-1718294079468.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>You can also claim daily free rewards for logging into the game. When you're in the lobby, look for the <strong>calendar icon</strong> in the top left-hand corner of the screen. Click it and a tab will appear showing the daily rewards for logging in. Press claim below the current reward to add it to your account. These rewards can range from coins to free items, so it's well worth getting in the habit of claiming them each time you play.</p><p><em>Callum Williams is a freelance media writer with years of experience as a game critic, news reporter, guides writer and features writer.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Each day you login you'll earn another reward.

<p data-characters="428" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As you embark on the <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em> journey, be prepared for a series of pivotal decisions. The first of these will confront you right at the beginning, offering two paths: ‘Take her hand’ or ‘Don’t take her hand.’ This choice is not to be taken lightly, as it will shape your entire experience in <em>SMT V: Vengeance. </em>We’re here to guide you toward the most beneficial outcome.</p> <h2 id="h-smt-v-vengeance-take-the-hand-decision-guide" data-injectable="false">SMT V: Vengeance take the hand decision guide</h2> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">When you reach out to the body in the early cutscenes of <em>SMT V: Vengeance</em>, a voice will tell you that this girl is not ready to exist quite yet. You’ll choose to either reach out to her or ignore it. <strong>Grab the girl’s hand</strong> to <strong>experience the new storyline, Canon of Vengeance. </strong>On the other hand, don’t grab the girl’s hand if you wish to check out <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-shin-megami-tensei-v/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>SMT V’s </em>original narrative</a>, Canon of Creation. Newcomers may be inclined to take this route to see what events transpired in the original version. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="802" data-injectable="true">Although Canon of Vengeance could be seen as the ‘evil route,’ it’s the only way to access the brand-new story. This pathway may involve more morally ambiguous choices and darker themes. It’ll still follow a similar route to the original but with a few twists and turns. <em>Vengeance’s </em>new character will also join your party frequently, resulting in exclusive dialogue and cutscenes. She’s honestly a pretty good ally to have and can make battles much more accessible.</p>
 <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="false"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Even if you’re a beginner, you can still take the hand if you so desire. </span>Like <span data-preserver-spaces="true">most </span><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-shin-megami-tensei-iv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SMT</a></em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-shin-megami-tensei-iv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> entries</a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Vengeance</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is a standalone experience, meaning you can enjoy the new content without feeling lost or overwhelmed by the game’s lore or previous entries. Of course, it’s entirely up to you to make the final decision. Plus, the game allows you to revert your choice at this point if you happen to change your mind. </span></p>
