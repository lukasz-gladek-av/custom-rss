Today, Nvidia added a few more features to get the app ready, including the ability to toggle G-Sync on and off, multi-monitor support for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/24/24048892/nvidia-rtx-video-hdr-feature-ai">RTX HDR</a>, and driver rollback. The app can also now notify you if there’s DRM content playing that could stop your <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/23/4358300/nvidia-shadowplay-and-geforce-gtx-780">ShadowPlay recording</a>.</p><p>Nvidia says upcoming updates to the app will also bring in the remaining features of Nvidia Control Panel, such as surround options, custom resolutions, and multi-monitor setup. Soon, both the GeForce Experience app and the Nvidia Control Panel will be replaced by the Nvidia app, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/22/24079529/nvidia-app-geforce-experience-control-panel-windows">first launched</a> in February.</p><p>The app also lets you change the font styles to make statistics, frame rates, and other info easier to read, and you can choose from “thousands of colors” for the app UI. And there’s now persistent user sorting and filtering of games and apps as well as the ability to hide and remove manually added programs.</p><p>Here’s a <em>Digital Foundry</em> video about RTX HDR, which was initially announced for video but is impressive for games as well: </p><p>To try it, you press Alt + Z to summon Nvidia’s overlay from inside your game, select “Game Filter,” then choose HDR. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For one reason or another, however, I always drop off about halfway through the month with just a handful of accomplishments to actually show for my effort, and I’m sure this year will be no different. I’m sure I’m not the only one who tries and fails in this regard. This year, rather than aiming to play a bunch of contemporary games, I’m going to try and fill in some gaps, and I think I’m going to start with the original <em>Resident Evil </em>trilogy.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196215" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Resident Evil Goes VR And More New Releases | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="68" data-playlist="196215,196646,196572" data-current="196215"><div><p>The Best Resident Evil Goes VR And More New Releases | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21757.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Now, Capcom has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891">remade</a></span> damn near half of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-resident-evil-4-remake-re4-village-survival-horror-1850329503&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-resident-evil-4-remake-re4-village-survival-horror-1850329503">mainline <em>Resident Evil</em> games</a></span> at this point, including the first four numbered installments, and I’ve played quite a few of them! But I’ve never really played the OGs outside of a brief experience with an emulation of <em>Resident Evil 2 </em>on the PS3, and I think it’s about time I buckled down and finally took the dip. Luckily, in a move that I’m sure has thrilled video game preservationists, Capcom has released the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_bundle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original versions of the first three <em>Resident Evil </em>games on GOG</a></span>, and they’re now bundled together.</p><p><strong>The <em>Resident Evil Bundle </em>which packages the first three titles is going for just $25 on GOG. </strong>Considering the legacy of these three games, as well as the larger series, that’s a damn steal for the origins of the franchise credited with defining and popularizing the survival horror genre.</p><p>The first <em>Resident Evil </em>is perhaps the single most influential horror game ever. A whole franchise would spill out from it, but it has also been the impetus for several other horror games and series that would seek out its throne and challenge it, including <em>The Evil Within</em>, which shares the same creator, Shinji Mikami. It is also one of the early 3D games that helped define the bounds of the technology, filling screens with immaculate pre-rendered backgrounds and leveraging the capabilities of the PS1 to lend the game a cinematic quality complete with fixed camera angles, which I desperately miss in games these days.</p><p><em>Resident Evil</em>’s Spencer Mansion is one of the most recognizable settings in video games, but the series would one-up itself in the subsequent follow-ups, <em>Resident Evil 2 </em>and <em>3: Nemesis.</em> Raccoon City, and in particular its police station, have been etched into the brains of video game horror savants for decades now. The labyrinthine nature of the latter, as well as the tunnels and labs underneath it, still inspire callbacks within the very same series to this day, and the city figures prominently into the history of the games, as well as the media franchise that spawned from it.</p><p>Each of these three games has also given us some of gaming’s most iconic heroes and fearsome enemies. Chris and Clarie Redfield, Leon Kennedy, and Jill Valentine are still hugely popular characters today, and Chris is <em>still</em> a driving force of the series’ ongoing story as of the end of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a></span>, even if he does <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/is-chris-redfield-okay-1844018378&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/is-chris-redfield-okay-1844018378">change faces every time he shows up</a></span>. Some of these characters are even referenced in the recent hit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span>, which comes as little surprise given the huge role that <em>Resident Evil </em>has played in PlayStation’s history. On the other side of things, folks still utterly hate (but secretly love) foes like the gruesome Lickers and Mr. X himself, and have cheered on the return of these enemies in the critically lauded <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-2-the-kotaku-review-1831951036&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-2-the-kotaku-review-1831951036">remakes</a></span>.</p><p>These games have history, but not all of it’s exactly <em>great</em>. These three games are kind of old (the oldest one of them predates my time on Earth) and I’m sure that age will show. The classic <em>Resident Evil </em>games are known for their stiff “tank controls” after all, and I’m sure that they’re largely more difficult than the modern entries on their most normal difficulty. However, that isn’t stopping me from giving them a shot, nor should it stop you!</p><p>It’s<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/classic-games-history-foundation-preservation-yakuza-1850623857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/classic-games-history-foundation-preservation-yakuza-1850623857"> rare that we have access to the original article</a></span> like this. Most older games just kind of go missing at some point, and even the legendary ones often get locked away to be remade for even more gains down the line. In that sense, consider me grateful that the first three <em>Resident Evil </em>games are just sitting on a store page for a bafflingly affordable price. Now, let’s all get reacquainted with survival horror’s tremendous roots in honor of the spooky season. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To help reach and promote their message of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/safe-in-our-world-bafta-mental-health-summit-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">raising awareness of mental health</a> and driving change within the videogame industry, they have written an official <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> one-shot exclusively for their Press Pause 2024 fundraiser.</p>
<h2>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Press Pause 2024 One-Shot</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, the Press Pause 2024 <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> one-shot adventure is designed for a party of four level-four adventurers.</p>

<p>As for how this one-shot benefits Press Play 2024, the press release explains further. It encourages players to open a free account on fundraising streaming platform Tiltify, get some friends together, and host private or live-streamed games of the <em>D&amp;D</em> one-shot between October 25 and November 3.</p>
<p>For those who raise <span>£100 or more will be rewarded with a set of custom L’Emporium du Bizarre dice shakers. In addition, Safe in our World will be giving away a Legion Go handheld gaming device.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“We really want to make a point that anybody can set up a Tiltify and enjoy the one-shot we have crafted. The Gatekeeper was designed as an entry-level adventure that can easily be built on or customised by more familiar players,” commented Sky Tunley-Stainton, The Gatekeeper co-writer and Partnerships &amp; Training Manager at Safe In Our World. “This includes first-time players, brand-new D&amp;D groups, or even groups of colleagues. We’d love to see our industry peers setup company fundraisers to support the campaign!” </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Safe in Our World will be hosting their own livestream of the Press Play 2024 <em>D&amp;D</em> one-shot. It will be hosted on their official Twitch channel on November 2.</p>

The new MMORPG by NCSoft and Amazon Games has already rushed to number four on Steam, behind only Dota 2, Counter-Strike 2, and that one <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-banana-game-may-not-be-a-scam-but-its-still-not-worth-your-time">banana game</a>. </p><p>At the time of this article, Throne and Liberty sits at around 292,116 concurrents, putting in the top half of the list of Steam's ten most popular games. Its early performance is all the more impressive in light of mixed reviews, most of which have focused on its server issues and microtransactions.</p><p>Indeed, server issues seem to be the biggest problem facing Throne and Liberty, with fans complaining about spending 45 minutes creating a character only to get disconnected. What's more, it doesn't appear possible to choose a different server, leaving fans little recourse except to hope that things improve.</p><p>Still, Throne and Liberty seems to be doing well, following in the footsteps of other Amazon Games releases including Lost Ark and New World. Originally billed as a Lineage sequel, Throne and Liberty is described as a free-to-play MMO with PvE and PvP set in a dynamic and seamless world. It suffered numerous delays over the course of a development cycle spanning several years.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>We wrote about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/throne-and-libertys-beta-is-fun-but-doesnt-do-enough-to-stand-out">Throne and Liberty during its beta</a>, "Overall, I certainly enjoyed most of my time with Throne and Liberty. There are big, late-game things that I want to come back and participate in, like large-scale PVP battles between guilds and raid dungeons. The story and quests won’t upend any long-standing MMO conventions. The inner voice that usually commands me to make sure every task that can be done must be done very quietly let me skip through slow dialogue and turn a blind eye to many menial side tasks. I never skipped an opportunity to fight, though."</p><p>But while Amazon Games have a way of getting off to a fast start, they have struggled to maintain that momentum amid slow updates, balance problems, and other issues. New World launched to huge numbers, wound up getting heavily retooled, and is trying to get a fresh start on console as New World: Aerturnum. We'll see if Throne and Liberty has better luck.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

Narrative director Alison Luhrs showed new concept art for the expansion's destination and provided some cryptic details about what players can expect as Destiny 2 moves into a new story.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGgEhZwd-kE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1349">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FGgEhZwd-kE?start=1349" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The next year of Bungie content, which will start after the last of its current episodes, Heresy, ends in early 2025, will include two major expansions instead of one huge tentpole release, as has been the case throughout Destiny 2's life. These expansions are smaller and will come at a more regular cadence, Bungie says, and be about the size of the original Destiny's Rise of Iron expansion. The first, Codename: Apollo, will have a nonlinear campaign structure, Bungie says, with a metroidvania gameplay approach, allowing players to choose their path through the content as they unlock new abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">We know Apollo will include a new destination, but Bungie has been extremely cagey on where it'll be. But Luhrs did give a few hints, saying during the stream that viewers should imagine the idea of going into the parlor of a mansion, where the owner says there's a secret door. That door would be activated by moving a book or a statue--something that was in front of the person's face the whole time, but only took on significance once they knew what they were looking for.</p><p dir="ltr">Luhrs also shared concept art that doesn't give much new insight but might contain some hints as to what to expect from Apollo. The first shows a group of people seemingly performing some kind of ritual involving blue energy (or possibly goo). The symbols and other elements seen in the image don't seem familiar, but one thing that <em>is</em> familiar is the background--the concept art uses an image of the Cosmodrome location on Earth to provide a rocky, tree-dotted landscape just beyond the structure. The use of an in-game image might just be filler, but then again, it might suggest that this new destination is actually a hidden location on Earth.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377053-frontiersconceptart1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377053" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377053-frontiersconceptart1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377053"></a><figcaption>It is not clear where this concept art takes place, but whether significant or not, that background appears to be the Cosmodrome.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377053-frontiersconceptart1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The second piece of concept art might also play into that theory. It looks like an underground location, somewhere in a huge cave where spires of rock hang down from above. The details here are sparse, but it's possible to see structures among the rocks, like staircases, and possibly more of that blue energy. So maybe we're dealing with a hidden location on Earth, maybe underground, and a group of people we've previously not encountered before in Destiny 2.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377054-frontiersconceptart2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377054" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377054-frontiersconceptart2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377054"></a><figcaption>This piece of concept art seems to suggest at least part of the Codename: Apollo destination could be underground.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377054-frontiersconceptart2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Developers also shared a few inspirations for Apollo that are also notably cryptic. These included the music of the 1960s, including The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, and early progressive rock bands like King Crimson.</p><p dir="ltr">They also mentioned Kurt Vonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse Five--which is notably about a man's experiences of the firebombing of Dresden in World War II and his time as a prisoner of war. The protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, also claims that he becomes unstuck in time, with the narrative jumping around to different points in his life, and that he was a prisoner in an alien zoo on the planet Tralfamadore, and it's never made explicit whether these elements are real or imaginary.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Bungie called out Scavenger's Reign, an animated series originally on HBO and now available on Netflix, that sees a group of humans marooned on an alien planet after their ship crashes. Assistant game director Robbie Stevens mentioned specifically how Scavenger's Reign depicts the strangeness and mystery of its alien world.</p><p dir="ltr">All that leaves us with nothing but rampant speculation about Apollo, but elements like time travel are a major part of the Destiny 2 universe, especially after stories like that of The Witch Queen expansion, where the planet Mars was seen with sections where earlier times break through into the present. But really, as Bungie kicks off a new story after completing the Light and Darkness Saga in The Final Shape expansion, pretty much anything is possible for the future of Destiny 2--and it seems likely to get weird.</p>

            <p>
Hi-<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rez">Rez</a> Studios, the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/smite-2">Smite 2</a> and Paladins, has announced it's laying off an undisclosed number of employees in order to "ensure [the company's] long-term success".
</p>
<p>
Hi-Rez CEO Stewart Chisam announced the job cuts in a <a href="https://x.com/schisam/status/1841072179028324382">lengthy statement</a> shared on social media, saying the layoffs - instigated as part of an "internal reorganisation and reprioritisation" - will "disproportionately impact those in marketing and publishing roles". Staff at Hi-Rez's Evil Mojo, G&amp;A, and Titan Forge divisions are also affected, with Chisam saying these latter cuts will "disproportionally affect our team working on cosmetic skin content and system features."
</p>
<p>
Chisam went on to acknowledge the "real human impact" of the layoffs, adding, "Each impacted individual is a talented and dedicated professional who has poured their heart and soul into our games. Letting them go is a heartbreaking decision, reflects a failure in my leadership, and one for which I take personal accountability."

<p>
The layoffs follow a "comprehensive review of [the studio's] strategy and operations", which will also see Hi-Rez's game division "concentrate [its] efforts entirely on Smite 2" - although "small teams" will continue to release "light updates" for Paladins and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/smite">Smite</a> 1. In the near-term, Hi-Rez will "almost exclusively" prioritise gameplay development for Smite 2 - including new modes, gods, and quality improvements - over the cosmetic and monetisation features it had previously planned to release in the run-up to its free-to-play launch next year.
</p>
<p>Smite 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/smite-developer-announces-standalone-smite-2">announced in January</a>, and released as a paid early access title for PC and consoles this August. On Steam at least, players reviews of the MOBA sequel remain Mixed.
</p>
<p>
"Our goal for Smite 2 in the near term is to create the best possible game experience for our community and a game that provides joy to players and can sustain itself long into the 2030s," Chisam continued. "As we've gained experience through the Alpha, the process of migrating gods from Smite 1 to Smite 2 is now clearer, and we also better understand what players want from the game. We're doubling down on ensuring this transition meets player expectations and moves faster, taking into account the lessons we have learned in the early Alpha."
</p>
<p>
"While these changes are difficult," Chisam's statement concluded, "we believe they are necessary and we will emerge stronger from them. We appreciate your continued support and understanding during this challenging period, and the support and thanks you give those employees who are impacted and have given so much of their passion and time to help entertain us all. Thank you for standing by us as we build the future of Hi-Rez and Smite 2."
</p>
<p>
Today's news continues a devastating 2024 for the games industry, which has already seen <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">over 12,000 employees</a> lose their jobs since the year began. Back in March, GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Tring, writing for Eurogamer, took a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">closer look</a> at the circumstances leading to such massive numbers of job cuts over the last few years.

            <title><![CDATA[When Is An Early Access Game Done?]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-is-an-early-access-game-done.997932/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/shadows-of-doubt-early-access-full-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in February, I wrote about <a href="https://aftermath.site/shadows-of-doubt-indie-detective" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Shadows of Doubt</em></a>, a very cool immersive sim detective game that was in early access. The game released its 1.0 version last week, alongside coming to Xbox and PlayStation. But some players are torn on whether it’s “really” in 1.0 now, and grappling with their expectations against the released game.</p><p><em>Shadows of Doubt</em> came to early access in April 2023. The latest <a href="https://shadowsofdoubt.notion.site/Version-Change-Logs-Released-1e5d5987a562401584d4790c2a9d2225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">version</a> isn’t a massive influx of new content; 1.0 launched with a few new case types and an umbrella to keep your character from getting wet (a real problem in the game!). In the release <a href="https://colepowered.com/shadows-of-doubt-devblog-41-1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a>, developer Cole Jefferies writes&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We’ve finished making the content we wanted to include in the final game… It’s such a massive project for any team, let alone a small one, so we’ll continue working hard behind the scenes to sort out any issues we didn’t manage to solve before launch… In the future, you can still expect small bits of content to arrive in patches, as we just love adding details.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/986130/Shadows_of_Doubt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, reviews are currently “mixed.” Many of the recent reviews express disappointment with the 1.0 release, citing a lack of new content and the presence of bugs that they wouldn’t expect in a finished game. Some players feel burned by the build-up to a full release that doesn’t meet their expectations, or feel like the game didn’t improve through early access in the way they’d expect. In true Steam review fashion, some players speculate that the game was pushed out of early access as a cash grab for console players’ money, or that the developer is abandoning the game. To sum up the opinions, as one player on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadows_of_Doubt/comments/1fs7ki0/comment/lpltont/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reddit</a> said, “The only change between 1.0 and early access is them saying it’s 1.0.”</p><p>Of course, plenty of other players are happy with the 1.0 release; they liked the game in early access and they like it now. Personally, I’d fall into this camp. I’ve only put a little time into the official release, and while I’ve encountered some performance issues, like micro-stutters, I’d hoped would be solved, plenty of other games have launched with such issues, and I feel confident, or at least hopeful, they’ll be worked out. I was a little surprised that there wasn’t a ton of new content for the 1.0 release, but I’ve far from burned myself out on the game; when combined with its procedural generation, there’s plenty of <em>Shadows of Doubt</em> left for me to play. For me, the main draw of the 1.0 release is that it means people I know who avoid early access might take a chance on the game, giving me more people to talk about it with.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t want to litigate the drama happening around a small indie game; instead, I’m curious what <em>Shadows of Doubt</em>’s release response says about the expectations early access and official releases set players up for. What does it really mean for a game to leave early access? Should a game be massively different in its 1.0 release?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no clear example. <em>Fortnite</em> was early access until <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308199/fortnite-leaves-early-access-epic-games-save-the-world-development-slow-down-free-to-play-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2020</a>, but I wouldn’t say the popular battle royale <em>felt</em> in-development; its gameplay changes and new content feel basically identical in the “official” release. <em>DayZ</em> was a sensation in early access in a way that made the label feel a bit meaningless and its official release anticlimactic. <em>Star Citizen </em>sits in some nebulous space between early access and, let’s face it, fake. A friend of mine has recently gotten into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/108600/Project_Zomboid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Project Zomboid</em></a>, a game that’s been in early access so long I can’t believe it still exists. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/reviews/dwarf-fortress-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dwarf Fortress</em></a> was in early access so long that it wasn’t actually <em>really</em> early access at all, because Steam early access <a href="https://kitfoxgames.medium.com/doing-early-access-the-right-way-2302d6646f3b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t exist</a> back then. Valve seems to be circumventing early access altogether with whatever the hell <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-deadlock-verge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Deadlock</em></a> is doing.&nbsp;</p><p>Some games, like how Nathan feels about <a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-technical-test-early-access-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hades 2</em></a>, seem to benefit from early access, with developers leaning into the label in the narrative and development of the game itself. Other games can struggle with how the process invites player participation in development; as Raphael van Lierop, the director of <a href="https://aftermath.site/long-dark-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Long Dark</em></a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-the-long-dark-1840052958" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told me in 2019</a>, “We have this grateful feeling towards our community, but also strangely cautious feeling towards our community… We want you [players] to participate. But you’re not in the driver’s seat and you’re never going to be in the driver’s seat.”</p><p><em>The Long Dark</em>, which started in early access in 2014, pegged its official launch to a much-hyped story mode that some players found so disappointing that studio Hinterland reworked the whole thing. It’s one example of one of the potential pitfalls of big new content for a 1.0 release: the risk that the game changes <em>too</em> much for dedicated early access players, or doesn’t meet the expectations they’ve set in their heads after years of feeling involved.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t think it’s necessarily bad for early access players to feel attachment or even a bit of ownership over a game; developers benefit from their feedback, and also from the money early access brings in. But I’m not sure what an official release <em>means</em> to the early access player who’s spent dozens or hundreds of hours in a game. Surely they stuck with it for more than just the idea of what it could be on full release. Should a full release be a kind of reward for their time, money, and feedback? Or is a full release more of an invitation to new players, an offering that meets whatever standards a developer sets for feeling it’s ready for them without the caveats of early access?&nbsp;</p><p>If you play early access, you know the pitfalls of burning yourself out on a game and missing out on any 1.0 content because you played it too much before it released. But you might also have higher expectations than a new player; you want new content because you’ve played so much of it, where a new player hasn’t played it at all. I think both cohorts might hold a game with an early access period to a higher standard than games that just release; it’s reasonable to assume a game’s content and technical performance will benefit from the extra development time. A game that feels rickety or unfinished after an early access phase is certainly extra disappointing to both new and returning players. But a game officially releasing also doesn’t mean it’s done; <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is a perfect example of a game whose official launch period sort of feels like early access now, given how much it’s changed since.&nbsp;</p><p>Leaving early access heralds a shift in how a developer works on a game; it signals that the development has changed, even if it hasn’t fully ended. For early access players used to updates and new content, this can be disappointing, especially if they’ve been deeply involved in the early access process. But it might also be relieving, signalling the end of saves lost due to updates or strategies and playstyles changing as systems are reworked. Maybe an official launch isn’t a renovation as much as a foundation, a settling in to what a game <em>is</em>. Despite what the <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rise of live-service games</a> suggests, I don’t think a developer should have to work on one game forever, nor do I think a player should get a lifetime of content out of one game. In one of life’s hardest lessons, it’s okay for a game to be “done” and for everyone to move on, even if a game still has room to grow.</p><p>Early access has come a long way since Steam <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/20/4128644/steam-early-access-buy-and-play-games-still-in-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched the program</a> in 2013. I’ve played games that felt basically finished out of the gate, as well as games that felt way too bare bones to have been worth spending money on. My Steam library is full of games whose titles or entire concepts changed in early access, and even ones that were basically abandoned and never changed at all after I bought them. Early access has its pros and cons, but at the end of the day, developers–for a variety of reasons–decide when their game is ready for 1.0.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In addition, I’ve also listed the animals the fighters turn into and more precise descriptions for correct spacing. Although each one is listed as having a mid-spacing requirement, they’re all far more lenient.<br></p><p>It’s worth noting that this list currently covers characters up to the first half of Kombat Pack 2. The last three in the pack are all guest fighters that we assume will be released individually over time. It stands to reason that they’ll roll out with Animalities, considering the guest fighters from Kombat Pack 1 were updated with these new finishers along with this huge update.</p><p>Ready?

That’s a long time to slowly iterate on a series and its characters, meaning that this prequel, set at the tail end of the 1980s, is informed by a lot of the learnings of that decade. As a result, <em>Yakuza 0 </em>is damn near masterful in its balance of the franchise’s irreverent humor, best-in-class brawler action, and soap-y criminal drama plotlines, and features a bunch of finely tuned side activities that reveal themselves to be full games, such as Majima’s famous cabaret minigame and Kiryu’s foray into real estate management. You turn the money earned via these lucrative detours into skills in <em>Yakuza 0</em>’s progression system, which can be funneled into three different battle styles for each of the game’s playable protagonists: the series’ longtime hero Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima, an equally stalwart rival of his.<br></p><p>If you ask me, this game really <em>belongs </em>to Majima, who has been a fixture of the series since the beginning, but greatly benefits from the characterization he’s given in <em>Yakuza 0</em>. In the original run of the games, and in particular the initial release of <em>Yakuza</em>, he was a more straightforward and eccentric Joker-like villain who plagued Kiryu before they eventually became allies in their later years. <em>Yakuza 0 </em>fills in the story of how Majima earns his stripes, not to mention his reputation as the Mad Dog of Shimano by the time that the events of the first <em>Yakuza </em>game occur.</p><p>This characterization follows Majima into <em>Yakuza Kiwami</em> and <em>Kiwami 2</em>, remakes of the first two games that followed <em>0 </em>and remix elements of their stories, while fleshing out others that might’ve been underdeveloped in their initial releases. And it is this renewed version of Majima, as well as Kiryu, that I think we’ll see in the Amazon adaptation.</p><p>The show has the benefit of the long series that precedes it, but despite its cast and creators having said that they’re <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-amazon-kiryu-actor-interview-1851592856&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-amazon-kiryu-actor-interview-1851592856">freeing themselves up to do their own thing</a></span>, it’d be a little foolish not to draw from the perspective of this prequel. Kiryu, the main character of the series, is largely portrayed as this stoic outsider in the criminal world who wants out of that lifestyle, but <em>Yakuza 0 </em>goes to agonizing lengths to paint a picture of his hotheaded nature and youthful recklessness, as well as show the circumstances that drew him to the yakuza and maybe even started him on his path to disillusionment. You even get to see Nishiki, his sworn oath brother, and their remarkably close relationship in <em>Yakuza 0 </em>before they are at odds in the first game.</p><p>Considering the fact that the show’s first season is only six episodes long, it’s got a lot of ground to cover, and it makes sense to condense these men’s complicated and storied relationships by pulling from various places. The show seems set to focus on Nishiki and Kiryu’s confrontation in 2005, but I don’t know how well that’ll work without setting up at least <em>some </em>elements of their friendship from <em>Yakuza 0</em>, even if it doesn’t adapt that story wholesale. Majima, who makes a madcap appearance in the show’s trailer saying “Kiryu-chan” in his iconic and deranged manner, benefits so much from the emotional foundation laid out for his character’s arc beginning in <em>Yakuza 0</em>. It’d be much better to play up what a ridiculous character he is if the show also pulls in the backstory that informs that appearance and to not do that would be doing Majima a disservice.</p><p>In order to get the full scope of it though, I’d urge you to just <em>play Yakuza 0</em>. The show looks good, but adaptations always gain and lose things, sometimes in equal measure and other times not. I’m sure that there’s a lot that’ll be left on the cutting room floor, but it’ll be interesting to weigh the trajectory of these characters and the differences once you understand the breadth of their backstory as provided by <em>Yakuza 0</em> while remaining unspoiled for the larger events of the season, which seem to be adapting from <em>Yakuza</em>/<em>Yakuza Kiwami. </em>Realistically, you also <em>only </em> have till the end of the month to catch up on the games before the show premieres, so much as I’d like to recommend just marathoning the series, you’re only going to fit one of these gargantuan games in that time and may as well make it the best and most informative of the bunch. For these, and countless other reasons, you’ve really got to play <em>Yakuza 0</em>, and I mean like right now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, in the wake of <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA announcing that it did not have plans for The Sims 5</a> last month, a new set of screenshots from Project Rene have leaked, and the community is upset over some pretty big presumed changes that have been made since the game's reveal.</p><p>Over the past week, several apparent images from a recent playtest of Project Rene have leaked online, showing off some of the game's new features for the first time. While Project Rene is still in development, quite a few players have taken to the internet to criticize its altered art style, limited scope, and apparent use of microtransactions.</p><p>Several fans have shared comparisons between earlier images of Project Rene and these apparent leaks, with many assuming that the studio must have shifted development plans to make the game more mobile-friendly, in turn downscaling its art style.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i can’t believe my eyes that Project Rene has switched its course from being a promising successor of the Sims 4 to some ugly ass mobile game that will be another cash grab full of ads <a href="https://t.co/55zBbi4vJI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/55zBbi4vJI</a></p>— tom (@simshive) <a href="https://twitter.com/simshive/status/1840433234867359749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>These leaked images also show off its gameplay, which seems to include a to-do list, a chat box, and a small neighborhood to explore. Most notably, the game features the ability to work at a cafe, which has caused players to draw comparisons to The Sims Mobile, EA's 2018 game that also featured a cafe (and stopped receiving new updates earlier this year).</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New images from "Project Rene" (which is NOT The Sims 5) <a href="https://t.co/hSkPSkokuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/hSkPSkokuk</a></p>— The Sims Nostalgia (@Sims_Nostalgia) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sims_Nostalgia/status/1840459070676836741?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Quite a few players have also noticed that the apparently leaked images feature a mobile-style coin tab. These coins are apparently rewards from completing quests and can be used to purchase new outfits. However, because of the game's mobile format, quite a few players have assumed that the game will feature microtransactions.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Like Life Sim (@LikeLifeSim) <a href="https://twitter.com/LikeLifeSim/status/1840306151251959881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Y’all have to understand.

                <p>Microsoft is discontinuing its consumer HoloLens headset program, marking a major change for the company. After all, CEO Satya Nadella said in 2016 that HoloLens would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-one-games-and-hololens-are-key-for-microsofts/1100-6428459/" data-ref-id="1100-6428459">"key" to Microsoft's growth in the future</a>. That didn't end up coming to fruition, though, and the HoloLens program is winding down--at least for consumers. Microsoft will continue to work with the US Army to make a version of the headset for soldiers.</p><p>Microsoft confirmed to <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/microsoft-discontinuing-hololens-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UploadVR</a> that HoloLens 2 production has ended. Updates for "critical security issues and software regressions" will run through the end of 2027. But software support for HoloLens 2 will come to an end in 2028.</p>

<p>The original HoloLens headset that debuted in 2017 will have its own software support end after December 10, 2024. Production on this device was halted in 2018.</p><p>Microsoft is ending the consumer HoloLens program but is staying in business with the United States military to create a custom version of the headset for soldiers. The US Army will run an operational test in 2025 to determine if it will go ahead with full-scale production. A Microsoft spokesperson told UploadVR that Microsoft continues to be "fully committed" to working with the US Army on this initiative.</p><p>The headsets are known as Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), and are an evolution of the company's HoloLens product. In total, the Army has said it will spend <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than $20 billion</a> over a decade on research and development of the new soldier technology with Microsoft.</p><p>HoloLens was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-halo-and-hololens-merged-at-e3-2015-magic-hap/1100-6428288/" data-ref-id="1100-6428288">highly touted as a potential game-changing consumer product</a> when it was announced in 2015. Prior to the announcement of the HoloLens consumer product discontinuation, Microsoft's recent mass layoffs affected the HoloLens team.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/">Patch 7</a> has been one of the most monumental patches in Baldur's Gate 3, as it opened up the official modding toolkit for the players and added a revamped split-screen mode and more evil endings for players to explore. As of today, Patch 7 is now available for those on Mac and console. The update is pretty massive, as it adds new Evil endings, a revamped split screen, and a selection of in-game mods that members of the BG3 community built. This is a huge occasion for gamers on consoles, as it's not often that games on consoles are given the possibility to mod their games, even if it is a chosen selection.</p>
<p>Over 15 million mods have already been downloaded for Baldur's Gate 3 using Larian Studios' official toolkit. While the update has been available on PC for some time, they have quickly got the update out for Mac and console players, where players will now be able to experience new Evil endings and cinematics, as well as unique endings if you are playing as an Origin Character.</p>
<p>The official Baldur's Gate 3 Toolkit allows anyone and everyone to make mods as long as they're doing so on PC and can upload them to the official mod manager, making it an accessible way to get into the world of modding. So far, people have found a way to 'unlock' the toolkit, and are using it to make <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-real-time-combat-mod-now-allows-party-to-get-involved/">real-time combat mods</a> as well as new areas to explore, such <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-modder-creates-custom-maps-including-avernus/">as Avernus</a>. Unfortunately, these mods are unlikely ever to be able to be put on consoles as they aren't within the realms of the official toolkit.</p>

<p><a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/patch-7-now-live_121?mc_cid=19af5d5b5f&amp;mc_eid=22f0f6c8d6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new patch</a> provides a more dynamic split screen option that is available for those who are playing the game via couch co-op. When you play on split screen and you are near the other party member, the screen will then merge into one, to provide a more seamless experience for those who are playing together in person.</p>
<p>There are plenty of different types of mods to play with, with some of them being as simple as changing a character's race or class, as well as a personalized UI, depending on what you prefer to play with. The patch also adds quality live improvements to the writing and animations. Honour Mode has also received a few changes, adding Legendary Actions to some of the most powerful foes you'll come across.</p>

After Adar snatches Galadriel’s ring from Elrond, the screen snaps to black and intense drums ring out. Before you even have a chance to read the first credit, a throaty, intense metal voice starts chanting. Yes, a metal song is playing in a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> television show, and it’s fucking awesome.<br></p><p>Called “The Last Ballad of Damrod,” the song was written by series composer Bear McCreary (the same man behind the music in the <em>God of War</em> reboot series), and sung by legendary musician Jens Kidman. Kidman is the frontman for and one of the founders of Meshuggah, a Swedish extreme metal band that is widely considered one of the best modern metal bands of all time. </p><p>The song is named after and tells the story of the troll Damrod, who joins Adar’s forces for the Siege of Eregion and wipes the floor with the city and many elves defending it until Elrdon, Arondir, and Gil-galad step in and kil the guy. Naturally, this ass-kicking troll (who apparently eats dragon bones) would be the perfect subject for a heavy metal song. I mean, check out these batshit lyrics:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>In humid mold, troll sits alone</p><p>No friend or kin to call his own</p><p>Troll gnaws on skins, raw shanks and shins</p><p>Rips meat from reeking dragon bone</p><p>With laughter deep and throaty groan</p><p>He rises from his seat of stone</p><p>From darkened cave, a bloodlust crave</p><p>Set loose upon the hills to roam</p></blockquote><p>I’ve had “The Last Ballad of Damrod” on repeat since episode 7 aired last week. It was such a lovely surprise, such an unexpected thing to hear at the end of a <em>Rings of Power</em> episode—but also something that just <em>works</em>. The relationship between high fantasy and metal music is a lengthy one, so McCreary’s choice to write such a badass song and enlist a legend of the genre to sing it is so brilliantly inspired. I’m pretty sure I PRed nearly all my lifts at the gym today while blasting this through my headphones.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXGQPRFP?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/last-ballad-of-damrod-jens-kidman-rings-of-power-lotr-1851662319&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0CXGQPRFP" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20"><em>The Rings of Power</em></a></span> season 2 finale drops this Thursday, October 3 on Amazon Prime. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
