			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is setting out to be one of the most interesting Nintendo Switch 2 ports launching next year, judging from the footage released so far.</p>



<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">Digital Foundry</a> compared the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-with-new-trailer/">Nintendo Switch 2 version announcement trailer</a> of the next entry in the CAPCOM series with the same trailer captured on PC, highlighting how this port is going to be notable for how it has been built with ray tracing in mind and for how the Nintendo console will support RT in a seemingly competent capacity. </p>



<p>Comparing the two trailers shows how RTGI is present in the Switch 2 version, delivering an experience that looks very much the same as that on the other systems, although with some cutbacks regarding image quality, hair rendering, shadow maps resolution, and reflections, as this version of the game seems to lack RT reflections. Performance also seems to be a little unstable from the footage, but considering it has been captured on a pre-release build, there's a good chance Resident Evil Requiem's performance will better in its final release.</p>

<p>Building the game with ray tracing in mind seems to be doing wonders for the experience as a whole, as Resident Evil Requiem looked stunning when I tried it last month during <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">Gamescom</a>. Although I wasn't able to experience combat, the short sequence set in Rhodes Hill Chronic Center made me very excited to see how the game will push the series forward when it launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on February 27, 2026.</p>

<p>"How beautiful, a divine quest so unobtainable..."</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Devolver Digital certainly has form when it comes to bringing us original indie games that go about things just a little bit differently than your usual fare, and with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, by developer Sam Eng, it seems the publisher's streak of off-kilter experiences looks set to continue. A good thing, we think you'll agree.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, which is set to drop at some point a little later this year on Switch 2, sees you assume the role of a skateboarder, nothing unusual about that. However, this particular skateboarder, you see...well, he's sort of made out of glass, it says here. He's made a deal with the devil and he has to skate to the moon and then swallow it in order to be freed. Yep.</p>
<p>What this all means for us players, apparently, is some incredibly cool-looking skateboarding action as your trippy, glass skater-boi gets busy blasting around the Wastelands en route to the actual moon. Good luck with that!</p>
<p>You can check out the slick new trailer for the game above, and here's some more official details and some Switch 2 screens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ollie, kickflip, and grind your way through the ash and smoke of The Emptylands as you take on a seemingly impossible quest. Learn to master your weight and motion to conquer the weeping concrete. Savour the ritualistic beauty as you set your feet to pop a perfect kickflip.</p>
<p><strong>Hypnotic Beats for Demonic Streets</strong><br>
Cruise through The Underworld to a psychedelic soundtrack by enigmatic New York artist Blood Cultures, and additional tracks by John Fio.</p>
<p><strong>Stylish Street Skating Adventure</strong><br>
Skate through nine layers of The Underworld. Cruise through streets and surreal landscapes full of waxed ledges, unholy gaps, and tortured demons. Push your way through precarious paths and shred freeform skate spots. Discover and create your own challenges as you explore the world and master your board.</p>
<p><strong>Succumb To The Beauty of The Board</strong><br>
Sell your soul for decks, wheels, and trucks to keep your skating fresh. Over 70+ skate tricks to progress and improve. Complete skate trials to level up, learn new tricks, and get new gear. Destroy vicious demons with your 360 flip… or at least impress them.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>It's all very stylish, the soundtrack seems awesome from what we glean from the short trailer, and there does seem to be an emphasis on actual skilful skating stuff, which has got our inner Tony Hawks very, very intrigued.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
I confess, after reading the comments on yesterday's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/endless-legend-2s-early-access-launch-is-a-triumph-of-asymmetrical-4x-design-but-i-do-wish-it-were-even-stranger">Endless Legend 2 early access impressions</a>, I am mortally afeared that I'm one of those accursed "positive outliers" I keep reading about in the Gamer Witchfinder Almanac. Seemingly, a fair portion of you were turned off by the recent Steam demo. You may be interested, then, to read specifics about how Amplitude have changed the game in response to demo feedback.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As detailed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3407390/view/496081198026588764?l=english">a new Steam post</a>, here's what they think you liked. Firstly, the Tidefall mechanic, whereby the ocean retreats periodically to reveal extra playable terrain, and the regular Monsoons that sweep the land. "This was a core element of the game, and we were happy to see it having a real impact," the devs write, adding that they tinkered a lot with the quantity of Monsoons and Tidefalls. Apparently, there were once eight smaller Tidefalls to every game of Endless Legend 2, so many that players began ignoring them.
</p>
<p>
They also reckon you're keen on the asymmetrical faction design - "always a focus of Amplitude" - and that you're mostly enjoying the art and sound, including the map design, characters and jingles for stuff like minor factions, or the weird echoey thudding you might hear during Monsoons.
</p>
<p>
Now for weaknesses. According to Amplitude, the bulk of the negative feedback concerned the user interface. "A quarter of reviews mentioned UI and only 30% of those comments were positive," they note. "In reading all your feedback we realize it's not as simple as making a few changes and we are looking at something larger. There are instances where we displayed the wrong or not enough information. There were UI and text bugs to fix and we think more is needed here, which will take some time."
</p><p>
In particular, they're looking at making the city screens more intelligible. "Adjacency, leveling districts, managing population, and having clear decisions on what to build next were all muddy," the devs write. This is a "flow issue", apparently, which I guess refers to how your eyeballs and attention move from one UI element to the next in the course of urban management.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, they might change up Districts so that you can select them from a construction list like Improvements, rather than picking a tile to build on first. "This will take time to change and won't be in the initial Early Access, but we will be sharing concepts with you to get feedback," the devs comment.
</p>
<p>
To belatedly update my impressions from yesterday, I haven't had much of a problem with the UI in the early access build, but there were definitely a couple of moments this week when the verdant tile designs made it hard to discern, say, city centres, or units inside cities. It's definitely rather busy, which is to be expected for a 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game with such florid factions and a turbulent expanding map. I also sometimes forgot what right-click and left-click do in different contexts. I don't consider any of these deal-breakers, however.
</p>
<p>
Following on from those UI thoughts, Amplitude acknowledge that some players have found the colourful world a little too hallucinogenic. They've addressed this in early access by making city foundations clearer, so you know to build there, while getting rid of bugs (not the Necrophage) that caused blurriness, and adding more graphics options.  They've also reduced the colour saturation of the terrain a little and made the all-important hexagonal grid lines more prominent, while shrinking certain fancier vegetation that players kept confusing with Anomalies. 
</p><p>
"It's a difficult balance between providing a lush, detailed world where you can see the leaves blow in the wind during monsoon, and still not have to strain or be confused when trying to see information you need to play," the developers observe.
</p>
<p>
In my impressions of Endless Legend 2, I was most critical of the character writing. Demo players were also iffy about this side of the game. In their Steam post, Amplitude note that there are many more words in Endless Legend 2 than the 2014 original, including reams of character dialogue. "We want heroes to feel personal and deep," they write. "They may be members of your council, have their own friends and enemies, and they talk directly to you and each other. But this additional granularity also came with issues. 
</p>
<p>
"For Early Access we have updated the presentation of the dialog, we are cutting lines and events to focus on only the best and most suitable," the devs continue. "In some cases, the wrong character would say something, or a character it didn't make sense for, which we are fixing." I definitely picked up on a few instances of the latter, but my overarching problem with the character writing is that the focus on characters doesn't do certain factions justice. The Necrophage are a horde, not a cast. The Aspect are a reef, not an ensemble. That's what I find attractive about them conceptually, at least.
</p>
<p>
Endless Legend 2 launches into early access on 22nd September. It'll start off with five factions. They're planning to add a sixth plus multiplayer and custom faction support before the 1.0 release next year. If you end up disliking it please don't burn my house down.

              <p><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>has revealed new sprays coming to the game that some fans online have been </span><a href="https://x.com/dewenjoyer/status/1968131210951241935"><span>speculating are AI-generated</span></a><span>. These </span><a href="https://x.com/ougidraws/status/1968070064403579098"><span>sprays feature new character</span></a><span> Wuyang playing competitive </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>at his computer, and Venture and Juno posing back-to-back. Both sprays reference the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-champions-series-owcs-owl-esports-dreamhack-1851189732"><span>Overwatch Esports</span></a><span> organization, with its logo included on the heroes’ clothes and computer. After they were revealed, some fans started </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@inklionart/video/7551148691952864543"><span>accusing Blizzard of using generative AI in </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i></a><span> to create these sprays, as well as </span><a href="https://x.com/ougidraws/status/1968109749507072419"><span>explaining which details about the sprays</span></a><span> they felt gave them away as the product of AI. Well, we asked Blizzard if this is the case, and the company says that both sprays were made by a human artist.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Overwatch is ABSOLUTELY using AI, LOOK AT THE EYES <a href="https://t.co/Wsl7Q95qSN">pic.twitter.com/Wsl7Q95qSN</a></p> <p>— Juno 🍐 COMMISSIONS OPEN (2/2) (@DewEnjoyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/DewEnjoyer/status/1968131210951241935?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“The sprays referenced are artist-made,” a Blizzard spokesperson said in a statement to </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>When these accusations started flying around social media in places like X and TikTok, some </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>haters </span><span>were more than willing to jump on the bandwagon, but several others argued that calling things out as AI art based on small nitpicks is only detrimental to the cause of protesting AI slop in favor of supporting artists, because you might be mistaken, distort others’ perception of what is and isn’t AI-generated, and then the artists whose work is mischaracterized as AI are left with that controversy on their public record. Though yes, AI art is a plague on this planet and we should absolutely speak out against companies using it instead of hiring real artists, firing the accusation from the hip ultimately risks throwing the very artists you claim to be advocating for under the bus. Now, a Blizzard artist or maybe a contractor has seen people assume their work isn’t their own, that it isn’t even the work of a human being, and is instead the product of an algorithm scraping other artists’ portfolios.</span></p> <p><span>I sympathize with the fear that your favorite thing might become lost to the slop machine. </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>is one of my favorite games, and I play it just about every day, largely because I love the work Blizzard’s creative team has put into bringing these characters to life. But vigilance shouldn’t turn these conversations into witch hunts where the artists whose work we want to support takes collateral damage. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There is a new roguelite deckbuilder chugging its way into town in the form of Fogpiercer, which is being developed by Mad Cookies Studio and published by Hooded Horse. Fogpiercer is set in a post apocalyptic world where the trains still run, but are the targets of bandits who want whatever the train carriages are carrying. Your mission is to fight off these bandits and get the train to safety.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fogpiercer - Announcement Trailer | Roguelite Deckbuilder On a Train" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OuEIQH6AsCU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The announcement trailer of Fogpiercer shows how the game works in practice. As you can see, the train has its set route to take, making it easy for bandits to roll up in their own vehicles and attack. However, the nature of this deckbuilder means you can equip the train with different carriages, and each of those as their own deck. These decks contain various cards that equip the train with offensive and defensive capabilities. Each ability has its own way of dealing with enemies, with some forcing enemies to crash into each other or get caught under the train. As the train chugs along, you will need to pick the route to travel, with different dangers presenting themselves.</p>
<p>If you are interested in Fogpiercer, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219010/Fogpiercer/">there is a demo available on Steam</a>. Fogpiercer is due out in 2026 for PC.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> (Yoshi-P) intends to work on the game "for at least a good while", even as he works on other projects within <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zydl9wAQuc">Noisy Pixel</a> at Pax West, Yoshida discussed what keeps him working on the MMORPG after 12 years, to which he described himself as "more of a businessman" than a creative person.</p>
<p>"People tend to say we're creators or creative, but I am an employee at Square Enix and I receive money to make games," he said, "and I think my primary purpose is to make games so that we are delivering it to gamers out there, fans, players that want to consume our product. I think that is fundamental or a minimum requirement that I have because I belong to this company."</p>

<p>He continued that designers working in a company and feeling bored should remove themselves from a corporate environment, but he doesn't "have that strong personal desire to go into my own creative things".</p>
<p>"So when asked, do I ever get bored with Final Fantasy 14?" Yoshida concluded. "I don't think so, because there are a lot of things that I have yet to actualise in 14, things that I want to do, things that I must do, things that require to be taken care of. And so I think for at least a good while, I should be ok."</p><p>Yoshida added he wishes to do less "management or operational things", joking he may be scolded for his response. "I already do a lot of game developing and I've sacrificed some sleep sometimes," he said, "but perhaps if I were to have a choice, I would like to focus in on the game development design."</p>
<p>Yoshida is best known for his work on Final Fantasy 14, but in recent years has been pulled into other projects. Yoshida heads up Square Enix's Creative Business Unit 3, responsible for the MMORPG as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> and the forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>: The Ivalice Chronicles. He was also co-producer on Fantasian: Neo Dimension.</p>
<p>In another interview at Pax West, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-naoki-yoshida-wants-players-to-stop-sending-developers-demoralising-abuse">Yoshida requested players stop sending developers demoralising abuse</a>.</p>
<p>"I want to emphasise here, there is a person behind the games," he said. "While I understand some harsh criticism might be necessary sometimes, there's a person behind the games that you enjoy and if you have that harsh criticism, I think we would want to have it be constructive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I am exhausted this week, and that’s only slightly because I’ve repeatedly been up until the wee hours of the morning playing a bunch of video games for review. Chief among them has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/frostpunk-2-console-review/">Frostpunk 2</a> on console, which is such an incredible game, made only slightly more annoying by playing with a controller. Other than that, I didn’t really get on with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review/">Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</a>, which feels lacking the same soul as previous Sonic kart racers, but I’ve quietly enjoyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/19/formula-legends-review/">Formula Legends</a>, even if it is a bit limited.</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played the slightly worrying heading to the hospital for an op game, but has happily come out the other side of it, and his nose only flashed a couple of times so the doctor probably did a fairly good job. He told us, “I’ve got back into Breath of Fire II on my Retroid and really enjoying the benefits of a fast-forward feature for the random battles.” Besides that, he’s hoping to get back to reviewing, at least as soon as he can sit in a chair again.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> is working on Ghost of Yotei, and that’s literally all he’s allowed to say about that, so we’ll move on to <strong>Jim</strong> finished Sword of the Sea, saying, “It offers some great visual set pieces but little in the way of compelling gameplay as you cruise around levels, interacting with the occasional node to make water (and marine life) suddenly appear. I was left a little disappointed, as I was expecting something more in line with The Pathless, or even an evolution of that format.”</p>
<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has been playing Final Fantasy Tactics: Chronicles of Ivalice for review, and you can find out what he thinks about that next Wednesday. While that’s been going on, <strong>Jason</strong> has been playing a lot of Borderlands 4, saying, “I’ve managed to not experience any bugs, and am really enjoying it. It’s a bit leap from previous games, and with more fluid movement and a strong roster of Vault Hunters and NPCs, it’s just a really good time all around.”</p>


<p>Next up was Ade, telling us that “between bouts of Marvel Rivals I played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-sacred-tree-review/">Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</a> for review, which offers a surprisingly innovative take on the standard Hades formula. Also, I’ve spent a frankly shocking amount of my overall leisure time painting my Castigator battle tank for Warhammer 40k!”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/dying-light-the-beast-review/">Dying Light The Beast</a>, Discounty, and Rise of Industry for review. That’s not all though, as he’s been watching Blippo+ which he says is, “Indescribable”.</p>

<p>Continuing the slate of upcoming reviews, <strong>Laura</strong> has been solving all the mysteries this week: a bit of murder in Egypt in the 70’s alongside Poirot in her review of Agatha Christie’s Death on the Nile, and solving all sorts of haunting cases in 17th century New England in Banishers Ghosts of New Eden!</p>
<p>It’s been a busy week for <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, who’s been playing the immersive sim “I have a real job again”. He says, “While it’s interesting and I am enjoying wandering through the realistic render of Canary Wharf, I kinda miss just getting up, walking doggos, writing music and not having to care about anything. Will be seeking out the Sugar Daddy DLC pack so I can return to that.”</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;what has <strong>Tef</strong> played? Well, there was some Strange Antiquities for review later today, a brief refresher of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-preview-torpor-less-in-seattle/">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> for his Gamescom preview, and he finished a jaunt through the DLC for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/16/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-whips-up-a-mini-matinee-adventure/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which was a nice bitesized adventure.</p>
<p>What about you, what have you played this week?</p>

<p>Set in Ireland in the year 1897, players take on the role of Detective Declan Ward who has been summoned to solve the case of the disappearance of Evelyn Deane. The case is going to be tough especially when it is Halloween, you are surrounded by mystics gathered for a séance, and the unexplainable situations that plague the investigation. The gameplay consists of speaking to the other people gathered on the island, observing the events that are taking place, and being in the right place at the right time. Time is not a luxury Declan has due to the guests going about their day, so if you are not in certain places you may miss vital evidence that could help solve the case.</p>

<p>In our preview of The Séance of Blake Manor, Stefan wrote, <em>“Having such a broad cast of characters to investigate, it will be fascinating to see how this gels with the game’s time limit. Certainly, there’s an implication from my brief game over that you need to not only save Miss Deane, but also save people from attending the séance. This is absolutely one to watch for fans of mysteries and puzzles.”</em></p>

            <p>
There was really only one way to enhance the prospect of an Antarctic open world game with a choice of playable penguins that's actually a fractious retelling of Lovecraft's Mountains of Madness, created by the developers of Umurangi Generation. And that one way was to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/veselekov.bsky.social/post/3lz56tdcfg22z">hire Lenval Brown</a>, narrator for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>'s special edition, to voice the first proper trailer. And also, make the trailer look a lot like John Carpenter's The Thing. No further words from me are needed or desired. Find the footage below.

<p>
I have been informed by management that being a website editor, I am contractually obliged to provide further words. So be it! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-next-for-the-umurangi-generation-devs-why-a-game-about-penguins-and-people-going-mad-on-a-mountain-of-course">Announced in June</a>, Penguin Colony is a short narrative adventure in which an explorer thrown outside Time by the Old Ones seeks aid by possessing or manipulating the local penguins. You will slide and slip around the surface of the bergs and also, travel deep beneath the ice, which is generally not a great place to be in anything Lovecraftian.
</p>
<p>
This being a game from the people behind Umurangi Generation, a brilliant political artwork which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-cant-stop-snapping-umurangi-generations-dazzling-jet-set-radio-cityscape">deals in themes of decolonization from the perspective of a Māori shutterbug</a>, I imagine there will be some critique of Lovecraft's notions about foreign parts and people. I don't have the linguistic knowledge to confirm this, but based on some quick online research, part of the trailer also appears to be voiced in Māori.
</p><p>
The last penguin game I had the pleasure of was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/faaast-penguin">Faaast Penguin</a>, which Brendy (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/faaast-penguin-is-that-super-mario-64-level-where-you-race-a-penguin-except-now-the-penguin-is-39-other-players">summarised</a> as "that Super Mario 64 level where you race a penguin except now the penguin is 39 other players". There are no Old Ones in Faaast Penguin, but it did launch <em>almost exactly a year ago to the day</em> - a temporal alignment that surely reflects the dire intervention of some cosmic Cthulhuin or Penghulu, tracing cryptic sentences with its immense pygostyle (tail bone) upon the snows of unreality. 
</p>
<p>
While researching penguin anatomy in order to construct that stupid skit about the penguin god, I discovered that a "penguin diagram" is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_diagram">some kind of quantum field McGuffin</a> referring to the "flavours" of "quarks". Coincidence? None of this is coincidence, foolish child! The universe is ending and Lenval Brown is here to preside over the collapse. Let's see if we can distil any further cortex-flensing insight from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3695930/Penguin_Colony/">Steam page</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Unlock different penguins to replay the game as," it comments. "Different penguins have different abilities and challenges. For example playing as a baby penguin means you can fit in smaller gaps but you cannot swim."
</p>
<p>
Well, that seems harmless enough. Please try to distract yourself from the coming doom by telling me which is your favourite penguin. If you wrote anything other than Rockhopper then sorry, you are wrong. Alternatively, exacerbate your awareness of the coming doom by rewatching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAoONl2P8fw">Thingu</a>.

		<p>The most premium of games which is only for premium players, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a>, is absolutely great and there’s nothing wrong with it, it’s your PC that’s rubbish and you don’t know how to configure it. That’s what <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/16/randy-pitchford-reminds-you-that-borderlands-4-is-a-premium-game-made-for-premium-gamers/">Randy Pritchford say</a>s so we can all ignore the statement released by Gearbox that states:</p>
<p>“We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes. We hear you. Updates to improve stability and performance already started rolling out over the weekend and another is coming. This is our top priority.”</p>



<p data-start="0" data-end="456">Look, folks, let me tell you something very important about Borderlands 4—it runs beautifully.&nbsp; Everybody’s saying it’s one of the smoothest, most incredible games ever made. No performance issues, none. The people trying to say otherwise? Fake news. They’re the same people who always want to tear down great American entertainment, the same tired critics like Jimmy Kimmel, a bad man, who has been wrong about everything from the beginning. Believe me.</p>
<p data-start="458" data-end="780">Borderlands 4 is fast, it’s sharp, it looks amazing—better than anyone thought possible. The developers did a tremendous job, maybe the best job ever. Everybody’s talking about how great it feels, how stable it is, how much fun they’re having. And you know what? They’re right. Because it works perfectly. Zero problems.</p>

<p data-start="782" data-end="1180" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The fake news media doesn’t want you to enjoy it, they want to make up stories about “frame drops” or “performance problems.” Total lies. Don’t believe them. Ask the gamers, ask the fans—they’ll tell you the truth. Borderlands 4 is a massive success, running flawlessly, and people are loving it more than ever before. It’s a big, beautiful win. And we’re not going to let fake news take that away.</p>
<p data-start="782" data-end="1180" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">You know me, I like a border, big beautiful borders with big fences and to keep the robotic pyschos out of my game. We need more Borderlands like this because it’s the biggliest and best Borderlands ever.</p>

		<p>A new video for Football Manager 26 has been released by Sports Interactive, and the core subject is the introduction of women’s football to the series. The video shows how Sports Interactive has incorporated women’s football into Football Manager, confirming there will be 14 leagues across 11 countries with WSL and WSL2 among those leagues. Women’s football has been fully integrated into the game, allowing players to have both men and women’s league active in their games, or you can choose to play either men’s football or women’s football only.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 26 | Introducing Women's Football" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zjJ39Hd-O-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The women’s football database will include over 40,000 players as well, making it the biggest women’s football database in any game. Women’s player stats are equivalent to the men’s stats, but also within the context of the women’s game. Sports Interactive has gone further with animations with women footballers being used to motion capture movements, so the on the pitch action resembles close to the reality of how women play football. Sports Interactive has also confirmed that this is just the first step for women’s football in the Football Manager series, with the database set to expand and the experience to get more depth in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/10/football-manager-26-releases-on-november-4th/">Sports Interactive recently confirmed that Football Manager 26 releases on November 4th</a> for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, Game Pass, and mobile exclusively through Netflix. Football Manager 26 Touch will launch on December 4th for Switch.</p>

            <p>To invert or not to invert? The question of whether to flip the Y-axis in games is often answered with recollections of childhood habits and/or varyingly smug declarations of which joystick setting is 'better'. Now, though, a cognitive research study posits that our control preferences are less about whether or not we played GoldenEye after school and more about the innate quirks of our brains.</p>
<p>As reported by Keith Stuart at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/sep/18/why-do-some-gamers-invert-their-controls-scientists-now-have-answers-but-theyre-not-what-you-think">The Guardian</a>, Dr Jennifer Corbett and Dr Jaap Munneke’s <a href="https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-025-00626-5">paper</a> 'Why axis inversion? Optimizing interactions between users, interfaces, and visual displays in 3D environments' details their experiments into control inversion choices. After answering a questionnaire about whether and why they think they use invert controls or not, participants were tasked to, as Corbett puts it, "mentally rotate random shapes, take on the perspective of an 'avatar' object in a picture, determine which way something was tilted in differently tilted backgrounds, and overcome the typical '<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/simon-effect">Simon effect</a>' where it’s harder to respond when a target is on the opposite v the same side of the screen as the response button."</p>
<p>These experiments, the study claims, indicated that none of the participants’ stated reasons for rejecting or embracing inversion "had anything to do" with their actual choice. "It turns out," Corbett says, "the most predictive out of all the factors we measured was how quickly gamers could mentally rotate things and overcome the Simon effect. The faster they were, the less likely they were to invert. People who said they sometimes inverted were by far the slowest on these tasks."</p>
<p>Or, as Stuart puts it, "It’s much more likely that you invert or don’t invert due to how your brain perceives objects in 3D space." And the speed factor doesn’t mean that electing to invert is a skill issue either, as the study adds that while non-inverters would flip their images at a faster pace, they’d make more mistakes than the cautious inverters, resulting in an overall equal accuracy rate.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>I suspect my C grade in GCSE Biology isn’t quite enough to let me give a learned interpretation of these findings, but it sure sounds like the desire to invert is based mainly on unconscious brainworkings – hardly sure footing for any "No, MY way is better" reasoning. Though on a personal level it’s nice to know, as someone who’s always inverted the Y axis on thumbstick controls but can’t remember a reason why, that I don’t actually <em>need</em> a reason. It’s just how I perceive objects in 3D space, guys. I shall continue to go around gaming trade shows, flipping the sticks at all the demo booths and forgetting to reset them, thus leaving a trail of harmless inconveniences like a hallway full of slightly tilted paintings. And it’ll all be fine, because it was basically an accident of birth.</p><p>Then again, the study doesn’t entirely reject the impact of learned behaviour, and in fact suggests we try practicing the opposite of our control preference – just in case we’ve convinced ourselves to stick with a method that isn't a cognitive match.</p>
<p>"Non-inverters should give inversion a try – and inverters should give non-inversion another shot," Corbett argues. "You might even want to force yourself to stick with it for a few hours. People have learned one way. That doesn’t mean they won’t learn another way even better.</p>
<p>"A good example is being left-handed. Until the mid-20th century, left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand, causing some people to have lifelong handwriting difficulties and learning problems. Many older adults still don’t realise they’re naturally left-handed and could write/draw much better if they switched back."</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I’m running a quick test of something on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, I leave the Y-axis uninverted just because I can’t be bothered to delve into the menus to change it. Does that count?</p>

            <p>Nintendo has argued mods shouldn't be recognised as "prior art", and therefore are irrelevant to its ongoing lawsuit with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> creator Pocketpair.</p>
<p>As part of its defence against alleged copyright infringement of the Pokémon games, Pocketpair has pointed to mods as an example of prior art that would invalidate Nintendo's patent claims. Specifically, it highlighted the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/690?tab=description">Pocket Souls</a> Pokémon mod for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>, which allows players to capture and battle with enemies in the game.</p>
<p>Now, in a response spotted by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/gross-in-palworld-patent-case-nintendo-tells-japanese-judge-mods-should-not-count-as-prior-art-because-they-cant-run-without-underlying-games/">Game Fray</a>, Nintendo is disputing the defence because it believes mods don't stand on their own as they require an original game to run on. As such, mods shouldn't be subject to patent infringement in the same way Palworld is.</p>

<p>As Game Fray points out, game makers often look to mods for inspiration, so Pocketpair's defence should be valid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/nintendo-reportedly-gets-even-more-obnoxious-about-patent-law-by-taking-a-mods-arent-real-games-stance-against-a-dark-souls-3-mod-that-could-invalidate-its-palworld-lawsuit/">PC Gamer</a> reported Japanese courts have a history of siding with patent lawsuit defendants able to present examples of prior art. That's why Pocketpair is using Pokémon-themed mods as such an example, which Nintendo is now attempting to invalidate.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">Nintendo was granted a patent in the US</a> based on the gameplay mechanic of summoning a sub-character to fight another, which covers whether the summoned character battles on player input or automatically.</p>
<p>Games industry lawyer Richard Hoeg told Eurogamer the patent is "enforceable in so far as it has been granted, but Nintendo likely knows it 'got away with one' here and would prefer not to make a court actually sign off."</p>
<p>Don McGowan, former chief legal officer at The Pokémon Company, meanwhile, believes the patent will likely be ignored.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">Pocketpair has disputed Nintendo's claims</a> as part of the ongoing lawsuit, but has already accommodated changes to Palworld.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pocketpair-to-fix-jank-in-hugely-successful-pokemon-alike-palworld-as-it-pushes-past-nintendos-controversial-lawsuit-towards-full-10-release-in-2026">Palworld is also heading towards a 1.0 release</a> next year as it aims to fix "jank".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/formula-legends-review.1302342/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Codemasters might have the official F1 license, but that hasn’t stopped indie developers from creating their own take on the premier racing class. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/12/new-star-gp-review/">New Star GP</a> drew on classic Sega arcade racing thrills last year, but speeding toward a fierce braking zone is Formula Legends, the fresh-faced rookie, which has taken the hard-nosed, serious sport and given it a cute, hyper-deformed makeover, all the while attempting to retain the competitive racing action of its inspiration. It’s a pretty successful attempt too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Formula Legends - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IgUCx--1qfs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Formula Legends is not officially licensed by the FIA, so there’s no official drivers, no official constructors, and no official tracks. What there is, however, is a roster of drivers inspired by their real-life counterparts, so you can welcome Danny Ricchiordi and Luis Hammerton to the sport, rather than Daniel Ricciardo and Lewis Hamilton. You can laugh your little socks off at Batteri Voltas and Charlie Lacreme, or just enjoy my personal favourite, Hans Troll, simply because of how much it might annoy Lance… or more probably his dad.</p>


<p>Formula Legends takes you through the history of F1, through a lightly distorted lens. Starting in the 1960s, the central Story Mode offers a range of races in each era, providing a taste of the different cars, steadily improving technology, and the changes to the layout of each track over the years.</p>
<p>While they’re not allowed to use the official names for each location, the different tracks and their alternate layouts across the decades are close enough to their real-world inspirations to let you pick out the sweeping curves of Spa-Francorchamps and the iconic setting at Monza. They’re definitely ‘inspired by’ though, so if you think you know the Melbourne Park circuit like the back of the hand, you might need to prepare to stare questioningly at the skin there. In some cases the tracks are mirrored too, presumably to avoid too many angry looks from license holders, so you come away with a flavour of the sport, rather than a full course.</p>


<p>The little F1 race cars we get in Formula Legends are undoubtedly cute to look at, but they’re almost as difficult to drive as the real thing. Dropping things down to Easy, alongside a couple of driving assists for braking and traction control, will likely see you whizz by the competition, and Formula Legends becomes wholly approachable here. Meanwhile, playing on Normal really ramps the difficulty up, and it’s a welcome and rewarding challenge where track knowledge and braking points need to be spot on. The Hard setting following that isn’t as much of a leap, but you will need to drive more or less flawlessly to be in with a chance of a podium.</p>
<p>The AI drivers won’t make that very easy. To say that they’re aggressive would be to downplay just how little they care about whose corner it is, and you’ll be glad to discover that damage is a health bar, rather than individual pace-wrecking components. They’re not really all that smart, and you’ll see them careening off at various points, but when Logan Sargeant was still in the sport up until a year ago, that remains fairly realistic.</p>
<p>I really enjoy Formula Legends handling model. It’s undoubtedly an arcade racer, and they feel more like the toy cars they look like than open-wheel race cars, but once you’ve got into the flow of things, sweeping around corners with surety becomes second nature. You can’t treat it like a simulation, and if you do, you’ll actually come off far worse than you might expect.</p>
<p>There are some interesting nods to realism though, including having to select the right tyres, coping with their degradation, and conducting pitstops. These involve a fun little mini-game where you have to match the right button press, all the while repairing and refuelling your car, before mashing the analogue stick buttons in, and it definitely adds to the experience, especially in a tight race. Alongside that, the attention to detail given to each era is a real treat, from the sepia tones and the pitstop tents of the early years through to the inclusion of BRS – definitely not DRS – in the modern age.</p>

<p>Formula Legends is a small-scale taste of F1, and that becomes more apparent the longer you spend with it. There are no multiplayer modes here, whether local or online, and that’s a real shame for an approachable arcade racer. Equally, there are only 14 tracks, and while that number is buoyed by the different renditions of them across each era, they are fundamentally the same track. When the sport has expanded as far as it has, with sprint races and 24 race seasons, that means there’s some obvious gaps.</p>
<p>Those gaps continue onto the grid, so races host 14 cars, rather than the 20 we’re used to, and the maximum championship length you can create is 14 too – fine if you want to recreate a season from the 1980s, but limited for the modern sport. I’d really like the option of multi-season championships, and racers moving about, but that’s clearly not what Formula Legends is designed for. This is an indie game created with a genuine love for the sport, and it offers a wholly different take from its peers.</p>
<p>Performance on PS5 is generally very good, with crisp, clear visuals that make the most of the cute art design. There’s the tiniest hint of pop in, but it fades into the distance so much that you won’t notice while you’re concentrating on the more immediate racing line. We did also get to check out the Nintendo Switch version, and that’s a wholly different story, with glaring pop-in, massively reduced resolution, and the lack of analogue triggers causing all sorts of issues. Make sure to pick up the PC, PS5 or Xbox versions, and cross your fingers for a Switch 2 update…</p>

			<p>German independent developer Shin'en Games announced that The Touryst Deluxe will be released digitally on the Nintendo Switch 2 next week, on September 25. Pre-orders are already open via the Nintendo eShop at $19.99, and owners of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-touryst-renders-at-6k-4k-on-xbox-series-x-s-it-almost-looks-like-a-good-cgi-movie-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Touryst</a> for the original Switch can upgrade for $4.99.</p>



<p>Compared to the original title (which launched in late 2019 for the Switch before making it to PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5), The Touryst Deluxe will add a new arcade game, new items, new quest, and improved visuals. On the 'docked' or TV mode, it will run at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, while handheld mode runs at 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second. Now, it should be noted that this is by no means a heavy game to run. In fact, it already ran at 4K resolution on the Xbox Series S back in 2020.</p>



<p>Finally, the studio confirmed that users will have the option to import existing save data from The Touryst.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Here's a brief overview of The Touryst, courtesy of the developer:</p>



<p><em>You are just arriving at the Monument Islands. Want to go swimming? Or rather take a dive into the deep sea? Or do you want to visit the amusement arcade, do some shopping, dance at the beach party? Fancy some surfing? Or will you talk with the strange old tourist and listen what he has to say about these ancient mysterious monuments..</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Discover exotic islands and explore ancient monuments</em></li>



<li><em>Climb into deep mines and uncover secret passages</em></li>



<li><em>Make the trip you always wanted and enjoy the tourist life</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The Touryst Deluxe will be the second game released by Shin'en for the Nintendo Switch 2 after the launch title <a href="https://wccftech.com/fast-fusion-nintendo-switch-2-q-new-hd-rumble-is-very-impressive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAST FUSION</a>, which also runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with HDR support.</p>

            <p>The great 'dematuring' of videogames continues with reports that Valve are now forbidding "post-launch NSFW content" for games on Steam, even those that are already "adult-only". That's according to Crimson Delight Games, the developers of fantasy RPG Tales of Legendary Lust: Aphrodisia. They launched it on September 15th with adult content warnings, after submitting it to Valve's review process in August, and had planned to add sexy scenes through updates while working on a big DLC expansion for 2026. 
</p>
<p>These updates are not going to happen anymore, apparently because everybody's favourite PG-rated cartoon villains, global payment networks, are putting pressure on Valve. Instead, the updates will need to be submitted as proper official DLC so that Valve can give them a formal review.</p> <!--more-->
<p>This will likely mean more work for the devs and potentially, release delays, compared to the relative ease of publishing an update or patch - as Valve <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/updates">explain in their FAQ</a>, "Steam makes it easy to patch your game or add content at any time that you need to in order to best serve your audience on your schedule".
</p>
<p>"We were told all new adult content for our game has to go through DLC, presumably so it can be reviewed and approved," the developers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1nio69j/valve_no_longer_allows_postlaunch_nsfw_content/">wrote in response to a Reddit post</a> about the situation this week. We don't know the inner workings of Valve / Steam, but we're in a couple of NSFW dev communities and these new rules weren't in place before the Collective Shout uproar and subsequent payment processors' censorship."
</p><p>If you're new to Collective Shout, they're an Australian activist group who campaign against "the objectification of women and sexualisation of girls in media, advertising and popular culture", and are also affiliated with conservative groups who campaign against sex work and pornography at large.</p>
<p>Back in July, Collective Shout <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">claimed credit</a> for stampeding Mastercard, Visa and other payment processing companies and networks into forbidding the transaction of a vast number of sexually themed or otherwise "NSFW" adult games on Steam and Itch, including a lot of games from queer developers. Collective Shout have yet to properly explain which individual games they consider unfit for sale and why.
</p>
<p>Steam and Itch have now changed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">their</a> <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">policies</a> to give the payment networks some control over what counts as acceptable "adult" material. They have also delisted or removed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy">a lot</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">of games</a>, with Itch electing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-are-seeking-out-new-payment-processors-who-are-more-comfortable-with-adult-material">seek out new payment partners</a> while revising their catalogue. Valve are reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-appear-to-be-blocking-mature-themed-games-from-steam-early-access-release">denying the release of "mature" games under Steam early access</a>, possibly because (to echo Crimson Delight's point above) the platform holder needs to be able to review the finished work before approving it for sale. I say 'reportedly' and 'possibly' because Valve still haven't made a formal comment on these recent events. I'll ask them again now.
</p>
<p>In the Reddit thread about the rejected NSFW updates, Crimson Delight have only good things to say about Valve's handling of the situation. "I have to say the reviewer was kind and forthcoming, we didn't feel threatened or bullied in any way, and we got the feeling they were trying to do their best to help devs navigate the process," developer Frenzin writes. "But the fact of the matter is that Valve has payment processors breathing down their neck, and the rules keep getting stricter as time goes on." 
</p><p>"Valve isn't the problem here," Frenzin continues. "The big credit card companies are. If anything, Valve has stood up to them and pushed back. They could've simply nuked the 18+ section of Steam, but they didn't, they stuck up for developers. Obviously adult games make Valve money, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the rest of Steam's catalogue. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> itself probably earned Valve more than most NSFW titles put together.
</p>
<p>"Given that we're erogame devs, we're against any sort of censorship (as long as the content isn't sexualizing minors or nonconsensual in any way)," the developer comments. "But it's important to understand where the real problem lies, and it's not with Valve."
</p>
<p>My very Lukewarm Take regarding the on-going NSFW/mature game crackdown is that people should be allowed to get their rocks off to whatever responsibly created fictitious media they choose in the absence of evidence that they are doing harm, and large finance corporations with no actual mandate to serve the public interest shouldn't <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">play the part of moral sentinel</a>.
</p>
<p>I'd flesh that argument out with reference to Tales of Legendary Lust, but my efforts are hindered by the UK's new Online Safety Act, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-now-require-uk-steam-users-to-verify-their-ages-using-a-credit-card">requires me to verify my age</a> to visit the game's Steam page and visit the developer's subreddit (thanks to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/games-on-steam-can-no-longer-be-updated-with-nsfw-content-post-launch-but-valve-isnt-the-problem-developer-says/">Automaton</a> for being the messenger). I don't have a credit card for Steam verification, and Reddit's camera age verification widget seems to think that my age defies categorisation. Which, you know, fair dos. You can find a SFW version of the game on <a href="https://crimsondelightgames.itch.io/tales-of-legendary-lust-aphrodisia-sfw">Itch</a>, though.</p>

            <p><a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">A patch for Borderlands 4</a> has gone live on PC, which claims to address many of the crashes plaguing the game. Specifically, crashes related to animation states, audio, collision checks, and "various" GPU-related things. Basically everything, then.</p>
<p>The patch also irons out kinks affecting the Gilded Glory pre-order bonus pack, which was conflicting with the Reward Center in the game. This fix will also be coming to the console versions of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> in "the coming days" (I expect verification procedures have slowed its release down).</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 was released last week and, though popular, faced backlash for poor performance on PC. Boisterous Gearbox Software boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/randy-pitchford-advises-borderlands-4-players-to-get-a-refund-if-theyre-not-happy-with-it-as-social-media-tirade-defending-pc-performance-continues">Randy Pitchford since spent the week defending against complaints</a> on social media about it. There are fixes in the works, he confirmed, but he argued that Borderlands 4 was never designed to be a twitchy high-frame shooter like those in the competitive genre, so will never perform in that way - not unless you made graphical trade-offs to enable it.</p>
<p>Our Borderlands 4 review is in the works, by the way.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Change List:</h2>
