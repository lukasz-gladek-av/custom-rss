  <p id="pC3IeD"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a> is having a Bounsweet Community Day event on<strong> Sunday, May 19, from 2-5 p.m. in your local time</strong>.</p>
<p id="dnBcPc">As expected with a Community Day event,<strong> Bounsweet </strong>will spawn in huge numbers with a high chance for it to appear shiny. There are also several other bonuses and perks, which we’ve list out below.</p>
<hr id="sH67yG">
<h2 id="JHxyzU"><strong>How do I catch a shiny Bounsweet?</strong></h2>
<p id="ZGv7YR">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), Shiny rates on Community Days are about 1 in 24, which means that if you keep playing throughout the three-hour window, you should find quite a few shiny Pokémon.</p>

<p id="JqBuiK">If you’re short on time or Poké Balls, you can pop an <strong>Incense</strong>, then quickly <strong>tap each Bounsweet </strong>to check for shiny ones, running from any that aren’t shiny. Notably, any Bounsweet you’ve already tapped will face where your player is standing, so that should help you identify which ones you may have already checked.</p>
<hr id="fCZXnK">
<h2 id="Rck3HW"><strong>What Community Day move does Bounsweet’s evolution learn?</strong></h2>
<p id="P33K1t">If you evolve Steenee into Tsareena between 2 p.m. until 10 p.m. in your local time, it will learn the charged move <strong>High Jump Kick</strong>.</p>
<p id="pcrxXf">If you miss out on evolving it during this period, you will likely be able to evolve it during a Community Day weekend event in December to get High Jump Kick. If you don’t want to wait, you can use an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22557832/tm-elite-fast-charged-best-use-how-to-get-technical-machines">Elite TM</a> to get the move.</p>
<hr id="sJ5mE8">
<h2 id="PRBqBQ"><strong>How does Tsareena do in the meta?</strong></h2>
<p id="UnfEw0">In terms of PvE (raids and gyms), Tsareena is behind the usual powerful attackers like Kartana and most shadow and Mega starters (Mega Sceptile, Mega Venusaur, Shadow Venusaur, Shadow Torterra — you get the gist). However, it sits among Roserade and Chesnaught in terms of power. So if you usually use these two and don’t have the resources to invest into Megas, Legendaries, and Shadows, then Tsareena is worth having with <strong>Magical Leaf </strong>and <strong>Grass Knot</strong>.</p>
<p id="Ome1FM">While High Jump Kick will give Tsareena some range in PvP, it’s still likely not worth using outside of specialized cups and tournaments.</p>
<hr id="wsHYws">
<h2 id="rVGJO4"><strong>How do I make the most of Bounsweet Community Day?</strong></h2>
<p id="VP2Yku">The following bonuses will be active during Bounsweet Community Day:</p>
<ul>
<li id="IH0sir">
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> hatch distance for eggs placed into Incubators during the event</li>
<li id="ygtKvn">Doubled candy for catching Pokémon</li>
<li id="IlHTnG">Doubled chance for level 31+ trainers to get XL candy from catching Pokémon</li>
<li id="PF2Fbg">Incense lasts three hours</li>
<li id="R4eQq7">Lure Modules lasts three hours</li>
<li id="Kt1oY9">Bounsweet special photobombs when taking snapshots</li>
<li id="3l86uP">One additional special trade</li>
<li id="QaoYEy">Stardust cost halved for trading</li>
</ul>
<p id="kOd6mO">That said, you should definitely put your eggs in Incubators and pop an Incense and try to nab some powerful Bounsweet.</p>
<p id="tLRqH5">If you can <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22447919/mega-evolution-list-candy-bonus-buddy-raids"><strong>Mega Evolve</strong></a> <strong>Venusaur, Sceptile, Groudon, or Abomasnow</strong>, you’ll score additional Bounsweet Candy per catch.</p>
<p id="mfZjRH">In addition to all this, Niantic is still running special four-star raids from 5-10 p.m., where if you clear the Steenee raid, Bounsweet will spawn in a 300-meter radius around the gym for 30 minutes. These raids cannot be done remotely. If the usual 2-5 p.m. spawn increase doesn’t get you the Bounsweet you wanted, you can try raiding for another chance.</p>

            <p>Seablip is a pixel art pirate 'em up, which promises an open world to sail around, islands to visit, crews to hire, bounties to hunt, and minigames through which to uncover treasure and fish. It looks adorable and it's out in Early Access now.

<p>The bit that always interests me most in games like these is the crew management, because I like looking after little guys. The sailors in Seablip sound as if they have a fair amount going on: there's a finite number of them so you've an incentive to keep them alive and happy, and they each have skills and attributes that'll change as they go through fights.
</p>
<p>There seems to be quite a few pirate 'em ups that split the game into distinct activities, which I'm assuming is thanks to Sid Meier's influence, and you can guess the way they link together. Winning fights and chasing down bounties provides resources for hiring crew and upgrading your ship which in turn helps you win fights and you get the idea.
</p>
<p>Watching the trailer for Seablip above gave me a full, Ratatouille-like zoom to a memory of playing Puzzle Pirates nearly twenty years ago. Puzzle Pirates is <a href="https://www.puzzlepirates.com/">still going</a>, I discovered! It's a pirate MMO where every activity is a different puzzle game and it was colourful and cosy in a way Seablip seems reminiscent of, in vibe if not substance.
</p>
<p>You'll find Seablip <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471270/Seablip/">on Steam</a> where it's £11.51/€13.31/$13.49. It's aiming for a full release next year.</p>

<p>In a recent blog post, Ubisoft outlined the monetisation plans for XDefiant, the soon-to-launch first-person shooter that’s totally free to play. As you might expect, there will be plenty of optional purchases in XDefiant, but Ubisoft has pledged that there will be no ‘pay-to-win’ mechanics. The full breakdown provided below details how your money can be spent in XDefiant.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-amazing-customisation-options">‘Amazing Customisation Options’</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/1Xg1YrL6SEcqcuTDNIYSGz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft has stressed</a> a critical point by stating boldly that there will be no pay-to-win elements in XDefiant. It was confirmed that any ‘gameplay-impacted content’ can be both purchased and earned in-game, which means that users can either get their hands on something immediately or grind the game and unlock it over time.</p>



<p>XDefiant will reward players for investing their time and effort into the game, it was revealed. That means that even going on a losing streak will reward you with experience points and content. Here are the kinds of rewards you’ll unlock for progressing through the game:</p>



<ul>
<li>Battle Pass Rewards</li>



<li>In-Game Challenges</li>



<li>Ubisoft Connect Challenges</li>



<li>Weapon Mastery</li>



<li>Participation Rewards</li>
</ul>



<p>Ubisoft then confirmed that customisation is at the heart of the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our goal is to be providing amazing customisation options that reward all of the matches, victories, and even defeats that you put into the game. We know being able to display your identity as a player is important, and so customization will be key to the XDefiant experience.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To that end, players will be able to both unlock and purchase:</p>



<ul>
<li>Character Skins</li>



<li>Weapon Skins</li>



<li>MVP Player Animations</li>



<li>Player Cards</li>



<li>Emoji Packs</li>
</ul>



<p>Players will also be prompted to purchase a premium battle pass when they start playing XDefiant – but there will also be a free pathway that’ll reward players with <strong>less prestigious </strong>unlocks. </p>



<p>Are you going to invest any extra money in XDefiant?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout London Team Hopes It Won’t Be Long Now Before Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-team-hopes-it-wont-be-long-now-before-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-london-team-hopes-it-won%E2%80%99t-be-long-now-before-launch.874920/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-team-hopes-it-wont-be-long-now-before-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Fallout London total conversion mod for Fallout 4 was supposed to launch on St. George's Day, April 23rd, but Bethesda's next-generation update <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-mod-is-officially-delayed-due-to-bethesdas-upcoming-fallout-4-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disrupted those plans</a>.</p>
<p>We last heard from the team over a month ago when they announced the inevitable delay without being able to nail down another date. This morning, Project Manager Dean Carter (known online as Prilladog) posted an update on the Fallout London Discord channel. To be clear, the message isn't mainly about the release date; it is instead an endorsement of GOG, which helped the Fallout London team a lot with the mod's distribution. The update also links to a new interview <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-london-gog-release-delay-fallout-4-update-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on The Gamer</a> featuring both GOG and Dean Carter himself. The Project Manager said:</p>
<p><em>We initiated discussions with GOG to release Fallout London after Nexus faced challenges hosting the files. Without the combined help of Nexus Mods and GOG, releasing Fallout: London wouldn't be possible.</em></p>
<p>However, right after linking to the article, Prilladog also wrote, 'We hope not long now—fingers crossed.' While not exactly a confirmation, it does hint at a forthcoming resolution of the compatibility issues with the new version of Fallout 4.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Fallout London is a fan-made game-sized mod that imagines how the UK's capital would fare following the nuclear apocalypse (something that Bethesda doesn't intend to do in the foreseeable future, as Todd Howard recently confirmed the studio will stick to US settings). It is set in 2237, between the first and second installments and around fifty years before Fallout 4.</p>
<p>According to Team FOLON, the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus) wouldn't have made it to the UK, so don't expect to encounter Deathclaws, Super Mutants, and the like. Similarly, there is no Vault-Tec in the UK, though there will be underground shelters. The factions are also entirely new, so players won't find the Enclave, the Brotherhood of Steel, the Institute, et cetera.</p>
<p>In terms of size, Fallout London is massive. Its playable space will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-total-conversion-mod-to-launch-in-april-2024-has-a-playable-space-as-large-as-base-game-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the size of the base Fallout 4 game plus the Far Harbor DLC</a>. Fans can also look forward to 53 main quests, 35 side quests, 25 faction quests, 64 miscellaneous quests, 16 branching gang quests, 7 companions (5 of which are fully voiced with detailed relationship levels and their own companion quests), over 90K recorded voice lines (1.5x the number of lines in Fallout New Vegas or The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and only slightly less than Fallout 4, with the difference that Bethesda's game had a voiced protagonist and Fallout London does not), a revamped crafting system for ammo, an overhauled perk and dialogue system with skill and perk checks during dialogues, new player animations such as ladder climbing and swimming, fast travel options such as trains, taxis, and boats, dynamic weather, new smoking mechanics, and playable guitars. To play the mod, you must own Fallout 4 and all of its DLCs.</p>
<p>In other Fallout news, the franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-enters-fortnite-in-chapter-5-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is about to land in Fortnite</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/mtg-card-sizes-and-dimensions-explained-for-competitive-play/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=mtg-card-sizes-and-dimensions-explained-for-competitive-play<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="266" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While it might seem unimportant at first, the card sizes and dimensions for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-did-magic-the-gathering-come-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> cards are actually critical to competitive play and fairness within the community. They not only help to avoid cheating, but they also prevent you from getting scammed. </p> <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true"><em>MTG</em> cards are designed to be a specific size and weight to help protect fans who buy and sell them but also ensure the competitive scene stays free of any cheating. Markedly different cards can have a serious impact on a game, making it difficult to tell what the card does or if the text has even been altered to give a player an advantage through a completely fake rule. If you’re buying, selling, or playing with <em>MTG</em> cards, it’s worth checking if they’re the right size and shape to avoid a humiliating loss. </p>
 <h2 id="h-what-are-the-official-mtg-card-sizes-and-dimensions-for-competitive-play" data-injectable="false">What are the official <em>MTG</em> card sizes and dimensions for competitive play?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Scryfall</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">According to Wizards of the Coast, the official <em>MTG</em> card sizes and dimensions for competitive play are<strong> 2.5 inches (6.3 cm) by 3.5 inches (8.8 cm)</strong>. While foil cards are slightly thicker, most cards are <strong>0.012 inches (0.305 mm) in thickness</strong> and weigh between <strong>1.7 and 1.8 grams</strong>. </p>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">However, there are a few exceptions to these sizes and dimensions. For example, printing errors can create cards that are slightly larger and heavier. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/magic-the-gathering-ever-set-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1997 <em>MTG</em> <em>Vanguard</em></a> set’s Vanguard cards are all 3 inches (7.6 cm) by 5 inches (12.7 cm), meaning they’re all larger but are technically tournament-legal. These get set aside at the start of a game, so they’re more of a gimmick and don’t impact the rest of the game that much. </p>
 <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">When it comes to these exceptions, they generally need to be revealed to both the judges and the opponent before a game even starts. If both players agree that a card isn’t fake and can be used for a specific purpose, then, most of the time, it can be. </p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="515" data-injectable="true">Obviously, this isn’t always the case, but when it comes to proxies and cards of that type, the general rule of thumb is that as long as you’re upfront about them with your opponent and agree to work with them in your game, they’re fine. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Why do <em>MTG</em> cards have to be a specific size and weight?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">The reason <em>MTG</em> cards must conform to specific dimensions, size, and weight is because it’s considered marking if they don’t. Card marking is illegal in competitive play because it gives you an unfair advantage over your opponent. </p>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">You could compare this to drawing a black line on the back of a powerful card or one you know you need for your planned strategy. If you’ve got a hand that allows you to get your card, if you know that it’s potentially only five cards deep in your deck, that’s unfair on your opponent who doesn’t know where their cards are in their deck. </p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">Furthermore, a weighted card, or one that’s slightly bigger than the rest, could make it easier to pick out in cases where your opponent gives you a set of face-down cards to pick from. There are several strategies where bigger cards can be of help in a game, which is why all cards must stick to the outlined sizing. </p>
 <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">Another advantage of this strict rule on card sizes is that it makes it harder for anyone to create fake cards and sell them for a profit. This could become a real problem, especially with cards like the One of One Ring from the <em>Tales of Middle-Earth</em> set. If cards didn’t have a set weight, even for foil versions, then it would be far too easy to fake rare cards for a profit. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/18/24159721/retrohai-nintendo-ds-lite-game-boy-color-advance-sp-mods<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you ever looked at a Nintendo DS and thought it would be cooler if the top screen was swapped for the Game Boy Advance SP’s? Or looked at a Super Nintendo controller and wished it had a GBA SP screen bolted onto the back? Whether you have or not, Hardware modder Hairo Satoh, aka Retrohai hai Softbank, has you covered with some truly cursed reimaginings of Nintendo’s portable consoles. (Recall their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125681/now-thats-a-playstation-portable">portable emulated PlayStation</a> built into the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoURW25xReoI">Takara Roulette Controller</a>.) </p><p>Let’s go on a little journey through Satoh’s Instagram account. Before we get into my favorite mutated Nintendo handhelds — frankententos, if you will — know that Satoh also does some very pretty custom jobs on the company’s various portable consoles. And they’re <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17892712832143201/">made to order</a>.</p><p>This one they posted recently is a good example. We are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23774468/clear-transparent-tech-gadgets-news-announcements-products">Known Transparent Case Stans</a> here at <em>The Verge</em>, but this goes a step further with its colorful hologram stickers and ChromaFlair-style color-changing sheen. Oh, and it runs Game Boy Advance games.</p><p>That controller mod I mentioned up top isn’t the only time Satoh has turned a console gamepad into its own handheld. The GBA SP’s screen looks remarkably at home on an SNES (well, Super Famicom, technically) pad...</p><p>...and on a PS2 Dual Shock controller, too.</p><p>But why not jam one onto a Nintendo DS Lite, too? It doesn’t make sense at all, even if this is a mash-up of the two most attractive pieces of hardware Nintendo ever made, but I don’t need any justification for this thing’s existence. Also, this is the point where things start getting a little cursed.</p><p>I guess this is also a Nintendo DS?</p><p>Again, but more colorful. </p><p>Ah yes, the Original Game Boy Advance SP DS (OGBASPDS). </p><p>I’m enamored with the concept of a multi-position adjustable screen on this original DS.</p><div><p>What if... GBA SP but also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24115039/danger-hiptop-t-mobile-sidekick-jump-button">T-Mobile Sidekick</a>?</p></div><p>Give me this and the ability to emulate the fantastic vertical-scrolling shooter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/21/17489520/nintendo-switch-flip-grip-accessory-vertical-arcade-games"><em>Ikaruga</em></a><em>, </em>please<em>.</em></p><p>I’m sorry, what?</p><p>Ah, yes, this makes sense.</p><p>I can’t say I understand the extra buttons and d-pad here, but I respect the chaos.</p><p>The Nintendo Long Boy DS.</p><p>I think this is probably the final boss of Satoh’s inventive creations. </p><p>Satoh didn’t respond to us when we reached out, but we’d love to know more about these creations. How much of these are made up of custom hardware on the inside? How many of them are emulating Nintendo’s handhelds, rather than rejiggering its original hardware components to fit? If we receive a response, we’ll dig in some more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> pre-orders are "looking very strong".</p>
<p>That's according to notable – and often accurate – leaker Tom Henderson, who claims that "no one in the know [at Ubisoft] is disappointed" with the number of pre-orders the highly-anticipated action-RPG has secured so far.</p>

<p>"Assassin's Creed Shadows pre-orders are looking very strong," Henderson said in his full, if brief, statement on Twitter/X. "I don't have the exact numbers yet, but no one in the know is disappointed with them."</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>

<p>The pre-orders are likely clocking up after our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-reveals-first-look-at-dual-protagonists">first proper look at Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> earlier this week, which detailed the game's dual protagonists. Both characters appear front and centre in the game's new cinematic trailer and on the game's cover, with each offering a markedly different play style. A gameplay trailer will follow next month, Ubisoft says.</p>
<p>As Tom described for us at the time, the teaser embedded above opens on Naoe, a female shinobi, as she crosses paths with Yasuke, the historical figure depicted here as a powerful samurai. Initially, it seems, the two are adversaries - but the pair soon find common ground. By the end of the trailer, Naoe is wearing the Assassin's Creed series' iconic Hidden Blade weapon - and both appear to be at least allied with the Assassins.</p>
<p>Ubisoft also recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boxed-copies-still-require-internet-connection-to-first-play">Assassin's Creed Shadows players will need to connect to the internet to first install the game</a>, although there is no "mandatory connection" requirement.</p>
<p>"We wanted to share some early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community," Ubisoft wrote.</p>
<p>"Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection."</p>

            <p>Star Citizen is free to play until 29th May 2024.</p>
<p>The free play period – timed to mark Invictus Launch Week 2954 – enables players to download and play the game for free during the event and "test pilot all 87 military vehicles for a limited time", with all ships available to test drive for the final three days of the show. You can also expect "surprise reveals" throughout the week, too.</p>

<p>"A variety of collaborative in-game events designed in the spirit of 'One Empire', and how each citizen’s individual contributions help create humanity's unrivaled power of unity that has taken it beyond the stars, showcase the might of the UEE Navy and invites citizens to explore the vessels that keep the ‘verse safe," Cloud Imperium Games teases.</p>
<p>"The improved New Player Experience, originally released for Area18 in Alpha 3.19, has been expanded and is now supported on all starting locations. While the same core skills are taught at each location, new players can now choose to begin high in the cloud city of Orison, in the mining town of Lorville owned and operated by Hurston Dynamics, on New Babbage, which is both a bustling major trading hub and home to high-end electronic companies, or back at Area18’s urban downtown where bright lights attract commerce and entertainment."</p>
<p>Existing players who convince a pal to jump on-board can also secure a 5000 aUEC bonus if their friend uses their referral code.</p>
<p>Cloud Imperium Games' CEO, Chris Roberts, recently said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-is-finally-pushing-towards-the-finish-line">Star Citizen was pushing towards the "finish line" of a 1.0 release</a>.</p>
<p>"After many hard years of work towards a goal many thought was impossible, we are on the cusp of delivering one of the final pieces of technology that will enable a connected, shared universe that thousands of people can experience together at the same time," Roberts explained in his <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/19848-Letter-From-The-Chairman">latest Letter from the Chairman update</a> in March.</p>

  <p id="NVaWDO">While <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23920816"><em>Bridgerton</em></a>’s alternate history means the show is already much more racially diverse than other Regency-era romances, the show so far has still been very heteronormative and deeply patriarchal, even with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23709730/queen-charlotte-bridgerton-review">Queen Charlotte</a> ruling. If women can’t even inherit property without a man or an heir, they definitely can’t kiss other women (and same goes for dudes). </p>
<p id="tvqmrM">But new showrunner Jess Brownell told <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2024/05/11718497/bridgerton-queer-storylines-future-showrunner-interview">Refinery29 Australia</a> that queer main characters will be featured in the show’s future seasons. </p>
<p id="qRtw0k">“I think this is a show about the many ways in which people love,” said Brownell. “So it only feels right to show all the ways in which people love, including queer love. So we are exploring queer love stories across the next couple of seasons,” she added.</p>
<p id="DxWgt0">Now, Brownell was tight-lipped about just <em>which</em> characters would have queer romances. But there are some strong contenders — especially when it comes to the Bridgerton family. </p>

<p id="kgkZXE">All of the older brothers have had their share of sex and debauchery (thanks 1800s-era double standards!), but Benedict is still the only one who has seen a dude get it on with another dude. In the first season, he went to a wild party hosted by artist Henry Granville, and eventually learned about Granville’s clandestine relationship with another man. </p>
<p id="w3aJl9">And Benedict (Luke Thompson) is the most artsy-fartsy of the Bridgerton siblings. Being avant-garde and in touch with one’s artistic side is a stereotype that filmmakers and TV writers alike have used to indicate that a <a href="https://www.them.us/story/high-school-musical-ryan-gay">male character is queer for decades</a>. </p>
<p id="IMRAs0">While all of the brothers aren’t super keen on finding a match, he’s the one who’s arguably put the least effort in, and shown the least interest in, actually courting a woman. Before <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22993130/bridgerton-season-2-ending-breakdown">Anthony met Kate</a>, he was smitten with his opera singer mistress. And Colin even proposed to Marina Thompson back in season 1. But Benedict’s only really been interested in the sexual part of relationships. It could be that he’s missing a certain spark. </p>
<p id="B8SirI">This season, he strikes up yet another sexual relationship with a new female character. This time, though, Lady Tilley Arnold (Hannah New) is a widow, and described by <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/10/bridgerton-season-three-hannah-new-black-sails-starz-netflix-shonda-rhimes-1235143731/">Deadline</a> as a ”living life on her own terms with financial independence and sexual freedom.” In the first half of season 3, we certainly see her hold her own with the men of the Ton — but could that sexual freedom mean opening Benedict’s mind beyond heterosexuality? </p>

<p id="MNrFne">Eloise (Claudia Jessie) has rejected societal conventions from the very first season. She doesn’t want to get married at all and would rather wax on about the rights of women. She and Penelope once bonded over this, back when <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22995119/bridgerton-lady-whistledown-spoiler">Eloise was inspired by Lady Whistledown</a>. Of course, that got a wrench thrown into it, but Eloise constantly seeks female friendship in a way that we don’t really see with the other female characters her age, who are more preoccupied with finding a proper suitor. </p>
<p id="Vcywpq">Female characters who speak out against marriage and traditional social norms often end up coded as queer when it comes to most movies and TV shows, particularly ones with historical settings. Even if they’re not textually presented as queer, many <a href="https://www.them.us/story/little-women-greta-gerwig-jo-march-queer">fans spark to these characters and claim them</a>. </p>
<p id="Y7xC8J">Even though she had a bit of a flirtation with a charming newspaper boy in season 2, Eloise’s closest relationships outside her family are with other women. This season, we see her grow closer with Cressida Cowper (Jessica Madsen), which brings a nice depth to Cressida’s Mean Girl antics. Both Eloise and Cressida confide in each other about wanting to live their own lives without being married. And we see them seeking out each other’s company at events, in a way that almost plays out like a traditional courtship. </p>
<p id="UpewzB">When asked about possible queer-coding in Eloise and Cressida’s relationship, <a href="https://decider.com/2024/05/17/bridgerton-season-3-jessica-madsen-cressida-cowper-interview/">Madsen told Decider</a> that she’d be stoked if that was the case.</p>
<p id="Ne6VDh">“I absolutely love that,” she said. “That would be the best! Yeah, I mean, that would be cool. I like to think it would make sense because, like, she hasn’t bagged a guy. So, like, why not a gal?”</p>
<p id="6B7KyA">Eloise and Benedict share a particularly special relationship too, one that makes them very much at odds with their more marriage-focused family. They’re often seen together, making jests at the expense of the ladies and gentlemen of the Ton. They’re both the second-eldest son/daughter, both have a passion for something other than being a rich person. While some of the other Bridgerton siblings weren’t too keen on the idea of marriage in the first place (like  Anthony and Francesca), Eloise and Benedict more openly reject the institution of marriage. </p>

<p id="y2ybms">Now there <em>is</em> an existing fully-fleshed out and beautifully poignant queer love story in the Bridgerton universe — but you’d have to watch the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23715775/queen-charlotte-bridgerton-spinoff-brimsley-reynolds"><em>Queen Charlotte</em> miniseries</a> to experience it. As it turns out, the Queen’s butler Brimsley is in a long relationship with the King’s butler Reynolds. We saw the full extent of that relationship in the prequel, but we haven’t seen Reynolds in the modern day. He <em>could</em> be dead, but also we just haven’t seen a lot of King George at all, so maybe Reynolds is simply attending to his boss and we’ll see the gay butlers reunited!</p>

<p id="s9bv1T">There is, of course, the strong chance that the queer <em>Bridgerton</em> love story does not belong to one of the main siblings. After all, this is a show with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22991651/bridgerton-season-1-recap-season-2">a <em>lot</em> of characters and side plots</a>. Maybe it’s a heavily featured side character (sapphic arc for Lady Danbury, perhaps?), or maybe it is someone introduced solely in an upcoming season to have a background romance. </p>
<p id="HQOb5Y">Hopefully this promised queer love story is given just as much weight as the heterosexual ones. After all, this is an alternate history, where love conquers all and the showrunners aren’t exactly beholden to historical accuracy. </p>
<p id="mVKx76">As Brownell says: “We have the privilege of living in this fantasy world which means we can push back against some of the reality of what happened in the 1800s.”</p>

<p data-characters="335" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are few games that are still going as strong, even after over ten years, like <em>Minecraft</em>. But, even today, there are plenty of ways to play the game by checking out different seeds. This way, you’ll still have plenty of adventures and tons of fun. However, you might need to do a little searching for the best possible seed.</p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">Seeds in <em>Minecraft</em>, instead of having a randomly generated world, are worlds already set up with plenty to find in them. After so many years of the beloved survival game being around, there’s a chance of it getting stale, but these seeds will let you enjoy everything that 2024 has to offer for the beloved title.</p> <figure data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-1-sakura-season-seed-5584399987456711267" data-injectable="false">1. Sakura Season (<strong>Seed: -5584399987456711267</strong>)</h2> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">Cherry blossoms are just as magical in <em>Minecraft</em> as they are in real life. This seed lets you enjoy the beautiful pink trees in a huge Cherry Blossom biome, which was introduced in the 1.20 update. Randomly generated maps aren’t always going to feature tons of stunning trees, but this seed lets you enjoy tons of them everywhere you look. It’s easily one of the prettiest seeds you’ll find.</p>
 <h2 id="h-2-shipwreck-survival-seed-8065848147699287859" data-injectable="false">2. Shipwreck Survival (Seed: -8065848147699287859)</h2> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true">Coming across a shipwreck while out sailing is a great find, since there can be a hoard of treasures within. However, it’s much harder when you spawn on the shipwreck itself. This seed starts you out on one of the shipwrecks, surrounded by nothing but ocean as far as you can see. You’ll need to scavenge materials from the shipwreck, build a boat, and begin your voyage to find any land you can.</p>
 <h2 id="h-3-giant-cavern-seed-7445395903252703439" data-injectable="false">3. Giant Cavern (Seed: 7445395903252703439)</h2> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false">Similar to the previous seed, this one instead spawns you inside of a massive cavern underground, with the goal of working your way up and out. Of course, being deep in the earth, there are plenty of resources for you to take to make it easier to build your way up to the surface. There are tons of smaller winding caves to explore in the cavern, and other great finds with this cool seed.</p> <figure data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-4-coastal-village-seed-7783854906403730143" data-injectable="false">4. Coastal Village (Seed: -7783854906403730143)</h2> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">This seed will spawn you right next to a charming village right on the water. While there are great places for adventuring nearby, such as the mountains and ocean ruins, there are also plenty of great views in the village on the shore. It’s a perfect balance of cozy gaming to make a great farm and house, and adventuring to find the best gear and resources like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-minecraft-iron-level-explained/">iron</a>. </p> <figure data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-5-mooshroom-biome-seed-859337968100847433" data-injectable="false">5. Mooshroom Biome (Seed: 859337968100847433)</h2> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">What’s more enticing than mushroom cows? Since they were introduced into <em>Minecraft </em>years ago, Mooshrooms have been one of the most beloved mobs in the game. This seed gives you plenty of them to enjoy the company of, with a massive mushroom biome to explore when you travel to the island located at the coordinates 128, 66. Plus, the entire island is safe from monsters, making it a perfect paradise to use as a base.</p>
 <h2 id="h-6-ancient-city-and-trail-ruins-seed-4349791831285849707" data-injectable="false">6. Ancient City and Trail Ruins (Seed: 4349791831285849707)</h2> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">If you’re on the hunt for a great place to find armor trims, this is the seed you need to get. Not only is it chock full of fantastic places to explore, including the trail ruins above and the ancient city below, but it’s also easy to find the extremely rare ward <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-armor-enchantments-in-minecraft/">armor</a> trims to deck yourself out in while you’re out and about. This seed is perfect for adventures and exploring.</p> <figure data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-7-woodland-mansion-seed-5705783928676095273" data-injectable="false">7. Woodland Mansion (Seed: 5705783928676095273)</h2> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">Spawning directly in front of a massive mansion in the woods is a great head start to any <em>Minecraft</em> game. This seed gives you just that, along with a sprawling ancient city just nearby down below to go exploring in. Both the mansion and ancient city have plenty of armor trims for players to find, giving you tons to do no matter what kind of loot you’re interested in.</p> <h2 id="h-8-frozen-lake-of-cherries-seed-6384763642895912697" data-injectable="false">8. Frozen Lake of Cherries (Seed: -6384763642895912697)</h2> <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="785" data-injectable="true">I can’t help putting another Cherry Blossom seed on this list because they’re just so lovely. This seed is a beautiful combination of the pink sakura trees and plenty of ice spikes and snow, making a gorgeous winter combo. It’s the perfect scenic place to build a home or even an entire village. It’s definitely more for aesthetics than anything, but it’s still full of adventure.</p>
 <h2 id="h-9-badlands-mountain-seed-932245979383499761" data-injectable="false">9. Badlands Mountain (Seed: <strong>-932245979383499761</strong>)</h2> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">Far from the lush lands that have appeared so far on this list, this seed will spawn you right on top of a mountain of badlands, surrounded by nothing but desert. It’ll be tough to scavenge your way through this land due to the lack of trees and other necessary resources. If you’re up for a challenge, this is a great seed to do it with.</p> <figure data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-10-bamboo-jungle-and-buried-treasure-seed-4813269715648826820" data-injectable="false">10. Bamboo Jungle and Buried Treasure (Seed: -4813269715648826820)</h2> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="false">With this seed, you’ll be instantly surrounded by beautiful jungle and bamboo as far as the eye can see. This is stunning enough as it is, giving you plenty of materials to work with, but with this seed, you’ll also want to dig around to find tons of buried treasure along the shore. While you’re busy <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-tame-a-parrot-in-minecraft/">taming parrots</a> and harvesting jungle wood, you’ll also get to uncover plenty of secrets. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/every-call-of-duty-black-ops-game-ranked/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=every-call-of-duty-black-ops-game-ranked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Regarding Call of Duty, it’s easy to argue that <em>Black Ops</em> is perhaps the most beloved and popular series in the franchise’s history. With <em>Black Ops 6</em> firmly on the horizon, I’ve looked through the last 16 years to rank every Treyarch-developed game from worst to best. </p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">It’s a testament to the quality of the <em>Black Ops </em>series that Treyarch is widely viewed as the best <em>Call of Duty</em> developer, which made ranking the six mainline entries difficult. A dev team rarely has no absolute stinkers in their library, but Treyarch has never made a bad <em>CoD</em> game, at least in my opinion. </p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">However, this is an article to rank them all, so I couldn’t sit on the fence and say that they’re all great, which is why we’ve ranked them all in order. For this list, we’ve included <em>Call of Duty: World at War</em>, as it is viewed as the beginning of the <em>Black Ops </em>series due to characters from it appearing in 2010’s <em>Black Ops</em>. </p>
 <hr data-injectable="false"> <h2 id="h-6-black-ops-4" data-injectable="false">6. <em>Black Ops 4</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>It has its moments. Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2018</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Multiplayer, Zombies, Blackout</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false">Picking the worst <em>Black Ops</em> game is like going to a donut shop and picking the least tasty one: They’re all pretty good. There had to be a loser though, and for me, <em>Black Ops 4</em> is probably the least memorable title in the series, and always felt like I wasn’t sure what kind of <em>Call of Duty</em> game it was. </p> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">The return to “boots on the ground” <em>CoD</em> was certainly welcome, but bringing Specialist abilities back meant that <em>BO4</em> felt like an odd mix of classic<em> </em>and futuristic <em>Call of Duty</em> that never quite worked for me. The decision not to release with a campaign also damaged this title, and the public reception to it meant Black Ops 4 was on the back foot before it was even released. </p>
 <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">Treyarch does deserve credit for the game though, for the most part, the multiplayer was fun and Blackout was a great introduction to Battle Royale in CoD, laying the groundwork for the ultra-successful Warzone. While Blackout was a little clunky and wasn’t updated very often, it was still an enjoyable experience, one that shaped the <em>Call of Duty</em> we play today. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">5. <em>World at War</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>The first entry into the franchise. Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2008</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies</li> </ul> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false"><em>World at War</em> is viewed as the starting part of the <em>Black Ops</em> franchise, even though it doesn’t feature the series’ iconic title. Set during World War II, it was a stark change from the previous year’s game, <em>Call of Duty 4</em>: <em>Modern Warfare</em>. </p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="736" data-injectable="true">As it’s the oldest <em>CoD</em> game on this list, it’s easy to write it off, but to do so would be a mistake. The campaign is one of my personal favorites—It’s dark and gritty, and switching between the Americans and the Soviets really gives you a feeling that you’re not in control of what’s happening, and the true intensity of war. </p>
 <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">Of course, you can’t talk about <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-call-of-duty-world-at-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WAW</a></em> without gushing about Zombies, the starting point of the legendary mode, and some of my favorite memories in <em>Call of Duty</em>. I can still picture myself sitting in my old bedroom playing Nacht der Untoten with my buddies, even though I was terrible at it. </p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, multiplayer is where I feel like <em>World at War</em> slips down this list, as I didn’t enjoy many of the maps, the weapon meta was dominated by the PPSh-41, and the inclusion of tanks didn’t feel like <em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer to me. In truth, I ended up returning to <em>CoD4</em> before the year ended, and I never looked back. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">4. <em>Black Ops 3</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Just too much going on in multiplayer for me. Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2015</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, macOS, Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies, Bonus (Dead Ops Arcade, Nightmares, Freerun)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">Look, before I get into <em>Black Ops 3</em>, I have to be honest. <em>Advanced Warfare</em> is, in my opinion, the best jetpack <em>Call of Duty</em> game by a mile, and I don’t care what anyone says. So with that in mind, there was simply no way I could rank it any higher than this, even though I know <em>BO3</em> has its loyalists who think it’s the best <em>CoD</em> ever. </p> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="735" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-black-ops-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 3</a></em> multiplayer is fun, but I think the jetpacks are almost too powerful. Being able to wall-run and dash to the sides made it play too quick for my liking, and at times it felt like you were playing <em>Halo</em> rather than <em>CoD</em>. It does have some really good maps like Stronghold or Evac, but it’s also got some stinkers like Exodus and Havoc which were just not enjoyable to play. </p>
 <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">For me, <em>BO3</em> also has the weakest campaign in the series and ended up being a confusing experience that didn’t really explain why you were doing anything. The campaign gameplay is fun and does have some good moments, but it’s not enough to make up for the flawed story. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">3. <em>Black Ops Cold War</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>My favorite of the recent <em>CoD</em> releases. Image via Treyarch. </figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2020</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies</li> </ul> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true"><em>Black Ops Cold War</em> is my favorite of the “modern” <em>Call of Duty</em> titles and was lightyears better than 2019’s <em>Modern Warfare</em> reboot. There’s a lot to like about <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BOCW</a></em>, with a solid campaign that’s bolstered by the fact that decisions you make during the story can change the ending you see. I ended up completing it a couple of times to see what happened, which is something I rarely do with <em>CoD</em> campaigns. </p>
 <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">The Zombies Dark Aether storyline was also really strong, and the gameplay was, in my opinion, the best since <em>Black Ops 2</em>. The maps were good, the gameplay didn’t get too convoluted, and it was generally an enjoyable experience. Multiplayer on this game was also great, with gunplay feeling much more rewarding than <em>MW</em> and classic maps returning to the game. I spent hours playing <em>BOCW</em>‘s Ranked Mode, and if it was still live, I’d be tempted to go back. </p>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">My only real gripe with <em>Black Ops Cold War</em> is how strong the skill-based matchmaking felt in multiplayer, which made playing matches feel more like work than fun at times. Still, I have fond memories of this game, and it almost feels harsh to rank it third. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">2. <em>Black Ops</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>The jump from <em>World at War</em> to <em>Black Ops</em> is huge. Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2010</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, macOS, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo DS</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies</li> </ul> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">The first <em>CoD</em> game to boast the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-black-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops</a></em> title, Treyarch’s 2010 is an almost flawless <em>Call of Duty</em> game. The campaign was the best in the entire franchise at the time, with an ending (which we won’t spoil in case you haven’t played it) that will blow your mind. </p>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">Multiplayer gameplay was also excellent, with weapons that were enjoyable and rewarding to use, while the maps were also widely excellent. <em>Black Ops</em> is the game that introduced Nuketown, one of <em>CoD</em>‘s most iconic maps that is recreated to this day, showing how influential this game really was. </p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">No surprise, but <em>Black Ops’ </em>Zombies mode is also brilliant, with unique maps that each posed different challenges, a solid storyline that weaved through every map, and great gameplay that added new guns like the Thunder and Wave Guns.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">1. <em>Black Ops 2</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>The undisputed King of <em>CoD</em>. Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2012</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii U</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="147" data-injectable="false"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</em> is the pinnacle of the franchise. It’s not just the best <em>Black Ops </em>game, it’s the best <em>Call of Duty</em>, period. </p> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BO2</a></em> was the first campaign in the series to use branching storylines, with decisions you make affecting the ending you get. Better than that, the choices have real stakes and really invest you in the story. Treyarch went above and beyond in this campaign and hasn’t been able to match it since. </p>
 <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="262" data-injectable="false">Zombies in <em>Black Ops 2</em> is good, not great, but still, a really fun experience that is boosted by its incredible gunplay and all-around gameplay. Mob, Origins, and Die Rise are all solid maps that each have their unique style too, helping to keep the mode fresh. </p> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true"><em>Black Ops 2</em> multiplayer, however, is where this game blows everything else out of the water. This game has arguably the best maps in the franchise, with remakes still popping up in <em>CoD </em>games to this day. On top of that, the guns feel so rewarding to use, the Pick 10 class system is still yearned for by players, and League Play is the standard to which all <em>CoD</em> Ranked Play modes are still held, and none have managed to better it yet. </p>
 <p data-characters="105" data-current-count="105" data-injectable="false">A truly perfect <em>Call of Duty</em> game, and one that has yet to be matched in the 12 years since its release. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2-review.874863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I have played Sins of a Solar Empire 2, and I am poorer for it. This sequel is extremely similar to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/15/sins-of-a-solar-empire-review">original real-time 4X strategy game</a> from 2008 (including a lot, but not all of the content from its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/13/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion-review">2012 Rebellion expansion</a>) with nicer graphics and needed engine improvements. That alone is more than welcome for a game that’s had such staying power, and revamps to its well-differentiated and complex factions give them even more depth to explore. However, the version that stealth-launched out of early access on the Epic Games Store feels rougher and less complete than a lot of games when they launch <em>into</em> early access. Expanding my empire, conquering planets, and watching my fleets do battle with rivals and bomb their planets to ash did grow on me a bit once a friend and I worked together and eventually taught ourselves its ins and outs, but getting to that point was so much less fun than it should’ve been that any joy was sucked out of it like atmosphere through a hull breach.</p><p>For context, I played Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion a fair amount a decade ago, and have been playing 4X and real-time strategy games habitually long before and since. And yet, after buying Sins of a Solar Empire 2 and jumping in, I felt completely lost. There are no tutorials for this enormously complex game (outside of a website with a quick-start guide that’s barely more than a glossary), and the in-game instructions you do get for things as relatively simple as climbing the research tree to unlock essential technologies often send you on wild goose chases through the confusing interface. For every ounce of interstellar entertainment I managed to laboriously mine like metal from an asteroid, there was always some major headache to accompany it. Between that sort of thing, bugs, grayed-out options in the map creation interface, and a lack of a server browser to play with people you don’t know, it clearly isn’t a finished product. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Sins of a Solar Empire 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>There is no way to talk about how Sins of a Solar Empire 2 ended up like this without addressing its strange exit from early access at some uncertain point earlier this year – a warning label it really shouldn’t have dropped in its current state. After arriving on the Epic Games Store back in early 2022 as a “technical preview,” it recently removed all caveats from its store page without so much as an official press release. Instead, the publisher, Stardock, has announced a Steam launch date for this August, which promises a major patch that will include significant new features, such as the third race called the Advent and its two factions that are already listed as playable on the store page but are currently nowhere to be found. </p><p>In comments around that announcement, Stardock CEO Brad Wardell stated that you “only get one shot at a Steam release,” (where the vast majority of PC games are sold). So the plan is to wait until then to get the word out properly. It’s not a crazy idea: any strategy game enjoyer will tell you that you should save your limited resources for the moment they’ll have the maximum effect, and the same is true of game marketing dollars. But while that may sound reasonable from a business perspective, the reality is quite misleading for anyone looking to play Sins of a Solar Empire 2 who stumbles across the Epic Games Store page right now. This isn’t some hypothetical misunderstanding, either: my friend and I actually did spend a while looking for the Advent as we played. Did we have to unlock them? Enable an option in some menu? Play a couple games with the other races first? Nope. They’re just not there yet. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As of today, Sins of a Solar Empire 2 is about as barebones as can be.</p></div><p>I’d like to tell you the rest of it is better, but as of today Sins of a Solar Empire 2 is about as barebones as can be considering how many systems are packed in on top of combat, including diplomacy, trade, culture spread, and pirate bounties among others. It’s disappointing that there’s no story campaign – there isn’t one in the original Sins of the Solar Empire, either, and it proved it didn’t require one any more than Civilization or Stellaris do, but it’s long been a fan-requested feature and it might’ve gone a long way toward gradually introducing us to how everything works rather than throwing you into the deep end. Instead, it took me and a friend several hours of fumbling through a couple of games against the AI to nail down how one of the two human factions even worked, and again, we’re both RTS and 4X veterans. </p><p>Once, when I was trying to build something I had insufficient research points for as the alien Vasari race, I was told to build more orbital labs. The problem is that you don’t get research points for building orbital labs – they just speed up your research <em>rate</em>. You get the actual research points by buying upgrades on each planet’s development tracker menu, but you’d never know that unless you happened to mouse over the tooltip on the right button instead of doing what you’re told to do. </p><p>Sometimes buttons don’t seem to do anything at all… until they do. Here’s an example: the construction ships you get from colonizing planets have a button literally labeled “Build Structure,” but clicking it has no discernable effect because nothing you click on afterward, be it a planet, ship, asteroid, or anything else will give you the option to build something… unless you click on an orbital structure that’s already queued to be built, which then tells the ship to prioritize that building over any others in the queue. If you actually want to build a new building, you’ll select it from a separate menu; the ship will build it without you ever having to control it directly. </p><p>It’s a problem that the interface is confusing because you'll spend a lot of Sins of a Solar Empire 2 in menus. When you’re not grouping your ships into fleets and ordering them to jump from one planet’s gravity well to the next or focus their fire on an enemy capital ship, you’re going into a menu, clicking a button, and waiting for the thing you’re researching or the ship you’re building to complete, and then you’ll click another button in another menu and wait some more. That’s fine because that's just the kind of game Sins is – it has as much or more in common with Crusader Kings 3 as it does with StarCraft 2, so there’s very little micromanagement of individual units beyond retreating them as they’re damaged or triggering capital ship abilities manually. Managing an efficient build order offers satisfying challenges, but you want those challenges to be about interesting choices rather than figuring out how to make them in the first place.</p><p>Through hours of experimentation, I finally discovered that the developers at Ironclad have actually added some nice quality-of-life features to the interface. If you want to build or research something but don't have the necessary prerequisites, the Intelligent Construction System will queue all of the things you need up to be researched in order and let you check their progress in real-time. The new Empire Management screen lets you, well… manage everything in your sinful solar empire – planets, fleets, starbases, the whole space enchilada – from one page. That beats the heck out of clicking around the star system for each of them, shortcuts or not. </p><p>Then there's the new Fleet Management System, which allows you to request reinforcements for any of your specific fleets directly from that fleet's menu – no heading back to a planet to queue them up and setting the rally point required. New ships are then built at the closest factory and rallied to that fleet automatically (though you can opt for traditional rally points if that's more your speed). These are all good, smart additions that make Sins of a Solar Empire 2 easier and more engaging to play, once you figure them out.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Most of the fun combat stuff is saved for the late game.</p></div><p>When it comes to space combat, the basic idea hasn’t changed: you mostly build big fleets and throw them at your opponent, then watch them duke it out in entertainingly flashy battles that – as you’d hope – put the original Sins’ to shame in terms of detail and ship behavior. Instead of ships largely lining up and plinking away at the other side until someone explodes like a Civil War reenactment in space, we now have smaller classes that dart around like large fighters, and larger ships are loaded with gun turrets that swivel to track targets, bringing much more of a sense of action. Long-range missiles can be intercepted by point defenses or blocked by other ships before they hit something expensive, which is a nice nibble of tactical depth for those looking to micro something. And at the top of the Warfare tech tree sits the Titan, a single enormous, faction-specific behemoth that can take on entire fleets by itself. Watching all of these ships shooting all these different weapons, exploding, and making emergency phase jumps out of a system before their hull points tick down to zero looks pretty cool when you’re zoomed in, but early skirmishes with basic units are generally pretty dull.</p><p>Like its predecessor, Sins of a Solar Empire 2 saves most of the fun stuff for the late game when you unlock tech that can do a lot of damage in a hurry. The pinnacle of that is the human’s Novalith cannon, which can shoot massive, literally world-ending shells across the solar system and take out enemy planets in one hit, as opposed to bombarding them into submission with a fleet after bashing through whatever turrets or starbases the enemy has built up to defend it. That’s awesome normally, but it’s even more so (and way funnier) when you have two Novaliths target the enemy’s home planet – you know, just to be sure – and eliminate them from the match without ever moving a fleet into orbit. Then you’ve got the Vasari’s Orkulus starbase, which is essentially just a bigger, angrier version of the Cylon Basestar from Battlestar Galactica. Armed to the absolute teeth and containing several support fighters, it’s all but unstoppable by conventional weapons and, once you upgrade it, it can jump to other planets like a spaceship. Nasty.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Speaking of the two current races, they’re fairly different from one another, which means there’s a lot of learning to do but also a ton of opportunity to experiment with tactics and strategies geared toward their strengths. The human Trader Emergency Coalition (TEC), for instance, needs credits to manage their economy and build things. The super-advanced alien Vasari don’t, though money gives them access to the galactic markets where they can buy resources. There are unique ships and structures for each race, including several that are unique to one of their two sub-factions. The TEC, for instance, currently has the only ship that repairs others on the fly, while the Vasari can build Phase Gates that allow them to immediately jump between planets that aren’t connected by phase lanes. </p><p>That’s taken even further by some of the biggest additions to Sins of a Solar Empire 2, such as the Empire System bonuses. The TEC’s Trade Port structures were in the original game and provided a steady stream of credits, but now they allow you to allocate points to boost your production of metal, crystal, or credits on the fly. The Vasari, meanwhile, can build all-new Phase Resonators that let you allocate points to upgrade ships, their research rate, and so on. I love these additions; they add some spice to each race’s already distinct flavor while offering interesting strategic choices that allow you to build your economy or military in cool, unique ways.</p><p>Drilling down further into the subfactions, there are a lot of options to suit different playstyles. The Loyalist TEC, for instance, are more defensive, gaining access to planetary garrisons of ships that are produced automatically and don’t take up population cap, but have limited range. They can also build two starbases around a planet instead of one, which can make conquering their systems an especially difficult nut to crack. The TEC Rebels, however, are much more about offense: They get the aforementioned planet-destroying Novalith cannon, can ally with pirate factions and build a pirate base in a system they control, get economic bonuses for going on the attack, and can use propaganda abilities to make their ships more effective in combat.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Your chosen faction makes a big difference in how you play.</p></div><p>The Vasari are similarly divided between defensive and offensive factions. The Exodus are here for a good time, not a long time, so they’re happy to force humans into labor camps, strip mine the cores of planets they don’t need, and gain resources by destroying things. The Alliance, meanwhile, is all about fostering cooperation with other races, trade, and good table manners. They want to put down roots and stick around for the long term.</p><p>These distinctions sound subtle, but they make a big difference in how you play (and serve as the majority of the lore you’ll find). I was more fond of the Rebels for the TEC because I tend to prefer an aggressive playstyle, and in my experience, purely defending in Sins of a Solar Empire 2 isn’t going to win you the war. Like any good – sorry, <em>successful</em> – empire, you have to expand or you’ll eventually get overwhelmed. But when I needed to hold out long enough so my teammate could provide support against the two AI opponents I was facing down, those Loyalist garrisons sure did come in handy. With the Vasari, though, I much preferred making alliances with the Minor Factions (small AI players who don’t expand) and supporting my teammate, though I had a couple of nasty fleets capturing planets by the end. I like that the Factions provide so much variety, and when Sins of a Solar Empire 2 works, it feels good (mechanically, not morally) to build your empire up, expand, and conquer your neighbors.</p><p>And, in a nice touch, there are a lot of options for map generation, ranging from recommended player counts (between two and 10) on procedurally generated star systems to specific scenarios with unique challenges. Most of that is carried over from the original, but Sins of a Solar Empire 2 introduces planets and other astral bodies that rotate around stars, which can open up new phase lanes between them when they get close enough. That sounds a bit cooler than it is in practice because it can take hours for rotations to sync up in a way that truly matters (and on smaller maps, it might never happen at all), but when the stars literally align it can let you hit an enemy with a surprise attack on a world they thought was protected by heavily defended neighbors. You have a Future Orbits button that shows you how phase lanes will change for up to an hour into the future, so it’s not left up to chance or guesswork. </p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Will's Favorite RTS/4X Games</h3><p>Playing Sins of a Solar Empire 2 made me reflect on some of my favorite RTS and 4X games. Here they are.</p></div><p>But, man, so many things just feel incomplete or underbaked. Take the Minor Factions, for instance. You gain favor with them – and special bonuses – by spending Influence Points; when I was playing the Vasari Alliance, Influence Points were easy to get, so I earned lots of bonuses, but once I’d more or less unlocked everything I could only use the points to bid on auctions for resources. Being buddy-buddy with a Minor Faction doesn’t really do anything for you aside from getting you some abilities and making it so they’re (sometimes?) not actively hostile. Like most things in Sins of a Solar Empire 2, it’s hard to tell because there’s not much in-game to clue you in until you’ve pieced together a lot of disparate tooltips and experimented enough to find the right answer.</p><p>Then there are the bugs. I’ve already mentioned misleading audio cues telling me to build the wrong thing, but I’ve also had incorrect notifications telling me an enemy had conquered a planet I’d just colonized and so I spent a minute trying to figure out what happened before realizing, “Oh, it was me who conquered the planet, actually.” Once, I started a team game with a friend where we were clearly set to be allied, only to be told we weren’t once we got into the match, forcing us to fix it in-game. </p><p>There are also entire menu options grayed out that control things like “Orbiting Planet Speed,” or “Research Rates,” or “Ship Build Rates” when you try to adjust pre-game settings – you know, things you might like some say in when you’re setting up a match – that just aren’t available. There’s a tooltip telling you that these options are disabled “as we collect balance feedback,” which is fair, but these limitations just drive home how unfinished everything is. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When it works, it really works - it just needs to get us there with less frustration.</p></div><p>All of that said, when Sins of a Solar Empire 2 works, it really works. There's a lot of nuance when it comes to choosing your upgrade paths, deciding which structures to build on your planets, how to spend each planet’s limited orbital slots, and constructing your fleets. Do you go for an economic opening or a military one? Which capital ship do you start with, and why? What upgrades do you give it? What kind of research do you prioritize? Do you trade with other players, or buy the resources you need on the market? How much, if at all, do you engage with the Minor Factions on the map? If a battle looks like it will come down to the wire, do you pull your fleet out and live to fight another day, or go all in and bet on the victory?</p><p>The consequences of those choices, and the choices your opponents make in response to them, determine how games play out. The right decision at the right time – even one as seemingly small as prioritizing one research upgrade over another or choosing a specific capital ship to lead your first fleet – can snowball and make all the difference in an interplanetary power struggle that can last for a dozen hours or more. In its best moments, Sins of a Solar Empire 2 understands that, and that makes for compelling, memorable matches. It just needs to get us there much faster and with less frustration along the way.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="266" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The latest episode of <em>Doctor Who</em> Season 14 dropped onto streaming services on May 17. While the episode is undeniably mostly filler, one thing happened that has sparked discussion among eager Whovians—the Doctor’s next companion made a rather large appearance.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">In the third episode of the latest season, ‘Boom’, written by Steven Moffat, the Doctor and Ruby find themselves on a wartorn planet where the Doctor runs headfirst into danger, directly onto a landmine. Cue an entire episode where he can’t move while the action comes to him. Like I said, it’s mainly filler.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">Of course there are some key moments worth paying attention to, such as the fifth known re-appearance of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doctor-who-showrunner-russel-t-davies-confirms-the-importance-of-susan-twists-reappearances/">Susan Twist</a>, who plays the AI Ambulance in Boom, and the mysterious snow which seems to fall around Ruby at strange moments.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">However, the biggest thing to come out of Boom is the fact that, ahead of her becoming the Doctor’s next Companion in season 15, Veradu Sethu made an appearance as what could be considered a main character in the episode.</p>
 <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">I won’t go into too much detail about her role in the episode, but she plays an ordained soldier named Mundy Flynn (which was the source of a strangely timed joke about how she should marry Ruby and become “Mundy Sunday”), taking part in the war that’s currently ravaging the planet. Of course, she faces some heartbreak and tough decisions in the episode, but the question on the minds of Whovians everywhere is why is she here, and will she still be playing Mundy when she returns in season 15?</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">Let’s face it: this is <em>Doctor Who</em>, where even the Doctor himself admits that everything is possible, so Verada could come back as literally anyone else. We even have some precedent for that, given Jenna Coleman’s multiple roles before debuting as Clara proper. </p>
 <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false">However, the Doctor did openly say that he would be popping back to the planet to visit again at some point. Regardless, it was interesting to see the next companion before we have to get used to them being around for the long haul next season.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="false">The news that Verada would play the next companion, alongside current companion Ruby, came in April 2024. The actress has previously appeared in Jurassic World Dominion and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-68802766">has said</a> that it’s an ‘honour’ to be included in the cast of <em>Doctor Who</em>.</p>

<p data-characters="255" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Mountain Dew x Final Fantasy XIV</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-ffxiv-x-mountain-dew-rewards-merch-and-how-to-redeem-points/">promotion</a> has taken the gaming world by storm, causing the birth of <a href="https://x.com/ColinRyan/status/1791190990868369802" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memes</a> and discussion across the internet. However, one thing seems to be drawing more attention than anything else at the moment — Big Sippin.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">Big Sippin is <em>Mountain Dew</em>’s in-game character mascot for the promotion. A level 81 (at the time of writing) Bard, dressed entirely in green and setting out on his adventures across Eorzea. Players have begun to <a href="https://x.com/MTNDEWGaming/status/1791202741248811209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obsessively stalk his FC house</a> (the FC is called House of Sippin, for those interested, and the house is located on Hyperion – Goblet, Ward 21, Plot 9 – if you want to join in the stalking), and <em>Mountain Dew</em> is sharing Big Sippin’s progress over on their Twitter page.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey gamers, Big Sippin is live in <a href="https://twitter.com/FF_XIV_EN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@FF_XIV_EN</a> right now!</p><p>He’ll be at the Mtn Dew House for a bit, then heading out to start his FFXIV adventure.

 <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">For those who don’t know, to be considered a Legacy Player, the player must have played Final Fantasy XIV for at least 90 days prior to the Eighth Umbral Calamity and the release of <em>A Realm Reborn</em> back in 2013. This has raised some questions, and my love for researching strange events led me down a bit of a weird wormhole looking for answers.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="648" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="152" data-current-count="152" data-injectable="false">The reason that people are starting to think that Big Sippin might be a Legacy Player is down to two things which can be found on his <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/52996912/#profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lodestone profile</a>:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false"> <li>They have the <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Cait_Sith_Doll" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cait Sith Doll</a> minion, which was only ever available as a pre-order bonus for A Realm Reborn</li> <li>They have a <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Legacy_Chocobo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legacy Chocobo</a> mount, which is only owned by players who were around pre-A Realm Reborn</li> </ul> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true">Now, I’m going to be honest and say that I’m 99% sure that Big Sippin is not a true Legacy Player. For starters, he only has three DoW/DoM Jobs unlocked (Bard at level 81, Sage at level 70, and Conjurer at level 22), and I’m wholly convinced that Bard has been level skipped in order to be used for <em>Mountain Dew</em>‘s promotional purposes. </p>
 <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">The Soul Stone for Bard is green, so it fits the theme. Sage unlocks at level 70, so there’s no progression there and while it does look like Big Sippin has at least played a little as Conjurer, he hasn’t progressed far enough to gain his <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-equip-soul-crystal-job-stone-in-ffxiv/">Soul Stone</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="false">It’s more likely that this is a loaner account from Square Enix that was used for testing purposes or similar before A Realm Reborn was released. Or, if you want me to don my tin foil hat, this could just be a new account with a couple of red herring items added to spark conversation amongst players who look into it. If that’s the case, then I guess it worked because here we are.</p>

<p data-characters="143" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As soon as fiction began introducing absurdly powerful heroes, fans started needing to pit them against each other to determine who would win. </p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">These battles take place in crossover scenarios that would likely never happen — even if only because that kind of defeats the purpose of them being the good guys. Still, here’s the only ranking on the Internet that tells you with pinpoint accuracy who the most powerful hero in all of fiction is.</p> <figure data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Sony</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">10. Kratos </h2> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Kratos was always strong, but what made him powerful to the point of challenging the gods was a deal he made with one. He received immense power from Ares, but that power came with a blinding rage that cost Kratos everyone he loved. He set out to get revenge against one god but then ended up killing the entirety of Mount Olympus and pretty much every Norse God in existence. </p> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="745" data-injectable="true">The only argument you can have against Kratos from <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-god-of-war-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God Of War</a></em> as being one of the most powerful characters in existence is the fact that he dies three times in his series. Then again, dying only really helps set him up to kick the ass of whoever’s working as the warden of hell at that point and return even stronger, so maybe he really does belong on this list.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">9. Doom Slayer </h2> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true">The original <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-doom-games-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>DOOM</em> games</a> play like a horror movie where humans pay for messing with the wrong thing. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-doom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>DOOM</em> reboot</a> from 2016 turns the tables and has the demon horde as the dumbasses that open the wrong sarcophagus and unleash something that they cannot deal with: the Doom Slayer.</p>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">The Doom Slayer is what the biggest and baddest demons in the <em>DOOM</em> universe see in their nightmares at 666 in the evening. He’s like a version of Kratos who has guns and who can make use of interstellar travel to get close enough to perform a glory kill on any demonic entity in the universe. Also, he already spends most of his time in hell, so dying and being sent there would feel more like waking up from a nap than a proper respawn — not that he would die, anyway.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">8. Asura </h2> <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">Even though it’s a tremendous game, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-asuras-wrath/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asura’s Wrath</a></em> doesn’t <em>ever</em> play like a regular game. You play as a god here, and a true god doesn’t care for the tiny zombies that Kratos and the Doom Guy need to kill in their respective games’ early levels—unless there are a million of them at once. </p>
 <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">Every level in <em>Asura’s Wrath</em> is a set piece of enormous proportions where Asura has to go against Akuma, giants, entire fleets of combat spaceships, or even planet-sized gods. If the Doom Slayer is the sci-fi version of Kratos, then Asura is the anime version of Kratos, which naturally means he’s at least an order of magnitude above in terms of power and wildness.</p> <figure data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Nintendo</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-7-kirby" data-injectable="false">7. Kirby</h2> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">Kirby’s power level isn’t immediately obvious, but he’s a wildcard of such magnitude that you just cannot help but respect it. It’s almost impossible to make a list of all his abilities because they make up new ones whenever a new Kirby game comes out, but he’s basically able to eat anyone (or anything) and gain their powers.</p> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="723" data-injectable="true">If you want more clear proof of Kirby’s power, just look at the trailer for <a href="https://youtu.be/WShCN-AYHqA"><em>Super Smash Bros.</em> <em>World Of Light</em></a>. It shows Galeem, the god who controls the master hands, wiping out an entire galaxy — the galaxy where <em>every</em> character you’ve ever seen in <em>SSMB</em> lives — but failing to even put a bruise on Kirby. You don’t mess with that kind of power.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">6. Superman </h2> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">When not failing to fly through some hoops because of bad controls, Superman is your quintessential strong character. he’s the character every comic book hero cribs from, whether they realize it or not. </p>
 <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="231" data-injectable="false">Superman is SO strong, in fact, that it works against him. Many complaints from modern fans are that he’s boring because there are so few instances when someone was able to present him with an interesting physical challenge. </p> <figure data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Toei Animation</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">5. Goku </h2> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false">While kid Goku from the original <em>Dragon Ball</em> would likely take no more than one half-charged slap from Superman to explode and die, the same definitely doesn’t apply to <em>DBZ’s</em> Goku.<em> </em>I believe there’s one point in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dragon-ball-fighterz/">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, likely the time when Goku first reaches SSJ, when Goku just leaves Superman in the dust and never returns.</p> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="712" data-injectable="true">I’ve read very detailed scientific number crunches detailing how Superman is actually stronger than Goku, but here’s the thing: you’ve picked the only place where science doesn’t matter. Frieza’s weakest form was able to conjure enough energy to destroy a planet in one of his fingers, and Goku still slapped his final form silly. </p>
 <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">Goku’s biggest advantage? A genetic trait that makes him stronger whenever he gets beat. Do you know who also shares that genetic trait? Doomsday, the only creature who ever killed Superman, and it wasn’t even powerful enough to destroy a planet with a finger gun.</p> <figure data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">4. Vegito</h2> <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="163" data-injectable="false">I know Vegito is half-Goku, so that may invalidate his form for this tournament, but he’s here to prove a point and also too strong for me to just push away.</p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">Vegito, who is a fusion of Vegeta and Goku using the Potara Earrings, is significantly stronger than Goku alone. Even though no character in <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> can match up to him, he avoids becoming boring simply because the mix between Goku and Vegeta’s personalities makes him too funny not to enjoy.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by DC</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">3. Dr. Manhattan </h2> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true">Dr. Manhattan’s powers go well beyond those of mere strength. This is a being so powerful he can end or create life in an instant. He exists at the current moment but also in all moments. Dr. Manhattan is an omnipotent being above all beings, which might somehow make him the most human character in <em>Watchmen</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="262" data-injectable="false">His only weakness comes not from any imaginable lack of power but rather from having too much of it. By the time of <em>Watchmen</em>‘s event, Dr. Manhattan has gone so far past the line separating humans from deities that he no longer feels empathy for humankind. </p> <figure data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">2. Saitama</h2> <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">Impossibly powerful “gag” characters aren’t a new thing —children and Reddit users come up with them every day. Still, It’s not common for a gag character to get promoted to the main character role in a legit and spectacular anime. </p> <p data-characters="478" data-current-count="736" data-injectable="true">Saitama feels like an alien even in the incredibly wild world of <em>One Punch Man,</em> as he goes through the suffering that a real human who’s too good at his job would, but keeps the invulnerability that only a joke character would have. Though he’s known for finishing off any enemy with one single punch, no aspect of Saitama is bound to any sort of power or ability ruleset, meaning that he’ll always be more powerful than whatever enemy you put in front of him.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by American Comics Group</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">1. Herbie Popnecker </h2> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="756" data-injectable="true">The most powerful character on the list is, interestingly, the least famous one. Herbie Popnecker dates back to the ’50s, and his powers are, well, <a href="https://vsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/Herbie_Popnecker">pretty much all of them.</a> He’s capable of teleportation, but also he can just walk anywhere in the universe. Herbie is so strong he tends not to notice even when incredibly powerful beings are physically attempting to kill him. Also, he can communicate with animals, and ghosts are afraid of him.</p>
 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">I cannot say that this is the first godlike gag character in history, but he’s at least the most influential one. If you love Saitama, which you should, know that he might only exist because of Herbie, and that’s why he’s not number one.</p> <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="false">Don’t agree with my pick for number one? Well, I only even know of Herbie because he’s <a href="https://bleedingcool.com/comics/the-debut-of-alan-moores-favorite-comic-character-up-for-auction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the favorite hero of <em>Watchmen</em> creator Alan Moore</a>, so good luck taking it up with him.</p>

<p data-characters="467" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-did-magic-the-gathering-come-out/">30+ year lifespan of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>, countless mechanics, creatures, and even crossovers have been added to the game. Despite all of the changes and additions throughout the decades, MTG has maintained the same five mana colors. Each mana color represents vastly different playstyles and can be combined to create 25 different color combinations. These color combinations have been given lore-inspired nicknames, which gives each deck its own identity.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false">You aren’t required to know the name associated with your deck, but it can help when searching for decks online or watching the <a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour">Magic Pro Tour</a> since decks are commonly referred to by their combination name. Most websites will organize decks by combination name + archetype, such as “Esper Midrange” or “Boros Convoke.”&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-all-color-combination-names-in-mtg-explained" data-injectable="false">All color combination names in MTG explained</h2> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true">The most basic decks in MTG use only a single mana color. These decks are simply referred to as mono-color decks. An example of this would be mono-red decks, which focus entirely on the aggressive, low-cost cards that Red specializes in.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">When combining multiple colors, names taken from the lore of Magic: The Gathering represent each combination. It’s essential to learn a few different concepts to understand the naming conventions used for the various color combinations. </p> <h3 id="h-what-letters-represent-each-mana-color" data-injectable="false">What letters represent each mana color?</h3> <p data-characters="102" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">With the exception of Blue, each mana color in MTG can be referred to by the first letter of its name:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true"> <li>G – Green</li> <li>R – Red</li> <li>W – White</li> <li>B – Black</li> <li>U – Blue (since Black and Blue share “B” and “L”, Blue goes by U)</li> </ul>
 <h3 id="h-what-are-allied-and-enemy-colors-in-mtg" data-injectable="false">What are allied and enemy colors in MTG?</h3> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">Each of the five mana colors represents a different playstyle in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. Some mechanics or abilities are unique to a particular mana color which helps provide each color’s identity within the game. Some of the strategies for the colors work well together, while others clash and are more difficult to combine within a deck; These are known as “<strong>allied</strong>” and “<strong>enemy</strong>” colors.&nbsp;</p>
 <h4 id="h-allied-colors" data-injectable="false">Allied colors</h4> <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">Allied colors have roughly the same strategy within MTG. One of the most popular allied color combinations is known as “Azorius Control,” which consists of Blue and White. White mana cards contain a large amount of hard removal spells such as “Exile” and “Destroy” cards. Blue mana cards are known for counterspells and “Draw” cards which ensure that players always have a spell up their sleeve. The combination of Blue and White allows for complete control over the battlefield.</p>
 <h4 id="h-enemy-colors" data-injectable="false">Enemy colors</h4> <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true">On the other hand, enemy colors have vastly different strategies and aren’t as easy to combine within a single deck. An example of this would be an “Izzet Spellslinger” deck that pairs the control spells from Blue with the aggressive nature of Red creatures. While the strategies of the colors contrast each other, the inclusion of Blue spells offers staying power to the Red creatures which otherwise wouldn’t have many defensive options.</p>
 <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">Allied and enemy decks aren’t better or worse than each other. Rather, they are something to keep in mind when determining a deck’s overall strategy. Allied colors have similar strategies and are much easier to pull off when given the opportunity. However, they also share similar weaknesses that your opponents can exploit. Enemy colors aren’t as focused as allied colors, but as seen in the example above, enemy colors can cover each other’s weaknesses much better than allied colors can.&nbsp;</p>
 <h4 id="h-how-to-determine-allied-and-enemy-colors" data-injectable="false">How to determine allied and enemy colors</h4> <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">Figuring out what colors are considered allies or enemies of each other is simple. On the back of each MTG card, the five mana colors are arranged into a pentagon. For any given color, the two colors adjacent are known as allied colors, while the two colors opposite of it are enemy colors. An example of this would be Blue being adjacent to White and Black (Allied) but opposite to Green and Red (Enemy).&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-list-of-all-color-combination-names-in-magic-the-gathering-mtg" data-injectable="false">List of all color combination names in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> (MTG)</h2> <h3 id="h-mtg-s-two-color-combination-names" data-injectable="false">MTG’s two-color combination names</h3> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true">Across every format in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, most decks are pairs of two mana colors. The original Ravnica block sets were focused on guilds that each had a pair of mana colors as their identity. Since then, the names of these guilds have been used to refer to each of the 10 two-color combinations.</p>
 <p data-characters="48" data-current-count="48" data-injectable="false">MTG’s two-color combinations (<strong>Ravnica guilds</strong>):</p> <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Azorius</strong> – Blue/White (UW)</li> <li><strong>Boros</strong> – Red/White (RW)</li> <li><strong>Dimir</strong> – Blue/Black (UB)</li> <li><strong>Golgari</strong> – Black/Green (BG)</li> <li><strong>Gruul </strong>– Green/Red (GR)</li> <li><strong>Izzet </strong>– Blue/Red (UR)</li> <li><strong>Orzhov</strong> – Black/White (BW)</li> <li><strong>Rakdos</strong> – Black/Red (BR)</li> <li><strong>Selesnya</strong> – Green/White (GW)</li> <li><strong>Simic</strong> – Blue/Green (UG)</li> </ul>
 <h3 id="h-mtg-s-three-color-combination-names" data-injectable="false">MTG’s three-color combination names</h3> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false">While three-color combinations don’t have the iconic guilds of Ravnica to be named after, they do have two different naming sources of their own. Remember the allied and enemy colors we explained earlier? The three-color combinations in Magic: The Gathering are organized into two different types based on allied and enemy colors:&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true"> <li>The allied colors are named after shards from the 2008 <strong>Shards of Alara</strong> block.&nbsp;</li> <li>The enemy colors are named after the five clans from the 2014 <strong>Khans of Tarkir</strong> block.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="71" data-current-count="71" data-injectable="false">Here are the names of the allied three-color combinations in MTG:&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Bant</strong> – Blue/Green/White </li> <li><strong>Esper</strong> – Black/Blue/White </li> <li><strong>Grixis</strong> – Black/Blue/Red </li> <li><strong>Jund</strong> – Black/Green/Red </li> <li><strong>Naya</strong> – Green/Red/White </li> </ul> <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">Here are the names of the enemy three-color combinations in MTG:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Abzan</strong> – Black/Green/White </li> <li><strong>Jeskai</strong> – Blue/Red/White </li> <li><strong>Mardu</strong> – Black/Red/White </li> <li><strong>Sultai</strong> – Black/Blue/Green </li> <li><strong>Temur </strong>– Blue/Green/Red </li> </ul>
 <h3 id="h-mtg-s-four-color-combination-names" data-injectable="false">MTG’s four-color combination names</h3> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">There are only five different four-color combinations in Magic: The Gathering. Just like the two-color combinations, the nicknames for these come from the Ravnica block. But instead of the combinations being named after guilds, they’re named after the first word used in the names of the four-color creatures known as the <strong>Nephilim</strong>. These creatures are:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true"> <li>Dune-Brood Nephilim</li> <li>Glint-Eye Nephilim</li> <li>Ink-Treader Nephilim</li> <li>Witch-Maw Nephilim</li> <li>Yore-Tiller Nephilim</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="57" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">Here are the names of the four-color combinations in MTG:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Dune</strong> – Black/Green/Red/White (No Blue)</li> <li><strong>Glint</strong> – Black/Blue/Green/Red (No White)</li> <li><strong>Ink</strong> – Blue/Green/Red/White (No Black)</li> <li><strong>Witch</strong> – Black/Blue/Green/White (No Red)</li> <li><strong>Yore</strong> – Black/Blue/Red/White (No Green)</li> </ul>
 <h3 id="h-mtg-s-five-color-combination-name" data-injectable="false">MTG’s Five-color combination name</h3> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">Last but not least, the five-color combination name has a simpler approach than the other combinations. Many players simply say “all colors” or “rainbow” when referring to these decks. But you can also find some players that refer to the five-color combination as “WUBRG” (woo-berg) after the letters that represent each of the colors.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone says he's "not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier, saying, "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time".</p>
<p>In an interview about his plans for Stardew Valley's following its recent 1.6 update, Barone said that he doesn't feel pressured to create a follow-up game, stating: "It's a game that I'm deciding to make. I don't need to make it".</p>

<p>"[Fan expectation] definitely puts pressure on me," Barone told <a href="https://aftermath.site/stardew-valley-concernedape-haunted-chocolatier-interview">Aftermath</a>. "But it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time. When it's ready, that's when I'll release it. I'm not too concerned with the pressure. I don't feel like I owe anyone anything when it comes to Haunted Chocolatier. It's a game that I'm deciding to make. I don't need to make it.</p>
<p>"Before making Stardew Valley, I spent all day hunched over the computer," Barone added. "I still spend all day hunched over the computer... My goal in life isn't about making money. I want to create things and share them with the world. That's what it's all about. That's what I'm doing. That's what I will do, regardless of any other circumstances, as long as I can financially support myself to be able to do that. If I couldn't, I would get a job and spend my free time creating stuff to try to get back to doing that."</p>
<p>Last October, Barone celebrated one million followers by sharing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-shares-new-screenshots-of-haunted-chocolatier">four previously unseen screenshots of Haunted Chocolatier</a>.</p>
<p>Shared on X, formerly Twitter, the four screenshots show some new areas: an interior home and shop, a vivid forest, a mermaid fountain in (presumably) the town square, and a creepy library with a peering skeleton.</p>
<p>That forest screenshot also shows the character shooting at a leafy creature with a bow and arrow, suggestive of the increased combat focus compared with Stardew.</p>

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you feel like getting into epic fantasy is a bit of a chore these days due to the sheer number of well-recommended book series out there, we’re here to tell you that there are a ton of brilliant novels, often standalone, that can serve as a starting point for beginners.</p> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">Fantasy enthusiasts have an inclination to throw huge book series at readers who may simply want to dip their toes into the genre. Many have come to believe all High Fantasy or Epic Fantasy has to offer <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fantasy-book-series-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are enormous 1000-page novels</a> that seem closer to a scholarly endeavor than escapism. </p> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">For this article, we have put together a list of 10 highly acclaimed books that can serve as an entry point to your Epic Fantasy journey. We’ve decided to leave out certain names you almost certainly already know, like <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, or even well-known series like <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> and <em>His Dark Materials</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">That’s not to say the following titles are obscure. But they are all exactly what you need to wrap your head around the genre, its history and legacy, its tropes and themes, and what it has to offer in storytelling and literary terms. Here are some of the best fantasy books for beginners.</p> <figure data-current-count="591" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>via William Morrow Paperbacks</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">10. <strong>Stardust by Neil Gaiman</strong></h2> <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">Beyond count is the number of fantasy books dealing with the faerie world, but few have become an instant classic in this lately inundated genre. </p> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true"><em>Stardust</em> by Neil Gaiman is the perfect blend of the magical and the lyrical, pushing readers down a literary rabbit hole full of analogies, archetypes, and symbolism. You follow Tristan Thorn, who enters a fairy tale world in search of a fallen star for his beloved Victoria, little knowing that the journey will fundamentally change his self-perception and identity.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via HarperCollins</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">9. <strong>Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones</strong></h2> <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="739" data-injectable="true">You’ve probably seen Studio Ghibli’s <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em>, an anime adaptation of the 1986 novel by British author Diana Wynne Jones. The acclaimed Hayao Miyazaki flick now finds itself among the top 10 lists everywhere, but reading the book can also prove to be an unforgettable experience. Diana’s witty prose and exceptional storytelling and characterization chops have turned <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em> into a timeless classic.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Ace</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">8. <strong>Elric of Melniboné by Michael Moorcock</strong></h2> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true">If J.R.R. Tolkien is the father of High Fantasy, then Michel Moorcock’s Elric of Melniboné is akin to the father of modern characterization for fantasy protagonists. Elric may be severely underrated today, but his legend as Moorcock’s so-called “Eternal Champion” hearkens back to mythologies as old as human civilization. </p>
 <p data-characters="562" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">Following the tale of its titular protagonist — who is the last emperor of the decaying island kingdom of powerful sorcerers, Melniboné — the <em>Elric Saga </em>is chock-full of amazing character moments, compelling plotlines, and dark narrative themes, with Moorcock often being referred to as one of the original grimdark fantasy spinners who subverted Tolkien. Dozens of other prominent grimdark fantasy authors like George R.R. Martin, Stephen R. Donaldson, Glen Cook, Steven Erikson, and Andrzej Sapkowski have since taken inspiration from Elric of Melniboné.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Ace</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">7. <strong>The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle</strong></h2> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">Whimsical, unexpected, and beautiful. These words perfectly capture what it feels like to read <em>The Last Unicorn </em>by Peter S. Beagle. Now a classic of the genre, this 1968 fantasy novel explores themes like love, mortality and nature, wrapped inside a perfect story with lyrical prose, following the adventures of a unicorn who is led to believe that she’s the last of her kind. </p>
 <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false"><em>The Last Unicorn </em>is not only an epitome of everything the fantasy genre has to offer but has also been a huge wellspring of inspiration for many other popular fantasy authors today, namely Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Patrick Rothfuss.</p> <figure data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>via Orbit</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">6. <strong>Kings of the Wyld by Nicholas Eames</strong></h2> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">What High Fantasy often distinctly lacks is a sense of humor. I’m not talking about lighthearted character moments or a bit of witty banter between protagonists, but a properly rib-tickling and humorous novel set in a fantasy world. Besides Terry Pratchett’s <em>Discworld</em>, only a handful of authors have attempted to write such a story, and fewer still have managed to make it work. </p> <p data-characters="585" data-current-count="969" data-injectable="true">Nicholas Eames is one of those people, and his book <em>Kings of the Wyld </em>is a great retreat for readers who want a story that doesn’t take itself too seriously. <em>Kings of the Wyld </em>follows the adventures of a retired band of mercenaries (heavily inspired by old-school rock and roll bands) who break off their retirement to save the daughter of one of their members. But time and age make milksops of us all, even if you used to be a fearsome warrior of legend, and no band reunion in history, be it music or something else entirely, has ever managed to recapture that old flash of glory.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Penguin Random House</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">5. <strong>The Once and Future King by T. H. White</strong></h2> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">Most fantasy stories, even Tolkien’s own Middle-earth, trace their roots to the Arthurian legend. But the problem with old and strewn mythologies is not knowing where to start. <em>The Once and Future King </em>by T. H. White takes care of that little dealbreaker by delivering a unique and modern spin on the Matter of Britain. </p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true"><em>The Once and Future King </em>unites all the different stories and accounts from works like <em>Historia Regum Britanniae </em>and Sir Thomas Malory’s <em>Le Morte d’Arthur </em>into a cohesive take on King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. The tale begins with Arthur’s tutelage under the wizard Merlin and continues to explore the founding of Camelot’s ideals and other legendary tales like the quest for the Holy Grail.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Berkley Books / Harper Voyager (reissue)</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">4. <strong>Tigana by Guy Gavriel Kay</strong></h2> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">Guy Gavriel Kay is probably the most underrated High Fantasy author alive. Best known for his rich world-building and intricate prose, Gavriel Kay first made a name for himself when he assisted Christopher Tolkien in editing The Silmarillion in the late ‘80s. Kay then went on to write books of his own, first The Fionavar Tapestry trilogy and then the highly acclaimed <em>Tigana</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">In this book, Kay weaves mythology and fantasy together to make a deeply complex story about the history of a civilization. It features a masterful narrative structure, many thought-provoking themes and brilliant character studies, and is now finally garnering some love for its massive influence on the genre.</p> <figure data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>via Hachette Book Group</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">3. <strong>The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski</strong></h2> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false"><em>The Last Wish </em>is a collection of short stories that first introduced the world to Geralt of Rivia. <em>The Witcher </em>series of books and the consequently following video games are now a huge part of pop culture, but <em>The Last Wish </em>still stands on its own as a great gateway into modern fantasy literature. </p> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true">Andrzej Sapkowski writes in tandem with history and often brings in elements of folklore, especially East European folklore, to inform and develop his world. The Last Wish has excellent prose and remains, in my opinion, the best <em>Witcher </em>novel from the saga to this day. If you want a grimdark, character-focused fantasy story, then waste no time picking up <em>The Last Wish</em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Gollancz</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">2. <strong>The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson</strong></h2> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">Brandon Sanderson is mostly known these days for his <em>Stormlight Archive </em>series, but the <em>Mistborn </em>trilogy, beginning with <em>The Final Empire </em>in 2006, is also very beloved in the fantasy community. </p>
 <p data-characters="556" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true">The Final Empire tells the tale of a band of rebels who want to overthrow the seemingly invincible, verifiably immortal, and utterly tyrannical god emperor of their world. But there’s a catch: The tyrannical emperor, called The Lord Ruler, is actually the prophesied Hero of Ages and the man who saved the world from an enigmatic calamity known as the Deepness a thousand years ago. There’s also the fact that he’s very much invincible and untouchable, and the business of overthrowing him, justified though it may be, will not prove to be so simple.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Del Rey</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-spinning-silver-by-naomi-novik" data-injectable="false"><strong>1. Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik</strong></h2> <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="490" data-injectable="true">This standalone book from 2018 tells the tale of three women who fight against fate and get thrust into a conflict with evil forces in an imaginary medieval European kingdom called Lithvas. </p>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false"><em>Spinning Silver </em>is about identity, self-perception, and the consequences of human greed. Naomi Novik’s prose is poetic, her worldbuilding is top-notch, and the magic and wonder of <em>Spinning Silver </em>is reminiscent of some of the best stories in the history of the fantasy genre.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> was blessed with several excellent animated trailers, each one produced by French animation studio Bobbypills. Now the slick metroidvania is getting a full animated television series from the same folks, and the first trailer is below.

<p>It's in French, but you can turn on English subtitles. Also, the animation style is different from the trailers.

<p>I think I approve of everything about this. I like that it's not treating the subject matter overly seriosuly - because who really cares about Dead Cells lore when the game is mostly about the wonderful feeling of rolling, dashing, and exploding enemies. I like that it's a comedy. I like that several of the gags in the trailer above are derived from the animation itself. (I'd guess many Dead Cells fans will not agree with me.)
</p>
<p>The Dead Cells animated series is due to release on June 19th on ADN (France). That's the <a href="https://animationdigitalnetwork.fr/">Animation Digital Network</a>, an online streaming service. An English version is due later in the year - but it's fine, you can watch it with subtitles, don't be afraid.
</p>
<p>Dead Cells recently received <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-cells-to-receive-its-final-update-as-devs-move-on-to-new-secret-projects">its final update and DLC</a>.

<p>When you have an immensely popular first-person shooter—a genre known to draw cheaters—you’ll find that many of your rounds include a hacker or two. The more popular the game, the more money flowing behind the scenes to facilitate cheating. Unfortunately, Escape From Tarkov cheaters prove to be some of the most prevalent and dug-in bunch. Is the extraction shooter full of cheaters today?</p>



<h2 id="h-are-escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-in-every-lobby">Are Escape From Tarkov Cheaters in Every Lobby?</h2>



<p>I wouldn’t say every single lobby in Escape From Tarkov includes cheaters. Is it possible? Yeah, if you listen to the community on Reddit. Does the game have a cheater problem? Absolutely!</p>



<p>There are too many Escape From Tarkov cheaters to count, and despite Battlestate Games reportedly banning tens of thousands of them, it seems like there are more each day. How and why? We’ll dive into that more shortly. For now, however, know that Escape From Tarkov has a problem with hackers plaguing the game.</p>



<p>They use all manner of hacks commonplace in competitive first-person shooters, including wallhacks, aimbots, and speedhacks. But in Tarkov, where loot reigns supreme, you’ll find many with a vacuum-like cheat that sucks up the loot from every container in the map, then deposits it in front of the cheater. They may then pick and choose what they want while utterly untouchable. </p>



<p>How can the average player compete with hackers? You have a few options. You can report them to BSG and hope they take action, try to avoid a known cheater, and consider playing single-player. BSG themselves recently launched the PvE mode, but there’s a fantastic single-player Escape From Tarkov mod, known as SPT, that genuinely instills me with excitement to play once more!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-do-escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-keep-coming-back">How Do Escape From Tarkov Cheaters Keep Coming Back?</h2>



<p>The amount of money flowing from the cheating scene proves rather tremendous on all fronts. You have cheat creators actively seeking workarounds to any anti-cheat software in their favorite games. In this case, EFT. Then, you have the cheaters themselves. They buy the cheats, use them for days or weeks before they receive a game ban, and sell the loot they receive, or even the account, for real money. Using that money, they turn around and buy another key for EFT on the cheap from a gray market website or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-buy-escape-from-tarkov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">directly from BSG during a sale</a> and continue the process.</p>

<p data-characters="396" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Along with increasing the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-magic-the-gathering-sets-in-2024-mtg-2024-release-schedule-and-sets-explained/">frequency of their <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> (MTG) releases</a> over the years, Wizards of the Coast have also begun to provide consistent updates to their <strong>Banned</strong> and <strong>Restricted</strong> card lists for each format. In a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/december-4-2023-banned-and-restricted-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2023 update</a> by Wizards designer Dan Musser, he confirmed that banned and restricted announcements will now be made within two to five weeks after the release of a set. </p> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false">Whether you’re playing <strong>Commander</strong> at your Local Games Store (LGS) or preparing a decklist for a <strong>Modern</strong> Challenge tournament, it’s essential that you’re up to date on what cards are legal in your format of choice.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-the-difference-between-banned-and-restricted-cards" data-injectable="false">The Difference between Banned and Restricted cards</h2> <h3 id="h-banned-cards" data-injectable="false">Banned Cards</h3> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true">Banned cards in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> are exactly what they sound like. These cards can’t be used in your deck or sideboard, otherwise your deck would be considered illegal to play. You’ll be expected to play with a legal deck even in casual settings unless you’ve discussed it with your playgroup or players at your LGS.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-restricted-cards" data-injectable="false">Restricted Cards</h3> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">Restricted lists are currently only used in the <strong>Vintage</strong> and <strong>Timeless</strong> formats. If a card is on the restricted list, only a single copy can be included within a deck and sideboard. This keeps the most powerful cards from being used over and over again, making it much more important for players to time their casts wisely.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-why-does-wizards-of-the-coast-ban-or-restrict-cards" data-injectable="false">Why does Wizards of the Coast ban or restrict cards?</h2> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">In many competitive games, balance changes are necessary in order to sustain a healthy gameplay environment; <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is no exception. But with over 30,000+ cards and counting, reprinting cards with minor changes isn’t feasible. And let’s face it, no player wants to take a Sharpie to their foils and adjust the power or toughness of their creatures.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="782" data-injectable="true">MTG’s solution is simple: Ban or restrict the cards that are disrupting the play environment or simply take the fun out of games. This policy has worked well for decades and isn’t likely to change anytime soon. Due to MTG’s rapid growth, some cards have managed to become unbanned due to the release of more forms of counterplay, effectively making previously overpowered cards reasonable for play.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="172" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Having a large library of game adaptations can be considered one of the biggest testaments to a franchise’s success. In this regard, only a few can rival <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/one-piece/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em></a>. </p> <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">But surprisingly, for the flagship of the Shonen demographic, the games based on the series can vary from sleeping hits to entries even die-hard fans struggle to love. Here are all <em>One Piece </em>games, ranked.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">All One Piece Games, Ranked From Worst to Best</h2> <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">To be fair in our rankings, we decided to only focus on games that made it to the West officially with an English localization. We also won’t be including crossovers such as <em>J-Stars Victory Vs</em>+ and <em>Jump Force</em>.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">24. One Piece Grand Cruise</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 (PlayStation VR)</li> <li>Released on: 2018</li> </ul> <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece Grand Cruise</em> is a VR title that<em> </em>allows you to interact with and assist the Straw Hats in two scenarios. But although both will involve battles, you won’t be able to jump into the fray directly. Instead, you will be in charge of operating a canon to face either a Kraken or stop a Marine attack. A short experience that offers very little, <em>Grand Cruise </em>feels like a missed opportunity. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">23. <mark>One Piece: Run, Chopper, Run!</mark></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Bandai Namco Entertainment YouTube. </figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Released for mobile devices</li> <li>Released on: 2015</li> </ul> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="722" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece: Run, Chopper, Run! </em>was a 2.5D endless running game that put fans in the role of everyone’s favorite cotton candy-loving reindeer. The game also allowed players to equip multiple costumes. Once equipped, each costume offered a new ability to Chopper. Unfortunately, the game was not successful, and its service ended in 2016. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">22. <mark>One Piece Bon! Bon!

Bon! Journey!!</em> was a puzzle gacha game. In it, players were tasked with assembling combinations of at least three matching bonbons within rows. Doing that would then allow your characters to perform attacks and damage enemies. The game was a success upon its release, but <em>Bon! Bon! Journey!! </em>was discontinued two years later. </p>
 <h3 id="h-21-one-piece-grand-battle-ps1" data-injectable="false">21. One Piece: Grand Battle!

As the first in the series, the game features impressive visuals for its time and follows the <em>Super Smash Bros</em> format. Nostalgia aside, the title did not age well and offers a pretty basic experience by today’s standards. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">20. One Piece Unlimited Cruise SP / SP2</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Images via MobyGames</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: Nintendo 3DS</li> <li>Released on: 2011 (SP) / 2012 (SP2)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="881" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece Unlimited Cruise SP</em> and<em> SP2</em> are localizations released after the debut of <em>SP’s</em> Japanese version. Each game features half of the title’s story, as well as some exclusive features. Among them, we have the Marineford Episodes. The mode adapts the arc it’s named after and brings many of its protagonists as playable characters. Unfortunately, that is overshadowed by how both <em>SP</em> and <em>SP2 </em>feature considerable downgrades when compared to the original <em>Unlimited Cruise</em> episodes. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">19. <mark>One Piece: Thousand Storm</mark></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via DeNA</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Released for mobile devices</li> <li>Released on: 2016</li> </ul> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="true">A gacha action RPG, <em>One Piece Treasure Cruise</em> won the hearts of many through its simplistic gameplay and F2P-friendly approach. The latter is seen in how the game did not have a character-pulling system. Instead, players could pull for Cards, which could then be equipped to characters to provide buffs or skills.&nbsp;<em>Treasure Cruise</em> was discontinued in January 2024.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">18. One Piece: Grand Battle!</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MobyGames</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Platforms: PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube</li> <li>Released on: 2005 / Released in Japan as <em>One Piece: Grand Battle! Rush</em></li> </ul> <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="783" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece: Grand Battle!</em> is the western version of <em>One Piece: Grand Battle! Rush</em>. Unlike the latter, however, the game only adapts the events up to the first portion of Alabasta. The title also shifts from the platform style present in previous entries in favor of an arena fighter approach. <em>Grand Battle! </em>was the first title in the series to debut in North America and features 16 playable characters. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">17. One Piece Gigant Battle</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: Nintendo DS </li> <li>Released on: 2010 (Japan) / 2011 (Europe)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="814" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece Gigant Battle</em> is a platform fighting game whose combat heavily resembles that of the <em>Super Smash Bros </em>series. The game also plays very similarly to <em>Jump</em> <em>Super</em> and <em>Ultimate Stars</em>. Here, you can take any characters from its roster of 20 to the field and join up to 4v4 battles. You can also use dozens of supports to get the upper hand. The title was the only game in the <em>Gigant Battle</em> series to be released outside of Japan. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">16. One Piece: Romance Dawn </h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: Nintendo 3DS (also PSP in Japan)</li> <li>Released on: 2012 (PSP) / 2014 (3DS)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="738" data-injectable="true">A turn-based RPG,<em> One Pìece: Romance Dawn</em> allows you to follow Luffy from the beginning of the <em>OP</em> story to the heartbreaking end of the Marineford Arc. The title features solid combat mechanics, but it’s hurt by its map designs and lack of side content. Nonetheless, <em>One Piece: Romance Dawn</em> offers a unique experience sure to at least entertain fans. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">15. One Piece: Pirates’ Carnival</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MobyGames</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: PS2 and GameCube</li> <li>Released on: 2005 (Japan) / 2006 (United States)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="480" data-current-count="860" data-injectable="true">Any successful manga/anime is guaranteed to receive a minigame-centric title at one point. In <em>One Piece’s</em> case, that’s <em>Pirates’ Carnival</em>. The game allows up to 4 players to participate in 40+ minigames. All of which can be played either as standalone experiences or as part of its Board Game mode. A casual experience that follows the formula made famous by the <em>Mario Party</em> franchise, <em>One Piece: Pirates’ Carnival</em> brings a niche but fun experience to all. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">14. One Piece: Grand Adventure</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MobyGames</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: PS2 and GameCube</li> <li>Released on: 2006</li> </ul> <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="822" data-injectable="true">A direct sequel to <em>Grand Battle!</em>, <em>One Piece: Grand Adventure</em> was released exclusively in North America and Europe. Apart from its versus mode, the game allows you to take part in mini-games and tournaments and dive into a story mode (known as Grand Adventure). Although the latter is geared toward younger audiences. <em>Grand Adventure</em> also deserves a special mention for featuring characters like Zeff within its 24-playable characters roster. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">13. One Piece: Unlimited Adventure</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Gamestop</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: Nintendo Wii</li> <li>Released on: 2007 (Japan) / 2008 (North America)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">An open-world action RPG featuring an original storyline and set after the events of Enies Lobby. <em>One Piece: Unlimited Adventure </em>follows the Star Hats after they come into contact with a glowing orb. The game brings a good degree of exploration to players. Being able to play as all Straw Hats is also a plus.</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Apart from the above, <em>Unlimited Adventure </em>also relies heavily on crafting and building. Both of which would become staples for the series. For fans of fighting games, you can also take control of more than 40 characters in up to 7v7 versus battles here. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">12. One Piece World Seeker</h3> <figure data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC</li> <li>Release Year: 2019</li> </ul> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false"><em>One Piece: World Seeker</em> is an action RPG that puts players in the control of Luffy after he finds himself in Jail Island. This time, the plot takes place after Dressrosa but before the Zou arc. Players can also play as Law, Sabo, and Zoro through Extra Episode DLCs. </p> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">Like the <em>Unlimited</em> series, <em>World Seeker</em> allows you to fully explore its open world map and features a simple combat system. You can also use multiple traversal abilities to cover ground fast and add more flair to exploration. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">11. One Piece: Unlimited Cruise</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Images via MobyGames</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: Nintendo Wii</li> <li>Release Year: 2008 (Japan) / 2009 (Europe)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="816" data-injectable="true">The second game in the <em>Unlimited </em>series, <em>One Piece: Unlimited Cruise,</em> features a non-canon story that takes place after the Thriller Bark arc. The action RPG was released as two episodes and features many of the mechanics present in its predecessor. All while also benefiting from some quality-of-life upgrades. Like <em>in Adventure</em>, the game allows you to take part in an open-world single-player mode, as well as face friends in Versus. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">10. <mark>One Piece Bounty Rush</mark></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: Mobile devices</li> <li>Released on: 2018</li> </ul> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="864" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece Bounty Rush </em>is a gacha real-time action game that overcame its troubled launch to become a fan favorite. The game features many modes, with its most well-known being its PVP 4v4. In it, you are tasked with capturing treasures on the battlefield and then guarding their areas from your opponents. A feat you can accomplish by performing explosive combos and characteristic attacks. <em>Bounty Rush</em> also boasts a roster of more than 250 characters going from East Blue to Egghead.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">9. One Piece Pirate Warriors (PS3)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MobyGames</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: PS3</li> <li>Release Year: 2012</li> </ul> <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="830" data-injectable="true"><em>Pirate Warriors </em>is the title responsible for starting what many believe to be the greatest <em>One Piece</em> game series of all time. Developed by Omega Force, the game features the musou style made famous by the developer’s <em>Destiny Warriors</em> franchise. On it, you can take a multitude of characters and battle against hordes of hundreds. This was a match made in heaven, as <em>One Piece’s</em> larger-than-life attacks were a perfect fit for the genre. </p>
 <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="199" data-injectable="false">Except for Skypea and Thriller Bark, players can experience all of the arcs up to Return to Sabaody in <em>Pirate Warriors</em>. Its small roster, however, might cause it to become repetitive relatively fast.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">8. One Piece: Unlimited World Red </h3> <figure data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: 3DS, PS3, Vita, Nintendo Wii U, PS4, Nintendo Switch, PS5, PC</li> <li>Release Year: 2013</li> </ul> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="331" data-injectable="false">The latest game in the <em>Unlimited</em> series, <em>One Piece: Unlimited World Red</em> features huge visual upgrades when compared to previous titles. The game also features another original non-canonical story, this time situated between Punk Hazard and Dressrosa. </p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="690" data-injectable="true">Overall, the core of the <em>Unlimited</em> experience remains almost the same here. Although <em>Unlimited World Red </em>shakes things up by focusing way more on combat. The latter of which is still as straightforward as it was in the Wii installments. The franchise’s building and crafting mechanics are also taken to another level. Now, you can upgrade a whole town. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">7. One Piece (GBA)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MobyGames, assembled by Destructoid </figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: Game Boy Advance</li> <li>Release Year: 2005</li> </ul> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="775" data-injectable="true">Sometimes less is more. An action platformer developed by Dimps and released exclusively in North America,<em> One Piece </em>allows players to follow through the events of the East Blue saga. Featuring a solid but simple beat ’em-up combat and well-made sprites, this game is a blast. Honestly, the only downsides here are its length and how you cannot battle with any Straw Hat apart from Luffy. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">6. One Piece Pirate Warriors 2</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MobyGames</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: PS3 and PSVita</li> <li>Release Year: 2013</li> </ul> <p data-characters="570" data-current-count="950" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece Pirate Warriors</em> 2 further polishes the combat system featured in the original game while also increasing its roster to 37 characters. The former is not an understatement, as the game feels faster, more consistent, and way more responsive. The title also removed QTEs and the divisive platform sections players came to hate in <em>Pirate Warriors</em>. On the other hand, <em>Pirate Warriors</em> 2’s most debatable point lies in its main story, where you don’t play through the series’ arcs. Instead, the game features an alternative What If original scenario.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">5. One Piece Treasure Cruise</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: Mobile</li> <li>Release Year: 2014</li> </ul> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece Treasure Cruise </em>is a gacha turn-based RPG that allows you to revisit the whole story of the franchise. The title also allows you to take more than 200 characters to the field in various modes. Most of the characters must be pulled in true gacha fashion.</p>
 <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">The game’s biggest differential, however, lies in its combo mechanic.&nbsp;When in battle, the mechanic will allow you to perform sequential attacks by&nbsp;tapping.<em>&nbsp;</em>You can also find a deep team-building system here. This can be seen in how players, more often than not, need to completely rework their teams based on the opposition. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">4. One Piece: Burning Blood</h3> <figure data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: PS5, PS4, PSVita, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</li> <li>Release Year: 2016</li> </ul> <p data-characters="539" data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece</em>: <em>Burning Blood</em> is an arena fighter that allows you to take part in up to 3v3 battles. The game won the hearts of fans by featuring a straightforward but still entertaining combat system. Here, understanding how to efficiently counter your opponent will be key. Another huge highlight lies in its roster. The version released for the PS4, Xbox One, and PC offers 44 playable characters and 50 supports. That helps make up for the fact that <em>Burning Blood</em> features an extremely compact main story (covering only the Marineford Arc).</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">3. One Piece Pirate Warriors 3</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: PS3, PS4, PS5, PSVita, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</li> <li>Release Year: 2016</li> </ul> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="722" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece Pirate Warriors 3</em> goes all out by featuring huge combat and graphical upgrades when compared to 2. Differently from the latter, however, the game’s story mode covers the canon of the series until the Dressrosa Arc. As the arc was still ongoing when the game was released, <em>PW3</em> features an original non-canonical ending for it. </p>
 <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="188" data-injectable="false">There are very few things not to love here, as the added mechanics —such as the Kizuna Rush and Overdrive— made the game as fun as it can be.

You can find some wild names here, such as Big Mom, Kaido, and Gear 5 Luffy —the latter available via a DLC. The game also made significant changes to combat. Among the tweaks, the biggest one lies in how players can now perform aerial combos. </p>
 <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false"><em>Pirate Warriors 4</em> also features a bulky story mode. In it, you can go through the Alabasta, Enies Lobby, Marineford, New World, Whole Cake, and Wano arcs.

 <p data-characters="169" data-current-count="169" data-injectable="false"><em>Odyssey</em> also set itself apart for the quality of its original storyline. The latter of which segments the title as the best <em>One Piece </em>game released in the West to date. </p>

            <p>The next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/every-call-of-duty-campaign-ranked">Call Of Duty</a> will arrive on Game Pass on day one, according to anonymous sources. Microsoft's strategy has long involved releasing all their first-party games on Game Pass, but there had been doubt over whether the same would be true of the first Call Of Duty to be released since Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of publishers Activision.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-call-of-duty-game-pass-53e8930c">the Wall Street Journal</a> (paywalled), who cite "people familiar with the matter", the plans are due to be announced at the Xbox showcase next month. A Microsoft spokeswoman declined the WSJ's request for comment.
</p>
<p>Call Of Duty remains a top seller every year, and even the critically-derided Modern Warfare 3 was the second best-selling game of last year in America. Not bad considering it was released on November 10th.
</p>
<p>There's plenty of evidence to suggest that releasing a first-party game on Game Pass reduces the number of people willing to cough up the premium fee, and so there had been doubt that Microsoft would risk slaughtering the golden goose by putting Call Of Duty on their subscription service. 
</p>
<p>Personally, I'm not surprised. Microsoft's entire Xbox strategy is based around Game Pass, and buying Activision Blizzard seems like a clear effort to get Game Pass subscription numbers growing again after years of stagnation. Microsoft only get the benefits of their investment if Call Of Duty joins Game Pass, just as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4-is-coming-to-game-pass-on-march-28th">Diablo 4 did earlier this year</a>.
</p>
<p>Those stagnant Game Pass numbers have also been blamed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-xbox-studio-cuts-likely-to-follow-tango-and-arkane-austin-and-game-pass-looks-like-the-culprit">for the recent closure of the beloved Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks</a>, two studios Microsoft picked up in their earlier acquisition of publisher Bethesda.
</p>
<p>Microsoft's Xbox Showcase will take place on June 9th, amid the week of game announcements formerly known as E3.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/adult-friendships-can-be-tough-babes-gets-it.874782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24159206/babes-movie-ilana-glazer-michelle-buteau-adult-friendships<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="HE2lBB">In one of the first scenes of the new comedy <em>Babes</em>, free-spirited Eden (Ilana Glazer) gets down on her knees to peer at her best friend’s vagina. Pragmatic Dawn (Michelle Buteau) is going into labor, and Eden is trying to gauge how far along she is, to figure out whether they can continue to eat brunch, or they need to get Dawn to a hospital right away. It’s immediately clear that director Pamela Adlon is not holding back when it comes to the grosser details of pregnancy and childbirth, and using them to full comedic potential. </p>
<p id="GaKOaW">That scene also speaks to what the movie actually is: an honest look at the strain adulthood puts on friendships, especially as life tugs individuals along separate journeys. Eden and Dawn’s relationship feels authentic — their bathroom-routine updates, their full conversation where all they say is “Bitch!” in different tones, Eden immediately volunteering to buy Dawn sushi for her first post-birth meal. It made me nod along and think <em>Ha ha, I’m like that with my best friends</em>.</p>
<p id="lqUgY5">That also means that during their arguments with each other, I thought <em>Oh no, I feel like that, too. </em>I’ve never gotten mad because my friend showed my child <em>The Omen</em>, as Eden does with one of Dawn’s kids, prompting him to write demonic symbols all over his bedroom wall and scare off the new nanny. But I do get frustrated when weekend plans with my friends don’t align, because one of us has a standing commitment that the other just doesn’t understand. Adlon keeps Dawn and Eden’s frustrations grounded (albeit with some hilarious, over-the-top inciting incidents), so they never escalate to the point of destroying their friendship. That just makes their grievances resonate even more. </p>

<p id="Qb6ZJ3">Eden and Dawn have been best friends since they were kids. Though Dawn is a married mother of two and Eden is single and living her best noncommittal life, they still make time for each other, even if that means Eden has a four-train journey across New York City if she wants to meet Dawn for their annual Thanksgiving tradition of watching a movie in a theater. </p>
<p id="DUy5L9">When Eden ends up pregnant from a one-night stand, she decides to keep the baby, much to everyone’s surprise. Dawn promises to support her. But Dawn has her own life to juggle, with her family, work, and marriage, and she can’t always be there when Eden needs her. And Eden admittedly needs her constantly for appointments and other pregnancy-related things, since she doesn’t have a lot of other meaningful relationships in her life, particularly not with other parents. The tension unearths buried frustrations; Eden doesn’t admit it at first, but she feels abandoned and betrayed that Dawn and her husband moved to Manhattan, away from where she and Dawn grew up in Astoria, Queens. </p>
<p id="TZ3ZPE">As someone who recently moved to a different borough from most of her friends, I felt that struggle so deeply. Instead of walking 10 minutes to meet up, now my friends and I need to find a middle point, or else commute via a stupid number of trains. (Seriously, why doesn’t the M train connect Queens and Brooklyn?!) I’m happy with my move; it was the right decision for me and my partner. Likewise, Dawn moved because living in a nice brownstone that could fit her entire family was the right choice for them. </p>

<p id="MPDHn4">But eventually, Eden confesses that she’s sad Dawn never considered her feelings when making the move. That moment made me confront a fact I’d been trying to ignore: I didn’t consider how far away I’d be from my closest friends when I moved, either, and I didn’t consider the toll it would take on my relationships. I insisted that overall, the move made sense because it’s what me and my partner wanted. Societally, we tend to accept that people will consult their spouses, immediate family, and their jobs when moving, and no one else. But with <em>Babes</em>, Adlon comes right out and says it: best friends get totally shafted in adulthood. </p>
<p id="iA3cV5">Sitcoms like<em> Friends</em> or <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> have a very rose-colored view of how friendship works for people in their 20s and 30s, in which people’s lives revolve around a tight-knit group of friends who somehow all have free schedules and live in the same neighborhood. But actual adulthood is busy! And you sometimes need to take four trains on a holiday weekend to get to a convenient meeting place. Your priorities start to shift, and they may not align with your friends’ priorities.</p>
<p id="ENq658">It’s a slow strain, but maybe one friend is starting a family, so they can’t afford New York City rent anymore; maybe another joined a club and their weekends are full of commitments; maybe another insists on staying in Bushwick, despite living in a tiny apartment (it’s rent-stabilized, though!) and outgrowing the hip nightlife scene. Those frequent weekend hangouts become more and more sparse, a fact you try to ignore because you love your friends so much, but one that eventually does alter your relationship. </p>

<p id="vzEzr2">Unlike in <em>Bridesmaids</em>, where tension escalates to a huge relationship-ending fight, Adlon take in <em>Babes</em> is that, most of the time, fighting with a best friend doesn’t mean totally cutting them out of your life. Even when Dawn and Eden argue — and their personal frustrations do escalate into pretty big blowouts — they never stop being friends or talking to each other. Usually, when friends fight in movies, it involves a big, dramatic declaration that the friendship is over, sometimes accompanied by an angsty life-without-each-other montage to really solidify that they aren’t talking. But in <em>Babes</em>, even after some arguments, Dawn and Eden still hang out, and are still friends. </p>
<p id="hfcNUK"><em>Babes</em>’ view of adulthood friendships isn’t idyllic, but it also isn’t overblown drama, in a way that’s easy to dismiss as heightened, unreal movie fiction. Having a fight with a friend that only sort of gets patched up as you continue to be in each other’s lives feels much more real, especially when that argument is built on beautifully realized tension, where neither side is <em>wrong</em> exactly, but neither of them are right, either. At its core, <em>Babes</em> is a love story between Eden and Dawn, two best friends who struggle to keep their friendship strong as adulthood threatens to pull them apart. Never once does Adlon lead us to doubt that these women mean a lot to each other.</p>
<p id="GcwMUf">It’s telling that this movie never veers into finding a romance for Eden as a way to fix her relationship with Dawn. Dawn is married and her husband is incredibly supportive, but Eden doesn’t magically find a similar partner who shows her the importance of family, or who reframes her friendship with Dawn as a secondary consideration. A lesser movie might have Eden realize that her new baby and possible new beau are her priorities now, and tell Dawn that she finally understands where Dawn is coming from. Instead, Adlon declares that friendships are just as important as family.</p>
<p id="E2OQ0b">Society constantly prioritizes romantic relationships and the nuclear family over friendships, which we see over and over again in media. So to see a movie celebrate the importance of adult friendship, and have both friends reach a new, realistic understanding of how their relationship has evolved — but not disintegrated — is immensely satisfying. It’s an important perspective on friendship — one that often gets overlooked in a youth-focused cultural landscape, but that speaks to something a lot of us have experienced in some form, or will eventually experience, sooner than we might like. </p>

 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">Alongside the usual dice, cash, and sticker pack rewards, you can also receive Robo Partners tokens to progress through the ongoing Partners event. The Partners event also has its own milestones and rewards list, with the grand prize including a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-wild-stickers-in-monopoly-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wild Sticker</a>, making it worthwhile to participate. </p> <h2 id="h-how-to-score-points-in-the-monopoly-go-fortune-patrol-event" data-injectable="false">How to score points in the&nbsp;<em>Monopoly GO</em>&nbsp;Fortune Patrol event</h2> <p data-characters="154" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">You’ll score points during the Fortune Patrol banner event by landing on Chance, Community Chest, and Railroad tiles. Below are the points for each:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li>Chance: Two points</li> <li>Community Chest: Three points</li> <li>Railroad: Five points</li> </ul> <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="false">Since you need tens of thousands of points to finish the event before its time limit ends, you’ll also need to increase your dice multiplier. The points you receive from these event spaces scale with your multiplier, allowing you to score more if you land on them at the cost of using more dice per roll. Watch your dice supply, as you can quickly burn through it if you’re using a high multiplier, especially if you have High Roller active.</p>
