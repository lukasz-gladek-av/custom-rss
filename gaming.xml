            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/startplaying-and-roll20-partner-up-for-daggerheart-launch-event<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roll20 and StartPlaying are partnering for a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-darrington-press-hotly-anticipated-ttrpg-is-now-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> launch event. Darrington Press' highly anticipated fantasy TTRPG, set to release sometime this year, will have the support of one of the industry's largest VTT platforms and professional GM services.</p>

<h2>The <em>Daggerheart</em> Launch Event Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Roll20 and StartPlaying have put together an extensive <em>Daggerheart</em> launch event. StartPlaying has provided over 150 officially vetted Game Masters with advance copies of the <em>Daggerheart</em> Core Rulebook via the Demiplane Nexus. This means once the TTRPG launches, those wanting to experience it as intended can do so through StartPlaying.</p>

The entire launch month of Daggheart will be packed with exclusive online game sessions hosted by StartPlaying. Registration for these gaming tables are limited, so if you are a fan of Critical Role or have been enjoying the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-13-playtest-available-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">past playtests</a> of the game, it is best to register now while you can.</p>

<p>The press confirmed that the Daggerheart Demiplane Nexus will offer everything needed to play the game. This will include a digital reader, compendium, character builder, and GM tools. Furthermore, courtesy of the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-roll20-demiplane-integration-feature-is-now-in-beta" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">platform integration</a> feature, these tools will be completely compatible with Roll20.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This is an incredible opportunity for fans who have been eagerly awaiting Daggerheart’s release," said Jayme Boucher, Senior Marketing Manager at Roll20, the parent company of Demiplane. "Being able to learn and enjoy a brand-new TTRPG on launch day with professional GMs is not a typical day one experience, but it’s one that Roll20, StartPlaying, and Darrington Press are delighted to offer the community.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Daggerheart is Darrington Press' latest TTRPG. The publishing arm of Critical Role has produced several high-quality TTRPG books and products. These include official supplements for the fantasy setting of Exandria like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tal'Dorei Reborn</em></a> and its gaslamp fantasy TTRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/candela-obscura-core-rulebook-review-comprehensive-guide-to-newfaire-and-horror" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/661814/xbox-best-selling-games-ps5-oblivion-minecraft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>More than a year after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073691/microsoft-xbox-games-ps5-nintendo-switch-exclusivity">Microsoft announced plans to start releasing games on rival platforms</a>, the publisher seems to have hit its stride on PlayStation. Sony released <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/05/playstation-store-april-2025s-top-downloads/">its monthly most-downloaded charts for PS5 games</a>, and for April, the top three titles in both Europe and North America all came from Microsoft. No sales numbers were included, but the top games were <em>Minecraft</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/654770/oblivion-remaster-hands-on-xbox-gamepass-bethesda">the <em>Oblivion</em> remaster</a>, and <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314376/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-bethesda-machinegames-xbox"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a> and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> charted as well.</p></div><p>This, of course, is a great thing for players, with major game releases available on more platforms. But it’s also part of a slow and steady shift for the platform holders, which once heavily relied on exclusives as a means to move hardware. That’s still largely the case for Nintendo — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">don’t expect to see <em>Mario Kart World</em> anywhere but the Switch 2</a> — but Microsoft and Sony have been steadily pushing in another direction.</p><p>While Sony has yet to release a first-party game on a rival console, it has made the PC a major part of its current strategy, with notable releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/18/24273919/spider-man-2-pc-release-date"><em>Spider-Man 2</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24340000/the-last-of-us-part-2-pc-playstation-network">soon <em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a> launching on PC after their PlayStation debuts. Part of the goal, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167560/sony-thinks-its-pc-games-will-tempt-you-to-buy-a-playstation-really">according to Sony</a>, is to use these PC games to eventually lure players back to their console.</p><p>Microsoft’s strategy has similarly been gradual, but more expansive. It started with four smaller titles, including <em>Grounded</em> and <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, last February, and covered both the PS5 and Nintendo Switch. And <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073666/microsoft-gaming-phil-spencer-interview-ps5-switch-games">at the time Xbox chief Phil Spencer told <em>The Verge</em> that</a> “I don’t want to create a false expectation on those other platforms that this is somehow the first four to get over the dam and then the dam’s going to open and that everything else is coming, that’s not the plan today. I also don’t want to mislead customers on those other platforms.”</p><p>Well, the dam seems to have burst. Major Xbox releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606102/xbox-ps5-age-of-empires"><em>Age of Empires</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610817/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date"><em>Indiana Jones</em></a> have made their way to the PS5, while upcoming games like <em>Doom</em>, <em>Gears</em>, and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> are also launching on Sony’s console. Not every first-party Xbox game has been announced for the PS5 — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/611255/avowed-review-xbox-pc"><em>Avowed</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647143/south-of-midnight-review-xbox-compulsion-games"><em>South of Midnight</em></a> are still Xbox exclusives, for now, as is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23852390/starfield-review-xbox-pc"><em>Starfield</em></a> — but many of the heavy hitters have, including the likes of <em>Gears</em>, which has long been heavily associated with the Xbox brand.</p><p>It seems pretty clear that Microsoft is still in something of an experimentation phase, seeing how different kinds of games perform on different platforms. And as selling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659430/microsoft-xbox-console-controller-game-price-increases-worldwide">increasingly expensive hardware</a> becomes less of a focus for the publisher, the success of those games will be key. Last year, when this initiative was still getting started, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24074166/microsoft-xbox-strategy-multiplatform">Spencer said that the long-term goal was</a> “a future where every screen is an Xbox.” Based on the current sales charts, it seems that now includes a PlayStation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> is one of those forever games where occasionally I'll see that it's released something new and think "dang, that old dog is still truckin' along?" It seems to be that time of year again, as both a big update for the game as well as a new expansion dropped yesterday. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/paradox-interactive">Paradox</a> previously described this as a "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-date-stellaris-40-a-phoenix-update-to-attract-new-players-and-improve-performance">phoenix update</a>" to try and sort out a bunch of the game's long-running issues, as well as make some tweaks to help bring in new players.
</p>

<p>
Ironically, based on some recent Steam reviews since the update dropped, a lot of people seem to be saying it's kind of done the opposite, at least in terms of making the game run better. I'm sure that'll get fixed eventually, the game's nearly 10 years old, I doubt one dodgy update will sink this spaceship. In terms of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/502823294872846886">update's big changes</a>, the game now groups singular populations by species, strata, and ethic. These groups then produce Workforce, which then get assigned to jobs on your planets.

<p>
DLC wise, there's lots of additions there too. You'll find a couple of new biological shipsets, which kind of look like different species of deep sea squid. There's also a new origin called the Wilderness, a "Hive Mind exclusive origin" that requires you to play with a biological ship set.
</p>
<p>
Godzilla and giant space creature lovers alike may also be interested in the new player crisis scenario which lets you breed your very own giant monster. Existentially terrifying, but makes for some cool gameplay.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that, there's new civics like genetic identification and civil education, a new deep space citadel megastructure, an overhauled genetic ascension, and a lot more. Big DLC! Too much to cover here, but that's ok, it just leaves plenty more for you to discover. Or to just read about in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/502823913043001850">Steam post</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-and-website-still-lists-release-date-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s-with-no-mention-of-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-released-rockstar-tells-fans-to-explore-vice-city-and-beyond">the release of Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2</a> and a significant update to its official website, all eyes were on the launch platforms accompanying the new release date of May 26, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the trailer, we see the release date alongside the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, confirming the consoles remain part of GTA 6’s release. Indeed, Trailer 2 was captured on a PS5 (the trailer specifically mentions PS5, as opposed to PS5 Pro).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what does this mean for the inevitable PC launch, or perhaps even a release on the Nintendo Switch 2? Some had wondered, perhaps even hoped, that GTA 6’s push to May 2026 would cause a rethink at Rockstar and parent company Take-Two and spark a simultaneous release on PC. The lack of mention of PC here perhaps suggests otherwise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an omission in keeping with developer Rockstar’s playbook for its previous games, but in 2025 and certainly in 2026 it feels outdated. And, given the increasing importance of the PC for a multiplatform game’s success, is GTA 6’s no-show on PC a missed opportunity or even a mistake?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025?utm_source=threads,twitter">IGN put that question to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick in an interview in February</a>, and in his response he teased GTA 6’s <em>eventual</em> release on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So with Civ 7 it's available on console and PC and Switch right away,” Zelnick said of Firaxis' recently launched Civilization 7. “With regard to others in our lineup, we don't always go across all platforms simultaneously. Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/gta-6-main-1746545044332.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GTA 6 is still set to launch on console only.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar fans have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question of how long PC gamers will have to wait for what could end up being one of the biggest games ever remains. If not May 2026, then when? Fall 2027? Early 2027? A year later, in May 2027?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-tries-to-explain-why-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-after-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s"><u>attempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hits PS5 and Xbox Series X and S</u></a>, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how big of a missed opportunity could skipping PC for GTA 6’s launch be? Zelnick told IGN that the PC version of a multiplatform game can generate 40% of overall sales, or even more with certain games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Lucia Caminos Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue,” he said. “Of course, there will be a new console generation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, there’s no Nintendo Switch 2 logo on GTA 6 Trailer 2, which is perhaps expected. While we still don’t know exactly what the Switch 2 is capable of, it is set to get CD Projekt’s Cyberpunk 2077, so there was some hope that GTA 6, which, let’s remember, is still down as coming to the less powerful Xbox Series S, could make its way to Nintendo’s next-gen console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It's similar to the spell that Delve NPC companion Brann Bronzebeard occasionally busts out when players are injured. The spell's healing properties, Wowhead notes, are actually stronger than the best cooking profession foods available, and it can also be used inside dungeons and raids.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft: The War Within - Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It's a nice little addition that in many ways feels overdue. Having to buy food from a vendor or eating just to regain lost health is definitely a core part of early WoW but hasn't been especially relevant as a mechanic for many, many years at this point. That's particularly true for characters with mana who have healing spells. Since running out of mana is almost unheard of in modern WoW unless you are in a lengthy PvP battle or extended raid encounter, classes with access to a heal can easily use that to restore their health fast instead of taking the time to eat.</p><p dir="ltr">Just because Blizzard is giving every player an easy way to heal up after encounters doesn't mean cooking or buying consumables from vendors will be obsolete. Recuperate, notably, does not restore mana. It also doesn't provide any stat-boosting buffs--the primary reason players sit down and eat a snack before a fight. That makes the game's cooking profession still relevant.</p><p dir="ltr">Recuperate is just one of many interesting additions coming as part of the game's next patch, titled Legacy of Arathor. It's also introducing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-patch-11-1-7-will-add-a-new-story-focused-way-to-level-characters/1100-6531276/" data-ref-id="1100-6531276">new story-focused way to level characters</a> called Lorewalking and adding a rotation assist tool that can even go so far to turn a class' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-one-button-rotation-tool-will-basically-play-the-game-for-you/1100-6531244/" data-ref-id="1100-6531244">damage rotation spells into a single button</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Patch 11.1.7 doesn't yet have a release date, but Blizzard in the meantime continues to share more details about how the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/" data-ref-id="1100-6529278">MMORPG's upcoming housing system will work</a>. In its latest blog discussing the topic, Blizzard revealed how old expansion content and professions will be relevant again when it comes to acquiring housing items, and that the game will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-system-will-reward-decor-based-on-past-achievements/1100-6531163/" data-ref-id="1100-6531163">retroactively reward housing items based on past achievements</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/06/rockstar-details-9-of-grand-theft-auto-vis-presumably-many-many-characters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/06/rockstar-just-unveiled-the-second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer">surprise released a new trailer this morning</a> for Grand Theft Auto VI (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/02/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-to-may-2026">which was recently delayed to next year</a>), but that's not all it shared about the game today. Alongside the trailer, Rockstar overhauled <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">the game's website</a> and added all kinds of new details about the the game's locations and some of the characters you will meet in the game, including its protagonists.</p>



<p>Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos are the aforementioned protagonists. Jason an army vet who works in the Keys for local drug runners, but wants to try something new. Lucia's father trained her as a fighter her whole life and it was apparently fighting for her family that landed her in jail. But in both the GTA VI trailers, we see her regaining her freedom.</p>



<p>Brian Heder is the other character we see early in the trailer. He is an older gentleman that Jason apparently works for. Apparently he and his wife Lori manage the drug running business together. Though it was not confirmed in the trailer, Brian sounds like he is voiced by Stephen Root (<em>Barry</em>, <em>King of the Hill</em>).</p>



<p>Cal Hampton is also seen speaking periodically in the trailer. He is apparently a friend of Jason's and also works for Brian. Though similarly not confirmed in the trailer, it sounds like he is voiced by <em>Saturday Night Live</em>'s Bobby Moynihan.</p>



<p>Boobie Ike is a well-known and successful Vice City entrepreneur who built a number of legitimate businesses from his crime roots.</p>



<p>Dre'quan Priest is a musician who is "more of a hustler than a gangster" according to his bio.</p>



<p>Bae-Luxe and Roxy together go by Real Dimez. They are high school friends and are heavily invested in social media.</p>



<p>And finally,&nbsp;Raul Bautista is a charming and cunning bank robber.</p>

<p>There will be undoubtedly be many more characters in Grand Theft Auto VI when it releases May 26 of next year, but for now, this is a substantial look at who we can expect to meet in the game.&nbsp;For more GTA 6, you can <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/04/grand-theft-auto-vi-revealed-with-first-official-trailer-alongside-2025-release">rewatch its reveal trailer</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/humor/2023/12/05/watch-two-florida-men-analyze-the-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer">see what Game Informer's resident Floridians thought about Rockstar's adaptation of their home state</a>.</p>

<p>TechRaptor was given an exclusive sneak peek at four of the Environments that will be available in the full rulebook when it releases physically and digitally at the end of the month. We also had a chance to talk about Environments (among other things that will be saved for a later date) with Lead Designers <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3b50b662-11ad-4fba-8903-ff76c59dea55" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/spenser-starke-is-bringing-cinematic-gming-to-candela-obscura-chapter-2" rel="nofollow">Spenser Starke</a> and Rowan Hall.</p>

<h2>Environments Help A GM Consider The World</h2>

<p>Environments are locations that a GM can put in play that will not only affect the story by posing potential challenges for the players to overcome, but also offer unique mechanical obstacles to engage in.</p>

<p>The four Environments that TechRaptor can exclusively reveal are the Cliffside Ascent, Local Tavern, Outpost Town, and Raging River. Each is a Tier 1 event, which means it's intended for a party of level 2-4. Set for a lower level of play we're able to see how each of these are able to impact the party, and how these can be scaled up.</p>

<p>Each Environment is comprises of the following features:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Name:</strong> The name of the Environment</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Tier and Style of Environment: </strong>Here we see both Traversal and Social giving you fast information for where you might want to include it</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Impulses: </strong>Describing the way that you could provoke your players with the Environment to help them more readily engage</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Difficulty: </strong>This indicates the average difficulty check that the area would have, the GM can then further scale this up or down based on the relative safety or danger of the character's actions</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Potential Adversaries:</strong> A list of creatures or monsters that a party might find while exploring that area</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Features: </strong>Key gameplay elements tied to the Environment, these can be related to social interactions, rules for how to overcome an obstacle, but also can be related to ways things like combat may change</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>"We like Environments because they allow you to create a stat block, but for a place" - Spenser Starke</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Getting to talk with Starke and Hall they explained they wanted to create a way that you could have stats about a location, that were available for you next to Adversaries. In <em>Daggerheart</em>, as play moves back to the GM it's important that you're able to understand all of the moves you can make.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-environments-exclusive-page-spread.jpg?itok=3oE4lfMJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-environments-exclusive-page-spread.jpg?itok=kf9-RpNj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>How Environments Enhance <em>Daggerheart </em>Combat</h2>

<p>Hall gave an example of how an Environment could be used "say you're taking your players to a graveyard, you know there's a big bad evil Necromancer raising a bunch of zombies, you've got maybe a horde statted up, but you also want to have hands reach up from graves and grab your players and restrain them. It could be a lot of work to stat up a bunch of zombies, but if you have an Environment you can make an Environment Action where on a certain trigger hands restrain your players"</p>

<p>In <em>Daggerheart</em>, the combat isn't linear in that every character and adversary has a turn in order before it all resets. There's a player's turn and a GM's turn. For the players, this promotes playing collaboratively to strike together, for the GM, that means when it's your turn, any of the Adversaries at your command can go at any time. So many abilities at any point in time can be difficult to track, letting an Environment clearly be part of your list of actions is simply helping the GM have less to manage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Being able to pair down and streamline [combat], we're always looking for ways to give GMs all of the support that they need and also open enough doors that they might expand with their own narrative, their own choices, and have flexibility" - Rowan Hall</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starke did highlight that Environments shouldn't be used everywhere "but if there's a place where you're like 'I can see how this environment itself really impacts the narrative, let me write down what this place is really about."</p>

<h2>An Environment Doesn't Have To Be A Place</h2>

<p>While the four that TechRaptor has been able to reveal were specifically places, Starke expanded that there were also Environments that it may not be "a particular place, it isn't like, an outpost but it is an Ambush. That can be placed anywhere, but it can give you the framing of what mechanically an Ambush might look like in <em>Daggerheart </em>for a scene you're interested in running."</p>

<p>When I asked what kinds of GM tools would be available for crafting their own Environments Hall paused for a moment before saying "One of my favorite parts of the book is a section where we go through how we build different adversary types and why we make the choices we do."</p>

<p>Describing it as 'popping open the hood' Hall continued to explain "We hope it's a conversation with the designers, the goal there was to make it as approachable as possible with as many examples as possible to people can refer to it almost like a recipe book. We have all different ways that people can approach that."</p>

<p>It's these kinds of behind the scenes looks and conversational understandings about why things are designed the way that they are that Starke and Hall are hoping it will make GMs crafting their own Environments possible.</p>

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Feven-more-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-games-and-updates-released%2F" rel="sponsored">has announced</a> a May 19th release date for its $299 RTX 5060 graphics card and the first laptops, which start at $1,099, that will feature it. The company says they’ll be available to buy from retail partners starting at 9AM PT / 12PM ET.</p><p>At 3,840 CUDA cores, the RTX 5060 has nearly 800 fewer cores than the 5060 Ti Nvidia <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648705/nvidias-rtx-5060-ti-gpu-pricing-release-date">released last month</a> and is the most basic of the RTX 50-series. But like the Ti version, the 5060 has GDDR7 memory, supports DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, and gets the latest ray tracing and tensor cores. The company says more games are being updated with support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation before the 5060 launches, including <em>MechWarrior 5: Clans </em>on May 7th and <em>New World: Aeternum</em> on May 13th. </p><p>Whether the card is worth picking up, though, is another story. The RTX 5060 is limited to just 8GB of VRAM, and chances are good it’ll cost more than its suggested $299 retail price. Retailers started selling GPUs, including the other RTX 50-series cards, at a premium even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628332/amd-9070-xt-gpu-retailer-partner-scalping">before President Trump’s tariffs took hold</a>. And as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/656783/gpu-prices-are-out-of-control-again"><em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister</a> noted recently, Trump’s removal of the de minimus exemption last week could also impact pricing via extra import taxes on shipments valued at or under $800.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rockstar have released a second trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. It's one of those cinematic clip shows of scenes from the game, setting up the story and relationship between dual protagonists Jason and Lucia. It's horny and boring at the same time. Nope, there's still no word on a PC release, sorry. </p>

<p>In the video we see Jason "Do You Even Lift" Duval going to collect his partner in crime (and life) from her stint in prison. Once free, Lucia "Okay One More Butt Shot" Caminos fires many weapons, kicks people, and makes kissy faces at her criminal bae. This is all set to 1986 pop hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NnMl7NUmS8">Hot Together by the Pointer Sisters</a>.</p>
<p>"Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them," say Rockstar on <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">the studio's website</a>, where they're finally sharing more about the game's story. "But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive."</p>
<p>Other characters include conspiracy theorist pal Cal Hampton (basically Jack Black), bank robber Raul Bautista, gangster-to-musician Dre'Quan Priest, and two social media rappers known as Real Dimez. The developers have dumped a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI/downloads/screenshots">ton of screenshots</a> of these characters and more.</p>
<p>The trailer follows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">the game's recent delay</a>, which pushed the open world crime sim's release date back to May 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the film itself, the name “Thunderbolts” refers to a soccer team Yelena (Florence Pugh) was part of as a child, which her father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), uses as a placeholder name for their team of misfit toys. At the very end, the group is rebranded as the “New Avengers,” officially relaunching the superhero team after its previous lineup disbanded following the events of <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) leads the team, which makes sense considering he’s the only person who was around as part of the initial group when Thanos was destroying half the known universe, but as seen in the post-credits scene, not every Avengers alumnus is thrilled by this development. Captain America (Anthony Mackie) is suing the group for copyright infringement after he was shown to be in talks to lead a new team under the Avengers banner in <em>Brave New World</em>. So it seems like there will be some tension between the group and other heroes in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474"><em>Avengers: Doomsday</em></a></span><em> </em>next year.</p><p>Once the group is deemed the New Avengers, the end credits sequence reveals the film’s new, true title: <em>The New Avengers</em>. It’s a clever gimmick that finally contextualizes the asterisk in the movie’s original title. However, it wasn’t enough for Marvel to introduce a New Avengers team through the back door of what appeared to be more of a B-plot film about some of the outcasts of the MCU; the company is also making this a marketing beat and spoiling the movie after one weekend. This isn’t just sequestered into trailers or social media videos; real-world billboards for the film are being updated for people to stumble upon out in the wild.</p><p>I’m torn because, as a marketing campaign, it’s pretty great. From the outside, <em>Thunderbolts* </em>was already fighting an uphill battle as a team-up movie of mostly side heroes in a franchise that no longer has the same cultural cache it once did. So it’s fun to see the movie rebranded as something more seemingly central to the overall MCU as a cheeky acknowledgement of the “oh, you thought you could skip this one?” feeling that has followed it. But also, this movie is only days old, and Marvel is using its massive platform to just spoil it outright for anyone who didn’t have the time or cash to swing by the theater on opening weekend. I’m staunchly against a company trying to control the narrative and tell people not to talk about something they paid money to see (within reason), but I feel even weirder about Marvel making that executive decision collectively for its audience.</p><p>Spoiler culture has gotten out of hand, and people’s almost phobia-like aversion to even pretty basic narrative details has made it almost impossible to talk about media without a comical amount of self-policing in public spaces. But I don’t know if Marvel is the company to take a big, subversive swing on the matter just 72 hours after a movie launched. Maybe there’s something to be said about how the “Thanos demands your silence” nonsense was a trailblazer and that other companies have followed suit in the years since. Maybe <em>Thunderbolts* </em>could be a pivot point that encourages people to stop taking spoiler culture so seriously. But maybe it could have waited one more week or so. Some of us were busy last weekend, Kevin Feige. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
After last week revealing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">Grand Theft Auto 6's delay to May 2026</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-second-trailer-is-here">Rockstar has today released the second trailer</a> for its highly-anticipated open world game. 
</p>
<p>
Much of the new footage focuses on co-protagonist Jason Duval, glimpsed in Rockstar's first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> trailer alongside his partner in crime Lucia. Today's trailer expands on his life, the couple's relationship, and introduces a few more faces from the game's cast. 
</p><p>

Alongside the trailer, Rockstar has also released a brief synopsis of the game's plot: "Set in Vice City, Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida - forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive."

</p><p>
Let's dive in.
</p>

<p>The trailer opens with a look at this picturesque seafront area - vastly different to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s Los Santos.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It's here we meet Brian Heder, who Rockstar desrcibes as a "classic drug runner from the golden age of smuggling". He owns the property where Jason's living, rent-free, in exchange for help with his schemes.
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Brian's vaguely upset that Jason is living easy, when he should be off collecting rent from Brian's other, paying tenants. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Jason's line here, "love you, Jason" is the first time his name has actually been confirmed - previously we just knew the name of his partner, Lucia. Jason's name now gets said a bunch more times in the next 30 seconds, just so you definitely know what it is.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Indeed, Jason is shown to be something of a popular guy around these parts. Jason doesn't seem too bothered.
</p>

<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
As you'd expect, rent collection requires a bit of convincing from some folk. Here, Jason slaps a weed store owner and helps himself to the money from the cash register.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
I can hear the GTA 6 mapping enthusiasts scribbling notes from here. We're headed along the freeway with a left turn to Vice City airport and Ambrosia, a location beyond the city fans have suspected may represent Orlando. Straight ahead lies Vice City's Downtown area. To the right is the city's Southside, and then Peacock Bay. Bumper stickers on the car in front read "MyWays" and "#Unbuckled".
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Yep, Jason is definitely buff.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But he also likes beer! His T-shirt here reads Leonida Marine Center, reflecting his former service. The slogan reads "We support all marine life!", while the design sports a cigar-smoking eagle brandishing a gun with each wing. You can also buy lottery tickets for a prize draw declaring "a new billionaire every week!" And finally - note the cat on the right. Cats in GTA 6 confirmed. 
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Jason's off somewhere - past cops pushing people around - to the jail we saw Lucia inside during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">Grand Theft Auto 6's first trailer</a>. "I'm here for Lucia Caminos," Jason says. "She's supposed to be getting out." The prison guard recognises Jason, establishing that he has visited Lucia often. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
And here Lucia is, GTA 6's other main character. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It's safe to say Lucia and Jason have some things to catch up on. 
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Is this a flashback, or does Lucia get straight back to work? Masked, we see her threatening two men in suits. Jason is involved too.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"To new beginnings," Jason says, finally cracking open that beer with Lucia. (They're drinking a brand of cerveza named "Dayho".) The pair reminisce at sunset, seemingly remembering an occasion where one of them broke someone's nose. 
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Contrast that talk of new beginnings and bright sunset with two nighttime shots of reality. Back at Brian's, Jason helps load something (presumably drugs) onto a small plane. Meanwhile, Lucia sports a fluorescent jacket picking up litter by the side of the road.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"Trust me, this place is just a start for us," Lucia tells Jason, who looks unsure. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"Ring the bells!" shouts Cal Hampton, a friend of Jason's, in a seedy-looking bar where the pair do shots. Cut to Lucia, now in a gold sequined dress, at a far more upmarket establishment, showing off her outfit to Jason.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"If we're doing this, we do it right," says Jason, as we see our characters holding hands, partners in... crime? A new life? Cut to Jason and Lucia, presumably later that night, dancing in a club. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
In another scene, Jason and what looks to be new character Dre'quan Priest approach a contact. "Yo D, this fool a Fed?" the contact asks. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It's unclear what happens next, but these gentlemen do not look happy. Is this the easy score that goes wrong? Jason and Lucia are shown escaping from a window, as Brian remarks that their name and address are now known. But by who?
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
We're introduced to a cop character, prowling through a building toting a gun. "Us cops, we gotta protect each other," he tells someone in a boiler suit, presumably undercover.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
A succession of quick shots shows, among other things, Jason shoving someone into a car while Lucia fights in a kickboxing match. "You and me Lu, we got this," says Jason. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Cut to a police convoy exploding after someone fires a grenade launcher. It's safe to say they have not got this as much as they expect. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
More quick shots, including someone (Lucia?) wrestling someone else on the open cargo doors of a taxiing plane, a car chase where someone steals an ATM machine that was mentioned in an earlier leak, and various shots of people dancing/showing that Vice City is aptly named. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
In the trailer's final sequence, Jason sits on the couch watching a commercial for Phil's Ammu-Nation, beer bottles and a fake PS5 in view. Lucia's just home from her litter picking job (her vest sports the letters LDC, presumably Leonida Department of Corrections). 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
But there's no time to sleep. Jason's on a jetski! A motorboat shooting at a helicopter! A motorbike! 
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"Hey, if you got friends can you hook me up please?!" shouts Cal - a question hopefully the audience is also now saying of GTA 6, before we're reminded that the game is still over a year away. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And that's it - what did you think?</p>
<p>
Accompanying the trailer, Rockstar has today also released new information further <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-cast-and-locations-revealed-troublesome-rappers-vice-city-and-beyond">detailing GTA 6's large cast of charaters and some of the various regions you'll visit around Vice City and beyond</a>.

			<p>Getting Cyberpunk 2077 to run on Nintendo Switch 2 did not require a gigantic effort, although getting it to play well was among the challenges CD Projekt Red had to face during the port's development.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/cd-projekt-nintendos-audience-is">The Game Business</a>, CD Projekt Red SVP of Business Jan Rosner revealed that the team managed to get the game running on Nintendo Switch 2 fairly quickly and without a gigantic effort. However, bigger challenges were to ensure the game would play well, use some of the Nintendo Switch 2's unique features, and that it suited the handheld format. With the game's disastrous launch on previous generation consoles in mind, CDPR wanted to ensure the game played well on the system, even with some visual compromises that, according to Rosner, don't impact the game's artistic vision. In this regard, the CDPR SVP of Business feels the team achieved their goal of having a big AAA RPG on the go playable from start to finish without making any <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch2-surpass-ps4-graphics/">significant compromises</a>.</p>
<p>The attention CD Projekt Red placed on the Nintendo Switch 2 release of Cyberpunk 2077 and the console's audience is well highlighted by the fact that the retail edition will include the full game on the cartridge and won't require any additional download. The team made this decision based on their experience with The Witcher 3 on the original Switch, which proved how important physical editions are for the Nintendo audience, and, as such, putting the entire game on the cartridge to offer a plug-and-play experience was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console debuts worldwide, with a few exceptions. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2340520/view/535474378243048018" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>will be arriving on PC via Steam Early Access on May 21st, and yes, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">unlike&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a>, that's May 21st this year, not next.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu</em>, you'll be building your dream farmhouse, all while shapeshifting into various yokai forms in order to make exploration and day-to-day life easier. Think&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spirittea" rel="nofollow"><em>Spirittea</em></a>, but where you get to transform into the creatures, and you're not a million miles away.</p>

Together with your sister Kon, you'll build a life among these mythical beings.</p>

<p>Forms you can shapeshift into over the course of&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>include the Crow Tengu, which grants you flight, as well as the water-dwelling Slime and the farmland-tending Boar.</p>

<p>As you'd expect from a life sim like this, you can grow and tend to crops, raise livestock, and build your homestead, kitting it out with custom-crafted furniture to add that all-important personal touch. Of course, you can also cook meals from the ingredients you grow and source from the local area.</p>

<p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>also features a romance system, with "a variety of romanceable partners" available, each of whom has "their own unique personalities and heartwarming stories". The game's "extraordinary" villagers will have a range of quests for you to complete as well.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2340520/Tales_of_Seikyu/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on May 21st.

Again, how reflective that is of the finished game remains to be seen, but Rockstar Games has certainly earned itself the benefit of the doubt in many quarters over the years, especially between <em>GTA V </em>and <em>Red Dead Redemption VI</em>. The footage was running on a PlayStation 5, which is also a boon to those worried the game might only really pop on a PS5 Pro (it’ll also be on Xbox Series X/S but a PC port won’t be ready at launch).</p><p>We’ll see if that widespread enthusiasm remains once the game’s price is announced. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615">With Microsoft</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036">and Nintendo</a></span> both moving to $80 for their most premium games, it’s not inconceivable now that <em>GTA 6 </em>could blow past that and come in at $100 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553">as some analysts have speculated</a></span>, potentially with an even higher price tag for early access or other deluxe edition bonuses.

Here's the official blurb, alongside brand new screenshots.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Grand Theft Auto VI Characters</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">Jason Duval</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Jason wants an easy life, but things just keep getting harder. Jason grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him. Jason knows how he'd like it to turn out but right now, it's hard to tell.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Jason Duval Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Lucia Caminos</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Lucia’s father taught her to fight as soon as she could walk. Life has been coming at her swinging ever since. Fighting for her family landed her in the Leonida Penitentiary. Sheer luck got her out. Lucia’s learned her lesson — only smart moves from here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More than anything, Lucia wants the good life her mom has dreamed of since their days in Liberty City — but instead of half-baked fantasies, Lucia is prepared to take matters into her own hands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh out of prison and ready to change the odds in her favor, Lucia’s committed to her plan — no matter what it takes. A life with Jason could be her way out.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Lucia Caminos Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Cal Hampton</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">What if everything on the internet was true? Jason’s friend and a fellow associate of Brian’s, Cal feels safest hanging at home, snooping on Coast Guard comms with a few beers and some private browser tabs open.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The psychopaths are in charge. Get used to it. Cal is at the low tide of America and happy there. Casual paranoia loves company, but his friend Jason has bigger plans.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Cal Hampton Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Boobie Ike</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's all about heart — the Jack of Hearts. Boobie is a local Vice City legend — and acts like it. One of the few to transform his time in the streets into a legitimate empire spanning real estate, a strip club, and a recording studio — Boobie's all smiles until it's time to talk business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Top quality cuts. Boobie might seem like he's just out for himself, but it's his partnership with the young aspiring music mogul Dre'Quan for Only Raw Records that he's most invested in — now they just need a hit.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Boobie Ike Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Dre'Quan Priest</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Only Raw... Records. Dre'Quan was always more of a hustler than a gangster. Even when he was dealing on the streets to make ends meet, breaking into music was the goal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You're with the label now. Now that he's signed the Real Dimez, Dre'Quan's days of booking acts into Boobie's strip club might be numbered as he sets his sights on the Vice City scene.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Dre'Quan Priest Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Real Dimez</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Viral videos. Viral hooks. Bae-Luxe and Roxy aka Real Dimez have been friends since high school — girls with the savvy to turn their time shaking down local dealers into cold, hard cash via spicy rap tracks and a relentless social media presence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One hit away from fame. An early hit single with local rapper DWNPLY took Real Dimez to new heights. Now, after five years and a whole lot of trouble, they’re signed to Only Raw Records, hoping lightning can strike twice.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Real Dimez Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Raul Bautista</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Experience counts. Confidence, charm, and cunning — Raul’s a seasoned bank robber always on the hunt for talent ready to take the risks that bring the biggest rewards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A professional adapts. Raul's recklessness raises the stakes with every score. Sooner or later, his crew will have to double down or pull their chips from the table.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Raul Bautista Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Brian Heder</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Nothing better than a Mudslide at sunset. Brian's a classic drug runner from the golden age of smuggling in the Keys. Still moving product through his boat yard with his third wife, Lori, Brian's been around long enough to let others do his dirty work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looks like a Leonida beach bum — moves like a great white shark. Brian’s letting Jason live rent-free at one of his properties — so long as he helps with local shakedowns, and stops by for Lori’s sangria once in a while.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Brian Heder Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar also released information and screenshots on the explorable places in the state of Leonida, GTA 6's take on Florida.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Grand Theft Auto VI cities, places, and environments</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">Vice City</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything in Excess. We're a long way from the '80s, but Vice City is still the sun and fun capital of America.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The glamour, hustle, and greed of America captured in a single city. Each neighborhood has something to offer, from the pastel art deco hotels and bright white sands of Ocean Beach, to the bustling panaderías of Little Cuba and the bootleg brands of the Tisha-Wocka flea market, out to the VC Port, the cruise ship capital of the world.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Leonida Keys</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gateway to Paradise. The dress code is casual, the bars are loaded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Life in this tropical archipelago isn’t flashy but it’s easy. Get your buzz on and pull up a deck chair but look out — you are right on the doorstep of some of the most beautiful and dangerous waters in all of America.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Leonida Keys Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Grassrivers</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Welcome to the Wetlands. The untamable jewel of Leonida’s crown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You never know what lies beneath the surface of this primordial expanse. The gators may be the most famous attraction, but there are far deadlier predators and weirder discoveries among the mangroves.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Grassrivers Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Port Gellhorn</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Live Hard. This is Leonida’s forgotten coast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cheap motels, shut-down attractions, and empty strip malls won’t bring the tourists back, but there’s a new economy in this once-popular vacation spot. It’s fueled by malt liquor, painkillers, and truck stop energy drinks. Jump on a dirt bike and hold onto your wallet.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Port Gellhorn Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Ambrosia</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeping Leonida Sweet. The battle for the health and wealth of Leonida begins here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the heart of Leonida, American industry and old school values still reign supreme — whatever the cost. The Allied Crystal sugar refinery provides the jobs, while the local biker gang provides almost everything else.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Ambrosia Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Mount Kalaga</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Wild, Wild Country.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/06/rockstar-just-unveiled-the-second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Grand Theft Auto VI is the gaming industry's most anticipated game, but after <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/02/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-to-may-2026">last Friday's news that it would be delayed into May of next year</a>, it seemed like it would be a while before we saw any new details about the game. Today, Rockstar decided to surprise the internet once more, but with good news this time: a second trailer. You can check it out below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>This trailer spends a bit more time introducing the audience to Jason Duval, the game's male protagonist, by giving us a glimpse into his day to day life. It seems to be as much about showing off the new and improved Vice City, as Jason lifts weights on the beach, cruises down the highway, and avoids police at night. Eventually, he picks up Lucia Caminos, the other protagonist, from prison, and the game wastes no time showing how head over heels they are for each other. It's almost an even split between action shots and intimate romance, further suggesting that GTA VI's story will have a Bonnie and Clyde vibe.</p>

<p>Additionally, developer Rockstar has <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">updated its website</a> to include more information and images, including screenshots, new characters, and more. Here's the new synopsis of the game's plot, revealing more of the story's stakes:</p>

<p>Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is over a year away, giving ravenous fans plenty of time to dissect this new look at the game and mine it for more information. Regardless, we can't wait for May 26 of next year.

            <p>Rockstar has begun lifting the lid on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, releasing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-second-trailer-is-here">new trailer today</a> that gives a deeper look at its pair of protagonists and the setting of Leonida.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">game's website</a> has also been updated to show off its cast of characters and locations - Vice City, and beyond.</p>
<p>Judging by its sexy trailer, it looks like GTA 6 is set to be something of a love story, but there's a strong music industry theme too.</p>

<p>First up, our protagonists are Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos. The hunky Jason is a former army soldier turned drug runner, while Lucia is fresh out of Leonida Penitentiary, having previously lived in Liberty City with her family.</p>
<p>Both characters seem to be seeking a way out of their current lives, leading to the events of GTA 6.</p>

</figure>
<p>Next up is Jason's friend Cal Hampton described as living "at the low tide of America and happy there". He appears to be something of a lovable fool.</p>
<p>Cal is also an associate of Brian Heder, a drug runner "from the golden age of smuggling in the Keys" who owns a boat yard with his third wife, Lori. Brian is allowing Jason to live rent-free at one of his properties, as long as he helps out with some jobs. I imagine it's a slippery slope for Jason, setting up his meeting with Lucia.</p>

<p>Then there are the music industry characters. Boobie Ike is a local legend of Vice City, owning a recording studio, a strip club, and real estate as part of a grand empire. "The club money pay for the studio, and the drug money pay for it all," he says.</p>
<p>Boobie has partnered with aspiring music mogul Dre'Quan Priest for the Only Raw Records label. Dre'Quan is "more of a hustler than a gangster", though the music industry has always been his goal.</p>

<figcaption>Boobie and Dre'Quan | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Only Raw Records has signed a pair of troublesome female rappers, Bae-Luxe and Roxy aka Real Dimez. They are "girls with the savvy to turn their time shaking down local dealers into cold, hard cash via spicy rap tracks and a relentless social media presence".</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The GTA games have always been recognised for their brilliant soundtracks - shout out to Vice City's classic 80s tracks - but I'm particularly excited to see the developers lampoon the current state of the music industry and its reliance on social media. We already saw elements of that in the first trailer.</p>
<p>The last character introduced is Raul Bautista, a "seasoned bank robber always on the hunt for talent". No guesses for which pair of desperate anti-heroes he's about to hire.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Raul Bautista | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Rockstar has also hinted at some of the locations we'll be exploring in GTA 6.</p>
<p>Vice City - a spoof of Miami - is of course at the core of Leonida, representing the "glamour, hustle, and greed of America captured in a single city". It contains the white sands of Ocean Beach, the "bustling panaderías" of Little Cuba, the "bootleg brands" of the Tisha-Wocka flea market, and the VC Port.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>The glamour of Vice City | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Further out are the Leonida Keys, where life "isn't flashy but it's easy" - presumably this is where Jason starts out. Grassrivers are the "untamable jewel of Leonida's crown", known for their gators and other "weirder discoveries".</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>The thrills of Leonida Keys | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Port Gellhorn is full of cheap motels and shut-down attractions, presumably a spin on Florida's notorious theme parks and tourist areas. Ambrosia is the "heart of Leonida" where "American industry and old school values still reign supreme" - it includes a sugar refinery offering jobs and a dominating biker gang.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Nighttime in Port Gellhorn | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The final location is Mount Kalaga National Park, a national landmark on the state's northern border full of hunting and fishing spots, off-road trails, and hillbilly mystics.</p>
<p>How big will GTA 6's map end up? We don't know yet, but judging by these locations it's going to be expansive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">GTA 6 was recently delayed</a> from later this year, and will now be released on 26th May 2026.</p>
<p>This new trailer is the latest look at the game since the previous trailer, released in December 2023. Hopefully it won't be such a long wait for more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-soundtrack-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the blink of an eye, <a href="https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-nathan-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> has gone from a cool-looking RPG folks wishlisted after the 2024 Xbox Games Showcase to the talk of the town, with a <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-live-action-film-story-kitchen-sandfall-interactive-1236291356/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action film adaptation</a> already in the works. Its release <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-says-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-shadow-drop-actually-benefitted-the-game-by-drawing-attention-to-quality-rpgs-that-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coincided with <em>The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion</em> remaster</a>, making it a tough time for another game to hold its ground. We <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-giant-bomb-polygon-layoffs-valnet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke highly of its early goings on the podcast</a>, and I gave it a thumbs up in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/563522/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-ps5-pc-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my review</a>, though I’m still wrapping my head around the full RPG spectacle of its final act biting off a bit more than it could chew for my liking.</p><p>While a not-insignificant portion of the internet is embroiled in debates over whether <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s runaway success stems from its refreshing flavor of turn-based RPG mechanics, conveniently overlooking the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/expedition-33-unique-turn-based-combat-final-fantasy-lost-odyssey-yakuza-dragon-quest-baldurs-gate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stellar lineup of similar RPGs</a> we’ve been spoiled with lately, or gaming’s latest case of recency bias, one thing is indisputable: <a href="https://lnk.to/clair-obscur-expedition-33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its soundtrack slaps</a>. I spoke with composer Lorien Testard about how he went from making tunes once a week on Soundcloud to landing his first game project.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Antoine Billet</span></figcaption></figure><p>This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&nbsp;</p><hr><h2>Getting started</h2><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert:</strong> What was the process like getting approached by director Guillaume Broche to collaborate with Sandfall Interactive on <em>Clair Obscur</em> five years ago?</p><p><strong>Lorien Testard:&nbsp; </strong>Usually, I write one song a week, so it was a really long process for me. After one year [of posting songs], Guillaume found me on a web forum about indie games. He listened to some song off my SoundCloud, and he really liked what he heard, and he loved my music. So he asked me to do the job for <em>Expedition 33</em>.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> What details were you given about the game to help guide your approach to crafting music that complements its narrative and setting?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>I was really free. I created what I wanted and what I liked. But we had the same tastes on the video game — the melancholia and the nostalgia we wanted to put into the soundtrack, a sensitivity of sadness and a lifting up [element too].&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>Is there a particular emotion or atmosphere you strived to convey through the music?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>It depends on which la ville (town) you are in. When you are in the Gestral village or just at the start, it’s not the same atmosphere. It was like seeing each part of the game and thinking, “What will be the best fit?” When you were in the <a href="https://youtu.be/Ms4Mmb9kY4E?si=SWwtUt7EkQtd4Hyn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Gublu”</a>, we had a lot of submarine sounds and some crazy ideas for the water and aquatic stuff. But after, in <a href="https://youtu.be/2tl5ekssCZg?si=NOk3FQY_FAmIUSom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Sciel”</a>, for example, we have more beautiful, poetic, dense, soft music to help describe the environment.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Sandfall Interactive</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> I <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/post/composing-the-music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read</a> that you alternated between your home studio and working with the Curieux <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FIMsKKvBRM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orchestra</a> at the Midilive Studios in Paris while making the game’s soundtrack. Did you use any unique instruments or production techniques that worked best in one setting over the other?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> I was working for five years in my own studio, and then we chose a section of tracks and we did a little orchestra session. It’s not like I did a back-and-forth with the orchestra. It was only three days at the end of the project, so [the soundtrack] was really made at my own place. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>And, yeah, you have a lot of musical techniques. I love to find my sound on the soundtrack. For example, I really like to layer the piano sound of the game. Sometimes, it's like 12 different pianos to do the sound of one track. I really love this concept of taking the part I like in the virtual instrumental piano and layering it with the other part I like to have a distinct sound for a piano track.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Antoine Billet</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Finding sound through inspirations&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>IC: </strong>With <em>Clair Obscur</em> being your first contracted game, how did you manage the stress while stepping into the role of sonic leader for the project? Did you face any creative blocks or challenges, and how did you work through them?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>Honestly, at the start, we're like, we are three [songs] at the start. Then six. Then 10. So I didn't feel any pressure at all, because it was a thread on Discord, and we did the game and the soundtrack together at the start. And then we hired and grew bigger. From the beginning, I was here to write, so I didn't feel like “It's now my job.” It was a dream project to be with your friends and create music from the start.</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>Were there specific moments during the process where inspiration struck you?</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> It's happened often. Every song has a particular story that I really love. So for each song, I can say there’s a story.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>One song that struck me was the “<a href="https://youtu.be/sN91jLQJjcQ?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sirene</a>” theme. It reminded me a lot of the music I’d hear in <em>Nier Automata</em> or <em>Nier Replicant</em>, where it goes into a <a href="https://youtu.be/CqzlvuJs9-4?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ballet kind of playfulness</a>. But it’d also have <a href="https://youtu.be/RRCK_Co8c9c?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moodier</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/1KiFMEj7DtQ?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">darker undertones</a> to it with a boss fight that kicked my ass.</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> With “Sirene,” I wrote it early in the project, and I wrote the guitar part. So all is coming from the guitar. The main idea and concept for “Sirene” was the softness of the whole environment and the bosses. Then I added a low recorder to make the wind and environment like a circle.&nbsp;</p><p>In the level, you have the boss right at the start. You see it, and you have to do the whole level to be in front of her. So across the entire level, we wanted this voice that the player can hear everywhere. So we had the voice of Alice [Duport-Percier], the singer of the game, and the three elements together, and we created the track. Guitar first, then the low recorder, and then the voice everywhere in the level.</p><figure><figcaption>Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier cooking in the recording studio. <span></span><span>Antoine Billet</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> How did your approach to composing evolve over the five years you spent working on the game?</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> I knew pretty early the scope of the universe, the level, and the script, so I made my dream soundtrack. For example, I would take a level and would want to write three environment tracks, two battle themes, and one boss theme. I do that for the whole game and — one by one — I’d write the track for five years until the end.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> <em>Clair Obscur</em> proudly draws inspiration from iconic RPGs like <em>Lost Odyssey</em> and <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, while adding its unique twist to the genre. What gaming soundtracks from childhood shaped your musical taste, and how did those influences come through in the tracks you created for the game?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>I tried not to be influenced by other soundtracks. I was focused on my music for five years. But for sure, I have a lot of soundtracks I love from before. I love the music of Joe Hisaishi from Studio Ghibli. I listened to him often when I was younger. And I love <em>Zelda </em>music. I’m really a fan of <em>Zelda</em>'s sound and universe. So maybe we can feel my past taste in my music now. I also listen to a lot of French songs and French artists, so we can feel it too in the soundtrack.</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>Who were some of those French artists?</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Bashung" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alain Bashung</a>.</p><h2>Picking favorites and getting Ben Starr to sing</h2><p><strong>IC: </strong><em>Clair Obscur</em>’s soundtrack clocks out at a whopping 8 hours plus, with 154 tracks, some of which are remixes/permutations of a previous theme. Is there any specific piece of music from the game that stands out as a personal favorite, or one you're especially proud of?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>It's really hard to tell my favorite soundtrack, but I could give a story of the most challenging. I wrote three songs —“<a href="https://youtu.be/-i_nT9d-mK8?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Une vie à peindre</a>,” “<a href="https://youtu.be/3kMbTzomh94?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Une vie à t'aimer</a>,” and “<a href="https://youtu.be/10m7CzhQrFs?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Une vie à rêver</a>”— three eleven-minute tracks that were important for a confrontation in the game. They’re really important songs, and I spent a lot of time writing them with Victor Borba and Duport-Percier. It was challenging to create, and it took me the most time of the whole project.&nbsp;</p><p>When you discover it in-game, the cutscene and all the transition between the songs happens. It creates so much emotion to feel that. I have seen some reactions of players when they discover that’s in-game. It's insane to see that it works so well, because you have silence, and then you have something that happens, and the track is coming, and it's so powerful. I really love it.</p><p>And “<a href="https://youtu.be/EWEK2-6whZI?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aux Lendemains non Ecrits</a>,” the one before the end. It’s a favorite song of my father. I shared the eight hour soundtrack with my father. He listened to every song and said to me, “I really love the lyrics of this song,” and I think about it too. I’m proud of this lyric. It’s authentic and really simple. But for me, it worked well for where the song is put. In English, it’s “To Unwritten Tomorrows” and the song plays at a special place.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Sandfall Interactive</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Even with my limited understanding of music, I noticed that <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s soundtrack features a leitmotif — a catchy “Dim dim dam dada” melody — in Lumière’s theme, performed by vocalist Duport-Percier. Where did the inspiration for this earworm of a tune come from?</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqizXvvWnmM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lumière</a>” was one of the first tracks I wrote for the project. I wrote it on the guitar first and I really love the leitmotif of the song, because we had an internal playtest of the game, and we had a first draft of Lumière and Gustave walking on the roof of the city, and we put the credits of everyone who worked on the game. When I saw it, I knew it was the perfect atmosphere for “Lumière.” When I found that I really liked it, I decided to [use it] for the whole part of the game.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, we have the melody in “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbPkvqRiGg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gustave</a>” because it’s his city, it's like his own city, and he cares about those who came before and those who come after. So, we find this motif in his team, and we find it often in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>When you come back to Lumière, it's not the same. So the song could not be the same after what happened. But in the camp, we have some variation to remember where they came from and where they must go. You always have the Paintress in front of you, so the melody is really powerful to give this feeling of “My home is at my back and I have to think of it and protect it, but I have to move toward the adventure in front of me.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> Are there other recurring themes or motifs within <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s music that carry deeper, symbolic significance?</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> The main motif of the game is “Alicia.”We find this melodic motif in a lot of songs. I think “Alicia” is the most used theme in battle, and then we have “Lumière.” For example, when you had the music of the Gommage, it plays. It’s the music of Sophie when she turns to dust. And I use it for another place in the game, but it’s become the theme of Sophie.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Lorien Testard, Alice Duport-Percier - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - Alicia (Orchestral)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNu5UvsRNI8?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC: </strong>As is tradition in RPGs, each party member in <em>Clair Obscur</em> has their unique musical theme. How would you describe these character themes, and what approach did you take to give each one its own distinct sonic identity?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>It's so funny to do that. Honestly, I see that like a gift. I've played so many games, so I know when you write a theme for a character, it's for the life of a character. So it's really important that I give all my love to do that. I spent a lot of time looking at the concept art and trying to feel the mood and the whole soul of the characters.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, “Gustave” was written really late in the production. We can think [of it as] one of the first songs, but “Gustave” was written six months ago. It's late because, at first, I thought “Lumière” would be the “Gustave” theme. But one day, I found Gustave's piano melody, and I knew it was his, so we put it in the game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>How about Maelle’s theme?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>Maelle’s theme was special. It's the last theme on the soundtrack, and I put it in last for a good reason. You understand why, but seeing the song take life was special because it's the last song we recorded with the orchestra. We filmed the session with a dancer, and when I saw the dance with the whole song we recorded with a beautiful voice in French and the full orchestra, I knew it was like my farewell to Maelle. It was emotional for me to see it end. I could not have ended up happier with Alice and Victor’s help.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Until Next Life" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9P0Qgi4wAM?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC: </strong>We’ve talked about collaborating with incredible vocalists like <em>Devil May Cry 5</em>’s Borba and mezzo-soprano Axelle Verner, but the score also saw gaming’s babygirl, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ben-starr-wikipedia-gerbil-breeding-final-fantasy-warframe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Starr</a>, join in too. I’ve <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/expedition-33-composer-music-ben-starr-verso-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard </a>Ben’s involvement might have come after a couple of beers, prompting him to lend his vocal talents to Verso and its soundtrack. Would you mind recounting how Starr’s musical debut came to be?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> It was a chaotic good proposition at Christmas. I wrote the song “<a href="https://youtu.be/a9P0Qgi4wAM?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Next Life</a>” a year before meeting Ben Starr. The song is about Verso and what happened in his life. I told Broche it would be cool to have Verso’s voice actor singing it. We forgot about it, and then, one Christmas, I met Starr, and we shared a clip of the orchestration to show what we did. I remember saying, “Yeah, let’s go. I really want to do ‘Until Next Life’ with you. Would you like to try to sing?” He said yes, and the next morning, we recorded together. It was impressive to see him have a good instinct on the song, so we can have it feel really deep with the voices of Verso, and it works well in contrast with Alice, who is singing like an angel.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>IC: </strong>Do you have any advice for aspiring composers looking to create music for video games?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>I will advise them to play like [they’re] a composer. For example, I thought, “What does a composer do?” Every day, a composer writes music. So I wrote music every day for video games. After playing [music] for a long time, you become a composer.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bob-barker-mic-gameshow-sony-ecm-51-match-game"><h3>Bring Back Those Long-Ass Game Show Mics</h3></a><p>The long microphone used Bob Barker on the Price is Right and Gene Rayburn on Match Game haven't been produced in years.

The new trailer is — like the first — pretty heavily focused on setting up the characters and world, without much in the way of gameplay (though the developer does call it “the biggest, most immersive evolution of the series yet”).</p><p>But we do have a few more details about the story. Here’s the description from Rockstar:</p><div><blockquote><p>Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.</p></blockquote></div><p>And here are some closer looks at the setting (you can see more images and videos <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI/downloads">right here</a>):</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->12</strong><span><cite>Image: Rockstar Games</cite></span></p></section><div><p>The sixth <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> game was previously slated <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">to launch in fall 2025</a> on the PS5 and Xbox Series S / X (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607885/gta-vi-is-still-coming-this-fall">publisher Take-Two was pretty confident about hitting that window</a>), but was later <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">pushed to May 2026</a>. It tells a Bonnie and Clyde–style story set in a fictionalized version of Florida called Leonida, which is home to the iconic Vice City. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614743/gta-vi-user-generated-content-roblox-fortnite">Reports have also suggested</a> that user-generated content could play a major role in the release.</p></div><div><p>Of course, <em>GTA</em> fans are used to waiting around.
