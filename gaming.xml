            <p>Various games in the Shiren The Wanderer (and Mystery Dungeon) series have been recommended to me over and over, but I've yet to play any of them. I likely won't play the next, either. Shiren The Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon Of Serpentcoil Island is headed to PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178480/Shiren_the_Wanderer_The_Mystery_Dungeon_of_Serpentcoil_Island/">via Steam</a> soon.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Mystery Dungeon Of Serpentcoil Island is much akin to the previous games in the series. These are traditional roguelikes, in which you head into a randomised dungeon split across many floors and attempt to delve ever deeper using the resources you find along the way. It's also got some neat online features, such as the ability to rescue or be rescued by other players should you collapse on a particular floor, so that you can continue with that character.
</p>
<p>Serpentcoil switches up the setting, introduces somewhat rudimentary 3D graphics, and modernises the UI a little, but should otherwise be deeply familiar to anyone who has played previous games in the series.
</p>
<p>The last Shiren game was The Tower Of Fortune And The Dice Of Fate, which you'd be forgiven for thinking was a relatively recent game, given it launched on PC and Switch in 2020. Alas, no, it first launched on Nintendo DS in Japan in 2010, and in the west for the Vita in 2016. That makes Serpentcoil Island the first new game in the series for 14 years.
</p><p>Serpentcoil Island also launched on Switch back in January of this year, which means you can find out every detail about the game if you're so inclined. It was pretty well received, with Famitsu giving it 38 out of 40.
</p>
<p>Why won't I play it? Because I find my patience for traditional roguelikes has lessened, these days. I might have plunged into my last procedural dungeon. Whatever appetite I do have left, I'm saving for the far more ambitious and wild Caves Of Qud, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-teases-a-10-release-date-with-a-tricksy-riddle-about-beetle-moons">due a polished 1.0 release on December 5th</a>. I do continue to enjoy listening to others wax lyrical about these games though, so if you think I'm wrongheaded and I should give Shiren his due, please pen a passionate ode in the comments.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-reveals-new-stealth-gameplay-details.1042314/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-reveals-new-stealth-gameplay-details/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has provided players with new stealth gameplay details for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The main focus of the new gameplay was Naoe, the agile shinobi. However, some skills are applicable to Yasuke the Samurai, too.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-new-stealth-features">Assassin’s Creed Shadows New Stealth Features</h2>



<h3 id="h-observe-and-eagle-vision">Observe and Eagle Vision</h3>



<p>With the removal of the eagle companion, players in Assassin’s Creed Shadows will have to rely on two different scouting mechanics. The first is Observe, allowing players to identify targets, tag and monitor enemies, and highlight lootable stashes, collectables, and quest objectives. Players can also examine nearby locations through a Synch Point while using the Observe skill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next is Eagle Vision, and this Assassin’s Creed Stealth mechanic identifies enemy positions and lets you tag them behind walls and other objects. Eagle Vision will also isolate any relevant sounds the enemies make and let you find hiding spots. Naoe can use these skills separately and concurrently to survey the area better.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Observe" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HIElO8_Jtec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-hiding-crouching-and-going-prone">Hiding, Crouching and Going Prone</h3>



<p>The next Assassin’s Creed Shadows Stealth Features are movement mechanics, which include hiding in shadows, crouching, and going prone. During the nighttime, players will find different hiding pots covered in shadows—the best way to ambush their enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crouching is an effective movement mechanic for indoors. If players crouch, then the sound they make decreases drastically. Also, their visibility is much lower when compared to standing. Crouching will also reduce the chance of you walking into any noisy objects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next Assassin’s Creed Shadows stealth mechanic is for both Yasuke and Naoe. Players can be prone to reducing their visibility further when on rooftops, on the ground, or even underwater. When using prone as Naoe, players will be able to roll side to side or front to back by pressing the dodge buttons. There are also certain locations that you can crawl under by using prone.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Prone Assassination" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uTuL0Ob2EnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-stealth-tools">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Stealth Tools</h3>



<p>As a stealthy shinobi in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Naoe uses an array of tools to move around as sneakily as possible. Naoe has four primary tools: Smoke Bomb, Shinobi Bells, Kunai and Shuriken. The first two are great for escaping or distracting enemies, while the others are better for damaging or stunning them.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Smoke Bomb" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJ-AWZISiK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-return-of-double-assassinations-nbsp">Return of Double Assassinations&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players can go on the ultimate stealth runs, thanks to the return of Double Assassinations. All you need to do is have Tanto as your primary weapon and unlock the dedicated skill to perform the Double Assassination with the Hidden Blade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also a non-lethal stealth mechanic, which is grabbing. Players can silently assassinate their enemies by grabbing them and pulling them into the shadows or bushes to get rid of them. Moreover, Naoe is the “smallest Assassin to date”, so she will be able to squeeze through tiny wall cracks and hide inside small storage spaces and boxes to surprise her enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Grab Mechanic" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5y4HB6S_Mew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-enemy-reactions">Enemy Reactions</h3>



<p>While developing Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ stealth mechanics, the developers also focused on enemy tactics. Servants are a new non-lethal enemy that will be introduced in this game. They cannot harm you but can raise alarms to reveal your location to other enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enemies will be more suspicious in the game once you have been detected. If you hide after being spotted, they will start looking for you in pairs and be more on guard moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another unique enemy in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a Samurai. They cannot be tackled as you would with a regular enemy, as they are much more skilled. For example, players can’t assassinate them with a smoke bomb, and Samurai are likelier to deny their assassinations. Moreover, Samurais will also slice bushes when searching for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassination Denial is also a new system, where an enemy is denoted with a white colour if they are an instant kill, a yellow colour if you need to deal some damage, and a red colour if the enemy will completely deny your assassination attempt.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-yasuke-s-stealth-features">Yasuke’s Stealth Features</h3>



<p>Last but not least are Yasuke’s stealth mechanics in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Yasuke is a samurai, a character that players should pick for a more aggressive approach. However, players can be stealthy if they use their bow and start picking enemies off from a distance. Yasuke can get behind enemies and deal swift finishing blows with his melee weapons.&nbsp;</p>

Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive has announced it's banning mods from public online sessions, blaming them for a "non-negligible" amount of server instability seen by players - even those who don't have mods installed.
</p>
<p>
"We've seen incredible community engagement since launch, and we've noticed that some players have started to create and share mods for Space Marine 2," Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 game director Dmitriy Grigorenko wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/6681747476222836957?l=english">message to players</a>. "Mods are great, and they will no doubt contribute to this game's longevity."
</p>
<p>
"However, we as developers must also ensure game stability and continuously work towards a smoother experience for all players," Grigorenko continued. "Our data shows that a non-negligible amount of recent server stability issues are related to mods, and that instability impacts even those users who don't have mods installed. We have also received user reports that their save files were corrupted after playing alongside players with mods."

<p>
As a result of the studio's finding, mods will be prohibited from all public online sessions once Space Marine 2's next major update arrives in December. "You will no longer be able to enter a public game if you have mods installed," Grigorenko emphasised. That doesn't mean the end for Space Marine 2 mods, however. Acknowledging them as "a source of fun and creativity", Grigorenko confirmed players can still use mods online in private Operations lobbies, and they'll also be permitted in custom Eternal War lobbies once launched.
</p><p>
"We will also be providing an easy entry point to our backend for games with mods installed," Grigorenkoso added, "so modders won't have to spend time hacking the game executable after each patch." The studio also intends to give modders access to some of its own tools at a later date, "so they can develop mods with greater ease".
</p>
<p>
Space Marine 2's December update also introduces the Dark Angel Chapter Pack, the Tzaangor Enlightened enemy, plus a new PvE map set on Demerium, titled Obelisk. And if that's still not enough Warhammer to fill your December, Games Workshop has also confirmed Amazon's upcoming Secret Level series will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-getting-an-animated-sequel-in-amazons-new-secret-level-series">include an animated Space Marine 2 sequel</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nows-the-best-time-to-listen-to-aftermaths-52-pickup<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Professional DC Comics expert Alex Jaffe and I have been rereading the ambitious comic book <em>52</em> and podcasting about it. We’ve just reached the halfway point, and even if you haven’t read the series before, we think this is a great place to join us.</p><p>1985’s <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em> is a fantastic book on its own merit, but is also a fascinating look at DC Comics’ “events,” which are a way to both boost sales and resolve tricky editorial problems. Through this, writers and artists try to cohere the DC universe from something sprawling and inconsistent into a logical world with more concrete rules. DC has had dozens of such Crisis events, some more successful than others. <em>52</em> is a series that spun off of such an event, but is so, so much better than the circumstances of its creation.</p><p><em>52</em> was an experiment in American comics that worked exactly once. After the event <em>Infinite Crisis</em>, the DC universe jumped ahead in time by one year as a way to explain the new radical status quo for the characters. To help readers learn what happened in that missing year, four of the most popular DC comics writers–Greg Rucka, Mark Waid, Geoff Johns and Grant Morrison–got together to put out a weekly series exploring the events of the DC universe in real time, week by week.</p><p><em>52</em> did not do a particularly good job of telling the editorially mandated story of that missing year, but it did something much better: it was a successful weekly comic book that revitalized several smaller DC Comics characters. For manga readers, that may sound like no big deal, but the American comic books industry does not have the infrastructure to support a weekly, full color comic book. As Jaffe and I have explored this comic in depth, we’ve learned how many times this project almost failed. Most recently, I learned that in one week, the line art got lost while in transit to the Brazilian studio that inked the book, and they had to do a rush job working off photocopies that were overnighted. The fact that this comic book was released on time every week was a miracle. The fact that it’s <em>also extremely good</em> almost defies reality.</p><p>If you haven’t read <em>52</em>, feel free to start at the beginning of the podcast and read along with us. If you just want to start listening, <a href="https://aftermath.site/52-pickup-podcast-dc-comics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest, episode 27, is a great place to start</a>. Jaffe and I summarize each of the simultaneously running plotlines in the book. For Aftermath subscribers, we have a ton of bonus episodes for people who want to know more about the projects that spun off of <em>52</em>, including many aspects of the DC extended universe movies (except the Zach Snyder films, which Jaffe will not watch unless he personally receives three thousand dollars). We’ve also spoken to artists who have worked on <em>52</em>, including Greg Rucka, Mark Waid, and Geoff Johns. I have not given up on interviewing Grant Morrison, and if anyone has their contact information please do reach out.</p><p>Understanding <em>52</em> is the key to unlocking the entirety of DC comics. It is an exercise in its star writers exploring their specific fixations, working with and around an editorial mandate, and following in the tradition of <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em> to use fiction to solve other editorial problems. I doubt we’ll ever see a comic book like it ever again, but you may see adaptations of bits and pieces of this book in popular culture as James Gunn takes control of the DC movie universe. I mean, it already began before his tenure—The Rock’s <em>Black Adam</em> movie is directly inspired by the Black Adam storyline in <em>52</em>. But Gunn in particular has the same fondness for the freaks and losers of the DC universe as the writers of <em>52</em>, like Peacemaker, Vigilante, the Creature Commandos. His comic book inspiration for the upcoming <em>Superman</em> movie comes from a <em>52</em> writer, Grant Morrison. These are the kinds of stories and characters that truly differentiate DC from Marvel, and made a lifelong DC obsessive out of me.</p><p>Jaffe and I have already embarked on reading the second half of the series, where the narrative gets even weirder. I hope you’ll join us.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The global board game publisher's future was uncertain after its spin-off from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Embracer Group</a> and being saddled with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">considerable debt</a>. But thanks to recent events, their new strategy is mostly unchanged from their old one.</p>

<h2>Asmodee Group's Future Acquisition Plans</h2>

<p>According to its Capital Markets Day <a href="https://ir.financialhearings.com/asmodee-cmd-2024" rel="nofollow">presentation</a>, Asmodee Group plans to restart its strategy of buying smaller board game publishers and distributors following their separation from Embracer Group.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/catan-game-board-image.jpg?itok=5LTGCh3k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/catan-game-board-image.jpg?itok=KkimFzmJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This strategy is central to how the company has become one of the largest tabletop companies in the business. The broad group of companies under Asmodee's ownership includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/z-man-games-announces-arkham-horror-lovecraft-letter-eldritch-twist-on-classic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Z-Man Games</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-unlimited-shadows-of-galaxy-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fantasy Flight Games</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-is-coming-to-board-game-arena" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Catan Studios</a>.</p>

<p>In the presentation, Asmodee Group's CEO, Thomas Koegler, states they have a pipeline of more than 20 acquisition opportunites. Those opportunities include social and party game studios across the US and EU, and local distribution players to help strengthen their position in established companies.</p>

<p>According to Koegler, the acquisition targets being monitored are companies Asmodee knows well. Most of them are business partners the company interacts with on a daily basis spread across distribution and publishing. None of these companies were explicitly named.</p>

Those circumstances include being bought by Embracer Group in 2021. This was part of a string of purchases by Embracer, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Space Marine 2</em></a> developer Saber Interactive and The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-lord-of-the-rings-prototypes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></a> IP.</p>

<p>This came to an end when one of Embracer Group's deals fell through and they were saddled with <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2023/06/13/asmodee-owner-embracer-group-to-make-layoffs-to-help-tackle-1-5bn-debt-pile/" rel="nofollow">$1.45 billion</a> in debt. This lead to layoffs, selling studios, spinning off Asmodee Group and saddling them with €900 million in debt.</p>

<p>That debt is less daunting thanks to an investment by Embracer. As part of the proceeds of selling mobile game developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Easybrain</a>, Embracer <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-intends-to-contribute-eur-400m-to-asmodee-and-presents-asmodees-financial-targets-dividend-policy-and-net-financial-debt/" rel="nofollow">is investing</a>&nbsp;€400m into Asmodee Group.&nbsp;€300 million will go towards the debt, the&nbsp;€100 million remainder will go to strengthening their balance sheet ahead of their company listing, allowing them to continue their M&amp;A business strategy.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is making changes to how it handles stealth, versus other games in the long-running series. Gone is the companion eagle who can spot enemies for you, for a start; instead, players can hide in the - hey - shadows, lie on their tummies for the first time, and make use of a "shinobi and assassin arsenal" of smoke bombs and bells.
</p>
<p>There are old moves that are coming back after an absence, too: Shadows will allow for 'double assassinations' again.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ubisoft outlined their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3159330/view/4478361902017151340">approach to stealth in a new blog post</a>, which also includes links out to brief illustrative videos.
</p>
<p>"For the first time in the Assassin's Creed series, hiding in the shadows will make you invisible to enemies. During nighttime, any pocket of shadows becomes a dynamic hiding spot in which you can progress without being seen. This applies to both interiors and exteriors," explains the post. "The ability to use shadows in this way invites you to carefully study your environment for hiding opportunities and routes... or create them yourself by destroying lanterns with a shuriken."
</p>
<p>Likewise, "Naoe and Yasuke are the first protagonists able to go prone in the series." While lying down, you can roll in any direction, crawl under certain buildings, and commit special ankle-based assassination attacks.
</p>
<p>The post mostly focuses on Naoe, one of Shadows' two protagonists, who will carry a smoke bomb, shinobi bells for tossing to distract guards, throwing knives called Kunai, and shuriken which can stun enemies. Yusuke seems to have a similar set of stealth capabilities, but with a different arsenal and some unique wrinkles that will apparently be outlined at a later time.
</p><p>Perhaps most interesting is the return of double assassinations, a one-time iconic feature of the series. "By equipping the Tanto as one of your main weapons and unlocking the dedicated skill, you can eliminate two enemies standing next to each other at once with your Hidden Blade - whether on the ground or from the air," says the post.</p>
<p>The various RPG mechanics of more recent games of the series still remain, however, so it's possible to try to have your attempt denied if you have neglected your "Assassin Hidden Blade upgrades". The assassination prompt will change colour to let you know the outcome in advance: white if it's an instant kill, yellow if you'll deal just some damage, and red if it won't work at all.
</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows was originally supposed to come out this year, but was delayed until February 14th, 2025 seemingly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-due-to-ubisoft-finally-listening-to-developers-pushing-for-a-delay-for-some-time-says-report">at staff's urging</a> and in response to somewhat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">lukewarm sales of Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Outlaws continues to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-latest-patch-is-out-and-aims-to-make-stealth-and-combat-more-satisfying">receive patches to improve its own stealth systems post-release</a>.
</p>
<p>I love a good lie down in a video game, so these changes sound appealing to me. I still hate that enemies can out-level a knife, though. My reward for the risk of getting close to an enemy, particularly a strong one, should be the ability to take them out in a single blow - although I realise that other philosophies of stealth may be valid also.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Anything that ends up delayed could then potentially be eligible for a partial refund. “By offering a Season Pass, you are promising future content,” the new guidelines to development partners read. “In the process of launching a Season Pass you will be asked to commit to a launch timing for each content release in the Season Pass. That launch timing is a commitment to both customers and Steam.”</p><p>  Steam adds that while game development is complex and challenging, with delays sometimes necessary and understandable, companies will only get to reschedule DLC and season pass release timing once. “If you aren’t ready to clearly communicate about the content included in each DLC AND when each DLC will be ready for launch, you shouldn’t offer a Season Pass on Steam,” the company writes. </p><p>In addition, season passes are supposed to include at least one piece of content that’s already accessible at launch unless it’s for a currently unreleased game. Even if there aren’t customer complaints in a given instance, Steam reserves the right to auto-refund players for any potential violations of the new rules. And if any DLC is cancelled outright, players will get the “value of unreleased DLC” refunded into their accounts instead of relying on whatever in-game currency or other make-good the companies promise instead. </p><p>It sounds like the sections on Steam store pages beneath the buy button that list all of the microtransactions included in a game are about to get even more chaotic to look at, but at least it will hopefully incentivize companies to be more conservative about what they promise and charge for. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-naoki-yoshida-final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">What you need to know about the content rollout, how it's handling free-to-play, and more.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday's announcement that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-mobile-announced-tencent">Final Fantasy XIV is coming to mobile</a> thanks to Lightspeed Studios raised plenty of questions among fans, including which content it will feature and how it will incorporate monetization. Now, Final Fantasy XIV Producer and Director Naoki Yoshida has answered at least some of these questions in a new video released exclusively to IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While we were keen on the idea of a mobile version, we had doubts about adapting some core aspects such as monetization and core gameplay to be more accessible to mobile users. Therefore, we provided challenging feedback to the Final Fantasy XIV Mobile dev team," Yoshida explains.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida goes on to reveal that Final Fantasy XIV Mobile will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/11/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-review">indeed start with A Realm Reborn</a> — the original campaign that helped reboot Square Enix's struggling MMORPG back in 2013. The rest of the content will then be "released gradually based on player feedback."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, Final Fantasy XIV and FFXIV Mobile will be developed and operated independently, with FFXIV naturally being ahead in its release schedule," Yoshida says. "However, we see FFXIV Mobile as a sister title and we are thoroughly involved in its supervision. We will continue to provide guidance and feedback as the project moves forward, hoping that both versions will grow hand-in-hand."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is the Final Fantasy XIV will be relatively similar to the PC and console version, though Yoshida does not say whether it will unify accounts or progression. In addition to "faithfully recreating the story for mobile users," it will incorporate elements like the Gold Saucer, Triple Triad, and crafting and gathering. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We see FFXIV Mobile as a sister title and we are thoroughly involved in its supervision</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the battle system, Yoshida doesn't offer many specifics on how it is being adapted to mobile, but does allude to its virtual joystick and how the actions are being tuned for touchscreen play. "In particular, when it comes to the battle system, which involves player parties, we had to adjust each duty and its mechanics to ensure players would have a satisfying experience. Our battle and content designers as well as myself personally played through early builds and provided feedback on how to create a multiplayer experience that would be enjoyable to mobile users."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, the biggest difference between Final Fantasy XIV Mobile and the original release on PC console is that the former version will be fully free-to-play. However, that doesn't mean it will include "gacha" play or other exploitive mechanics. Instead, Yoshida says it will be geared toward encouraging "long-term engagement."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our goal is to ensure that players can enjoy Final Fantasy XIV for a long time while generating a small and sustainable revenue allowing as many people as possible to play the game. So, there's no need to worry too much — just dive in and enjoy the game," Yoshida says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida says that team will aim to gather feedback and begin conducting tests, including monetization in various regions globally. It will launch first in mainland China and gradually expand to a global release. In the meantime, Final Fantasy XIV continues to move head on PC and console, with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review">Dawntrail expansion having come out earlier this year</a>, and it sounds like there's still plenty more to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For us, there's no finish line," Yoshida says. "As long as I'm still around and haven't retired I will continue to give my all to Final Fantasy XIV."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

                <p>Few video game developers have had to deal with the things that GSC Game World had to face while making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/" data-ref-id="5000-82469">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>. The Ukrainian game developer behind this first-person shooter survival-horror title was derailed by Russia's invasion of its country in 2022. But the game was finally released earlier this month with some noticeable issues. Fortunately, a day-one patch has reportedly dealt with some of those problems, while others remain.</p><p>As noted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-tech-review-pc-xbox-series-x-s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer and Digital Foundry</a>, the patch arrived after reviewers had already played through Stalker 2. The good news is that this patch seems to have significantly helped the game's frame-rate performance. But the site notes that "the game still suffers from everything to minor, amusing bugs to more serious issues and heavy CPU utilization." On Xbox Series X, the game is said to occasionally freeze entirely for a few seconds when visiting large towns, before continuing with an erratic rate of frames per second.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHQ3jAeza60" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cHQ3jAeza60" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Overall, the first impression left by Stalker 2 remains positive. GameSpot's Richard Wakeling wrote in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review-in-the-zone/1900-6418320/" data-ref-id="1900-6418320">Stalker 2 review</a> notes that it "boldly sticks to the studio's vision of a seamless open-world survival shooter, which the series has always strived to be. It's rough around the edges and uncompromising in a way that is sometimes off-putting. Yet the series' emergent gameplay remains intact and is further complemented by a fascinating setting and the most accomplished combat in the series so far." However, Wakeling also reiterated many of the technical issues stated above, as well as crashes and other bugs that hampered the experience.</p><p>Xbox released the behind-the-scenes documentary <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/war-game-trailer-chronicles-the-making-of-stalker-2-during-wartime/1100-6526549/" data-ref-id="1100-6526549">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> last month, which chronicles the ordeal that GSC Game World's team went through in order to complete the game during war time. Ultimately, many of the developers had to leave Ukraine to finish the development while others remained behind to fight for their country. That war continues to this day with no resolution in sight.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' stealth has been much debated, though not hotly. Some people think it's rubbish, some others think it's basically fine. Ubisoft themselves seem to think it's one of the key issues with the game, with the creative director previously saying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-admits-forced-stealth-sections-are-incredibly-punishing-says-next-patch-will-ease-up-on-them">the forced stealth sections are "incredibly punishing"</a>.
</p>
<p>Now there's a new patch, apparently Outlaws' biggest yet, and stealth and combat are firmly in the crosshairs. The AI and player detection has changed; you can now choose combat in areas where it was previously not allowed; and enemies have had weak points added, for those who wish to cause massive damage.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Title update 1.4.0 has several notable changes, but the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1sXCR6GmB3Kn7OrKiy8DPO/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-140">patch notes</a> neatly call them out, so I'm going to quote them here:
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Notable updates to stealth and combat that allow players greater choice, including using stealth or reaching for their blaster, even in syndicate territories in cities.</li>
<li>Enemy AI and detection improvements, with players being notified when they're being detected and can choose to escalate or change tactics to remain in stealth.</li>
<li>Enemy weak points have been added to reward strategic gameplay, which if targeted can trigger explosions or cause enemies to die in spectacular new ways.</li>
<li>Re-tuned Kay's blaster and pickup weapons to improve the combat experience, including being able to carry two handed weapons in more situations.</li>
<li>Facial expressions and animations in dialogue scenes have been improved, the option to toggle off the cinematic lens during gameplay has been added, and the visibility of distant lights has been improved.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The full list of changes has plenty of interest in it. As well as enemy noggins now taking more damage when shot, weapons themselves have been adjusted, with new damage values across the board and revisions to spread and recoil. As if to balance these changes, enemies will now use cover more capably.
</p><p>"It’s hard to get lost in the scoundrel fantasy of stealth that lets you knock out an imperial officer in the middle of conversation with a subordinate to no suspicion; that lets you drop loudly from a walkway a few feet away from an oblivious stormtrooper, only to take him down with one of several ponderous, bubble-wrapped canned animations," wrote Nic in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws review</a>. "But there’s still fun in the <em>performance</em> of outsmarting science fiction’s most famously maladroit mooks, even if all you’re doing is keeping crouching pace with the reverse side of a floating baggage carrier."
</p>
<p>I've yet to play Outlaws, but I'd like it to be good, and I typically enjoy crouching around Ubisoft games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>. Whatever you thought of it at release, it's nice that they're continuing to bring it up to scratch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If a DLC drop gets delayed, Steam will let developers reschedule it up to 3 months later. And if developers have to cancel a DLC, buyers must get a refund for the item value.</p><p>Steam is also redefining what a season pass is:</p><div><blockquote><p>Because a Season Pass is effectively a DLC pre-purchase, creating a Season Pass on Steam has many of the considerations and restrictions as outlined in the documentation on&nbsp;<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/prepurchase">pre-purchases</a>. For these reasons, we will not offer a Season Pass except in a few rare cases with partners with which we have a well-established relationship and that have a proven track record on Steam.</p></blockquote></div><p>Steam also provided a strong disclaimer for developers:</p><div><blockquote><p>If you aren’t ready to clearly communicate about the content included in each DLC AND when each DLC will be ready for launch, you shouldn’t offer a Season Pass on Steam.</p></blockquote></div><p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/pc-gaming/steam-is-forcing-games-to-be-more-clear-about-whats-in-their-season-passes-and-only-allowing-devs-with-a-proven-track-record-to-sell-them/">As noted by <em>Games Radar</em></a>, the new rules might be more challenging for indie developers who don’t have a lot of games under their belts to pass Steam’s requirements. They also may not have enough resources to build up a guaranteed DLC list — but in that case perhaps they aren’t big enough to offer a season pass anyway.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301975/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-plan"><h2>Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have spelled out their plans for DOGE</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300569/jaguar-rebrand-new-logo-ev"><h2>Jaguar is now JaGUar</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301740/hyundai-ioniq-9-three-row-electric-suv-laas"><h2>The Hyundai Ioniq 9 is a three-row electric SUV with room to grow</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301489/amazon-echo-show-21-smart-display-price-specs-release-date"><h2>Amazon’s new&nbsp;Echo&nbsp;Show 21 has a huge screen and built-in&nbsp;smart home&nbsp;hub</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300617/doj-google-search-antitrust-chrome-breakup"><h2>DOJ says Google must sell Chrome to crack open its search monopoly</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/it-can-cost-up-to-500000-for-a-spot-on-opening-night-live-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The cost to show your game at Opening Night Live is set to get even more expensive for studios. According to a new report from German outlet <a href="https://www.gameswirtschaft.de/gamescom/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-werbespots-preise-211124/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesWirtschaft</a>, Geoff Keighley’s annual event at Gamescom is charging up to nearly $500,000 for an spot on Opening Night Live 2025.</p>



<p>The report claims that prices start at $146,800 (€140,000) for a 30-second ad and rises to roughly $487,506 (€465,000) for a 180-second (three-minute) ad, based on currency conversion rates as of writing. The three-minute ad is one of two new tiers offered for 2025 along with a 150-second ad for roughly $419,360 (€400,000). In total, there are six different tiers to choose from, all more expensive than the reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/it-costs-up-to-288000-to-show-your-game-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost for the same amount of time</a> in 2024. Across the board, the increases range from 17.4% up to 21.9%.</p>



<p>Opening Night Live 2025 is scheduled to air August 19, 2025, the day before Gamescom 2025 officially begins.</p>







<ul>
<li><strong>30 seconds</strong>: $146,776 or €140,000 ($125,000 or €115,000 in 2024)</li>



<li><strong>60 seconds:&nbsp;</strong>$214,922 or €205,000 ($179,600 or €165,000 in 2024)</li>



<li><strong>90 seconds:</strong>&nbsp;$283,068 or €270,000 ($234,000 or €215,000 in 2024)</li>



<li><strong>120 seconds:&nbsp;</strong>$351,214 or €335,000 ($288,000 or €265,000 in 2024)</li>



<li><strong>150 seconds:</strong>&nbsp;$419,360 or €400,000 </li>



<li><strong>180 seconds:</strong>&nbsp;$487,506 or €465,000 </li>
</ul>



<p>It’s worth noting that neither Keighley himself nor the Gamescom promoters have confirmed these prices. Insider Gaming has attempted to reach out for comment, though no response has been received as of publishing.</p>

                <p>When Conan O'Brien was still hosting a talk show on TBS, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/conan-obrien-is-bringing-back-clueless-gamer/1100-6509127/" data-ref-id="1100-6509127">Clueless Gamer</a> was a regular feature. While O'Brien hasn't made many episodes since the end of Conan, Clueless Gamer returned this week with a new installment that tackles the director's cut of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-the-limits-of-the-dead/1900-6417746/" data-ref-id="1900-6417746">Death Stranding</a>, a game that actually features O'Brien in a cameo role.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcw16EQObXM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xcw16EQObXM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Aaron Bleyaert reunited with O'Brien for the segment, and he proceeded to explain the lore of Hideo Kojima's game at length. When O'Brien wasn't looking at the camera and silently pleading for mercy, he was pretending to be falling asleep.</p><p>O'Brien eventually got his hands on the controller and stepped into the role of Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus), before promptly made a mockery of Sam's attempt to dispose of his mother's body. The scene in the game wasn't meant to be comical, but O'Brien kept finding ways to bring out the slapstick by slipping and falling before he handed over the controller to Bleyaert.</p><p>As related by O'Brien, he traveled to Japan and allowed himself to be scanned for his cameo role in the game. Kojima even briefly reappears in this video to tell O'Brien where he can find his character, who can provide players with a Sea Otter Suit for swimming. But after finding himself, O'Brien said, "Oh my God, I hate him and he's me."</p><p>To close out the segment, O'Brien jokingly pitched Kojima with the idea of making him a more heroic character in a new game, and the director invited him to return to Japan to be scanned by even more advanced technology than he was before.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-is-now-on-xbox-series-x-s-five-years-after-it-first-launched-on-ps4/1100-6527622/" data-ref-id="1100-6527622">Death Stranding Directors' Cut made its debut on Xbox Series X|S</a> after previously being a console exclusive for PS5 and PS4. The sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-officially-announced/1100-6509825/" data-ref-id="1100-6509825">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, was recently showcased with a look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2s-latest-footage-debuts-new-characters-and-a-talking-doll/1100-6526788/" data-ref-id="1100-6526788">the new and returning characters in the game</a>, including a talking and singing doll. Death Stranding 2 will be released in 2025.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> COD Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6 - Season 01 Battle Pass Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The update refreshes Black Ops 6's multiplayer to bring back the popular 10v10 moshpit playlists for both core and Hardcore. Hideout, Extraction, and Protocol are now added to the map pool for 10v10 as well.</p><p dir="ltr">On the Zombies side of the update, the patch notes reveal the developer has fixed an issue that previously caused players to be slowed when reloading while sprinting. It also addresses an issue that could cause the "Box Addict" Dark Ops challenge to not track properly.</p><p dir="ltr">Rebirth Island returns to Warzone, again. The map previously arrived the week after Season 1's launch, but was removed just hours after launch due to "map-specific issues." The patch notes confirm that the map is now available with lighting and audio adjustments that have been made to improve gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer thanked players for their patience, and discussed the map's disappearance by saying, "We wanted to take the necessary time to address key issues and make improvements to ensure the best possible experience."</p><p dir="ltr">The update also includes XP balancing across various Warzone modes. This includes increased player XP in standard battle royale and Plunder mode, while increased weapon XP is adjusted for Plunder and Resurgence modes.</p><p dir="ltr">Another major change is a buff to the popular Stim Shot tactical equipment. The patch notes reveal the Stim Shot's speed boost duration has been increased from one to three seconds.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for both <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-01-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><p dir="ltr">Most recently, an update went live to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-patch-notes-reveal-return-of-legacy-xp-tokens/1100-6527868/">add the Legacy XP tokens back into Black Ops 6</a>. It was also revealed by Activision that players who buy Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/buying-black-ops-6-or-playing-with-game-pass-comes-with-a-nice-bonus-for-warzone/1100-6527891/">receive a 30% XP boost in Warzone</a>.</p><h3>GLOBAL</h3><h4>New Event: The Hit List</h4><p>Who’s next? Keep up your luxurious – but slightly corrupt – lifestyle during the Hit List Event. You’re offered up a take-no-prisoners mission: kill or be killed. The Hit List Limited Event gives players a board of contracts with one goal – take them all out. Cross off the entire list and earn some exclusive loot for hire.</p><h3>MULTIPLAYER</h3><h4>Playlist Updates</h4><ul><li>Added 10v10 Moshpit to Quickplay</li><li>Added Hardcore 10v10 Moshpit to Hardcore Quickplay  <ul><li>Added Hideout, Extraction, and Protocol to 10v10 map pool</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Challenges</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue on the Krig C and Saug where Camo progression for Dark Spine was not tracking properly.</li></ul><h3>RANKED PLAY</h3><h4>Restrictions Update</h4><ul><li>The RC-XD has been restricted in all modes.</li></ul><h4>Gameplay</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue where some matches would unintentionally end in a draw.</li></ul><h4>UI</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue where SR would sometimes display incorrectly after a match.</li><li>Addressed an issue where players would sometimes be stuck with no UI after a match ended when they are max level.</li></ul><h3>ZOMBIES</h3><h4>Movement</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue where players would be slowed when reloading while sprinting.</li></ul><h4>Challenges</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue that could prevent the “Box Addict” Dark Ops Challenge to not track properly.</li></ul><h4>Stability</h4><ul><li>Added various stability fixes.</li></ul><h2>WARZONE PLAYLIST</h2><ul><li>Rebirth Island will be re-enabled in the Warzone playlist later this morning.</li></ul><p>Thank you for your patience these last few days as we've worked to bring Rebirth Island back to the Warzone playlist! We wanted to take the necessary time to address key issues and make improvements to ensure the best possible experience.</p><h2>MAPS</h2><ul><li><b>Rebirth Island </b><ul><li>A number of lighting and audio adjustments have been made to improve gameplay.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>GENERAL</h2><ul><li><b>Armory </b><ul><li>The Warzone Armory will be re-enabled later today.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>XP Balancing </b><ul><li>Increased player XP in Battle Royale and Plunder</li><li>Increased Weapon XP in Plunder and Resurgence</li></ul></li></ul><p>We’ve made several adjustments to Player and Weapon XP in order to bring earn rates across different modes closer together.</p><ul><li><b>Stim Shot </b><ul><li>The speed boost duration has been increased from 1 second to 3.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Upon the launch of Warzone, we identified a critical issue and, in response, temporarily reduced both the speed increase and the duration of Stim Shots while we worked on a solution. Our goal is to offer a meaningful speed boost with a clear upper limit, to ensure balanced and consistent combat encounters. As it stands, both Resolute and Stim Shot provide a 15% speed boost each, with their combined effect capping at 20%. This allows players to experiment with various combinations to reach the maximum impact.</p><ul><li><b>Deployable Box Interaction Speed </b><ul><li>We’ve removed an unintentional delay that previously prevented players from interacting with the Armor/Munitions/Utility Box when initially deployed.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>BUG FIXES</h2><ul><li>Fixed an issue on Area 99 that would cause players to hear Killstreaks from across the map.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed an issue that would cause players to drop a weapon involuntarily while attempting to pick up a different weapon from the ground.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed an issue that would prompt players to remove an Aftermarket Part from their weapon despite one not being currently equipped.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed an issue that caused the STB 556 Assault Rifle body to disappear when equipping an underbarrel attachment.</li></ul>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> continues to receive support from developer BioWare with several bug fixes and quality-of-life changes. The third patch, released on November 21 for PC and consoles, improves photo mode, input mappings, and some visual elements.</p><p>For the photographers out there, there are now filters available in photo mode. Plus, screenshot file names have been simplified and show the date the photo was taken, and the file path where screenshots are saved is now shown in game, which is especially useful for PC users.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoDI-4E7efU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WoDI-4E7efU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As for other quality-of-life changes, arrow keys can now be bound to input mappings. Elsewhere, the patch makes it so you can compare new rings against both equipped ring slots, and there's a clearer view to identify where an enchantment has been applied to a companion's equipment. Moreover, the Glint option description in settings has been adjusted, there are new icons for some weapons, and you'll now get a notification when the Crossroads' Spirit Merchant is available.</p><p>The list of bug fixes is quite extensive, and tackles a variety of issues. A few of note are instances where music would incorrectly stop playing, the HDR calibration setting now being saved correctly between game sessions, camera stutters, and a number of crashes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-releases-assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-gameplay-overview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As the release date for Assassin's Creed Shadows looms ever closer, Ubisoft has begun to drop details about the upcoming title, with <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/es-mx/game/assassins-creed/news/1lmnk4XTnnqRh1foViGYPR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new post</a> detailing the Stealth gameplay that players can expect from diving into this title. Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to release on February 14, 2025, after Ubisoft announced that they will be delaying the game from its <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/">original release date of November 15, 2024</a>. However, in September, Ubisoft announced that although the game's features are padded out how they wanted, they are going to delay the release to polish the game further <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">after Star Wars Outlaws suffered from a poor release</a> in August.</p>
<p>The stealth gameplay overview focuses primarily on Naoe, one of the two protagonists available in the game. One of the main features in the stealth gameplay is the Observe mechanic, which both Naoe and Yasuke have access to. This allows you to identify targets as well as tagging and monitoring enemies. This feature was available in previous games but wasn't as detailed. "The new Observer mechanic is at the core of the Assassin's Creed Shadows experience. When in doubt, take a pause, observe the world around you, and only then should you decide what your next move should be," says Simon Lemay-Comtois, Associate Game Director.</p>
<p>The blog post showcases many different features of how stealth works in Assassin's Creed Shadows, with small clips that showcase each element.</p>
<p>Naoe doesn't just have to rely on movement and being stealthy to get out of situations, as she has four tools that she can use to help her get away from a sticky situation or to secure a kill on a target. This includes Smoke Bombs, Shinobi Bells, Kunai, and Shuriken. All of them relate to the stealth mechanic in some way. For example, Shinobi Bells create noise, and you can throw them somewhere to alert enemies to the bell rather than to your presence. Kunai can be used for one-shot kills if you are good with your aim. Shuriken can stun enemies and cause distractions if thrown into an environment. The Smoke bombs are self explanatory, and the blog post provides a glimpse into the action of how Naoe can use these tools to better the situation.</p>
<p>"Naoe is our smallest Assassin to date. And she uses that to her advantage: she can squeeze through tiny wall cracks, and she can hide inside small storage spaces and boxes in order to get the drop on her enemies," says Lemay-Comtois.</p>
<p>When it comes to stealth, this is primarily an option that is given to Naoe, although Yasuke does have a couple of options if you want to avoid direct combat. Overall, it seems that the stealth system in Assassin's Creed Shadows has been well thought out, with tools to use at your disposal as well as a progression system that can allow you to tunnel vision skills for your stealth or abilities.</p>

First up is the game’s <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-ca%2Fgame%2Fstar-wars%2Foutlaws%2Fnews-updates%2F1Q4y5lMJwdUUt6qXzbWKPI%2Fstar-wars-outlaws-game-update-showcase-wrapup">first batch of downloadable content</a>, which adds a new storyline involving Lando Calrissian and what appears to be a very dangerous game of Sabacc. The new expansion is called <em>Wild Card </em>and will be followed by a second DLC update next spring called <em>A Pirate’s Fortune</em>.</p><p>Perhaps more significant, today, <em>Outlaws</em> is also getting a major update to address some of the game’s technical and design issues. Ubisoft describes it as the game’s “biggest patch yet.” Most notable, it seems, is that the stealth sections — a major point of frustration for many players — have been toned down.</p><p>Ubisoft says that the update includes “updates to stealth and combat that allow players greater choice, including using stealth or reaching for their blaster, even in syndicate territories in cities.” Similarly, there are “enemy AI and detection improvements, with players being notified when they’re being detected and can choose to escalate or change tactics to remain in stealth.”</p><div><p>Here’s how creative director Drew Rechner <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgame%2Fstar-wars%2Foutlaws%2Fnews-updates%2F4U9vshW5I0KpPRJFhQspn2%2Fstar-wars-outlaws-dev-update-3-the-scoundrels-journey">explains the changes</a>:</p></div><div><blockquote><p>Our first step in expanding player choice is removing forced stealth from almost all quest objectives. This doesn’t mean that sneaking is no longer a viable or even preferable option in some cases. Rather, if you’re caught while sneaking, the objective won’t fail and reset you to the last checkpoint. Instead, you’ll seamlessly transition into combat.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p>You can check out the full patch notes <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-ca%2Fgame%2Fstar-wars%2Foutlaws%2Fnews-updates%2F1sXCR6GmB3Kn7OrKiy8DPO%2Fstar-wars-outlaws-title-update-140">right here</a>, and get an overview in the video below.</p><p>Also notable: while <em>Outlaws</em> has been on PC since launch, it was only available through the Epic Games Store and Ubisoft Connect.
