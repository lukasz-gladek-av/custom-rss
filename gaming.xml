            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has had a bumpy start, accruing an 'Overwhelming Dislike' verdict on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Metacritic</a> on its opening weekend, making it the most unpopular Call of Duty game ever by Metacritic user score.</p>
<p>Whilst critic reviews have contributed to an aggregated score of 84 on PC (there aren't yet enough critic scores to give a verdict on console), hundreds of users have given the shooter the dubious honour of being the franchise's most disliked instalment with an aggregate score of just 1.7 at the time of writing. A whopping 85 percent of users have left a negative review.</p>
<p>It's also currently sitting on a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/#app_reviews_hash">'Mixed' user score</a> on Steam, with just 42 percent of player reviews leaving a positive thumbs-up.</p>

<p>Steam only represents one segment of the game's PC audience, of course, and doesn't take account of users playing through the Xbox PC app, let alone those on console. Nonetheless, complaints are varied, ranging from accusations that the "<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/user/armbarvictim1/">franchise has lost its way</a>", "<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/user/DarkStrikeX/">strays far from Call of Duty's identity</a>", and uses "<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/user-reviews/?platform=pc">ai slop</a>", while others call it "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993890407/recommended/3606480/">out of touch</a>", "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199636448645/recommended/3606480/">disappointing</a>", and "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/september_cs/recommended/3606480/">another under-baked title delivered on false promises and blatant lies</a>".</p><p>While not all reviews are bad - there are <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/user-reviews/?platform=pc&amp;filter=Positive%20Reviews">several</a> 10/10s posted to Metacritic - most complain that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-campaign-cannot-be-paused-by-solo-players-has-no-checkpoints-and-requires-an-online-connection-at-all-times">campaign mode cannot be paused</a> or <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/aniketvcool/recommended/3606480/">saved manually</a>, and<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-players-call-out-awful-apparent-use-of-generative-ai-for-in-game-calling-cards"> criticise the publisher for in-game calling cards allegedly created using generative AI,</a> all of which came to light when the game debuted on 14th November.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> wasn't perfect but it felt like COD was back again," <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/user/Stihl24/">explained</a> one player. "Zombies were great, the campaign was okay and the multiplayer felt like it used to. For the first time in 10 years, my [sic] believed that Call of Duty was on the right track again. That is until, they announced Black Ops 7.</p>
<p>"Every. Single. Thing. That the community has been super vocal about hating, they decided to bring to Black Ops 7. Everything that we said we loved about Black Ops 6 and OG Call of Duty, they took away. Now all that's left is a steaming pile of dog crap [where] a once great first person shooter empire lived. I hope this is a wake-up call, and the company decides to revert 100% back to the way that Call of Duty is supposed to be. This is what happens when you continue to put profit over passion."</p>
<p>Though Activision has properly declared AI was used during the development of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/">its Steam page</a>, complaints about AI are particularly evident. As Connor explained for us earlier in the week, calling cards belonging to the 'Jack of All Trades' campaign challenges, as well as two specific calling cards in the 'Embrace the Nightmare' campaign endgame challenges, raised eyebrows as players noted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-players-call-out-awful-apparent-use-of-generative-ai-for-in-game-calling-cards">similarities to the AI Studio Ghibli recreations</a> which have been circulating online for the past few months.</p><p>"If you can accept Black Ops 7's fundamental changes to the formula on their own terms, you'll have a good trip, despite the psychochemicals coursing through your veins," we said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 review</a>, awarding it 3/5 stars. "I'm just not convinced those changes bode well for the health of the series."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-%E2%80%98series-low%E2%80%99-metacritic-user-rating.1355170/</guid>

<p>While it does have an 84 critic score on Metacritic, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is not faring well with its user rating. The reviews, while not all serious, do touch on several notes like the reported usage of AI and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-reddit-reactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a disappointing campaign</a>.</p>







<p>Black Ops 7,&nbsp;which released last week, hasn’t had the best launch. While praise is there to the multiplayer and zombies, the game is in some hot water. First off, fans called out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-accused-of-using-generative-ai-art-for-black-ops-7-calling-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the usage of AI</a> for player calling cards and assets, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision has responded to</a>. Second, the campaign, fully co-op, has gotten a lot of flak for being absurd and far from the supposed series standard. With this, it’s not surprising that the game is not faring well with users on Metacritic, which is a series low.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/user-reviews/?platform=pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a>, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 currently has an 84 critic score with 16 reviews. However, the user rating, which has more than 540 reviews, is not as great. As of writing, its score is 1.6 out of 10. 2023’s Modern Warfare 3, which is one of the lowest-scoring Call of Dutys with a 56 critic score, still has a higher user rating with a 2.3.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that this number is likely to change as some reviews may be spam and as more longtime players get to it. Still, it’s not a great look for the franchise. Unfortunately, it looks like the damage has already been done, as Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hasn’t even reached 100k players</a> on Steam, while competitors like Battlefield and ARC Raiders consistently get over 200k. Whether Activision and the teams will address some of the problems is unknown. Hopefully, the next games will do a better job of satisfying fans and critics.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Partner Showcase Announcement Soon, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-partner-showcase-announcement-claim-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-partner-showcase-announcement-soon-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1355161/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a credible source, an Xbox Partner Showcase announcement is coming soon. A presentation was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-reportedly-has-a-partner-preview-event-scheduled-for-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored a while ago</a> to happen in November, but it seems it may actually be true.</p>







<p>Also known as Xbox Partner Preview, the events are short but substantial presentations on games going to Xbox consoles. However, compared to Game Showcases, they consist of third-party titles from various companies. For example, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-partner-preview-october-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the last one</a>, which premiered in October 2024 had games like Cronos: The New Dawn, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and FBC: Firebreak. Last month, it was reported that Microsoft and Xbox were planning a new showcase, though details were thin. Now, it seems a prominent leaker has added some fuel to the fire.</p>



<h2 id="h-announcement-coming-very-soon-for-xbox-partner-showcase-claims-natethehate2">Announcement Coming ‘Very Soon’ for Xbox Partner Showcase, Claims NateTheHate2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The claim comes from notable leaker <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1989885666679718304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NateTheHate2</a>, whose track record has been quite good. From multiple <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-direct-will-take-place-in-september-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Directs</a> to full games, the leaker does have a solid track record. Nevertheless, in response to a question regarding a future Partner Showcase, NateTheHate2 said that an announcement is coming ‘very soon’. As for when exactly that may be, we still don’t know. </p>



<p>The most likely date is early this week, as one of the games supposedly there, Silent Hill 2 Remake, is releasing this week, and no official announcement of the game’s port has been revealed yet. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-store-leaks-silent-hill-2-xbox-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An Xbox Store listing</a> for the PS5 title popped up earlier this month with a release date of November 21st, 2025. If true, we could get an announcement tomorrow with a Wednesday date or Tuesday with a Thursday date. Either way, it seems all signs are pointing to a Partner Showcase sooner rather than later.</p>

            <p>The producer of the next highly-anticipated instalment of Resident Evil, Resident Evil Requiem, has teased that the upcoming horror retains "some" elements of its prior life as an online multiplayer open-world game, but wouldn't tell us what, exactly, they are.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://press-start.com.au/features/2025/11/15/resident-evil-requiem-interview-putting-the-horror-in-survival-horror/">Press Start Australia</a>, producer Masato Kumazawa said that Requiem - initially conceived as an open-world, multiplayer game - was reinvented when the team decided fans of the franchise "wouldn't enjoy it" given the horror aspects were "very mild".</p>

<p>Questioned about this, however, Kumazawa would only say "there are some remaining elements, but we can't disclose what it is and how it is," and laughed when pressed harder for more details.</p>
<p>"Looking at the game when it was multiplayer, the horror part was very mild," he said. "However, in that build, we made a game that was fun to play. But we looked deeply into this game and wondered if a fan of the franchise would really like this, so we thought they [...] probably wouldn't enjoy it as much.</p>
<p>"That's the reason we made it back into single-player. But because it was fun, we added elements from that build to the final game to ensure it was fun."</p>
<p>Asked what, in his opinion, Resident Evil fans wanted from a new title, the producer added: "I believe fans of the franchise want [...] survival horror and being scared. That is the number one thing that fans want. So by saying that, we can't just slap on new skins and new characters and give you the same experience. It wouldn't be that good.</p>
<p>"That's why we wanted to make sure we added new elements that ensured this feels like a new survival horror game."</p>
<p>Interestingly, Kumazawa also revealed that Requiem was "in development way before Village", which is why the team is keen to ensure the game "focus[es] on the horror" and avoids becoming too combat-heavy.</p>
<p>Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-requiems-director-explains-how-in-one-crucial-way-it-is-the-most-extreme-title-in-the-series-yet">sat down with game director Koshi Nakanishi at Gamescom to talk about pacing</a>, where he explained that he would be taking the "same" approach" with Requiem as Resident Evil 7, which Nakanishi also directed.</p>
<p>Capcom also recently said it was looking to the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-wants-resident-evil-requiem-boss-battles-to-test-your-wits-rather-than-your-shooting-skill">for ideas about how to challenge players with boss battles in Requiem</a>.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is set to release on 27th February, 2026.</p>

<figure><a title="Blippo+ Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160176/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to really understand (or remember) what TV looked like before the internet, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo+</a> is just the ticket.</p>
<p>This unique little time capsule launched on Panic's Playdate in May and landed on Switch and PC in September. Now in full colour, this remarkable collaboration between the band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht_(band)">Yacht</a>, <a href="https://telefantasystudios.com/">Telefantasy Studios</a>, developer Noble Robot, and Panic itself teleports you back to a time when television was an appointment pastime and we viewed the world in fuzzy 4:3.</p>
<p>First off, Blippo+ is not a game, so if 'play' is the only verb that excites you, go ahead and hit that Back button or close the browser tab right now. 'Watch' is the, ahem, watchword here, and apt for a TV network sim and FMV experience like no other.</p>
<p>Serving up clips from a collection of fictional shows encompassing public, cable, and even pirate broadcasts on a distant Earth-like planet, it captures an alternate '90s buzzing with the static produced when older entertainment ideas and formats rub against an emerging youth movement looking to expand the horizons of art and tech with TV as their tool.</p>
<p>By the looks of its culture captured on screen, Planet Blip is all big colours and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/space_channel_5">Space Channel 5</a>-style energy, and instantly recognisable to any Earthlings born in the decades straddling 1985. Picture Bob Ross settling in at the Double R Diner while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etviGf1uWlg">Groove Is In The Heart</a> plays on repeat, and you're not far off the vibe.</p>
<p>You can cycle between channels at will, each one playing a series of minute-long clips that eventually loop around until a new 'packette' becomes available and you tune in a new batch. Along with packette notifications, messages from Blippo+ exec Lisa Duo periodically arrive, and interference from a nearby space anomaly means you'll occasionally have to manually recalibrate the signal. I played mainly with a Pro Controller, but you can snap off a single Joy-Con if you prefer remote-like control. You also have options to reduce background menu animation, and increase, reduce, or remove static effects entirely.</p>

<p>It would be easy to fill my word count here just listing references. Despite being 100% fictional, the array of programmes nails the feeling of switching on the telly and channel-hopping three-and-a-half decades ago. Werf’s Tavern blends the hokey energy of <strong>Star Trek</strong>, <strong>Dr Who</strong>, and '70s sci-fi with a dash of <strong>Cheers</strong>; Countertop's chatty 50s-styled waitress is equal parts Norma Jennings and Marge Simpson; trivia show Quizzards works in aspects of <strong>Crystal Maze</strong> and <strong>D&amp;D</strong>; the Boredome studio is filled with 'tude-laden teens lounging around, discussing topical youth issues, and generally shooting the blip.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, you've got talk shows, cooking clips, kids' claymation, antiques analysis, soaps, news reports, psychic weather forecasts, and a Teletext-style Femtofax app with Personal ads, review columns, and assorted hot takes and message-board wisdom. There's loads more besides, and the verisimilitude of the audio-visual experience is astonishing.</p>
<p>Among all the flotsam and jetsam in this channel surf, it's hard to think of anything missing from the Electronic Program Guide. Something with a puppet, perhaps? There's no live sports coverage. Were a clip evoking the Italia ’90 qualifiers, the Malaysian Grand Prix, or something more sedate — darts or snooker — to pop up, you’d swear you were sitting on a worryingly flammable family sofa back in 1990. But short of dropping in clips from <strong>The Simpsons</strong>, they've just about covered it all.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/accessibility-report/5859/embed @ 1763308123 -->
<p>Stylistic conventions from earlier eras bleed into the following decade(s), and that's the case with several shows; the brilliantly choreographed music videos, in particular, feel like authentic holdovers from early '80s <strong>Top of the Pops</strong>, with soft focus and light bloom aplenty. After seeing so many disappointing CRT filters in retro-themed games over the years, the accuracy of the signal warping, static, and distortion of an analogue broadcast here is enormously impressive.</p>
<p>That attention to detail extends to every part of the production: the calibration UI that pops up when your signal’s wonked; the early greenscreen compositing with prominent ghosting; the <em>spot-on</em> music, voice, and sound effect work; the collage-like, mismatching logo design; the editing and the way the minute-long clips automatically switch channels mid-sentence. Hitting 'Y' toggles to a 1-bit-style screen, presumably approximating how the image looks on a Playdate, and ‘X’ activates authentic-looking captions which I kept on most of the time. Every single detail is lovingly crafted and (re)created.</p>

<p>And threading all these disparate elements together is a gently comic narrative involving the discovery of a distant Blip-like planet on the other side of the galaxy. As you watch, topics and even cast members from one show begin appearing on others, with inter-show references woven in, sparking curiosity as you look out for new details and reactions to 'The Bend'.</p>
<p>Building a game around an activity born of boredom comes with risks of being <em>too</em> authentic, but the devs strike a nice balance between seeding narrative details and subtle worldbuilding while maintaining that odd, non-sequitous energy of channel-hopping.</p>
<p>My Switch says I've spent '9 hours or more' with Blippo+ before credits rolled, and only in short bursts towards the end was my attention beginning to drift. I probably didn't need to watch <em>every</em> cycle of <em>every</em> channel — including the ones with poor signals or others scrambled due to their 'adult' nature — but I didn't want to miss anything, such was the pull of those narrative threads.</p>
<figure><a title="Blippo+ Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160172/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Great performances from the sizeable cast keep you engaged, too. Representing all facets of '90s broadcasting involves being not just good, but <em>bad</em> if you want to accurately portray the awkwardness of a soap star's delivery, the unnatural line reading of an inexperienced teen, the overacting of a stage actor on the small screen. But it's all here - studied performances shot through with a dose of off-the-wall, intergalactic energy.</p>
<p>If it's not obvious by now, I love Blippo+, likely because it feels tailor-made for somebody born in 1984. For anyone who <em>hasn't</em> manually retuned a television — people who didn’t grow up before the World Wide Web arrived and everyone fragmented into online groups, who have always viewed the world in 16:9 and don’t know what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceefax">Ceefax</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboozle!">Bamboozle</a> are — I wonder if they’ll have the context to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Your agency is equal to watching TV with a remote in hand (slightly less, given the loopìng nature of the clips) as you exhaust each channel set and Femtofax update until it’s time to download the next packette. I found myself glued to the clips, only poking the analogue stick to shift once the loop was over, but would younger players without my reference points have the patience to stick with it?</p>
<figure><a title="Blippo+ Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160507/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Cleverly executed 'filler' channels here mirror the content supply problem broadcasters encountered back in the day as the number of channels exploded. The loving, lower-budget parodies here help turn a minus into a big (Blippo) plus and add to the impeccable presentation, but naturally, some people just won't 'get it'. It's not my place to worry about that, but it's important to flag in a review, I think. Perhaps necessarily, this entire project feels like an amazing joke that, by virtue of my age alone, I'm lucky to be in on.</p>
<p>I made a real effort to meet Blippo+ on its own terms, too. I treated it like television, switching it on in the morning for 20, 30 minutes while I ate breakfast with my mug of murk. You absolutely need to sit back and enjoy it in short bursts, coming back to the shows, developing a taste for your favourites, and yes, even skipping the ones you're not so keen on.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>For people who grew up watching <strong>Gamesmaster</strong>, early MTV, <strong>Hartbeat</strong>, ‘80s soaps, Bill Nye or Open University programming, and scanning the high channels past midnight for a glimpse of something softcore, Blippo+ is an absolute <del>must-play</del> must-watch. It really is a work of art, nailing the aesthetic of early-'90s TV and uncannily capturing a time and place in the way a song or a smell evokes a memory - in a way that feels almost personal.</p>
<p>You need to treat it like old-school TV, though, surfing a little bit each day and soaking up the static; do <em>not</em> approach it as a game. And as fun as it is — as wonderfully assembled, expertly performed, and lovingly crafted — nostalgia for (or at least intellectual interest in) the era feels like a prerequisite. I’m an ‘80s kid, though, so I adored every second.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-asus-falcata-is-an-ambitious-split-ergo-gaming-keyboard-that-falls-short.1355086/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hall effect gaming keyboards aren’t uncommon. But Asus’ ROG Falcata is the only one that’s also a split ergonomic keyboard, aimed at alleviating wrist, hand, or arm pain. For the luxury of having it all, you’ll pay $419.99, enough to buy a nice Hall effect keyboard <em>and</em> a split ergonomic one.</p><p>It’d be worth it if the Falcata truly represented the best of both worlds, but I’m split. As a Hall effect board, it succeeds, offering a wealth of customization options, including the ability to let you adjust each key’s actuation point by as little as a hundredth of a millimeter at a time. But if you’re buying it for ergonomics, like me, then maybe not. My biggest concern during testing was its limited tenting angles. $420 seems very steep for a keyboard that doesn’t... get very steep.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODIxMzU4"><p><span>$<!-- -->420</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Compact</li><li>Hall effect switches offer deep customization</li><li>Rapid trigger and Speed Tap in a split ergo</li><li>Browser-based customization</li><li>Ultra-fast polling over wire or 2.4GHz</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Tenting isn’t steep enough</li><li>Included USB-C link cables too short</li></ul></div></div></div><p>Tenting is an integral feature of split ergo keyboards. Being able to raise the inner sides of each of the two sections to your liking allows your arms and wrists to rest in a more neutral position than they would on a regular keyboard. The Falcata can only tent up to seven degrees (or six with the wrist rests installed). Some people may only need the slight tenting that the Falcata offers; I’m used to a 15-degree tent on my <a href="https://gaming.kinesis-ergo.com/product/freestyle-edge/">Kinesis Freestyle Edge RGB</a>, while some prefer even higher.</p><p>You may not know what feels right until you use a tented keyboard, but at this price, Asus should have included more tenting options — and longer USB-C link cables, too. The halves can only be separated by a maximum of 10 inches, which doesn’t let me spread my arms as much as I need to feel relief (the Freestyle’s non-detachable cable can go up to 14 inches). Sure, I can use my own longer cable with the Falcata, but at $420, this is an oversight.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</strong><span><figcaption><em>You can actually achieve one degree higher tenting without the wrist rests installed.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>The Falcata’s insufficient tenting aside, it’s everything that my daily driver isn’t. It has the same 75-percent key layout (minus the Freestyle’s left-hand macro key columns), so there was no learning curve. Yet its design is both far more elegant and more compact on my desk. The halves can fit together like a standard keyboard, which is convenient if you need to travel with it. Also, it’s <em>so </em>quiet to type on (to be fair, most switches are quieter than Cherry MX Blues, my point of reference).</p><p>The Falcata is overflowing with gamer-oriented features. It gives you the option to turn on rapid trigger and Speed Tap (Asus’ branded name for simultaneous opposing cardinal directions, or SOCD), controversial features designed to give players the advantage in competitive games. Additionally, it can operate wired or via Bluetooth or 2.4GHz wireless (in wireless mode, its two halves are still linked together via USB-C), with up to an 8,000Hz polling rate available in all modes except Bluetooth.</p><p>The perks of its Hall effect switches, other than being quiet, is that they’re analog, not limited to the binary on/off states of digital sensors. You can customize the distance at which each key registers an input (and a reset), which for gamers can mean lightning-fast commands with almost no physical movement. They’re a bit trickier to use with typing, at least with default settings. I accidentally typed “fffffffffffffffffffffffff” or “jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj” in many text boxes just because my fingers were putting a little too much weight on the home keys. The Falcata offers multiple ways to adjust their sensitivity, and to customize a <em>whole </em>lot more. One route is to use Gear Link, Asus’ browser-based app. In my case, tweaking the dead zones for each key helped to eliminate misfires. You can even adjust these settings via the keyboard’s multipurpose scroll wheel. It’s meant to be faster, and to some it might be, but it felt more cumbersome than just using the web app.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Gear Link is a browser-based tool that lets you easily configure the keyboard to your liking.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>Each of the Falcata’s keys can serve as a macro, if you want. While I’m more accustomed to the dedicated macro keys on my Kinesis, Gear Link makes it a breeze to assign additional functions to any key. In the app, you can assign simple functions to make life easier, like pushing a key also triggering a left mouse click. Since it’s a Hall effect board, there’s also Dynamic Keystroke, which lets you assign up to four unique commands depending on the key’s travel distance. For instance, you can program W (running forward in games) to just send W with a light press, and also trigger Shift and R with a full press, letting you sprint and reload any time you press it all the way. This level of customization is standard for Hall effect gaming keyboards, but this is the first time it’s available in a split ergonomic keyboard.</p><p>Coming back to rapid trigger and Speed Tap: They’re built to help you do things in games that are otherwise not possible, either due to the limitations of reflex speed or keyboard hardware. Rapid trigger, which is off by default and activated by flipping a switch near its multipurpose dial, allows key actuation to reset immediately upon release, even if you haven’t completed a full keystroke motion, readying the sensor to receive another input faster than the physical switches on your opponent’s keyboard might be able to.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>This satisfying toggle enables rapid trigger, which lets switches reset faster than usual.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Speed Tap (also off by default) lets you continue moving when two opposing cardinal directional keys (e.g., A and D) are pressed. For example, pressing A to move left and then pressing D to move right would normally make your character stop until you release one of them (reflecting reality — you can’t walk in two directions at once), but Speed Tap prioritizes your last input, overriding any other key that might still be pressed down. Valve considers the feature to be tantamount to an automatic assist, and therefore <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224261/valve-counter-strike-2-razer-snap-tap-wooting-socd-ban-kick">doesn’t allow its use in <em>Counter-Strike 2</em></a>. Still, it’s cool to have in games where you won’t risk getting banned.</p><p>For the Falcata to make sense, you have to really want both Hall effect <em>and</em> a split ergo keyboard. As an ergonomic board, it’s definitely a “try before you buy”; its limited tenting abilities could be fine, or you may realize right away that it’s not going to cut it. Unfortunately, you may not be able to try it <em>until </em>you buy it, as your local Best Buy may not have a model on display. If you decide to jump through that hoop, make sure you can get a refund if needed.</p><p>If you don’t mind missing out on the advanced features of a Hall effect board, the <a href="https://gaming.kinesis-ergo.com/product/kb975-plus/">Kinesis Freestyle Edge RGB Plus</a> is a great split ergo board that’s less than half the price. It offers hot-swap mechanical switches (it comes with either linear or tactile, but is compatible with thousands of different switch types), and with the Lift Kit that lets it tent at up to 15 degrees. Yes, it’s bulkier and wired only, with louder switches (depending on the ones you get), and it doesn’t have Hall effect switches. But it’s a very good keyboard, and it’s better ergonomically, too.</p><p><em>Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/821355/asus-falcata-review-hall-effect-switches-split-ergo-gaming-keyboard]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Black Ops 7 brings back Call of Duty campaign co-op for the first time in a long time. You can experience Treyarch’s newest story offering with other players, but there’s some uncertainty surrounding Black Ops 7 and split-screen multiplayer for the campaign.</p>



<p>You might have heard one or two interesting things about the Black Ops 7 campaign. It’s true that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/you-cant-pause-the-black-ops-7-campaign-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can’t pause the Black Ops 7 campaign, ever</a>. There is also the odd suggestion of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-skibidi-toilet-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">giant Skibidi Toilet Boss</a>—don’t adjust your glasses or wipe your phone, you read that right.</p>



<p>But let’s see if any of this matters due to a potential lack of local split-screen multiplayer in Black Ops 7.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-7-campaign-split-screen">Is Black Ops 7 Campaign Split-Screen?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A unit, to an extent. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Despite the Black Ops 7 campaign being capable of co-op, this feature is restricted to online only, meaning you can’t play the campaign in local co-op split-screen.</strong></p>



<p>You can enjoy the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 campaign with friends, but you have to do it through online multiplayer. BLOPS 7’s campaign is an online-only experience for the first time, which might prove finicky where local co-op is concerned.</p>



<p>If you want to tackle the story’s main missions and reach the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-skip-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Endgame</a>, you’ll either have to do so by yourself or online with other players.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-players-can-play-black-ops-7-campaign">How Many Players Can Play Black Ops 7 Campaign?</h2>



<p><strong>Up to 4 players can team up in Black Ops 7 campaign multiplayer, which is made easier because you all have your own screen to see.</strong></p>



<p>4-player local split-screen is seldom seen in modern gaming. It’s difficult to do, and presumably easier to code and develop with online multiplayer in mind. On the plus side, if you have three friends you want to spill blood, banter, and bullets with, the Black Ops 7 campaign allows you to.</p>



<p>If one or more of you need the game, we recommend you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/">use this link to buy Black Ops 7 for cheap!</a></p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-black-ops-7-campaign-co-op">How To Play Black Ops 7 Campaign Co-Op</h2>



<p><strong>You must invite one or more users to your party in Black Ops 7 to play the campaign in online co-op</strong>.</p>



<p>Like you would with a normal Call of Duty party, invite your friends to a private party, and once you have a squad of between 2-4 players, head into the Black Ops 7 campaign.</p>



<p>Whoever is the party leader will determine what you play: It could be main missions, or it could be Avalon!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Skibidi Toilet Boss—Giant Boss Battle Meme, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-skibidi-toilet-boss/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-skibidi-toilet-boss%E2%80%94giant-boss-battle-meme-explained.1355053/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Skibidi Toilet meme is a sign of the times, and the popular meme has now spread to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. If you keep seeing Skibidi Toilet mentioned in the same breath as Black Ops 7, we’ll, unfortunately, explain why.</p>



<p>Like ourselves, I’m sure many of you could’ve gone your whole life without knowing what Skibidi Toilet was. With meme culture being as big as it is, evolving on a day-to-day basis, new memes and trends can sometimes pass in the blink of an eye. One that is fervently sticking around is Skibidi Toilet—yay.</p>







<p>The meme has piqued more interest than usual because of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ai-controversy-catches-attention-of-us-congressman-we-need-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>. A certain viral section of gameplay from the game has caused this.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-skibidi-toilet-boss-in-black-ops-7">What Is The Skibidi Toilet Boss In Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What were they thinking? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Skibidi Toilet Boss in Black Ops 7 refers to the Harper Boss Fight, where Mike Harper—part of the main protagonist team throughout the campaign—has a breakdown, due to a story revelation, and you end up briefly fighting your ally who has morphed into a giant, somewhat resembling the Skibidi Toilet meme.</strong></p>



<p>That’s a lot to take in, I know. But here are the basics:</p>



<ul>
<li>Harper learns the truth about something big that happened in the past. (<strong>Keeping it spoiler-free</strong>)</li>



<li>He drags the team into a weird vision/memory/hallucination.</li>



<li>The unstable Harper suddenly turns into a giant boss, where you can only see the top half of him.</li>



<li>To many on the internet, Harper looks like the Skibidi Toilet meme because it looks like his torso could be sticking out of a toilet.</li>
</ul>







<p>That’s it, that’s the meme. It’s unclear if this was intentional on Treyarch’s part or a complete accident. Either way, the encounter has gone down in infamy as the ‘Skibidi Toilet’ boss fight in Black Ops 7.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-where-does-skibidi-toilet-meme-come-from">Where Does Skibidi Toilet Meme Come From?</h2>



<p><strong>YouTuber DaFuq!?Boom! is the creator of the meme, which has since been replicated across all corners of the internet.</strong></p>



<p>As a boomer, I might not be down with the kids enough to explain this very well, so here’s an explanation courtesy of <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/skibidi-toilet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">KnowYourMeme</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Skibidi Toilet&nbsp;is a series of&nbsp;Source Filmmaker&nbsp;videos by YouTuber DaFuq!?Boom! featuring a remix of “Give It To Me” by Timbaland and&nbsp;“Dom Dom Yes Yes”&nbsp;by Biser King in which an army of toilets with men’s heads coming out of them are shown singing the song in various settings. The series follows a plot about the Skibidi Toilets taking over the world and men with cameras for heads known as CameraHeads fighting against them.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>You can now sleep easy tonight knowing what the Black Ops 7 Skibidi boss fight is, AND where the original meme came from!</p>



<p>If you’ve played Black Ops 7, what did you make of the literal larger-than-life boss?

            <p>Sony has issued a number of DMCA notices against a fan project working to bring Concord back to life.</p>
<p>Concord was infamously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled from sale just two weeks after its PS5 and PC release</a>, amid suggestions it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">sold less than 25,000 copies</a>. At the time, Sony said the game would remain offline indefinitely so Firewalk could "determine the best path ahead" and "explore options, including those that will better reach our players." Later that same month, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-director-reportedly-steps-down-as-studio-awaits-sony-decision-on-games-future">Concord game director Ryan Ellis stepped down</a>, and by the end of October 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">Firewalk Studios, the Sony-owned developer behind the ill-fated shooter, was also shut down</a>.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, and a team of volunteer developers have been working for months to get the game up and running again, getting the main menu, character select, and matchmaking working on private servers. "The project is still WIP," one volunteer developer wrote on the <a href="https://discord.gg/q9Q2N52agh">Concord Delta Discord</a>, but confirmed "it's playable, but buggy."</p>

<p>"Hey. After a long time of reverse engineering [and] server development, we just managed to play a match of Concord!" the team announced on Discord.</p>
<p>"The project is still WIP, it's playable, but buggy. Once our servers are fully set up, we'll begin doing some private playtesting, if anyone here wants to join those playtests, let me know (include what region/time zone you are in for convenience)." The announcement ended thanking a couple of volunteer developers for "helping [...] reverse engineer the game".</p>
<p>Crucially, the team only hosted players who already owned the game files themselves through a legitimate purchase, and slapped down anyone trying to share "copyrighted files".</p>
<p>"I know this sucks for people who got forcefully refunded, but lawyers are most likely already watching everything we do and I want to ensure this project stays as legal as we realistically can do," the team wrote. "We will be removing any posts containing links to copyrighted files."</p><p>Despite the team's caution, however, Sony has targeted the project, filing copyright infringement claims against videos showing the project in action on YouTube and social media. And while it's unclear if Sony has filed against the team itself, it seems they've been cowed into submission for now, with one of the devs writing on Discord: "Due to worrying legal action we’ve decided to pause invites for the time being," (thanks, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/">The Game Post)</a>.</p>
<p>The UK's House of Commons recently debated the need for improved video game consumer protections as well as video game preservation. In this debate, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concords-sudden-shutdown-is-such-a-big-deal-its-been-brought-up-during-uk-government-debates-on-video-game-consumer-laws">Concord's sudden shutdown was used as an example</a>, and the requirement for strong consumer protections in such a case.</p>
<p>One MP stated: "A recent example is Concord, a game released for PlayStation 5 and Windows in August 2024. Following a disappointing launch, Sony Interactive Entertainment made a commercial decision to shut it down. To their credit, they did refund all purchases, but this isn't always the case."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For years now, Samsung has dominated the foldable phone market with its Galaxy Z Fold line, and the Galaxy Z Fold7 brings forth the sixth generation of this revolutionary smartphone. The great news today is that<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/"> Amazon currently offers this 512GB variant for $1,680, down from $2,119</a>. Samsung can’t offer that on their website which make it a legitimate all-time low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Screens That Redefine Mobile Productivity</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold7 boasts dual screens that seamlessly work together to redefine how you use a smartphone. The 6.3-inch cover screen smoothly handles your quick tasks and one-handed operations, while <strong>unfolding it reveals a massive 7.6-inch main display</strong>, reminiscent of tablet territory. This inner screen incorporates Samsung’s Ultra Thin Glass technology, which feels remarkably different from the plastic screens of folding phones past. <strong>A 120Hz refresh rate</strong> on both displays ensures smooth scrolling-be it flipping through emails on the cover screen or multitasking on the main display.</p>
<p>The hinge mechanism has been refined through six generations of engineering and it’s great: Samsung reduced the crease visibility significantly compared to previous models, though you’ll still feel it slightly when running your finger across the center. The <em>JetBlack</em> finish resists fingerprints better than glossy alternatives, and the Armor Aluminum frame adds durability without excessive weight. <strong>Samsung rates this phone for 200,000 folds</strong>&nbsp;which translates to roughly five years of opening and closing the device 100 times daily.</p>



<p>The brightness goes up to 2,600 nits peak, and outdoors, it’s perfectly visible even in direct sunlight. You will be very comfortable reading the screen at the beach or navigating maps while walking around town. Samsung’s adaptive color technology adjusts the display to match the ambient lighting, thus reducing eye strain during long uses.</p>
<p><strong>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite processor powers the Z Fold7</strong> and dlivers desktop-class performance in a foldable form factor. This chip handles demanding tasks like video editing, gaming, and AI processing without breaking a sweat. The 512GB storage option gives you plenty of room for apps, photos, and 4K videos without constantly managing space. Samsung pairs this with 12GB of RAM, ensuring smooth app switching even when running multiple resource-intensive applications.</p>
<p>The battery – 4,600mAh – may sound modest on paper but Samsung’s optimization makes it<strong> last over a full day with moderate usage</strong>. The heavy users who push both screens hard might need a top-up by evening, but typical usage patterns easily stretch from morning to bedtime. Fast charging at 25W will get you to 50% in about 30 minutes, though Samsung doesn’t include a charger in the box.</p>



<p>The<strong> new triple camera setup includes a 50MP main sensor</strong> that captures stunning details in most lighting conditions. Samsung’s AI processing enhances the photos automatically to adjust colors and sharpness, depending on the scene. Further, the 12MP ultra-wide camera shoots group shots and landscape photography, while the 10MP telephoto lens offers 3x optical zoom for distant subjects.

We're here once more to carefully open your digital missives as we open the door and put the little flag down on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/mailbox">Nintendo Life Mailbox</a>.</p>
<p>Got something you want to get off your chest? We're ready and waiting to read about your game-related ponderings. Each month we’ll highlight a Star Letter, the writer of which will receive a month’s subscription to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">our ad-free Supporter scheme</a>. Check out the submission guidelines at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>It's November, which means games are being launched at us like T-shirts from one of those cannons we've only ever seen on The Simpsons. So let's crack on quickly so we can get back to cramming for GOTY a month from now...</p>
<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - November 2025</h2>
<h3>"gramers" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, real talk. Grammar talk for grammar-conscious gamers: gramers.</p>
<p>Where do you stand on the use of ‘release’ as an intransitive verb? As in, “the game releases next month.”</p>
<p>It feels like it’s become increasingly popular over the last few years, even in official advertising, though I could just be growing more sensitive to it.</p>
<p>Most dictionaries list only the transitive use (“the game _was_ released (by Nintendo)”/“Nintendo released the game”), but that doesn’t seem to be holding people back from using the verb sans object.</p>
<p>Is this a new thing, or has it been around for as long as video games have been… releasing?</p>
<p>I consider myself to be more of a descriptivist than a prescriptivist, so try not to object to the lack of object. But I want to here you’re professional opinions on this mater as experiensed righters with a cute sence off prefect grammer &amp; speling, ect.<strong><br>
Maxz</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very good. That last sentence got me twitching.</p>
<p>I don't care for it. However, 'it releases' is so common, I gave in and use it myself these days. It doesn't sound unnatural to my ear anymore, and mixing it up with 'launches' gives some lexical variety.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the grammar police have larger problems with which to concern themselves. I'm currently playing whack-a-mole with 'addicting'. And let's not start on the true grammatical evil of our times, 'I could care less'... <em>*retches, weeps, withers*</em> <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"boulder-falling"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>With "Close to You" as Nintendo Picture's first in house produced short film, I wonder if we'll see dormant Nintendo franchises rise from the ashes in the form of animations. It's a lot less of a time and monetary investment to make an animation, than it is to make a new AAA game. Nintendo could make short animations of dormant franchises to truly gauge interest on if a new game would be of interest to them. Imagine an F-Zero race fully animated to be as cinematic as possible or the Golden Sun boulder-falling intro animated like a Miyazaki film.</p>
<p>These are just a few ideas off the top of my head, but what would you like to see, and more importantly, do you think positive reception to animations could result in new games?<br>
<strong>Kazman2007</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a nice idea, but I don't see it happening. A cinematic F-Zero race would be awesome for four minutes, and then talk would <em>immediately</em> turn to the reason behind the short. "We just wanted to do something neat!" wouldn't be good enough for diehard fans. They/we would feel snubbed, duped, <em>trolled</em>, despite the cool F-Zero thing.</p>
<p>Pikmin is a going concern for Nintendo; they just updated Pikmin 4, all the other games are on Switch, and Pikmin Bloom is still trucking along. Even if they're essentially training exercises for Nintendo Pictures, they're not going to waste their marketing potential on IP you can't buy.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed for a Rhythm Heaven short next year, then. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"every single box"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, Nintendo Life!<br>
Recently, due to its appearance on this site, I picked up Trails in the Sky 1st chapter, and I absolutely adored it. I'm on the next game in the series (on my PC, unfortunately.) and I really do feel like I found a franchise that checks every single box of what I love in a game. Fantastic OST, a giant focus on character interactions, a JRPG, general more cozy vibes, and I just love the characters and the world. The only other game I've felt like is made expressly for me isn't even out yet! (Hazuki Dies: She Has No Name on steam, check out the demo)<br>
Two things. First, thank you for featuring Trails the 1st on your website Nintendo Life! I really do appreciate it. Second, have any of y'all found that "perfect game series" for yourself? I'm curious.<br>
Regardless, thanks for what you do! I really appreciate it.<br>
<strong><em>Bluelink45</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we appreciate you, Bluelink! If it's done well, I can't think of a genre I flat-out don't like, which, conversely, makes picking out a 'perfect' series tough. Pikmin, perhaps? That has a brilliant mix going on, but really it's variety that keeps me going.</p>
<p>'This is a game about trauma' in the PR blurb is a <em>personal</em> red flag right now - I'm looking forward to when I'm not noping outta there for self-preservation purposes. Fortunately, variety is Switch's greatest strength, and Nintendo's forte is upbeat vibes and playful locomotion. Speaking of which... <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"good guesses"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Nintendo Life,</p>
<p>Been a member of this fabulous community for a good while now and this is the first time I'm writing to you folks. <i title=":smiley:"></i></p>
<p>I know you folks aren't Nintendo themselves, but any good guesses on when the next 3D Mario game would get announced/released for the Switch 2? The mainline Super Mario series is my favorite game series of all time and I'd love to see what kind of adventures await Mario on Nintendo's newest console. And yes I did play Donkey Kong Bananza - it's a good game for sure. But I really want that next 3D Mario!</p>
<p>Hope you're all having a lovely day.<strong><br>
D-Star92</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We're all waiting for the next proper 3D Mario, but trying to predict Nintendo is a fool's game. Fortunately, I am that fool, so let's say <em>*peers into the middle distance while opening a tab on the laptop and looking at decades of Nintendo Direct dates*...</em></p>
<p>Wednesday 10th June announcement for a Thursday 10th September release. You heard it here first, folks! Pulled that one right out of my... mind. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<figure data-uuid="7703043cba3d1"><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7703043cba3d1/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h3>"lukewarm"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Mario Kart World Appreciation<br>
(Sorry if this letter is too long!)</p>
<p>I continue to be surprised by the lukewarm reception for Mario Kart World. The dismissiveness seems to come from people who aren't aware of the high skill ceiling and depth of gameplay. In a way, I understand the opinion, because I agree that plodding along the main path through a track like Salty Salty Speedway is pretty boring. The thing is, people who love Mario Kart World don't race that way. We are lining up for wall rides and rail combinations that often allow us to skip over entire sections of the track. Eventually, a racer starts to see water as an obstacle to be avoided (because it's slower than other surfaces) instead of as the inevitable path. Add in the strategic decisions about when and where to most effectively use items and which of the multiple routes is best for the moment and you have a game with a ton of depth and replayability.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Even though Mario Kart is a classic for casual gaming, I wish more people would take the little next step of really learning a track in Time Trials. First, watch the included Nintendo staff ghost to see the main shortcuts and understand how it looks to race a clean line. Once you can beat the staff ghost, if you dare, look at the ludicrous world record ghost to see just how high the skill ceiling goes. You start to see that you’re losing time with slightly sloppy corners and by overlooking creative turbo boost opportunities, not to mention the truly advanced moves like jumping off the track on turns to wall ride along the skinny edge of the road instead and chaining shortcut combinations that emerge where genius Nintendo track design meets ridiculous skill. (Did Nintendo design that crazy shortcut intentionally? You never really know!) There are levels to the skill ceiling and you start to see just how much risk and difficulty you are willing to take on in Time Trials and then also out in your other favorite game modes, too.</p>
<p>By the way, count me in among the fans clamoring for updates. I absolutely am hoping for more tracks, a dedicated mode for classic 3-lap races, and 200cc. The idea I've seen about more elaborate missions in Free Roam for things like unlocking new characters or tracks could be pretty neat, too. But goshdarnit, I love Mario Kart World already! It's given me stretches of gaming bliss that are becoming rarer as the years go by (to the point of nearly activating parental controls on myself after staying up playing until 2:00 AM for a third night in a row). Happy racing everybody!<strong><br>
Scott</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree there's oodles of depth and World will be my default Mario Kart for years to come - I just haven't played it in a while because of everything else!</p>
<p>And we're <em>definitely</em> going to be getting updates. I hear they sold quite a few copies of this. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"a level of fun"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m at the point where I feel I need to stop buying Pokémon games. I was looking at the flat, N64-level wall textures in Legends Z-A and finally, the veil has been lifted.<br>
I’ve been loyally buying Pokémon games as a habit throughout the whole series, and having a level of fun with them. Generally though it’s more just to play the new one because I played the old one. They have had very little innovation over the decades. This is the most profitable entertainment franchise in the world and comparing the love and effort put in to Zelda, Mario, and many others - not to mention indie games with thought and love put into every frame - frustrates me to no end. We expect so little from them and they respect their loyal fans so little.<br>
At this point, I won’t lose much by missing the next entry in Pokémon and I’ll be voting with my dollar.<br>
<strong><em>Barton</em></strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-when-did-good-enough-become-good-enough-for-pokemon">'good enough' isn't good enough</a> for games like this. There's no shortage of software out there, and given the last generation of Pokémon games, you'll probably survive sitting the next one out and investing that dollar in a good handful of indie gems instead.</p>
<p>Or just wait a few months and see how things pan out. Being there day one to be part of the conversation is nice, but the games aren't going anywhere. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"excited for a Bubsy"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You know, I'm always a fan of a good redemption arc. Bubsy 4D is coming soon (that demo was actually fantastic) and it leaves me baffled I'm excited for a Bubsy game, but here we are.</p>
<p>Then again it's being made by Fabraz, who made the amazing Demon Turf (easy recommend btw) and are also making its sequel, Demon Tides, which looks gorgeous.</p>
<p>To a lesser extent, Yooka Replaylee just came out and the general consensus is pretty glowing.</p>
<p>Any good gaming redemption stories you can think of? Cheers lads. Happy gaming!<br>
<strong>Lewis</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cyberpunk springs to mind immediately. No Man's Sky, definitely (thanks, Jim). It can happen! There's still hope for Mighty No.9! Maybe when I get my 3DS code... <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Please Nintendo, Navi says "Listen!" But will you?" - <strong>YoshiTails</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>*takes out Airpods*</em> Sorry, what was that? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Just wanted to check in and see if you had a chance to consider our idea on enhancing home environments for better health." - <strong>Dennis</strong></em></p>

<p>Nah, you're alright, Dennis. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Hey there! Just popping back into your inbox to see if you're ready to unlock the secrets of stellar data collection." - <strong>Randall</strong></em></p>

<p>As in data from the cosmos or just really top-notch data collection? Dennis might have been off-topic, but at least he was clear. Please be more specific with your spam, Randall. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom — you're done!</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Steam Machine Offers Equal or Better Performance Than 70% of Gaming PC Rigs, Says Valve]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-offers-equal-or-better-performance-70-gaming-pcs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-machine-offers-equal-or-better-performance-than-70-of-gaming-pc-rigs-says-valve.1355026/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Out of Valve's <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three hardware announcements made on Wednesday</a>, the Steam Machine was undoubtedly the one that got people the most excited. Sure, Valve already tried and failed ten years ago, but the successful hardware launches of the Valve Index and, especially, the Steam Deck have proven Gabe Newell's company can do hardware really well. </p>



<p>One of the main changes compared to the previous Steam Machine iteration is that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bigger-game-catalogue-steam-machine-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it will feature a large selection of games</a>. However, Valve also needs to make sure <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the device has competitive pricing</a> while still delivering decent performance. In that regard, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkW3wTHT-p8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a video interview with Adam Savage</a>, Hardware Engineer Yazan Aldehayyat claimed the new console-like platform is comparable to or better than 70% of the user rigs registered in the Steam survey.</p>



<p><em>Well, there's looking at it from two different directions, right? The first one is that it needs to have enough performance to play all your Steam games. That was really important to us. We want it to be a pretty simple experience. You don't have to worry about, oh, I play these games. I don't know if it has enough performance to play these games. That was the first hurdle: we needed to make sure that there's enough performance in the Steam Machine that you don't have to worry about that.</em></p>



<p><em>But we also kind of wanted to target more of an entry-level device. We understand that affordability is really important, right? The price point definitely plays a huge factor into what performance level we're trying to target. Essentially, we kind of used those two directions to triangulate what we think makes the most sense. Another thing that we actually looked at is just the Steam hardware survey. Basically, that just gives us a good benchmark of where people's home devices are at in terms of performance, and the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70% of what people have at home. That's also another way to think about it where we kind of arrive at that performance level.</em></p>



<p>Still, based on the specs revealed so far, the hardware's performance could fall between that of the Xbox Series S and PlayStation 5, so don't expect anything extraordinary, especially <a href="https://wccftech.com/valves-new-steam-machine-packs-just-8-gb-vram-is-that-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">given the 8 GB VRAM</a>. In the video interview, Aldehayyat also confirmed that Valve did not bother to tune any of the silicon, using an 'off-the-shelf' chip. They did, however, customize the 'firmware and software bits' so that the Steam Machine would be optimized for the SteamOS environment.</p>



<p>With the platform slated to launch in early 2026, it shouldn't be too long before Valve provides more details, such as the final price.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-hits-13-years-of-development-nearly-900-million-in-funding-and-its-still-in-alpha/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-citizen-hits-13-years-of-development-nearly-900-million-in-funding-and-it%E2%80%99s-still-in-alpha.1355020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long road to Star Citizen’s full release looks to be continuing, as it’s been 13 years since the game was announced. We’ve checked back in from time to time, and the latest update is that Star Citizen is still in alpha, and it’s swiftly closing in on $900 million of crowd-funded money.</p>



<p>Say what you want, yes, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Citizen</a> actually looks like a quality game. On the other hand, it probably should do when it’s had the development time that many multi-game franchises get and enough money to fund several Hollywood-level movies. Cloud Imperium Games’ Star Citizen could end up being one of the most fascinating games of our time.</p>







<h2 id="h-star-citizen-approaching-1-billion-in-funding">Star Citizen Approaching $1 Billion In Funding</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Is the game lost in space? Credit to Cloud Imperium Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Star Citizen has been playable since 2017. To be fair, it somewhat mirrors Escape From Tarkov, which was first playable in 2016, and eventually came out in 2025 for its 1.0 launch. However, there doesn’t seem to be anything similar planned for Star Citizen right now, and the team continues to work on refining the game and adding new content.</p>



<p>There does come a point where the lines are blurred between ‘early builds’ and a complete release. You could argue that a game can’t stay in testing forever, especially not 8 years of alpha testing.</p>







<p>Since it was announced in 2012 (13 years ago), as of October 2025, Star Citizen has accumulated <strong>$885,286,273</strong> in funding—At the time of writing.</p>



<p>It’s figured that Star Citizen is in the top 3 most expensive video games ever made. The data varies from source to source. The crucial difference here is that funding shows no signs of slowing down. We expect the space-based combat simulation game to cross $900 million before long, and unless the beta phase—or full launch is announced—the $1 billion mark surely beckons.</p>



<p>Let’s make it clear: We are not criticizing the game or its development. But it certainly is a curious case, and after we learned a few months ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-loses-integral-staff-responsible-for-server-meshing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Integral Staff’ responsible for Server Meshing</a> are no longer with the company, you have to wonder if this road ever has an end.</p>



<p>Have you played Star Citizen or contributed to its ongoing funding? Give us some insight: Why do you enjoy it, and what do you think the holdup is?

            <p>Ubisoft has told Anno 117: Pax Romana fans that it will be replacing an AI-generated loading screen image, insisting it had "slipped through" and had only meant to be used as a placeholder.</p>
<p>The Steam page for Anno 117: Pax Romana carries an "AI Generated Content Disclosure" - the first for an Ubisoft game - but that hasn't stopped fans complaining about the image, or insisting that they expect better from a premium game from a developer like Ubisoft.</p>

<p>The image, which can be viewed in full <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fthe-ai-background-art-is-pretty-low-quality-unfortunately-v0-yi4z7xs7o11g1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D3399%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D2d42be908c532ce0df76c17431201e223ab81955">here</a>, shows a number of tell-tale signs that it's been generated rather than drawn, including disfigured or out-of-scale facial features, missing limbs, and strange set-dressing. A touched-up version is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fthe-ai-background-art-is-pretty-low-quality-unfortunately-v0-jjptto1zr11g1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D2683%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dc930b5ce57dcbe6d89cd4b02d4dc69af9a83d85e">considerably less jarring,</a> but some fans still take issue with the fact that it was based on a prompt rather than an original piece of art.</p>
<p>"If they are going to go with cheap tools in their game, I will wait till the game is cheap," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1ow3v75/comment/nonhwqr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one unhappy fan.</p>
<p>Another, leaving a negative review on Steam, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsAnny/recommended/3274580/">wrote</a>: "I don't want to live in a future where every big studio that very well could afford paying artists instead chooses to steal from artists by using AI generated images. AI tools are bad for the environment, bad for the job market, on top of that the images look awful, genuinely an eyesore in a[n] otherwise beautiful game."</p>

<p>Responding to <a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399">Kotaku</a>, Ubisoft said: "This image was a placeholder asset that unintentionally slipped through our review process. The final image is attached here and will replace the current version of this artwork with the upcoming 1.3 patch. With Anno 117: Pax Romana being our most ambitious Anno yet, we’ve assembled the largest team of artists ever for the franchise and to help meet the project’s unique scope, they use AI tools for iterations, prototyping, and exploration. Every element players will experience in the final game reflects the team’s craft, artistry, and creative vision."</p>
<p>And it's not just images that seem to have been generated by AI, either. According to some players, the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1onip56/german_text_localization_is_still_ai_generated_in/">text localisation is also allegedly "still AI-generated"</a>, too.</p>
<p>u/Taubenangriff posted a number of examples they believe were translated by machine, writing "nobody who has ever played an Anno before was let near translation work, and it is still AI generated slop to a large part. They got six million euros cultural (!) sponsorship from the German state, but the result is outright disrespectful to the German language".</p>

		<p>PIONER’s beta has ended and developer GFA Games has released an update on what players should expect next as part of the game’s development journey. First off, GFA Games has confirmed that anyone who took part in the open beta will get the “Combat Classic” weapon skin and 200 Efritan Crystals, which is PIONER’s premium currency, should they purchase the game when it releases.</p>
<p><iframe title="PIONER - Frontier" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xGXEA0Exa50?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The PIONER open beta did have lots of issues identified by players, including progression saving bugs and server stability issues. On these issues, GFA Games said, <em>“The test build contained several critical issues, and we acknowledge that more thorough pre-testing would have resulted in a smoother experience. It is undoubtedly our responsibility to ensure player comfort. <wbr>We will not promise quick fixes, nor will we announce new content until these fundamental issues are resolved. Our top priority is to use the data gathered during testing to ensure the game runs stably at release. <wbr>Work on fixes continues with doubled effort. Thank you for staying with us and helping us make PIONER better.”</em></p>
<p>In addition, there will be a further PIONER stress test, but GFA Games has not yet confirmed when that will be. PIONER is an MMO FPS that has both PvE and PvP gameplay, with players free to spend as much time in either. On the PvP side of things, PIONER has a mode called Shadowlands which is an extraction shooter mode. Here players will compete with each other to get kills and find treasures. On the PvE side players will be able to work together in structured missions as well as six unique raids. However, to survive in the world of PIONER, players will need to account for their character’s hunger, tiredness, and the resources to have to hand. The devs still have 2025 as a targeted release window but with only around six weeks until the end of the year, that does seem like a short amount of time to implement fixes and do a new stress test.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ai-controversy-catches-attention-of-us-congressman-we-need-regulations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-ai-controversy-catches-attention-of-us-congressman-%E2%80%9Cwe-need-regulations%E2%80%9D.1355008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Much of the Black Ops 7 discourse since launch has focused on the game’s AI usage. Activision has admitted to using AI in the creation of various art and materials in the game, and US Congressman Ro Khanna has issued a statement on AI use in general.</p>



<p>Certain gaming subjects leave us all divided. However, the use of AI is a fairly one-way street where opinions are concerned. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-accused-of-using-generative-ai-art-for-black-ops-7-calling-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision was accused of using AI for Black Ops 7 Calling Cards</a>. Amazingly, and to their credit, the company responded quite soon after the accusations became loud, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responding to the AI claims in full</a>.</p>



<p>The conversation is getting loud as even the US Congress is getting involved, to an extent.</p>







<h2 id="h-us-congressman-responds-to-black-ops-7-ai-use">US Congressman Responds To Black Ops 7 AI Use</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Does AI need to be limited, or removed altogether? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>American politician Ro Khanna (a Member of the&nbsp;U.S. House of Representatives) was quoted as saying: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits. Artists at these companies need to have a say in how AI is deployed. They should share in the profits and there should be a tax on mass displacement.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Interestingly, the message was used with a quote tweet of Pirat_Nation’s X message about the Black Ops 7 Calling Cards and AI claims.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 uses a large amount of AI-generated artwork across core assets (calling cards, posters, reward icons) instead of human-crafted art—despite being a major blockbuster title charging full price. <a href="https://t.co/vGbtG8NYM7">pic.twitter.com/vGbtG8NYM7</a></p>— Pirat_Nation 🔴 (@Pirat_Nation) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pirat_Nation/status/1989339040945233984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Since all of this happened, Ro Khanna has been spotted reposting a CharlieIntel message about his response to Black Ops 7 AI, and the politician has gone one step further by posting a fresh statement on the controversy:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“A company replacing artists with AI is not much different than one that replaces truck drivers. AI cannot just be for enriching tech billionaires. AI must be for us, not them.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>AI use has become ubiquitous across all industries in the last few years. The gaming landscape has certainly been rocked by AI, and there’s a fear that too many talented artists and developers will be phased out in favor of AI. </p>



<p>We learned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-developers-used-ai-extensively/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Steel Frontiers developers used AI ‘Extensively’</a>, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-nexon-ceo-defends-ai-voices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexon’s CEO has defended ARC Raiders’ AI Voices by saying ‘Every Game Company’ is doing it</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="2b568f8b1f0c9"><a title="Inazuma Eleven - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2b568f8b1f0c9/inazuma-eleven-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are back with this week's clash of the covers! Welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>.</p>
<p>It was a trio of designs for the NES' <strong>Dragon Power</strong> that went head-to-head (to-head) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-dragon-power-nes">last time</a>, though neither the European nor North American artwork stood a chance against the eye-catching Japanese variant, which gobbled up 72% of the vote and left with the win.</p>
<p>This time, to celebrate <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Victory Road</a> <em>finally</em> making it to Switch, we're throwing things back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/inazuma_eleven">Inazuma Eleven</a>'s debut entry on DS. This is the game that kickstarted the football RPG series, complete with OTT abilities, a player roster as long as your arm, and the kind of professional-quality anime cutscenes that we always love to see from Level-5.</p>
<p>You'll have to wait a little while longer for our full Victory Road review, but until then, here's a match-up between <em>two</em> covers (it didn't arrive in North America until the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/inazuma_eleven">3DS digital re-release</a>) for the game that started it all.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/ds/related-articles:15013,193735 @ 1763321151 -->
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="ddcc8ce31a18b"><a title="Inazuma Eleven -" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ddcc8ce31a18b/inazuma-eleven.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10834-inazuma-eleven">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We'll be the first to admit, there's a lot going on in this European design. Mark and Axel take centre stage, naturally, but a large portion of the cover is occupied by headshots of the other players you can recruit, accompanied by the boast that you can choose between over 1,000 of them. We like the football pitch stretching off into the background, but sometimes, less is more.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="137905c3429fa"><a title="Inazuma Eleven -" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/137905c3429fa/inazuma-eleven.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10834-inazuma-eleven">Level-5 / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese cover shoots for something different. This is all-out action. The pitch backdrop is replaced by a deep red, hiding the faces of some of the recruitable ballers. The central duo take more kinetic poses, and everything that isn't absolutely essential *<em>cough headshots cough</em>* is gone. It's as vibrant as they come, but there's no denying that it's eye-catching.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-mod-out-now-offering-up-to-2x-fps-in-cpu-intensive-scenes/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new Frame Generation mod for Fallout 4 was released yesterday <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/98208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Nexus Mods</a>. As you probably remember, modder PureDark released Frame Generation mods for Bethesda's open world RPG, first <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-dlss-3-mod-60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for NVIDIA DLSS</a> and then for AMD FSR, over two years ago. However, PureDark's mods are still locked behind the paywall of having to be a Patreon subscriber of his.</p>



<p>This mod, on the other hand, is completely free of charge. Created by doodlum, the main coder behind The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's Community Shaders graphics enhancement suite, it is the modder's second submission after <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-gets-perfect-skies-graphics-mod-long-15-quest-mod-due-december-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Skies for Fallout: New Vegas</a> for the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout-modathon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 2025 Modathon</a>, a Nexus Mods competition among modders that started on October 23 (Fallout Day) and ends on December 31, 2025.</p>



<p>Doodlum's Fallout 4 Frame Generation mod is powered by AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 technology, more specifically through the <a href="https://gpuopen.com/amd-fidelityfx-sdk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly available</a> AMD FidelityFX SDK GPUOpen API, and thus uses a DLL signed by AMD. It works through a custom-made DirectX 12 swap chain proxy and is compatible with any DirectX 12-capable graphics card, which is not surprising given that it relies on AMD FSR 3.</p>



<p>The modder says Frame Generation can smooth performance in the most demanding scenarios, such as in cities. Moreover, mods like the popular Sim Settlements 2 can further increase the CPU load, making Frame Generation even more important.

<p>By default, the mod only enables itself when detecting monitors with a refresh rate of at least 120Hz; however, users can force it to be enabled in the .ini file.</p>



<p>The mod requires Address Library for F4SE Plugins and High FPS Physics Fix, and also for you to set Fallout 4 to Borderless or Windowed mode in the game's launcher. It is compatible with ENB and also with PureDark's free <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/68586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 4 upscaler mod</a>, provided you set the latter to DLAA or native AA. It does not, however, work with the VR version of the game, though that's not an issue since VR's spacewarp already provides a similar and more effective frame generation technique.</p>



<p>Fallout 4 just celebrated its tenth anniversary <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-4-review-a-welcoming-wasteland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since its original launch</a> with the release of a new Anniversary Edition (which broke a lot of mods, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-broke-your-mods-heres-how-to-revert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prompting some users to revert to the previous version</a>). In other Fallout news, rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest</a> both a Fallout 3 and a Fallout: New Vegas remaster are in the works at Bethesda.</p>

<p>Use these Spin A Brainrot monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including a variety of Dice and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spin A Brainrot isn’t all that different from all the other brainrot-related games that have been trending on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monsterverze-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> over the last many months. With the younger generation consuming more and more brainrot content every day, the likelihood of every brainrot game that comes out gaining massive popularity is quite high.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Spin A Brainrot does have a few minor differences, though, as unlike the other games in the genre, it allows players to acquire brainrot characters by simply spinning a Dice. That’s easier said than done, however, as Dice spins don’t come cheap in this game. To make the grind a little bit smoother, players can make use of the following codes. These codes reward players with different kinds of Dice, making it easier to acquire your favourite brainrot in no time. With items like potions and passive stat upgrades on offer as well, using these codes can help players get ahead of the competition.&nbsp;</p>
