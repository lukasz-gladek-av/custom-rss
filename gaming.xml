            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I’ve always been enamoured by the legend of King Arthur and his Knights of the RoundTable. I blame Disney. Ever since watching the animated classic ‘Sword in the Stone’ I was a full-on überfan. King Arthur T-shirts, a Guinevere action figure, Lancelot emblazoned underwear, a plastic Excalibur with light-up glow-in-the-dark action (AA batteries supplied separately), heck, I even wrote slightly questionable fanfiction. Well, no, not really. But I still really like the Arthurian Legends, so when the opportunity to review Sworn, a roguelite inspired by near-forgotten British legends, I leapt at the chance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sworn - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9NLltDX7dbo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sworn wears its devoted inspiration to Hades rather obviously on its armour-clad sleeve. Just like Supergiant’s genre defining classic, Sworn is an action-RPG played from an isometric perspective. In an attempt to differ itself, Sworn asks you to press slightly different button inputs to dodge, attack, and open doors to new areas, yet otherwise this is, to all intents and purposes, a near identical experience, just set in British mythology rather than that of Ancient Greece.</p>


<p>I also get the feeling that someone on the dev team might have read Amy Jeff’s brilliant book Storyland: A New Mythology of Britain at some point, as Sworn draws heavily upon the mythological characters and their stories depicted within it. The Fae Lords – modern interpretations of ancient Celtic gods – bestow powers and abilities on your nameless protagonists, giving you the standard assortment of roguelite powers – flame generating dashes, magical projectiles, elemental attacks, you know the drill – before you die and lose them all. You’ll take on a host of grotesque beasties, before ultimately battling several corrupted members of the Knights of the Round Table, on your way to face Arthur himself.</p>


<p>The game looks fantastic, offering chunky character art and bold visuals clearly inspired by the work of comic-book artist Mike Mignola. Animation is slick and the controls responsive, ensuring it plays well too. Enemies are delightfully varied but often dumb as a poorly educated brick, getting stuck on terrain or hanging out in the corner of a stage, just waiting to die. Still, with a focus on swarming the player, they do enough to offer a decent challenge, even though it’s usually the tougher than tough bosses who will end your run.</p>
<p>There are a few elements that aren’t taken directly from Hades. First and foremost is online co-op, where up to four players can team up to hack through the monster-filled rooms together. This is tremendous – if rather chaotic – fun, though its all too easy to lose sight of your avatar in the unfolding violence and discover you’ve lost a heavy chunk of health. One can only hope that a local co-op mode is in the works, as I certainly missed its inclusion here.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are unlockable player characters which, whilst sharing in the same run-to-run stat upgrades, each play significantly differently. Indeed, working with other players to ensure a rounded team is vital; someone attacking from afar with an archer, whilst another absorbs damage as a knight, until the axe-wielding warrior can get in close to deal out the big hits. The range of meaningful build options is particularly impressive, each character having access to a choice of four varied weapons and numerous additional support spells and abilities.</p>

<p>As such, no matter the seemingly unstoppable might of the boss you are facing, there is always a work around, always something new to try, tempting you with that ‘just one more run’ compulsion. When you gather together a band of four players, these build options across the team increase exponentially, offering some truly devious combos that can see heavyweight foes annihilated in seconds. Part of the satisfaction is the sense that you’re almost breaking the game, up until you reach the next boss and are brought promptly down to earth.</p>
<p>The game is built around co-op, which unfortunately means that in singleplayer, things feel flat and basic. This isn’t helped by the lack of characterisation amongst the NPCs. In Hades, you became increasingly fond of Achilles, Nyx, and Patroclus – and the rest – as their personalities and back story were developed run to run. Indeed, it was one of the reasons I felt compelled to give every nasty boss fight another go; just to further develop my relationship with the gang back in the hub. This element is oddly absent from Sworn.</p>
<p>The developers have some absolutely awesome mythological characters at their disposal, Merlin and Guinevere chief amongst them. But rather than lean into these fascinating figures and their incredible back stories, not to mention the narrative opportunities that would provide, each character you meet is essentially nothing more than a dull merchant, offering power-ups instead of a fully rounded personality and intriguing dialogue. When you have a mythological world as rich as the one provided by the legends of Camelot, this can’t help but feel like a waste.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ntd-remakes-the-no-mercy-campaign-with-rtx-remix.1319449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, the so-called Nostalgia Drive Team released the first work-in-progress build of Left 4 Dead RTX NTD. This is based on the previous work done by modder xoxor4d, which we <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered earlier this year</a>.</p>



<p>The Nostalgia Drive Team describes Left 4 Dead RTX NTD as a visual overhaul of Valve's classic co-op first-person shooter game released in 2009, rebuilt with the NVIDIA RTX Remix platform (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-1-2-advanced-path-traced-particle-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just got a major update last month</a>, allowing modders to inject old games with enhanced fire and smoke effects through a path traced particle system). This fan-made visual revamp focuses specifically on the No Mercy campaign and reimagines its environments with high-resolution physically based rendering (PBR) materials, improved reflections, and manually recreated lighting to achieve a cinematic and atmospheric look.</p>



<p><strong>Technical Highlights</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Full PBR material system</li>



<li>Manually re-lit scenes (RTX Remix cannot capture native lights)</li>



<li>Enhanced shadows, reflections, and surface roughness</li>



<li>Upgraded materials for buildings, interiors, and props</li>



<li>4K texture rebuilds and improved normal maps</li>



<li>Full RTX Remix runtime compatibility</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>You can download the WIP build of Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NTD, which weighs 7.15GB, <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/left-4-dead-2-rtx-by-nostalgia-drive-team/downloads/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ntd-wip-build" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from ModDB</a>. However, the NTD team shared the following warnings and disclaimers:</p>



<p><em>This is not a complete remaster but a foundation for future RTX mods in terms of compatibility and visuals. Due to engine limitations and ongoing development, some assets may appear unfinished or darker.</em></p>



<p><em>Expect missing/dark skyboxes, rubber-like materials on some models, incomplete lighting setups, water surfaces that may look off, and CPU-heavy performance on animated meshes. Moreover, the renderer is currently forced to run single-threaded, Alpha foliage heavily impacts performance, software skinning causes CPU bottlenecks, and some effects are still unhandled or inaccurate.</em></p>



<p>If, on the other hand, you want to contribute to the project, the Nostalgia Drive Team seeks help in the following areas: materials, lighting, assets, and testing. Those interested in joining the team can contact the user Entity in the official RTX Remix Showcase Discord channel.</p>

            <p>The classic 1999 version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a> is set to be pulled from sale on Steam later this week. It'll still be kicking around, but as a freebie offered to owners of the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-edition">25th anniversary remaster</a>, rather than something you can buy separately on Valve's store.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>System Shock 2 (1999) will be delisted from PC platforms on October 10, 2025," reads a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/866570/view/542243728060844444?l=english">notice</a> Atari have pinned to the FPS/RPG about Von Braun corridor wandering's Steam page. "Existing owners of System Shock 2 (1999) will still be able to re-download and play it from their library, but new users will no longer be able to purchase System Shock 2 (1999) as a standalone product."</p>
<p>Going forwards, anyone who has already bought or buys the System Shock 2 25th anniversary remaster will be able to grab the original game for free. So, it's not going away completely. However, by joining the two at the hip, Atari have gotten rid of the option to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238210/System_Shock_2_1999/">pay just £6.99/$9.99/€9.99</a> to play the original, with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/">£23.99/$29.99/€28.99 remaster</a> now being the sole port of call as far as Steam goes.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that at least for now, the original version of System Shock 2 is <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shock_2">still for sale on GOG</a>. There's no indication on the page that it's also set to be taken down imminently and it's part of GOG's preservation program.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 25th anniversary it's been lumped in with on Steam got plenty of positive reviews when it debuted earlier this year, with one of them being long-time RPS contributor Rick Lane's verdict for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-review">Eurogamer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>In short, System Shock 2 remains great, but its star has dimmed slightly over the last quarter-century, revealing brighter celestial bodies in the process. Nonetheless, if you like your shooters brainy, your levels knotty, and your nightmares weird as hell, System Shock 2 still delivers in a way that's more accessible than ever thanks to Nightdive's sterling work.</blockquote>
<p>If you're still on the fence about Nightdive's fresh coat of paint, it's probably wise to grab the 1999 version in the next couple of days if you're certain it's the only one you want.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-2025-xbox-wireless-controller-falls-to-new-low-even-cheaper-than-yesterday-on-prime-day%E2%80%99s-final-day.1319443/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It doesn’t matter if you primarily do your gaming on an Xbox console, PC, or even an Android tablet or phone. The Xbox core wireless controller is still possibly the best option for a gaming controller to choose from. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">And right now because of Prime Big Deals Days, you can nab one for 21% off.</a> Through today, the 2025 Xbox gaming controller has dropped from $65 to as low as just $50. That amount to a savings of $15. That’s exactly enough extra cash to buy yourself the insanely additive roguelike deck builder <em>Balatro</em>.</p>
<p>Each new console generation, Sony has been reinventing the wheel. The company behind PlayStation has been adding new bells and whistles to the original DualShock controller design. We’ve seen innovations like a touchpad or haptic triggers. These can be cool gimmicks, but most games don’t utilize to their full extent if at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Xbox decided to do things differently. They locked down the current controller design back in 2013 with the Xbox One launch and said, “Yeah this works.” And you know what? It does.</p>
<h2>Unbeatable Controller Design</h2>
<p>There have been some minor innovations since then like the addition of Bluetooth support, a share button, and the change to the now standard USB-C. Though those have been just to keep up with the times. The basic structure, layout, and feel of the controller are mostly unchanged. This certainly comes down to personal preference, but the D-pad on the Xbox controller puts the first party D-pad of the PS5 and Nintendo Switch to shame.</p>



<p>One big thing that has actually changed in that time is the options for customization. You can now map out button layouts at the system level, not just relying on in-game settings. Put together your personal preferences in the Xbox Accessories app to tweak how your controller works. It may not be something everyone needs or wants, but anything that broadens the accessibility for more players is a win for all of us.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">The Xbox controller is available in all sorts of vibrant colors and patterns, as well as the more classic and subtle black or white.</a> The discounts across these various variants very much vary. The robot white model right now is the cheapest at $50. The carbon black is slightly more at just $51. Deep pink is down to $54 with electric volt at $53. Some of the patterned ones like the ice breaker or heart breaker are still sitting at their full prices of $80.</p>

<p>Life continues to find a way, with Jurassic World Evolution 3 marking the next stage in the franchise with some major changes, and we’ve got the exact release date and start times for the title.</p>



<p>The third iteration of the franchise, which began back in 2018, Jurassic World Evolution 3 takes a big step forward with the debut of baby dinosaurs and modular building, features that are crucial in sister titles Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster.</p>



<p>If you want to count down the hours until you can build the park of your dreams, or sacrifice guests to a T. Rex, we’ve got you covered.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-jurassic-world-evolution-3-coming-out">When is Jurassic World Evolution 3 Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Baby dinos. Image via Frontier Developments</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Jurassic World Evolution 3 will be released on October 21 on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.</strong></p>



<p>With no delays to the release date, the game is ready for launch to mark the next era of the franchise for Frontier Developments, following on from two previous iterations of the game.</p>



<p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is Frontier’s big release of the year, following on from Planet Coaster 2 in 2024, but the exact time you can dive into the park management sim depends on where you are located in the world.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-jurassic-world-evolution-3-start-time">Do we Know The Jurassic World Evolution 3 Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Store listings confirm that Jurassic World Evolution 3 will be available to play from 7 AM PT on October 21, with players elsewhere in the world needing to wait until later in the day.</strong></p>



<p>Confirmed by the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP2377-PPSA25153_00-JWEVOLUTION30000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 has a global release and unlocks simultaneously for all players. This isn’t too surprising, as online features are minimal, so there’s no need for a staggered launch to ease stress on the servers.</p>



<p>You will be able to preload Jurassic World Evolution 3 onto your console or PC ahead of launch, reducing the wait time when the doors do finally open, but there’s no way to queue jump the title.</p>



<p>The table below shows the Jurassic World Evolution 3 start times in major time zones across the world.</p>

                <p>Sony is feeling blue — but in a good way — as the company has just revealed a new limited-edition DualSense controller. The Icon Blue Special Edition gives the peripheral a striking makeover, wrapping it in layered shades of blue, and it'll be available to preorder exclusively from Walmart for $85 when it goes on sale starting October 20.</p><p>The peripheral's colorway is inspired by the signature blue glow of the PS5 consoles when it's powered on, and according to Sony designer Leo Cardoso, the design is meant to capture the "feeling of anticipation and wonder" whenever you boot up the console. Other small touches include Katakana characters on the back and PlayStation shapes on the D-pad.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581938-dualsenseblue%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581938" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581938-dualsenseblue%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581938"></a><figcaption>Icon Blue DualSense controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581938-dualsenseblue%284%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581939-dualsenseblue%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581940-dualsenseblue%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581941-dualsenseblue%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581939,1300-4581940,1300-4581941" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4581939-dualsenseblue%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4581940-dualsenseblue%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4581941-dualsenseblue%285%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581939-dualsenseblue%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581940-dualsenseblue%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581941-dualsenseblue%285%29.jpg"></figure><p>If you're looking for a different type of design, you can grab limited edition DualSense controllers inspired by two of the biggest PS5 exclusives of the year, as well as one of the company's beloved franchises.

You can access the demos by <a href="https://fortnitetrial.fortnite.com/en-US/">clicking the sign-up link</a> on Epic’s announcement page, which will then redirect you to Discord. Availability is limited to PC players in the US, UK, Mexico, Canada, and several European countries. However, it’s worth flagging that myself and another UK-based colleague were unable to launch the experience in Discord without using a VPN that connected to the US.</p><p>There are no requirements to install <em>Fortnite</em> to play the demos, but users need to be signed into both their Discord and Epic Games accounts to connect them for the trial. Epic says that it doesn’t share players’ data with Nvidia or Discord, but notes that the companies “may independently” collect it.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-saros-10r-1-600-robot-vacuum-is-now-selling-for-peanuts-amazon-is-quietly-clearing-out-all-its-stock.1319419/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robot vacuums have evolved far beyond the basic “bump-and-spin” models that once dominated store shelves at budget prices. Roborock has firmly planted itself in the luxury segment of this market, where several of their flagship models now command $1,500 or more. These aren’t machines you can compare to the $200 to $400 entry-level options still available at big-box stores. The difference becomes obvious the moment you watch one work:<strong> genuine autonomy, intelligent navigation, and cleaning performance that replaces human effort</strong> rather than simply supplementing it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/">Saros 10R</a> embodies everything that separates premium robot vacuums from their cheaper cousins, handling everything from self-emptying to obstacle avoidance with sophistication that justifies its positioning. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/">Prime Big Deal Day has brought this model down to $1,199 from its standard $1,599 price</a>, and creates an all-time low that makes luxury-tier automated cleaning more accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Engineering Excellence That Cleans Deeper</h2>
<p>The Roborock Saros 10R’s 3.14-inch ultra-slim profile represents a fundamental design shift enabled by the StarSight Autonomous System 2.0, which eliminates the raised LiDAR dome that makes traditional robot vacuums too tall to fit under most furniture. This<strong> system uses 3D sensing technology to map your home with precision</strong>, even navigating under narrow-legged furniture and suspended cabinets where dust accumulates undisturbed for months in typical homes.</p>
<p>The VertiBeam lateral obstacle avoidance system illustrates the intelligence gap between this vacuum and low-end robots: It <strong>recognizes and avoids 108 distinct types of obstructions</strong>, including charging cables that would futilely entangle low-end models. It can also vacuum along cords without the need for you to prep your floors, and removes the ironic task that is cleaning before your new robotic vacuum can vacuum.</p>



<p>Cleaning power comes from <strong>22,000Pa HyperForce suction that pulls embedded dirt from carpet fibers</strong> and extracts debris from tile grout lines with equal effectiveness. The Zero-Tangling DuoDivide Main Brush solves the persistent problem of hair wrapping around rollers, a design that handles long human hair and pet fur without creating the tangled mess that forces you to manually cut away accumulated strands.</p>
<p>The <em>FlexiArm</em> riser technology introduces <strong>extendable side brushes and extendable mops</strong> that reach into the corners and edges, beyond the reach of the fixed-position tools that leave messes behind. As the robot senses the presence of a corner or edge, the arms extend automatically to sweep and mop the spaces that would have had to be done manually. This dynamic response closes the cleaning gaps that leave cheaper robots incomplete.</p>



<p>The <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis represents industry-first engineering that Roborock pioneered, and <strong>allows the robot to climb obstacles up to 4cm high</strong> including door thresholds and navigate around U-shaped furniture legs that trap conventional robots. When carpets are detected, the dual spinning mops and their bracket lift automatically to prevent soaking your rugs, then lower again on hard floors for mopping.</p>
<p>The dock 4.0 handles the unglamorous but essential maintenance tasks automatically: It washes mop pads with 176°F hot water that dissolves grease and sanitizes the fabric, then dries them with 131°F hot air to prevent mildew. The <strong>60-day automatic dust collection</strong> means you empty the dock’s collection bin roughly six times per year instead of after every cleaning session.</p>
<p>At the price of $1,199 for Prime Day on Amazon, you’re spending money on everyday convenience that is truly luxurious, although <strong>this Prime-member exclusive offer ends tonight</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The long wait for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> is nearly over, but that isn’t stopping fans from arguing about whether multiplayer is better with Open or Closed Weapon classes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and the four-company team at Battlefield Studios will let loose their new entry in the large-scale military shooter series this Friday, October 10, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-global-release-times-confirmed">find out when, exactly, here</a>). Along with a new campaign, guns, gadgets, and maps, the developers behind Battlefield 6 have told fans to look forward to a return to form following the disappointment that was Battlefield 2042.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beta and Battlefield Labs players have largely come away excited for what Battlefield 6 promises, but the debate surrounding Open and Closed Weapons is the main thing on fans’ minds just two days out from launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The conversation picked up when players went hands-on during the August Battlefield 6 beta tests. While many past Battlefield games feature Closed Weapons – a design decision that locks classes to a specific set of guns – many were surprised to see the new Battlefield game add and prioritize an option for Open Weapons, which largely removes gun restrictions between classes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Open style is similar to the system used in Battlefield 2042, but it’s not the bad taste in players’ mouths that has them bickering. Closed Weapons defenders argue these restrictions encourage players to not only think on their feet but also rely on teamwork, a key element for many longtime fans of the series. The system could also pour cold water on meta gameplay strategies that could result in an unbalanced number of players relying on one particularly powerful gun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those on the other side of the fence feel Open Weapons offer players of all skill levels more freedom to craft a loadout that fits their playstyles while rewarding those who choose specific loadouts. Though perhaps not quite as vocal, there are plenty of players who feel Open loadouts are the way to go – and BF Studios agrees.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield Studios Says Players Prefer Open Weapons</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Debate continued up to earlier this week, when BF Studios offered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-day-one-patch-includes-changes-to-movement-weapon-recoil-rush-and-more"><u>a pre-release breakdown for its Battlefield 6 launch day plans</u></a>, previewing the contents of its day one patch for those looking forward to in-game changes following post-beta feedback. It came hand-in-hand with confirmation that data pointed to “a vast majority of players” preferring the Open system more than the Closed system after trying both options between different playlists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This reinforces our belief that Open Weapons is the right path forward for Battlefield 6,” the message from BF Studios says. “At the same time, we recognize that some players prefer the Closed Weapons experience. To support them, official Closed Weapons playlists will be available at launch.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter how loud fans of the Closed method are, BF Studios is adamant that players mostly gravitate toward an Open system, even if Battlefield 6 will continue to support both options. Meanwhile, many have used this latest update only as fuel to continue their mission to see this week’s new Battlefield game shift its focus to the Closed system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Their argument revolves around the notion that open beta players only favored Open Weapons because relevant playlist options are the first to appear on the Battlefield 6 multiplayer menu screen. So, the idea is, if your average player, who is unfamiliar with the discourse, boots up the game, they’ll need to dig for a Closed option, resulting in skewed data.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a criticism many are leaning on that EA and BF Studios have already stepped in to stomp out. Lead Battlefield producer at DICE David Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1975264910285459695" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to X/Twitter</u></a> to explain how the team came to their conclusion. He addresses the argument that Closed playlist options were hidden from players, reminding displeased fans that playlist and mode tiles often moved around, and their data accounted for that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yes they moved around alot, as you may have noticed,” Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1975266470260273583" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said in response</u></a> to a fan asking for clarification. “We did this to all tiles, [Conquest] vs [Breakthrough] etc. See how much tile placement impact pick rates and how single mode vs playlist with multiple modes differed, etc.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sirland’s explanation still hasn’t quite quelled the uproar, as one third of the Battlefield 6 community demands more answers while another third is voicing their support for Open playlists more than ever. That final third mostly just wants the fighting to come to an end.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Brutal truth:</p><p>Casuals won’t care about Closed Weapons. Or Open Weapons. Or even what weapon they’re using most of the time.</p><p>They just wanna play Battlefield 👍 <a href="https://t.co/3x2CQYxgXl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/3x2CQYxgXl</a></p></div>— Westie (@MrProWestie) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrProWestie/status/1975283650351800824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2">Preparing for Launch</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As BF Studios and EA barrel toward the launch of Battlefield 6, disgruntled fans continue to take to comment sections across social media to ask the developers to give Closed playlists more time in the spotlight. Complaints and memes poking fun at the situation have flooded Reddit, in particular, with many replies from users calling out debaters as simply being a vocal minority.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would be surprised if the open vs closed weapon debate represents more than 10% of players,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nztemf/comment/ni4jbd3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>popular comment said</u></a>. “I think 10% is being very generous lol,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nztemf/comment/ni4qvr5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Battlefield 6, Open vs Closed <a href="https://t.co/hffyEz2npw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/hffyEz2npw</a></p>— IT'S REAL.

At the time, senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson said the team didn’t want to “make a decision or really pigeonhole” how players experience Battlefield 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it’s ongoing, and I think it’ll continually evolve, but again, from a design side, we don’t want to make a decision for the player base at the end of the day,” Nickerson added. “We want to support both moving forward, and again, a key mantra for Battlefield 6 is, ‘Play Battlefield how you want to,’ so we’re making sure we support both open and closed systems. We just don’t want to make the decision for the player.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear if EA and BF Studios have any plans to address the Open vs. Closed Weapons debate further ahead of the launch of Battlefield 6. With the recent acknowledgment reaffirming its commitment to the Open system while reassuring players that Closed options will remain available, it seems unlikely BF Studios will change course anytime soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on our time with the Battlefield 6 beta, we’ve got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/Battlefield_6_Beta_Beginner%27s_Guide_and_Tips">BF6 Beginner’s Guide and Tips</a>, plus the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/Best_BF6_Loadouts">best Battlefield 6 Loadouts</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/BF6_Range_Finder_Explained">how to use the Range Finder</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/How_to_Deploy_Bipod">deploy the Bipod</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/How_to_Turn_Off_Haptic_Feedback">how to turn off Haptic Feedback in Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

<p>Sales launch in just under a week, with LRG offering up both a standard edition and a collector's edition, known officially as the 'Full Force Edition'.</p>
<p>The big boy comes with several added extras, including:</p>
<ul>

<p>Of course, all of these goodies do ramp up the price slightly, so you're looking at $79.99 for the Full Force Edition. The standard, meanwhile, is a bit more forgiving at $39.99. Limited Run Games has also clarified that this won't be a numbered release, so if you're looking for a full LRG set, missing out on this one won't be the end of the world.</p>
<p>Now let's check out a brief summary of the game itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"R-Type Delta HD Boosted features high-resolution graphics that hone the polygonal edges of this PlayStation masterpiece until they’re sharp enough to cut glass. You simply haven’t experienced R-Type Delta until you've played it in high definition. This version of the game also comes equipped with a new Practice Mode for those of you who want to polish your skills until they are as sharp as the resolution itself!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>R-Type Delta: HD Boosted will be available digitally on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-long-to-beat-digimon-story-time-stranger-game-length-explained.1319404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger is an action-packed adventure through time and space, with plenty to offer, but as it lands in a period stacked of new releases, questions about the game length are understandable.</p>



<p>With hundreds of Digimon to collect, a gripping story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and plenty of optional content to explore, prepare to sink many hours into Time Stranger.</p>



<p>For a full breakdown of exactly how many hours you can expect to put into Digimon Story: Time Stranger, for both a generic run and a completionist run, you’ll find all the details in our game length guide here.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-digimon-story-time-stranger">How Many Hours to Beat Digimon Story: Time Stranger?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to do. Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It will take around 40 hours to complete the main story of Digimon Story: Time Stranger, though that time is extended by side quests and difficulty level.</strong></p>



<p>Time Stranger features a host of side-quests to tick off, which add hours to the duration of the game, and it will take even longer if you want to tackle the longer side quests, like defeating all of the opponents in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-paradise-colosseum-great-omni-carnival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradise Colosseum</a>.</p>



<p>The length of the game also depends on the difficulty setting you’re playing on, and whether you can defeat bosses in a single attempt or need to retry several times. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-digimon-story-time-stranger-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Digimon Story: Time Stranger Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>A full completionist run in Digimon Story: Time Stranger will take an additional 100 hours on top of the main story.</strong></p>



<p>This is due to the vast number of tasks that need to be ticked off to boast 100% completion, including obtaining all Digimon, collecting all Digimon Cards, and defeating opponents in the Paradise Colosseum.</p>



<p>There are a whopping 471 Digimon in the game, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-dlc-season-pass-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more to be added in DLC</a>, and 451 cards to collect. Along the way, there’s also a hefty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-achievements-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">list of achievements and trophies</a> to earn.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, side quests can take a significant amount of time on their own, especially completing the Colosseum. With some battles only unlocking once specific requirements are met, this pumps up the required amount of time to play by a large amount.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FIFA 23, the last FIFA game by EA, will shut down its servers on October 30, 2025. </p>



<p>For those who don’t know, the agreement with Electronic Arts and FIFA came to an end a couple of years ago, with the former <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-officially-unveils-ea-sports-fc-to-replace-fifa-soccer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiling</a> EA Sports FC to replace the franchise. The EA FC series began after FIFA 23, making that the last FIFA game that EA created. </p>



<h2 id="h-fifa-23-servers-are-shutting-down-on-october-30">FIFA 23 Servers Are Shutting Down on October 30 </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/ea-sports-fifa-era-is-officially-coming-to-an-end-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FGZ</a>, confirmation that FIFA 23 will shut down its servers was announced on the EA Service Updates <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/legal/service-updates/a-h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page</a>. If you scroll down to ‘F’, the new update states that online services will no longer be available for Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5. Players will still be able to play the game offline; however, no online updates, online co-op, Ultimate Team, Pro Clubs, or any other online features will be available to the player. </p>



<p>The era for new EA FIFA games had already ended when the deal between the two parties ended. However, players now have a few days left to play the last EA FIFA game online, until the next one becomes available. Regarding the next one, 2K Games could potentially be developing the next mainline FIFA video game. EA has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-developers-arent-afraid-of-potential-fifa-2k-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that even if the rumors are true, they welcome the competition and “know how tough it is to make a football game.”</p>



<p>In other news, the first new FIFA game after the breakup with EA has officially been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-new-fifa-game-post-ea-breakup-announced-and-its-not-what-players-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>, and it’s not the game fans likely expected. Additionally, read about Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-addresses-rumors-surround-fifa-and-2k-sports/">addressing the rumors</a> surrounding a possible partnership between FIFA and 2K Sports. What are your thoughts on FIFA 23 shutting down its servers this month? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

<figure data-uuid="72fca9445ef7b"><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/72fca9445ef7b/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure><p>We had a blast with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> when it arrived on Switch and Switch 2 earlier this summer, but we can all agree that it was missing something, right? Something like, we don't know, bingo?</p>
<p>Well, Marvelous has answered the call and has added exactly that in the new ver. 1.1.0 update. Yes, 'Happy Bingo' is the big addition this time around, giving you the daily chance to fill out an activity card and win a prize. You'll need to have reached 'City Bazaar Rank' or higher to unlock the new mode, but with that out of the way, it's bingo a-go-go.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ylLGp-DIVlY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed601436npowhk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Here's a little more information about the new mode from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2508780/view/499459531596630810">Steam game page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you’ve updated the game and reached “City Bazaar Rank,” the Nature Sprites will visit during an event cut scene introducing “Happy Bingo.” Each spot on the card features an everyday activity like fishing or petting animals. Players complete these activities to fill spots on their card until they’ve completed a Happy Bingo! Players then turn in completed cards at the Nature Sprites’ stall, Happy Shoppe, on bazaar days to earn a variety of useful items.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it's not just bingo, either. Marvelous has thrown a handful of other fixes and tweaks into this update, all of which were shared in an update post on Steam. We've collected these patch notes together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Ver. 1.1.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bingo features added<br></li>
<li>Fixed issue resulting in a rare game crash<br></li>
<li>Fixed issue where dismounting from horse would reset bag color to default outfit settings<br></li>
<li>Fixed issue where pet food bowl would stop functioning properly after rehoming a pet<br></li>
<li>Adjusted select BGM and sound effect volume<br></li>
<li>Other minor bug fixes</li>
<li>Addressed Unity security vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>While we had a few small issues with the fishing and sheer number of gameplay systems, we called Grand Bazaar "a fantastic reinvention filled with smart choices and heartfelt polish" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 8/10 review</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baby-steps-isnt-about-humiliation-but-the-joy-of-disobedient-flesh">Falling over is the thing</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>. Sure, the goal in Bennett Foddy and co's walking sim is technically getting from A to B despite your doughy corpus' best efforts to get in the way, but it's the constant stumbling and hilarious unintended pratfalls which make these sorts of games really sing. You get plenty of that playing alone, but for those who want to take things to the next level, Baby Steps has a multiplayer mod that'll let you slap against your mates and gently bump their mushy forms off course.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/babysteps/mods/1?tab=description">Baby Steps multiplayer mod</a> by Caleb Orchard has only just hit Nexus Mods, it's already been through several early iterations on <a href="https://github.com/caleborchard/Baby-Steps-Multiplayer-Mod-Client">GitHub</a> and even <a href="https://x.com/bfod/status/1971393914574962710">gotten the approval of Foddy himself</a>.</p>
<p>With it installed, rather than taking on the life of a failson with misbehaving limbs alone, you and a gang of others can run around in a range of different coloured onesies. Your gang of badly coordinated Teletubbies can collide with each other if you enable that setting and as you can see in the video below, the result is the possibility to send someone skidding down a cliff or flying off a ledge with a single well-timed nudge.</p>

<p>Since recording that video, Orchard looks to have worked out how to ensure cutscenes trigger independently for each player's instance of the game, as well as ensuring hats and held items don't only show up for the host.The current version, <a href="https://github.com/caleborchard/Baby-Steps-Multiplayer-Mod-Client/releases/tag/1.1.2">1.1.2</a>, has also been through a couple of rounds of bugfixing since its initial 1.0 release last month, meaning it should hopefully be stable and relatively free from the sort of frustrating jank which could impede the intended fun jank.</p><p>As of writing, the modder is working on adding the likes of "dynamic suit muddying and wetness", water/dust particles, and "player sound effects" - which I assume'll be suitably goofy - to an equation which already seems a brilliant recipe for mischief and the occasional ruined friendship.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving that kind of action a go, you'll need to grab the <a href="https://melonwiki.xyz/#/">MelonLoader</a> framework and follow the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvQRWCoEZUk">handy installation tutorial</a> Orchard's put together. For more thoughts on Baby Steps, I direct you to Nic, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baby-steps-isnt-twitch-slop-you-have-simply-let-your-sense-of-wonder-atrophy">reckons Irish comic Dara Ó Briain would dig it</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-offloads-its-old-t7-external-ssds-now-selling-for-pennies-on-the-dollar-at-amazon.1319383/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>External storage needs have exploded as file sizes balloon with 4K video and high-resolution photos that exceed what internal drives can handle. Samsung recently launched their T9 portable SSDs with improved durability features but the performance gap compared to the T7 is minimal for most users while the price difference is substantial.</p>
<p>That makes the T7 SSD the smarter choice for anyone prioritizing value without sacrificing speed or capacity. Prime Big Deal Day<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/"> has pushed the 2TB Samsung T7 down to $129 from its usual $187 price, which marks an all-time low</a> that makes premium portable storage genuinely affordable. This <strong>Prime-exclusive offer</strong> expires tonight, giving members just hours to grab what remains the most popular external SSD on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>True Speed and Capacity that Matter</h2>
<p>The Samsung T7 PCIe NVMe technology<strong> can read at up to 1,050 MB/s, and write at up to 1,000 MB/s</strong>, translating to transferring a 50GB video project in just under a minute. Compare that with slower external hard drives plodding along at 120 MB/s and you know why creatives have left spinning platters behind. It makes <strong>the T7 roughly twice as fast as Samsung’s own previous T5</strong>, which is a significant leap that affects your workflow every time you transfer large files.</p>



<p>The 2TB size is just the sweet spot for the average user and offers enough storage room for full-scale libraries of videos, massive collections of photographs or complete sets of computer games without requiring frequent housekeeping. With 2TB, you never have the hassle of rotating files around or determining which ones need deleting as new material arrives. Samsung sells the T7 in capacities as high as 4TB, but the 2TB is the best-value-per-gigabyte at current price points.</p>
<p><strong>Built-in direct video recording abilities</strong> turn the T7 from just storage into a production device: Plug it into compatible cameras or smartphones and capture Ultra High Definition 4K video at 60 frames per second directly to the drive. You can use the iPhone 17 Pro’s ProRes video mode to shoot directly onto the T7 and <strong>skip the phone’s small internal storage</strong> and allowing you to capture multiple hours of professional quality video without clogging up your phone.</p>



<p>The T7’s solid aluminum unibody construction provides <strong>shock resistance with drop protection tested up to 6 feet</strong>. This metal chassis serves double duty by acting as a heatsink that dissipates the heat generated during sustained high-speed transfers, preventing thermal throttling that could slow performance. The compact design measures roughly the size of a credit card and weighs just 0,13lbs/58 grams.</p>
<p>Universal compatibility eliminates the typical hassles of formatting drives for other systems: The <strong>T7 is compatible with Windows PCs, Macs, Android smartphones, and gaming consoles</strong> via the USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface without a hitch. Samsung ships the drive with both the USB-C to C and the USB-C to A cable, providing the capability of plugging into both new and old devices without scrambling for adapters. The drive comes<strong> shipped in the exFAT format</strong>, which is read-compatible on virtually all contemporary operating systems without reformating.</p>
<p>At a price of $129 in the 2TB version, you pay approximately 6 cents per gigbyte on storage that reads the data at almost ten times the speed that the mechanical drives read the data. Keep in mind, this Prime Big Deal Day price ends tonight.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is getting a free trial for an entire week, starting 9th October. This free trial for last year's Call of Duty will provide access to the campaign, multiplayer, and zombies game modes - so interested players can play everything Blops currently has to offer.</p>
<p>This on its own would be some nice news for those looking for something to do during this month but with little money in their pocket right now, but an extra interesting layer to this free trial is that it's taking place during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> release.</p>
<p>If this timing is intentional, it would mark the first case of marketing retaliation from Activision in the ongoing public scuffle between the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> and Battlefield 6. This scuffle started during the Battlefield 6 Multiplayer reveal, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">where the developers at Battlefield Studios weren't shy about their intentions to stick to sensible military cosmetics, rather than the gaudy out-of-universe skins available in CoD</a>.</p>

<p>Following this discussion about wacky cosmetics' prevalence in Call of Duty entering the zeitgeist, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-dutys-u-turn-on-absurd-cosmetics-is-proof-that-battlefield-6-competition-is-a-really-good-thing">Activision soon announced its intention to pull back a bit from its cosmetic approach in Black Ops 7</a>.</p>
<p>Even so, EA continued to push this messaging in advertisements, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-live-action-trailer-is-its-biggest-jab-at-call-of-duty-yet-makes-a-point-out-of-blowing-up-zac-efron">bringing in celebrities to star in a recent Battlefield 6 live-action trailer in reference to Call of Duty's history of selling real-world figures as in-game skins</a>. The trailer soon blows these celebrities up, with a squad of typical looking soldiers taking their place.</p><p>So the clash over public opinion has been rather one-sided so far, but dropping Black Ops 6 for free during the Battlefield 6 release date is a pretty solid way to strike back, especially given the fact that Black Ops 6 is at the tail end of its lifespan with Black Ops 7 set to launch next month.</p>
<p>For those who do decide to hop into Black Ops 6 during this free week, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-06#Events">they'll be met with a collection of Halloween-themed events and cosmetics</a> to get them into the festive mood. These will transfer over to Warzone but not to Black Ops 7 as part of that aforementioned decision to keep things visually coherent in the new game, so keep that in mind.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/turn-based-crpg-starfinder-afterlight-reaches-minimum-kickstarter-goal-in-80-minutes.1319371/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Indie Barcelona-based developer Epictellers Entertainment announced that its turn-based cRPG Starfinder: Afterlight met and exceeded the minimum funding goal <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight/description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Kickstarter</a> just eighty minutes after the campaign opened.</p>



<p>For the record, the minimum goal was €75K, but supporters have already pushed the campaign to around €280K as we speak. With 29 days left on the campaign, it's fair to imagine the developers will be able to get a far greater amount of funding when all is said and done.</p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight is based on Paizo's eponymous science fantasy setting originally introduced in 2017. Players can look forward to a party-based RPG where they will lead a legendary crew, shape their destiny with choices and, most importantly, save the galaxy. It has been described as Divinity: Original Sin meets Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>



<p>The premise is that the ship's captain has vanished just as the galaxy is facing annihilation. Players must then assemble a crew of misfits from across the stars. There are six unique companions, from android assassins to mystic prophets, each with personal stories and moral dilemmas. </p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight adapts the tabletop RPG's second edition and includes the following classes: soldier, envoy, operative, mystic, solarian, and witchwarper. Being a roleplaying game, leveling up and collecting alien gear to become more powerful will be the key.</p>



<p>Epictellers stressed that no choice is forbidden, yet everything has consequences. Factions will remember the crew's deeds, and the companions will judge the player's heart. Branching storylines ensure that no two adventures are alike.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Throughout the 40-60 hours of adventure, players will get to explore neon stations, undead worlds, digital gods, and cosmic dragons. The game features multiple difficulty settings (from a story mode to Nightmare), mod support, and community tools on PC, and a voice cast directed by Neil Newbon (who won multiple awards for his performance as Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3).</p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight is currently targeting a Q2 2026 launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3245640/Starfinder_Afterlight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>. At that point, the game will feature Act 1 with around 10-15 hours of gameplay. The full release is loosely estimated to happen in 2027.</p>

              <p>Building (or upgrading) a gaming PC means making smart choices about where to invest your budget and the processor sits at the heart of everything. AMD’s Ryzen 7 9700X occupies that sweet spot in their lineup where you get serious performance without crossing into extreme enthusiast territory. This 8-core chip from the latest Zen 5 architecture delivers the processing muscle needed for modern gaming and content creation while staying within reach for most builders. Right now, Prime members <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4607/">can grab this processor for just $250 instead of its usual $359 price</a>, but there’s a catch: <strong>this Prime Big Deal Day offer expires tonight</strong>, which makes this your last chance to secure an all-time low on <strong>one of AMD’s newest desktop chips</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4607/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Perfect for Gaming</h2>
<p>The <strong>Ryzen 7 9700X packs 8 cores and 16 threads into your system</strong>, a setup that is no stranger to multitasking and still capable of providing the single-threaded performance that games require. That <strong>5.5 GHz maximum boost frequency means the CPU can increase speed when needed,</strong> accelerating frames in fast-paced games where milliseconds matter. AMD says this part can produce <strong>over 100 FPS in mainstream games</strong> which is supported by the Zen 5 design’s gains in instructions per clock cycle over the previous gen.</p>



<p>The unlockable multiplier gives enthusiasts freedom to <strong>further tune performance through overclocking</strong>. In this manner, you can increase the clock speed beyond the factory level if you have enough cooling, wringing out additional performance from the chip for work that benefits from sheer frequency. The <strong>combined 40 MB cache appears as ultra-fast memory on the very processor die</strong>, and reduces the time that the CPU is sitting idle waiting on data from the system RAM. This amount of cache is key to gaming, as the CPU is always reaching into the texture data, the logic of the game, and the asset files.</p>
<p>DDR5-5600 future-proofs your build by providing support for the newest memory standard. DDR5 has a greater bandwidth compared to DDR4 which translates into more data being transferred between your RAM and CPU per second. It pays dividends on everything from loading times in games through to video rendering, where large data sets require endless shuffling.</p>



<p>Socket AM5 compatibility matters because AMD has committed to supporting this platform through future processor generations. This means you can upgrade to <strong>newer Ryzen chips down the road without replacing your motherboard</strong>, and protect your investment in the platform. The processor <strong>supports PCIe 5.0 on compatible motherboards</strong>, doubling the bandwidth available for graphics cards and NVMe SSDs compared to PCIe 4.0.</p>
<p>The Ryzen 7 9700X is AMD’s mainstream performance option among the Ryzen 7 offerings: It is under the high-core-count offerings like the 9900X and 9950X that target content creators and professionals but over the budget-friendly Ryzen 5 chips that have 6 cores. Where that places the 9700X is in the sweet spot between gamers who want excellent frame rates and have enough oomph left over for streaming or side work like editing video.</p>
<p>Over 2,000 units have been sold in the past thirty days, and <strong>a score of 4.8 stars through virtually 1,500 reviews</strong>, buyers absolutely love what their new CPU is bringing home. You’re saving $109 off the regular price when you pay just $250, but remember that t<strong>his deal ends when the special Prime Big Deal Day ends tonight</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage limitations can kill productivity faster than almost anything else in the digital age. Running out of space means constant file juggling, deleted projects you might need later and that dreaded warning message interrupting your workflow at the worst possible moment.</p>
<p>This is where a high-capacity internal SSD becomes essential and today is your final chance to grab an exceptional deal: <strong>Prime Big Deal Day ends tonight</strong>, and Prime members can <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4606/">get the Samsung 990 Evo Plus SSD with a massive 4TB capacity for just $199, down from its regular $327 price</a>. This all-time low represents a serious opportunity to supercharge your PC or laptop with professional-grade storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4606/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Drive Transforms Your PC Experience</h2>
<p>The Samsung 990 Evo Plus brings performance that really changes the way you work with massive files and intensive apps. It <strong>reads sequentially at up to 7,250 MB/s and writes at up to 6,300 MB/s</strong>, figures that equate to real-world performance gains you can appreciate today. <strong>Moving a 50GB video project that can take a few minutes on a hard drive takes just seconds here</strong>.</p>
<p>Those data-transfer rates derive from Samsung’s latest-generation NAND memory technology which is the pinnacle of storage chip engineering. On the interface side, the drive is compatible with <strong>both the PCIe 4.0 x4 and the PCIe 5.0 x2 interface</strong> which translates into the drive auto-adapting to the capability of the motherboard and always providing optimum bandwidth no matter what gen the system is compatible with.</p>



<p>The 4TB capacity resolves the storage bottleneck that creative professionals and power users experience on a regular basis. Today’s game installs easily surpass 100GB, and the 4K video files and high-def photo libraries devour terabytes before you know it. This much storage on one drive obviates the need for external storage wrangling or the maintenance of multiple small drives. Samsung’s Intelligent Turbowrite 2.0 technology streamlines the way the drive approaches large file operations by providing a high-performance buffer that boosts write speed under high-workload conditions.</p>



<p>Thermal management is what distinguishes quality SSDs from the ones that throttle performance when they get hot: The 990 Evo Plus employs a nickel-coated efficiency-specific controller that enables <strong>the drive to reach optimal speed without consuming more power than the earlier generations</strong>. This is crucially important to laptop users whose battery life is critical, as well as desktop builders whoseheat build-up can cause system instability.</p>
<p>Samsung includes with every shipment their <em>Magician Software</em> suite which contains utilities that keep your SSD in top form long after installation. Drive health is monitored through tracking lifetime left and durability-based performance metrics, giving warnings before data loss is possible. Firmware updates also arrive automatically through Magician, ensuring that your drive benefits from Samsung’s newest developments and security patches. More still, the software contains further encryption utilities for safeguarding vital data as well as performance optimization tools that tailor the interaction between the drive and the OS.</p>
<p>More than 9,000 units have been sold in the last month alone and, <strong>following a 4.8-star rating through more than 7,000 reviews</strong>, the 990 Evo Plus has firmly secured itself among intensive users. At $199 per 4TB, you’re <strong>getting approximately 5 cents per gig</strong>, which is brilliant value for such performance. Note that this Prime-member deal is gone after tonight when the Prime Big Deal Day ends, so the price window is very small.</p>

<p>Excitement levels for the Fortnitemares event in Fortnite continue to rise, and further teasers have been shared by Epic Games showing the big collabs fans can expect.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s annual Halloween event has become a fan-favorite, with previous years including collabs with Saw, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, among others, and Epic Games is going big again.</p>



<p>The event, which is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-fortnitemares-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to kick off this week</a>, is yet to have full official details shared, but we know have confirmation of three major collabs.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnitemares-collabs-2025">Fortnitemares Collabs 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Peely-good collabs. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Official teasers were <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1975685374996312433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on Reddit</a> by the Fortnite team, showcasing promo art featuring Ghostface, Scooby-Doo, and R.E.P.O alongside recognisable Fortnite characters and items.</p>



<p>The Scooby-Doo Mystery Crew are depicted surrounded by thorns, likely a nod towards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doja-cat-is-coming-to-fortnite-as-fortnitemares-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doja Cat’s Mother of Thorns skin</a>, alongside a terrified Loot Llama, while Ghostface was shown with the reflection of a terrified Peely on his knife.</p>



<p>Finally, characters from R.E.P.O were shown with long arms and legs in order to fit the Fortnite style, a terrifying look in itself, running away from a zombie.</p>



<p>The build-up to Fortnitemares has already seen the return of several horror-themed outfits to the Item Shop, including Ash Williams, Leatherface, and there’s still more expected to be revealed in the coming days, including a Terrifier collab.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether any skins will be available for free through the event or if they are merely appearing in the Item Shop for purchase.</p>



<p>Usually, Fortnite makes some cosmetic items available to earn for free during Fortnitemares, although last year’s content did not include any free outfits.</p>



<p>What collabs do you want to see in Fortnitemares? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>The recent price hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate won't affect existing subscribers in some countries, Microsoft has confirmed.</p>
<p>Last week, the price of the top tier subscription went up by 50 percent, and has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-xbox-game-pass-price-hike-is-it-time-to-cancel-and-start-buying-games-again">met by criticism</a>. But in some countries, this will only impact new subscribers - at least "for now".</p>
<p>"At this time, these increases will only affect new purchases and will not affect your current subscription for the market in which you reside, as long as you are on an auto-recurring plan," reads an email from Microsoft sent to subscribers in some regions. "Should you choose to cancel your plan and repurchase, you will be charged at the new current rate."</p>

<figcaption>Is Xbox Game Pass still worth it?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJgWIx5dfT4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Microsoft has further confirmed this in a statement to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/794032/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-changes-countries">The Verge</a>.</p>
<p>"Our recent Game Pass update remains unchanged. Current subscribers in certain countries will continue renewing at their existing price for now, in line with local requirements. We'll provide advance notice before price adjustments take effect in these countries," says Kari Perez, head of Xbox communications</p>
<p>The countries unaffected by the price increase include Germany, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Poland, and India. The US and UK are not included.</p>
<p>It's been speculated this change is due to local regulation on subscription price changes. The email from Microsoft notes subscribers will be notified "at least 60 days in advance" of any price changes - so at the least, this latest increase won't take effect for another two months.</p>
<p>Last week,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year"> Microsoft announced the price increase of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> amid a shake up of its subscription tiers. This comes despite the company making record revenue from subscriptions last year.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-a-result-of-microsoft-becoming-too-big-to-care-says-former-ftc-chair">former chair of the FTC</a>, who opposed Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, claimed the Game Pass price increase is due to Microsoft becoming "too-big-to-care".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With only two days left before Battlefield 6's official launch, the developers <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1975637378636144955" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have shared</a> the full, detailed PC system requirements, ranging from Minimum to Ultra++.</p>



<p>As with all Battlefield games since 2008's Bad Company, Battlefield 6 is powered by DICE's own Frostbite engine. However, this time around, the development teams collectively known as Battlefield Studios (DICE, Ripple Effect, Motive, and Criterion) <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-ditched-ray-tracing-focus-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have explicitly focused on maximizing performance rather than, for instance, adding fancy visual features like ray tracing</a>.</p>



<p>Indeed, according to the developers, Battlefield 6 won't even need any upscalers before the Ultra++ preset, where they recommended using NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution to get 4K@144 frames per second at High Settings, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-in-battlefield-6-lost-soul-aside-eve-online-will-be-added-in-sword-of-justice-wuthering-waves-starship-troopers-extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multi Frame Generation is needed</a> to achieve 4K@240 frames per second at Ultra Settings. That's on a GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card; notably, no AMD equivalent is listed for the Ultra++ preset.</p>

            <p>As someone from the north east of England, there's a good chance my genetic makeup's some mix of old school celt and one of the many Scandinavian invaders who sailed across looking to conquer back in a time when blokes called Cnut roamed northern Europe. I offer that background in case it helps you understand why, even though I'm not part t-rex as far as I know, the premise of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dinolords">Dinolords</a> very much gets my blood pumping.</p>
<p>It's a hybrid of medieval strategy and action RPG which injects rideable t-rexes into a war between the Danes and the English, and a closed alpha test of it starts on October 31st, ahead of an early access release next year.</p>

<p>For those who gain entry, this alpha'll start with a three-part tutorial to get you up to speed with the game's funky mix of medival siege tactics and dino action. Then, four maps and two game modes will open up to offer a proper taste and test what developers Northplay call your "hack’n’strat skills". There's also the chance to have a crack at setting up a stronghold to try out the likes of base building, combat strategy, and unit control before you get the siege engines rolling.</p><p>"Dinolords is our chance to bring a unique blend of genres to players, and with the Closed Alpha Test, give them a taste of what to expect when the Early Access release launches next year," said Northplay boss Michael Flarup. "We are excited to hear what our player base thinks of the game and look forward to the feedback received to help shape Dinolords into the best possible title it can be." As such, there'll be a questionnaire to fill out in the name of feedback.</p>
<p>If you want an idea of what Dinolords is like to play beyond the quirky premise, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/t-rexes-arent-the-only-twist-that-dinolords-puts-on-medieval-strategy">James was intrigued by what he saw of it at Gamescom last year</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Enemy raptors can also scale the walls of your town, munching on archers as they go, while Danish T-rexes are apparently bred to specialise in destroying static defences. They’re not just here for laughs, in other words: each dino breed presents a distinct tactical challenge that you’ll need to plan for and counter in different ways, and while your lord is strong, he’s also not quite enough of a Diablo-tier godkiller that you can ignore your more traditionally RTS-y units.</blockquote>
<p>Sign-ups for Dinolords' closed alpha kick off today, October 8th, via the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2587620/Dinolords/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/for-the-closing-hours-of-prime-day-amazon-sells-pokemon-card-packs-for-just-0-10.1319344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Building a Pokemon card collection doesn’t have to drain your wallet and right now might be the perfect time to jump in: The trading card craze has sparked fresh enthusiasm across all generations, from kids discovering these iconic creatures for the first time to adults rekindling their childhood passion. <strong>Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Day</strong> is wrapping up today, and there’s a standout offer that everyone can grab, Prime member or not: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/">this assorted lot of 50 Pokemon cards has dropped to just $5, down from its usual $10 price tag</a>. It’s an all-time low that makes expanding your collection incredibly affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This collection ships exactly as collectors require without the hassle of searching outlets individually at high-end premium prices. You <strong>receive 50 randomly selected cards taken from the entirety of the Pokemon universe</strong>, <strong>covering every series issued</strong>. You get regular character cards as well as energy cards, which provides usable items suitable for actual play as well as collectibles that fans love.</p>
<p><strong>Duplicates will be found in the randomized sets</strong>, but that is part of the trade that collectors appreciate as they trade the excess with buddies or utilize them towards completing certain deck layouts.</p>
<h2>What Makes This Collection Pack Worth Getting</h2>
<p>The true value here is beyond the rock-bottom price: Each lot is like a surprise package as the cards include random series which can have <strong>anything ranging from vintage Base Set designs to recent releases</strong>. Randomization is something that works favorably in the case of <strong>new collectors</strong> establishing a good base without the need to have encyclopedic information on sets that need to be targeted. For parents introducing children to the concept, it is an affordable method of giving enough cards towards building multiple decks and testing out varied strategies.</p>



<p>The 50-card quantity is just the right size for collection expansion: It’s high enough that it is something significant that you can feel like you’ve accomplished something without being too overwhelming that new collectors don’t know quite what to do with them. Advanced collectors will pick these lots up just as a way to fill missing cards they have from past-generation sets or fill out common cards, which are often needed as part of building out a tournament-legal deck. Because the sets span all generations, you’re handling the initial 151 creatures through the latest expansion sets that include recent release games.</p>
<p>At $5 for Prime Day, <strong>you’re getting roughly 10 cents per card</strong>, which seriously undercuts what you would pay buying single cards or even regular booster packs at retail stores. Because today is the final day that the Prime Big Deal Day concludes, these prices will not last.</p>

The freebie is called the Cardboard Hero Bundle, and it includes 1,000 shiny rocks as well as the Handiwork Helmet and Armor. If you've never subscribed to Meta Horizon+, you'll also get three free months of the Game Pass-esque service. In addition to granting access to a rotating library of games, subscribers get two free games each month, and you get to keep them even if you cancel your subscription.</p><p>The Quest 3S is a lightweight, standalone VR headset that comes with two wireless Touch Plus controllers. It's strong enough to play a wide range of impressive VR games directly on the headset's internal hardware, including showpiece titles like Batman: Arkham Shadow, Asgard's Wrath 2, and Assassin's Creed Nexus. For VR games like Half Life: Alyx that are beyond its built-in capabilities, the Quest 3S can be synced to wirelessly to a gaming PC or with a compatible link cable. You can also cloud stream games and use the headset as a wearable projector to watch movies and TV shows.</p><p>Meta's entry-level VR headset is a modified version of the more powerful and expensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CD1JTBSC?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Quest 3</a>. Both models have 8GB RAM and use the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chipset, which is a noticeable leap forward from the Quest 2. Outside of storage differences--the Quest 3 has 512GB--the internals are the same. Both versions come bundled with the wireless Touch Plus controllers, too. The Quest 3 has more advanced lenses, which results in a larger, clearer image. That said, the Quest 3S still looks great and can play the same games, and it even has slightly better battery life (2.5 hours).</p><p>With this deal, you're getting the Quest 3S 128GB model for half the price of the $499 Quest 3.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Meta Quest 3S 256GB - Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$329 (was $400)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>For $70 more you can double your storage to 256GB and get Batman: Arkham Shadow, a $50 game that's exclusive to the Quest 3 family.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-platforms/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-powerwash-simulator-2-coming-to-switch-1-playstation-4-and-xbox-one-all-platforms-explained.1319311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 is a highly anticipated sequel to a game that is truly relaxing and rewarding to play, but will it be as easily accessible as the original?</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-explained-exact-start-times-and-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The game is set to release</a> just a couple of short weeks following a trailer announcing when to expect it, so now is the best time to figure out if you’ll be able to play it.</p>



<p>If you are still stuck on the Nintendo Switch 1, PlayStation 4, or Xbox One, here are all of the platforms that PowerWash Simulator 2 will release on.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-powerwash-simulator-2-coming-to">What Platforms is PowerWash Simulator 2 Coming To?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Futurlab</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>PowerWash Simulator 2 is only releasing on Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It will not be available on the original Nintendo Switch 1, PlayStation 4, or Xbox One.</strong></p>



<p>While this may be disappointing to some players, it’s not necessarily the most surprising move. For starters, <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/games/powerwash-simulator-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Futurlab</a>, the development team for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-confirmed-for-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>, is an indie studio, and these days, they are self-publishing the game, where the original had Square Enix money backing it. We highly doubt that the team has been focused on developing their new game for the older consoles, instead focusing on making new features work on better hardware.</p>



<p>In 2025, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have been on the market for 12 years, and the Nintendo Switch has already hit eight years. As is the case with the passage of time, these consoles are very outdated these days, though they have lived very extended lives, with some games still being released on them.</p>



<p>Even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-is-sunsetting-some-playstation-4-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony is gearing up to start ending support of PlayStation 4 features</a>, so it’s not surprising that a game like PowerWash Simulator 2 hasn’t been developed with the older hardware in mind, even though it likely could be playable.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-powerwash-simulator-2-ever-come-to-nintendo-switch-1-playstation-4-or-xbox-one">Will PowerWash Simulator 2 Ever Come to Nintendo Switch 1, PlayStation 4, or Xbox One?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no official word as of now about the prospects of PowerWash Simulator 2 ever coming to Nintendo Switch 1, PlayStation 4, or Xbox One, but we would be very surprised if it ever happens.</strong></p>



<p>As stated above, especially in the case of the PS4 and Xbox One, this is older, weaker hardware that not many people want to develop for anymore. This is the kind of thing that happens to every console generation. Sooner or later, it just isn’t feasible to keep releasing games on it, though that isn’t particularly reassuring with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ftc-chair-shots-game-pass-price-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how much prices are going up in gaming lately</a>.</p>
