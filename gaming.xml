			<p>It's the first GFN Thursday of the month, and October is already shaping up to be in a good spot with the latest update. Those who utilize GeForce Now will be able to stream 22 new games this October once this update drops, with five of them being available to stream this week. Thus far, there are ten day-and-date releases slated for this month, including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, one of the most highly anticipated games of the month. NCSOFT's title, THRONE AND LIBERTY, was also released earlier this week, and the game is now accessible in the cloud. THRONE AND LIBERTY is a free-to-play MMORPG where players can explore the world of Solisium, with a class-free weapon-based combat system featuring massive-scale PvP and PvE battles, alongside transformation abilities that allow the player to turn into various creatures for tactical advantage.</p>
<p>For those who are just getting used to using GeForce NOW, this cloud service lets you stream the game from a top-end rig without your own hardware struggling under the pressure of the game. GeForce NOW is a subscription-based service where you can choose the features you want for your gaming sessions.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-hatred-rising-season-lets-loose-the-colossal-realmwalkers-on-sanctuary/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>So far, Blizzard has stayed quiet about the Diablo IV season which will go live alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-goes-live-october-8-heres-how-to-prepare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vessel of Hatred expansion</a>, but that has now changed with the unveiling of Hatred Rising on the latest<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk2oJC-yX4Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> pre-launch developer update live stream</a>.</p>
<p>The background story is that Mephisto's unbridled hatred has made manifest the Realmwalkers, colossal monsters that were so far just the subject of tavern tales. Upon spawning, Realmwalkers can threaten an entire region, spewing nightmares born of hatred from the portal fused into their bodies. Once charged, they will begin stalking the Region for sacred ground. Realmwalkers are invulnerable during this phase, but fearsome Bloodbound Guardians will rush to protect them during their wandering phase. Diablo IV players must kill them to remove chunks of the Realmwalker's health. When the Realmwalkers arrive at the ritual site, they'll slam into the ground, creating three Hatred Spires around him. Dismantle these quickly and make the Realmwalkers vulnerable before they gain too much power.</p>
<p>Blizzard has shared the spawning schedule, too. A Realmwalker will spawn in a region every 15 minutes, alternating locations each time. Once every hour, a second Realmwalker will spawn in Nahantu (the region of Vessel of Hatred), in addition to spawning somewhere in Estuar. Moreover, the first Realmwalker spawned each hour in Estuar will be a Whisper. Every three hours, the Realmwalker spawned in Nahantu will be a Whisper.</p>
<p>Upon defeating a Realmwalker, Diablo IV players will have to go on the offensive, leaping into the portal to the so-called Seething Realm. These are dungeons filled with monsters to slay and treasures to claim. Players must go through the dungeon to find the Realm Gate. Once there, they'll be presented with a choice of materials to offer. Select the Seething Opal you wish to receive as a reward for the dungeon's completion.</p>
<p>A Seething Opal is a new type of elixir that provides a 15% experience boost and other bonuses for 30 minutes. There are a total of 5 Seething Opals:</p>
<p>Seething Opal of Equipment: 25 Murmuring Obols<br>
Swirling Opal of Materials: 5 Murmuring Obols<br>
Swirling Opal of Torment: 200 Sigil Powder<br>
Swirling Opal of Gold: 1 lump of iron<br>
Swirling Opal of Socketables: 3 Angel Breath</p>
<p>Note that the Seething Opal of Torment can only be obtained when playing on Torment Difficulty I or higher. Moreover, the Seething Opal of Socketables cannot be acquired unless you own the Vessel of Hatred expansion and play on Penitent Difficulty or higher in a Nahantu-based Seething Realm dungeon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV | Pre-launch Developer Update | October 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rk2oJC-yX4Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Hatred Rising season of Diablo IV introduces a new quest from the Zakarum Remnants. Players can visit Crusader Damond in Zarbinzet, Hawezar, to start the Creeping Hatred quest, where they'll learn how to annihilate Realmwalkers and harness the arcane power of the Seething Realms to acquire useful Seething Opals. To begin this quest, players must have either completed the final quest in the base game's campaign—Legacy of the Horadrim—or opted to skip the base game's main questline. The Zakarum Remnants are also tied to a new Reputation system. Defeating Realmwalkers will help you improve your Reputation with this faction to get useful rewards.</p>
<p>With any new Diablo IV season, there's also a season journey and Battle Pass. This one starts on October 7 at 4 PM Pacific Time and hosts 90 Reward Tiers (28 Free Tiers and 62 Premium Tiers). The Smoldering Ashes earned from the Free Tiers can be spent on Season Blessings, which provide helpful bonuses in fighting back the armies of Hell. There are three new Blessings for Season of Hatred Rising:</p>
<ul>
<li>Urn of Opals: Increases the chance of receiving an additional Seething Opal reward after completing a Seething Realm.</li>
<li>Urn of Remnants: Increase the rate at which you gain reputation from the Zakarum Remnant.</li>
<li>Urn of Curiosities: Increase the chance of receiving a second item when purchasing from the Purveyor of Curiosities.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>Getting the Premium Battle Pass will not only provide the rewards of the Free Tiers, but Soul Drinker’s Armor Set, Platinum, and more also await purchasers, including the Steed of Viz-Jun Present Mount, Curse of Viz-Jun Present Mount, and Ravenous Soul Mount Trophy, which unlocks at Tier 90. The Accelerated Seasonal Battle Pass also contains 20 Tier Skips and the Creeping Hollows Emote.</p>

The series has spanned over two dozen games and five timelines, but because the series is jumping between <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-nintendo-breath-of-the-wild-timeline-1851637896&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-nintendo-breath-of-the-wild-timeline-1851637896">its codified continuities</a></span>, the three Triforce bearers are some of the only constants throughout most of the games. So what about all the weirdos and allies Link meets on all his different journeys and in all his different forms? Most of them only last for one game, but even as fans have left them behind with each new entry, they’ve left a lasting impression. Here are some of our favorite <em>Zelda</em> side characters from over the years.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c26b7d1386b03b878f6272487505a5c5" data-recommend-id="image://c26b7d1386b03b878f6272487505a5c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1597" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anju and Kafei hug it out." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Anju and Kafei hug it out." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c26b7d1386b03b878f6272487505a5c5" data-recommend-id="image://c26b7d1386b03b878f6272487505a5c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1597" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anju and Kafei hug it out." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Anju and Kafei are so beloved because of how involved the player must be in their lives throughout <em>Majora’s Mask</em>. The couple was meant to be married before Kafei disappeared, after being turned into a child by the mischievous Skull Kid. You spend entire in-game days trying to bridge the gap between the two lovebirds while one is too embarrassed to be seen in his cursed form. This includes delivering messages between them, helping them rebuild a bridge, and leaving them with hope that the curse can be lifted. Through all your efforts, the two are reunited and the credits imply that the curse has been broken and Kafei has returned to his adult form. Sadly, we never actually see him as an adult, as their wedding is shown from Kafei’s first-person perspective, but he seems to be much taller. Link’s an excellent wingman. <br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="67d839c5e911589c6953ec4221de835d" data-recommend-id="image://67d839c5e911589c6953ec4221de835d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Midna in Super Smash Bros." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Midna in Super Smash Bros." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="67d839c5e911589c6953ec4221de835d" data-recommend-id="image://67d839c5e911589c6953ec4221de835d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Midna in Super Smash Bros." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Midna, the titular Twilight Princess, had some big shoes to fill as Link’s traveling companion after games like <em>Ocarina of Time </em>had solidified Navi as one of the most recognizable side characters in the series. At first, she is a sassy, demanding character who mostly accompanies Link as a means to accomplish her own goals. While she’s a manipulative opportunist for much of the early game, as Midna and Link grow closer throughout their journey, she’s unable to keep the facade up. Midna has a duty to herself and her people, but finds room in her heart for someone she originally viewed as just a tool to get her way. The gradual softening of her thorny exterior makes her one of the most rewarding characters to see through to the end.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c7fa4e22363d477b74af56602a0919cc" data-recommend-id="image://c7fa4e22363d477b74af56602a0919cc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2693" data-height="1514" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Link sails on the King of Red Lions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Link sails on the King of Red Lions." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c7fa4e22363d477b74af56602a0919cc" data-recommend-id="image://c7fa4e22363d477b74af56602a0919cc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2693" data-height="1514" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Link sails on the King of Red Lions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Mida and Navi are great, but easily Link’s best traveling companion over the years is the King of Red Lions. The dragon-like talking ship is intimately intertwined with every moment you spend in <em>Wind Waker</em>’s flooded version of Hyrule. He gets you where you need to go, provides meaningful commentary and perspective, and is a constant shoulder to lean on during the darkest times. His friendship with Link is the heart and soul of <em>Wind Waker</em>, but it grows into so much more, as it’s revealed that he is actually the long-lost king of Hyrule. He has watched his kingdom fall throughout <em>Wind Waker</em>, and though he’s haunted by its past, he does all he can,to help guide it to a better future. As an ally to Link, he is without peer. As a symbol of the cyclical nature of <em>Zelda</em> series seeking to free its heroes from the lives they’ve been forced to relive, he is a memorable figurehead within the franchise.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5673f1535bb360242593fd05db860ee3" data-recommend-id="image://5673f1535bb360242593fd05db860ee3" data-format="jpg" data-width="812" data-height="456" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groose points at Link." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Groose points at Link." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5673f1535bb360242593fd05db860ee3" data-recommend-id="image://5673f1535bb360242593fd05db860ee3" data-format="jpg" data-width="812" data-height="456" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groose points at Link." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Link’s rival in the Wii’s <em>Skyward Sword</em> is a delight. He gives big “dumb jock” energy in the game’s early hours, seemingly out of jealousy that Zelda fancies our hero more than him. But watching him go from a bully to a hero himself is one of the highlights of the divisive, motion-control-driven game. He’s a source of drama, levity, and humor, but he also has a lot of heart to go along with it. Groose makes a meh game better.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="05bb14e02c7f14793d53114b898f79ba" data-recommend-id="image://05bb14e02c7f14793d53114b898f79ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="850" data-height="478" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Champions take a group photo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Champions take a group photo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="05bb14e02c7f14793d53114b898f79ba" data-recommend-id="image://05bb14e02c7f14793d53114b898f79ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="850" data-height="478" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Champions take a group photo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Every time you learn about the Champions in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, it feels like a gut punch. These memorable heroes are all gone by the time you get to know them, and each of them had their own hopes, dreams, and responsibilities as they fought to protect Hyrule from Calamity Ganon’s destruction. Every memory you find in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> is tinged with melancholy as you see the gusto and vigor the Champions had in their hearts as they prepared to fight the Calamity just for them be stomped out in its wake.</p><p><em>Breath of the Wild</em> is full of tragedy, but just because the Champions were defeated doesn’t mean their wishes have been completely wiped away. Link takes pieces of them with him when he remembers their time together and when he uses one of their abilities to defeat Calamity Ganon. Their hopes live on in the people still here, and by the end of <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, it’s thanks to them that the day is won. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f5cc065718c19a6c70db1f7cd0927b6e" data-recommend-id="image://f5cc065718c19a6c70db1f7cd0927b6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beedle carries his wares on his back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Beedle carries his wares on his back." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Game Rant</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5cc065718c19a6c70db1f7cd0927b6e" data-recommend-id="image://f5cc065718c19a6c70db1f7cd0927b6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beedle carries his wares on his back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Nintendo has etched Beedle’s voice into the minds of millions. The recurring shopkeeper who first debuted in <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em> has appeared in several games over the past 20 years, and his exuberant and expressive sound bites have been a backdrop of so many rupee transactions that they’ve taken on a memetic life of their own. Who among us doesn’t still hear his excited “thank you!” in their head from time to time? Beedle has persisted throughout the years, and is even a shopkeeper in <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. As a traveling salesman, he’s seen some shit now, and his hollerin’ has only gotten louder.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3a377e5819580f7d27a64692c73c375c" data-recommend-id="image://3a377e5819580f7d27a64692c73c375c" data-format="jpg" data-width="770" data-height="432" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tingle in Hyrule Warriors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tingle in Hyrule Warriors." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3a377e5819580f7d27a64692c73c375c" data-recommend-id="image://3a377e5819580f7d27a64692c73c375c" data-format="jpg" data-width="770" data-height="432" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tingle in Hyrule Warriors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Speaking of flamboyant recurring characters, Tingle hasn’t been around lately, and I’m torn on whether that’s a relief or a shame. The <em>Zelda </em>series’ most recognizable little freak started out as a map salesman in <em>Majora’s Mask</em>, then went on to be one of the few characters that persists through multiple games. He’s known for his excited, obnoxious behavior, nickel-and-diming Link at every turn, and for the way Nintendo keeps putting him in games even though no one really likes him.</p><p>This little king got his own <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fans-have-finally-translated-the-most-recent-tingle-gam-1821755765&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fans-have-finally-translated-the-most-recent-tingle-gam-1821755765">spin-off series during the DS era</a></span>, though the games never made their way to the States. Honestly, kudos to him for sticking around even when people were mad about him. I have to give flowers for persistence. Though his appearances have been fewer and farther between as years have gone on, he’s still a mainstay of the extended <em>Zelda</em> universe in things like <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="06fed18f5d058f38bbbc9e9d0ed2e9c0" data-recommend-id="image://06fed18f5d058f38bbbc9e9d0ed2e9c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Navi talks to Sheik and Impa." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Navi talks to Sheik and Impa." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06fed18f5d058f38bbbc9e9d0ed2e9c0" data-recommend-id="image://06fed18f5d058f38bbbc9e9d0ed2e9c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Navi talks to Sheik and Impa." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like Tingle, whether or not someone thinks Navi is annoying or a staple of the <em>Zelda</em> franchise depends on who you ask. The fairy is Link’s traveling companion in <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, and her catchphrase “Hey, listen!” is embedded in gaming culture—someone you know has that as their text tone on their phone, while others would probably roll their eyes if they heard it. As her name implies, Navi is your navigator, your right hand, your blabbermouth friend you wish you could mute. But she’s also a trailblazer for characters like her throughout the series and one of the most memorable companion characters in all of video games.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c9e81036ac96ebc28538bbe4983464f6" data-recommend-id="image://c9e81036ac96ebc28538bbe4983464f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A great fairy rises from the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A great fairy rises from the ground." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c9e81036ac96ebc28538bbe4983464f6" data-recommend-id="image://c9e81036ac96ebc28538bbe4983464f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A great fairy rises from the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Great Fairies have appeared in multiple<em> Zelda</em> games, but their depiction in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> is one of my favorites. The giant women in flashy hair and makeup that would make anyone competing on <em>RuPaul’s Drag Race</em> jealous are fun, flirty, and always willing to lend a helping hand— if you help them first. Most design iterations of the Great Fairies have been a bit more reserved, which is why the <em>Breath of the Wild </em>versions are a delightful return to the maximalist look of <em>Ocarina of Time</em>’s fairies. Don’t give me generic fairies who will heal me up. Give me drag queen-looking mothers who are here to slay the pain away.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="77d6acdf56ba288814e92314bf143527" data-recommend-id="image://77d6acdf56ba288814e92314bf143527" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Impa as she appears in Breath of the Wild." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Impa as she appears in Breath of the Wild." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="77d6acdf56ba288814e92314bf143527" data-recommend-id="image://77d6acdf56ba288814e92314bf143527" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Impa as she appears in Breath of the Wild." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of all the recurring characters in the <em>Zelda </em>series, Impa is likely the one who has gone through the most wildly different interpretations since her debut in the original game. She’s been a non-combatant elder and a ninja-like bodyguard, but every time she and Link meet she is a source of wisdom and direction. Depending on when you jumped into the franchise, the name “Impa” might conjure a different image in your mind. I still remember her most vividly as the Sage of Shadow in <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, but it’s not lost on me that many will know her as an elder in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s Kakariko Village. But no matter which version of her you remember most, her presence as a guiding hand transcends timeline and appearance.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a49508c55950fa6ce7cfcb2edb94427" data-recommend-id="image://8a49508c55950fa6ce7cfcb2edb94427" data-format="jpg" data-width="256" data-height="240" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Error says &quot;I am Error.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Error says &quot;I am Error.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a49508c55950fa6ce7cfcb2edb94427" data-recommend-id="image://8a49508c55950fa6ce7cfcb2edb94427" data-format="jpg" data-width="256" data-height="240" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Error says &quot;I am Error.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Error is a man of few words.

Then if you talk to him again he’ll tell you about a tunnel that leads you to a whole new area you might not have found in the game. Thanks, Error!

You don’t even want to be sitting next to him at the Disney ranch.”</p><p>Jones and Smith had apparently both just gotten seated and strapped in for the cameras to begin rolling when the latter beefed. “I hear Will Smith go, ‘Oh, Jesus, so sorry. Tommy, so sorry. Baz, get the ladder,’ Sonnenfeld recalled. “And you hear Tommy saying, ‘That’s fine, Will. No worries, Will. Don’t worry, Will.’” The set apparently had to be “evacuated” for over three hours before filming could resume. “He’s a lovely guy, just he farts,” the filmmaker said. “Some do, some don’t.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Until Dawn Remake is not out until October 4, 2024; however, a day before the intended release date, the game’s ending has leaked, which hints towards a sequel.</p>



<p><strong><em>Spoilers ahead for players who haven’t played the original game.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/untildawn/comments/1fus4m8/leak_new_ending_for_until_dawn_remake/">untildawn</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-leak-points-to-potential-sequel">Eurogamer</a>), Until Dawn Remake developers have added an entirely new ending that paves the way for a sequel. In the original game, players could only reach two conclusions: either Josh dying or him turning into a Wendigo. However, in Until Dawn Remake, the developers have added an entirely new ending, where Josh survives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new Until Dawn Remake ending plays right after credits, and Dr. Hill addresses Josh, stating, “But it is a game that has driven you to one of your own deepest fears, Joshua. Isolation.” The scene ends with Joshua showing the massive scar on his forehead while Dr. Hill says, “I hope for your sake, Joshua, that you can find redemption.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Until Dawn Remake ending has an additional post-credit scene, where players see how Sam deals with PTSD some years after the game’s events. The scene begins with Sam asleep, and an alarm wakes her up. As she goes to stop the alarm, she finds her arm covered in blood, with someone knocking at the door. The scene ends with a mysterious voice calling her name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A reliable insider has also weighed in on Until Dawn’s sequel. Shpeshal Nick has taken to <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1841831653859328287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to provide more information about the game. According to him, Firesprite will be developing the upcoming title.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/god-of-war-review-out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new/1900-6416893/" data-ref-id="1900-6416893">God of War</a> introduced players to Atreus, the son of Kratos. And while gamers were largely charmed by the father and son bond that they forged, Atreus was a little overly chatty. That trend continued in the 2022 sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-blood-sweat-and-tyrs/1900-6417993/" data-ref-id="1900-6417993">God of War Ragnarok</a>. But now, a new mod has been created for the recently released PC port that keeps Atreus and other companions from stepping all over the game's puzzles.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-please-shut-up-mod-turns-off-all-companion-puzzle-hints" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, a NexusMods user, Mophead01, has released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/66" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Please Shut Up mod</a>. This expands on Sony's previously released option to decrease the frequency of hints for the puzzles that Kratos has to solve throughout the game. Mophead01 felt that did little to address the actual problem, including recurring instances where Atreus reminds gamers how to perform basic actions. Thus the mod has taken the drastic step of removing over 1,500 lines of dialogue from the game.</p><p>"Tired of companions telling you things you already know? Tired of the game treating you like a child if you don't instantly solve every puzzle? This mod removes over 1,500 pointless, [patronizing] voice lines from the game," wrote Mophead01.</p><p>Unfortunately, this mod is not an option for gamers who have Ragnarok on PlayStation 5 or PlayStation 4. Sony hasn't even gotten around to sending out an update for those versions that includes the PC option to cut down on the hints. So for now, only PC gamers have the chance to keep Atreus quiet for any extended length of time. </p>

		<p>A major game set in the Avatar: The Last Airbender and Avatar: The Legend of Korra universe is being developed by Saber Interactive, the studio has confirmed today. The new game will be a triple A action RPG set in the same universe, but it will not follow either Aang or Korra. Instead, this game will be set thousands of years before either of their stories, introducing a new Avatar that has not been seen in the show.</p>
<p><em>“We know loyal fans of&nbsp;<span>Avatar</span>: The Last Airbender&nbsp;have been eager for more stories that bring them into the universe of the show, and through gaming, we’re able to expand the world- building and allow fans to experience the new content in a completely immersive way,”</em> said Doug Rosen, SVP, Games and Emerging Media at Paramount. <em>“Saber Interactive has a proven track record in bringing IP-based games to life, and we are excited to co-fund this AAA title alongside them and let fans experience this world first-hand.”</em></p>


<p>“At Saber, we are all truly fans of the IP we work with,” said Josh Austin, Head of IP Development &amp; Licensing, Saber Interactive. <em>“Our team members are some of the most devoted, passionate creatives out there and it’s an honor to join forces with&nbsp;<span>Avatar</span>&nbsp;Studios and Paramount Games to further expand the&nbsp;<span>Avatar</span>&nbsp;Legends&nbsp;universe in video games. This unique co-fund structure is a result of our ever-expanding collaboration with Paramount, which started over a decade ago with WWZ, and we’re excited for all that’s on the horizon.”</em></p>
<p>Saber Interactive will be working with Avatar Studios to create a story and world which will fit into the lore that has been established by the two shows already, and it will follow a familiar pattern of being a story about an Avatar trying to master all four elements. The game’s description also seems to suggest that there will be choices that will have an impact on the story, and that this Avatar will have their own group of companions too, just like Aang and Korra. No platforms or release date has yet been confirmed.</p>

			<p>Sid Meier's <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vii-announced-summer-game-fest/">Civilization VII</a> is the next game to be announced in the Civilization franchise, a beloved franchise that has been going since 1991, with multiple spin-offs in the franchise. The next main game in the franchise was announced during Summer Games Fest 2024 and is slated for a 2025 release. As of today, the official system requirements have been announced, and the Ultra settings are asking quite a lot of players. At the moment, there have been no Mac requirements listed, so it's uncertain whether the game will be arriving on Mac as it releases on PC, if it'll come at a later date, or if there are no plans to put it onto Mac at all. Civilization VI was put onto Mac and Linux, so it's likely that the game will also be released on Mac at some point in its lifespan. Below are the PC system requirements for Civilization VII, as <a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841870892449640471" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced today on X</a>.</p>

<p>While the lower settings are quite reasonable, as are the recommended settings, dedicated fans in the comments are already posting their shock at the intense requirements for the ULTRA settings. Typically, Civilization games aren't that hardware intensive, and players can still run the game on great graphics without their hardware running hot. However, it seems that Firaxis has a different idea for this game.</p>
<p>However, considering that the ultra settings will allow the game to run at 4K60, it seems relatively reasonable that an RTX 4070 would be the recommended graphics card for those who want the utmost graphic fidelity in their 4X experience. Some have been quick to come to the defense of Civilization VII's system requirements, saying that they are justified, but some are saying that it seems unnecessary to need a 4070 for a turn-based game.</p>
<p>At the moment, details about Sid Meier's Civilization VII are quite slim, as the game was only announced earlier in the year. However, as we get closer to 2025, more details about upcoming features and perhaps information about why the system requirements are what they are are bound to be released.</p>

Yes, <em>Near Dark</em> is a love story, despite it being viciously violent and disturbing for most of its run-time.<br></p><p>It’s also, perhaps, one of the late Bill Paxton’s best roles. The iconic actor plays a deranged vampire named Severen who wears a biker jacket adorned with badges from different time periods that are likely from all the people he’s eaten.

The sadistic way in which he pulls a man’s sunglasses off his face as he’s being choked by him, laughing as his windpipe is constricted, will make your skin crawl.</p><p>Paxton isn’t the only great thing about this film, though. Bigelow deftly establishes a neo-Western vibe and mood that is gritty, dirty, and downright rotten at times, while expertly balancing its crueler moments with a love story that glistens like a pearl resting on a dank ocean floor. It’s an absolute must-watch, and yet you may not be able to.</p><p><em>Near Dark</em> is the unfortunate victim of the same fate as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/strange-days-streaming-cyberpunk-2077-braindance-1849945692&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/strange-days-streaming-cyberpunk-2077-braindance-1849945692"><em>Strange Days</em></a></span>, another Kathryn Bigelow classic that is difficult to watch but essential to find. Here’s hoping it’ll come back on streaming services before October is up. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s a sad day when another game studio shuts down, making people wonder just how fickle this industry really is. Studio Black Flag, also known as Blackflag Games, is officially shutting down after declaring bankruptcy, while also working on the game, Orphan Age.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-studio-black-flag-declares-bankruptcy-and-shuts-down">Studio Black Flag Declares Bankruptcy and Shuts Down</h2>



<p>With many other esports and gaming companies having mass layoffs recently or shutting down, it comes as no surprise to see another small studio hit the ground. Still, though, it is quite disheartening.</p>



<p>Studio Black Flag declared bankruptcy explaining that “communications broke down” between it and its publisher. The French government then shut down the French indie studio because it did not have any present or future funding.</p>



<p>“It is an inevitable situation. Due to the legal specifics of this case, we were put back in a closed bottle and unable to talk about the situation,” said Studio Black Flag in regards to having to shut down.</p>



<p>This news comes with many other companies shutting down operations within the industry or having to do mass layoffs.</p>



<p>“Ultimately,” the company added, “we appear to be another casualty of the&nbsp;current downturn in the video game industry.”</p>



<p>So, what does this mean regarding the studio’s game, Orphan Age, which has yet to be released?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-studio-black-flag-hopes-to-release-orhpan-age-still">Studio Black Flag Hopes To Release Orhpan Age Still</h2>



<p>Studio Black Flag does not want fans following the production of Orphan Age to be disappointed. The studio announced they are exploring options to release the game in its current state, which is unfinished but still playable.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>They made it very clear, though, that it will not be a close-to-finished version of the game, but still better than the playable demo that was released a while back.</p>



<p>It is very heartbreaking to see a company as such topple, but unfortunately, this is just a part of being in the gaming industry.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> HITMAN 3 - VR Mode Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Multiple roles have reportedly been affected across the studio, although XR Games has not officially confirmed that it has carried out this round of layoffs. If the studio is down to just 12 people, this likely doesn't bode well for its upcoming games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starship-troopers-continuum/" data-ref-id="5000-645815">Starship Troopers: Continuum</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/zombie-army-vr/" data-ref-id="5000-619399">Zombie Army VR</a>.</p><p>While it's not listed on GameSpot's sister site Metacritic, a quick glance at the reviews for Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded have not done the game any favors. Several critics have noted that it's a poor translation of the excellent PC and console game, while technical issues hamper its appeal further. Shortly after it was released last month, <a href="https://x.com/xrgamesvr/status/1833192314891571244" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XR Games did note that it was addressing player feedback</a> with planned patches.</p><p>Another high-profile VR game will launch on October 22 in the form of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-gameplay-trailer-reveals-first-person-dark-knight-action/1100-6525918/" data-ref-id="1100-6525918">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a>. Exclusive to Meta Quest 3 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-batman-arkham-shadow-bundle-preorder-guide/1100-6526720/" data-ref-id="1100-6526720">Quest 3S headsets</a>, this new Dark Knight adventure is set between the events of Arkham Origins and Arkham Asylum, <a href="https://youtu.be/CR0N1AL9jOM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and early impressions have been positive so far</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Just in time for spooky season, players of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a> got their first in-depth look at the popular life sim's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-confirms-sims-4-life-and-death-expansion-pack-releases-in-october-new-roadmap-unveiled/1100-6526303/">macabre new Life &amp; Death expansion pack</a> via a trailer released by EA. While every major Sims 4 expansion brings something new to the franchise, Life &amp; Death may take the cake as far as expansion-exclusive careers go, as it lets players step into the otherworldly shoes of none other than the Grim Reaper himself.</p><p dir="ltr">But clocking in for a job that revolves around telling other Sims when to permanently clock out isn't the only off-the-wall feature included in the new expansion pack. The trailer depicts a number of wild new activities for Sims to take part in. From planning the perfect funeral to executing the last will and testament of the deceased, The Sims 4 Life &amp; Death expansion pack gives players access to an array of humorous (and at times, heartfelt) content to engage with.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Sims 4 Life &amp; Death Expansion Pack: Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, players can now don the hood of the Grim Reaper, an NPC who has been a part of the franchise since the very beginning. The Grim Reaper career path allows Sims to become Grimsterns--mentees of ol' Grim who decide the fate of those who have recently kicked the bucket. (Yes, they even get to wield a scythe.) Grimsterns who meet Grim's "soul quota" can even be dubbed Employee of the Month!</p><p dir="ltr">Sims who build a good enough relationship with Grim may get a chance to see what he looks like under the hood, though his face is amusingly censored by the same pixelated effect that appears when Sims strip down to shower or skinny dip. The new expansion also includes mortician and funeral director career paths, along with an appropriately spooky new in-game world: Ravenwood, a bone-chilling environment featuring three new neighborhoods for Sims to live (or die) in.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4378343-grimhood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378343" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4378343-grimhood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378343"></a><figcaption>Sims players can finally see what's going on under Grim's hood. Er, sort of.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4378343-grimhood.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to creepy new locales, fresh-to-death clothing and furniture, and the whole "get paid to be the Grim Reaper" thing, The Sims 4 Life &amp; Death expansion pack also includes a truly life-changing new feature: reincarnation. Sims who have finally shuffled off this mortal coil can shuffle their way back to the land of the living by completing the Soul's Journey aspiration. Sims with this aspiration will be faced with a number of goals ranging from heartwarming (connecting with long-lost loved ones in the afterlife) to heart-stopping (scaring the Sul Sul out of non-dead Sims, just for fun). Completing the Soul's Journey aspiration will earn Sims the "Burning Soul" reward trait, which allows them to return from the dead without having to cook up a plate of Ambrosia or go through the whole "groveling at Grim's feet with a Death Flower" thing.</p><p dir="ltr">The Sims 4 Life &amp; Death expansion pack retails for $40 USD and will be available on console and PC starting on October 31, with a gameplay trailer set to go live on October 17. Players who purchase the game by December 12 will also receive the Mournful Mementos Digital Content Set, which includes the following items:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Lasting Legacy Family Portrait</li><li dir="ltr">Mournful Melodies Music Box</li><li dir="ltr">Plumed Elegance Mask</li></ul>

Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-journeying-through-life-and-beyond-in-latest-expansion-this-halloween">few early teases</a> last month, EA has formally unveiled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s spooky new Life &amp; Death expansion, which arrives on 31st October, adding everything from new neighbourhoods where the boundaries between the living and the dead are especially thin to a new grim reaper career and the ability for ghosts to WooHoo in objects small and large.
</p>
<p>
Life &amp; Death looks to be a particularly busy expansion, touching not only on what happens to the living when a loved one is lost - think Wills and more elaborate funerals - but what Sims experience after shuffling off this mortal coil. That includes spectral romances, ghostly powers, the ability to helpfully haunt their old homes as part of the family, even reincarnation.
</p>
<p>
Living Sims looking to make the most of their time on earth can create a bucket list as part of the expansion (which players can populate manually based on specific categories or expand automatically based on a Sims traits), and Sims who don't manage to tick everything off in life can work through that list beyond the veil as Unfinished Business - earning the chance for an especially powerful rebirth, carrying over previously earn skills and traits.

<p>
The living, meanwhile, can also plan elaborate Funeral events for their loved ones, specifying the likes of dress code, time and location, even activities that'll play out during the ceremony. Sims might give a lighthearted eulogy, for instance, serve food, light candles, or plant something in the deceased's memory. Players can even select specific memorial portraits, urns, tombstones, or decorate gravesites however they choose.
</p><p>
All that ties in with new forms of grief Sims can express when a loved one (including pets) dies, including Denial, Holding It Together, Anger, and Blues. Grieving sims can also Reach out for Help with their friends, attend Grief Counselling, console other Sims, or cope positively with grief by doing creative or productive activities.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, the Sims 4's Life &amp; Death expansion introduces two new careers; Sims can study to become undertakers, learning grave digging, embalming, and more as they follow their branching career paths toward either Mortician or Funeral Director. Sims can alternatively sign up as Grimterns at the Netherworld Department of Death, working through the ranks to become a reaper, filling their soul quotas, and even decided who to reap or return to life.

<p>
Then there's Ravenwood, a new world split into three distinct neighbourhoods where the dead and living more closely intermingle. Crow's Crossing, for instance, is an eerie village of cobbled streets where haunts are commonplace, while Whispering Glen is an idyllic countryside retreat that hosts a nightly Moon Revelry festival. "Things get a little wild during the Full Moon," EA notes, and "clothing is entirely <em>optional</em>."
</p><p>
And finally for Ravenwood, there's the gloomy Mourningvale, where Sims can find the Bell Tower, sentient plants, even the Baleful Bog, used to achieve an out-of-body experience or transition into Rebirth. It's also possible to join Afterlife Anonymous here if they need a bit of help adjusting to their recent transition to the other side.
</p>
<p>
There's quite a bit more going on in Life &amp; Death too, including a new Ghost Historian Aspiration, horror novels, new traits (Macabre, Chased by Death, and Skeptic), a new Thanatology Skill, and more. There's plenty of additional detail in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/life-and-death-expansion-pack">EA's announcement post</a> if you're curious, and a new gameplay video is set to be released on 17th October.
</p>

The Sims 4 Life &amp; Death Expansion Pack launches for all platforms on 31st October, and players that purchase it between 3rd October and 12th December get the Legacy Family Portrait, the Mournful Melodies Music Box and

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nearly five years after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-in-the-works-maybe-meanwhile-heres-a-playable-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gothic Remake playable teaser</a> was released on Steam, I watched a detailed presentation of the project at Gamescom 2024, followed by an in-depth Q&amp;A with the developers at Alkimia Interactive.</p>
<p>To start with, the developers stressed Gothic's importance from a gaming cultural standpoint, especially in Germany and Eastern Europe, where the fantasy role-playing game immediately garnered a huge following. They also immediately clarified that the Gothic Remake Gamescom 2024 demo was not part of the actual game. Instead, it was a sort of prequel featuring another main character rather than the nameless hero. Alkimia Interactive said they were unsure whether the demo would be released to the public.</p>
<p>Even in this demo, the action still took place in the colony under the magic barrier created by magicians to keep some prisoners. The developers said it was very important to keep the original spirit and the daily routines of the NPCs, who do their own things, like having random conversations that you can listen to.</p>
<p>In the original game, the player could dive, but the action was basically useless. In the Gothic Remake, the developers wanted to make this more meaningful, so players can now find loot inside sunken chests. For instance, at the very beginning of the demo, enterprising players can find a sword underwater. Alkimia wants to make the Gothic Remake a highly immersive experience. To that end, UI elements like the health and mana bars will only appear when the character draws a weapon.</p>
<p>If you have played the original, you'll find that many locations are logical extensions of something in the original. Often, there was a blocked path; you would see something behind it, but you couldn't actually go in. Now, the developers have taken these open ends to add more content.</p>
<p>In keeping with the gritty, realistic vibe of Gothic, the main character doesn't really know how to fight at the beginning. His swings are purposely very slow and equally clumsy. That's meant to highlight he has probably never held a sword before in his whole life, so he's untrained and skilled. However, in the demo (and in the final game, too, of course), NPCs were available to teach him sword fighting. You do actually train with them, and it is even possible, albeit unlikely, to beat them.</p>
<p>On a high level, this is one of the important aspects of the world of Gothic: everything is communicated to you either visually or through conversations, so you don't have to look abstractly at your skill tree; you can just look at your character and see that he's getting better.</p>
<p>Cooking was available in the original, but in the Gothic Remake, you can fry multiple pieces of meat at once. You don't have to do it one after the other. Also, if you find more recipes, you can even cook some more sophisticated dishes and sell them or eat them to get some more health points back. Another example is that you can count the number of arrows you've got left by just looking at the quiver.</p>
<p>Interestingly, most NPCs you fight against won't instantly kill you. They are instead only interested in asserting their dominance in the prison colony and they let you leave after they've won. Another peculiarity is that in the quest log, there won't be any separation between main quests and secondary quests.</p>
<p>I also learned from composer Kai Rosenkranz that the music in the original Gothic was only 25 minutes, maybe 30 minutes long, but it was composed out of building blocks that could be rearranged and shuffled around, which made it less repetitive. Still, there was only so much trickery that could be done that way. The Remake already has over two hours of music, including original melodies that are both variations and brand new ideas. Interestingly, Rosenkranz said his daughter also wrote some music for the Remake, so this was a collaborative thing. In the original game, Rosenkranz did the same while his father also worked on it, making it the second time the music is a multi-generational affair from the Rosenkranz family.</p>
<p>Overall, the Gothic Remake demo looked great, running smoothly on Unreal Engine 5. It looks fairly polished, too, even though the developers wouldn't open up on whether the game was close to launch. According to publisher THQ Nordic, it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-killing-floor-3-and-titan-quest-ii-to-launch-by-march-2025-alongside-three-unannounced-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposed to be released by March 2025</a>, although plans can always change.</p>
<p>After the presentation, I quizzed Kai Rosenkranz, Alkimia Interactive Director/Studio Head Reinhard Pollice, and Community Manager Timur Khodyrev on various aspects of the game, from its longevity to the changes they've made to specific systems and questlines.</p>
<p><iframe title="GOTHIC REMAKE Open World Demo | New Single Player RPG with INSANE GRAPHICS in Unreal Engine 5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4zj0HcyYphM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Can you explore all the world from the get-go, or do you need to unlock something first?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> Nothing is locked away from you, but some things are found behind a creature that is initially nearly impossible to defeat. Or maybe there is a closed gate, but when you find a transformation spell, you can transform into a little bug to crawl around tunnels and go to places. It's not locked per se as a systematic lock, but it's blocked by in-world obstacles.</p>
<p><strong>Can you upgrade your weapons?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> You can in the sense that you can forge your own weapons, and if you find more recipes for better weapons and better materials, you can go back to the blacksmith and forge a bigger weapon, which will look a bit fancier and stronger.</p>
<p><strong>Can you complete most quests in any order?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> Yes. Some quests advance the main story, of course, but there are also secondary quests that affect it. The player can choose what they want to do and what is important to them.</p>
<p><strong>What's the level cap in the Gothic Remake?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> The level cap will be 50.</p>
<p><strong>I wanted to ask about the game's length. I know you are adding some new areas and making new quests, so how much can we expect in terms of length?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> The original game from 2001 was roughly 20 hours long, but it had a very narrow and linear story in the later chapter, so the mid-game and the end game were much more to the point and much more linear than the previous chapters. So if we manage to extend those chapters, or even give you multiple options that extend the main story and the kind of opportunities to do side quests into the later chapters, that would, I think, lead to a significant increase in playtime to maybe about 30 hours.</p>
<p>The idea is to entice players to play more than just one time so that they can see other outcomes and experience a different fighting style.</p>
<p><strong>I know the game runs on Unreal Engine 5, right? Are you using Lumen and Nanite?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz: </strong>Yes to both.</p>
<p><strong>Will it be possible to have the camera centered on the player character, rather than the player character being so offset to the left, as seen thus far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong> We weren’t sure about the camera position, and in fact, we moved it to the side just a few weeks before GamesCom. But due to feedback starting with the trailer we will for sure add options like locking the camera on the left or in the middle of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Will players have different paths in the second and third Chapters if joining the New/Old Camp instead of 'spying' on the Sect Camp?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> There are more optional quests and ways to do things, but the main quest remains similar, meaning that you need to get a grip of the Sect Camp.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be more guild-specific quests compared to the original?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, as in the previous question, we want to expand Gothic Remake in different directions. We want to provide players with more in-depth information about the guilds, their goals, and motivations.</p>
<p><strong>Did you add more diverse character reactions to the Gothic Remake depending on which camp you have joined?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> We have a very complex reaction system and we plan to have different reactions based on story progress, missions you are in, recent events in the world or just the role of characters involved.</p>
<p><strong>Will it be possible to become a water mage earlier?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> Not specifically a water mage, but we want to open up access to magic sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be ways to customize the difficulty?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> The true Gothic experience has a specific difficulty level, but for players who want it differently, there will be options. However, everybody should be aware that it's not Gothic as it's imagined; it's just a variation.</p>
<p><strong>People always ask about the New Game Plus mode. Is that something you are considering for the Gothic Remake?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> We will have some options to raise difficulty, but no New Game Plus.</p>
<p><strong>Can NPCs use scrolls in the remake?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> NPCs use magic.</p>
<p><strong>How will the Brotherhood react to Y'berion's death? In the original Gothic, nothing changes except for Kalom leaving. Is that something you're going to expand on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, absolutely. Actually, after that moment in the original game, you don't really need to come back to the Sect Camp since there is no additional content or quests. This is also what we want to expand in the remake. But we can not spill the beans other than it follows our philosophy of adding depth to the world and making it feel more alive.</p>
<p><strong>How is the skill system changing in the Gothic Remake?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong>&nbsp;If you mean the progression system, then it will be almost the same as in the original game. You earn XP by completing quests and defeating your enemies. You can learn something only from teachers. So there are no "skill trees" as in many other RPG games. So you need firstly to find a teacher, who is a specialist in this or that category. We have a 3-step progression system for one-handed, two-handed weapons, and ranged weapons like it was in Gothic 1 (not in Gothic 2).</p>
<p>Also, there are some new skills you can learn, for instance - free climbing or diving. For the latter, you can learn how to stay underwater longer.</p>
<p><strong>Will you take advantage of ray tracing effects?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong> Yes, there will be Ray Tracing technology in "Gothic 1 Remake".</p>
<p><strong>Will there be a Performance mode on consoles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, there will be quality and performance modes on consoles.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to take advantage of the PS5 Pro console?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> There will be some improvements for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Will Gothic remake support NVIDIA and/or AMD frame generation techniques on PC?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> We will for sure support some kind of tech in that area.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <p>Yesterday, Valve dropped a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4659626709189608599">Steam client beta update</a> focused largely on Game Recording – the beta version’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-new-game-recording-beta-lets-you-instant-replay-all-those-elden-ring-deaths">recently added clip-capturing utility</a>. It’s a pretty wide-spanning array of improvements, adding support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-ultrawide-gaming-monitors">ultrawide monitor</a> resolutions up to 32:9, the high-quality H.265 (HEVC) video codec – on Windows only for now, apologies to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> – and the option to "record a specified game indefinitely with no specified time limit."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You wanna be careful wielding that kind of power, mind you. I once left <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/autoscreen/">Auto Screen Capture</a> running by accident, and only realised about eight hours later, after it’d filled my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> with sixty gigabytes of desktop screengrabs. May you be more attentive in your capturing endeavours.</p>
<p>Here’s the relevant chunk of patch notes:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li> Added support for recording with the H.265 (HEVC) video codec when supported by the machine's GPU. This is enabled by default on Windows and should provide improved recording video quality over H.264 at the same file size. Coming soon to Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>Added support for recording up to 4k video resolution when using H.265 (HEVC).</li>
<li>Added a new "auto" quality setting that will set the recording bit rate based on the game's video resolution. This will raise the bit rate when recording games running in 4k, to keep the recorded video sharp, and lower the resolution when running a game at 1080p to save disk space. This setting is on by default for all users.</li>
<li>Added support for recording ultrawide monitors up to 32:9 aspect ratio.</li>
<li>Added a setting to limit the width &amp; height of recorded video.</li>
<li>Exporting a recording (to file, clipboard or chat) will now use the machine's GPU to perform encoding and decoding when available.</li>
<li>Generating screenshots from recordings will now use the machine's GPU when available.</li>
<li>Fixed multiple issues where exporting a recording could fail.</li>
<li>Added export settings dialog to allow custom file size or other settings when exporting a clip.</li>
<li>Added video previews to the Background Recording items in the media manager when hovering them with a mouse or focusing them in BPM.</li>
<li>Added video previews to the Background Recording items in the app details page's screenshot section when hovering them with a mouse or focusing them in BPM.</li>
<li>In per-game settings, add the ability to record a specified game indefinitely with no specified time limit.</li>
<li>Integrated the list of games where recording is disabled into the per-game settings.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>If you missed it at launch, Game Recording is a pretty tidy addition to Steam’s ever-swelling feature set, and this update makes it materially better by adding new options and speeding up encoding and decoding. While I’m not a regular videosmith – I’ll clip a malfunctioning ragdoll to laugh at later over an Old Fashioned, but little else – it is handy to have a recording function built into the launcher, rather than running alongside it as another resource-hungry app. If you currently on Steam’s main stable branch, you can give the beta a whirl by switching clients in Settings &gt; Interface.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In that time, <em>Diablo 4</em> has proved again and again that it might just be the best entry the franchise has ever seen, with an excellent iteration on the core gameplay loop fans love that has only gotten better with consistent post-release updates . Next week, the game’s first expansion, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-mercenaries-dark-citadel-1851630602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-mercenaries-dark-citadel-1851630602"><em>Vessel of Hatred</em></a></span>, will release, giving fans even more reasons to dive back in. But if you haven’t bought into<em> Diablo 4</em> just yet then now’s the perfect time, as Steam has a 40 percent discount on the game until October 7.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195150" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Diablo IV - Bear Bender Build" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="526" data-playlist="195150,195326,194907" data-current="195150"><div><p>Diablo IV - Bear Bender Build</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20607.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The fourth <em>Diablo </em>remains true to the core of what makes the series so popular. Its Gothic setting is atmospheric as hell and fun to explore, combat is tightly designed to make every click turn into a satisfying action, and hunting after new loot never gets old. One exceptional improvement over the franchise formula that <em>Diablo 4</em> introduces is a new variation on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-best-builds-classes-necromancer-rogue-sorcerer-1850518023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-best-builds-classes-necromancer-rogue-sorcerer-1850518023">skill tree</a></span>. After early criticism that the skill tree was too rigid and essentially locked you into a set playstyle, Blizzard created a much more freeing take on the system. </p><p>The current skill tree in <em>Diablo 4</em> allows you much more freedom in how you build your class, meaning that not every person who plays as a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-best-builds-classes-necromancer-rogue-sorcerer-1850518023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-best-builds-classes-necromancer-rogue-sorcerer-1850518023">Druid</a></span> will have the same toolkit. And you can start your skill tree over at any point, which encourages experimentation with your builds. You might hit on a perfect build early or spend your entire playthrough trying out new things when the mood strikes. With a sprawling world that’s filled with a number of procedurally generated dungeons, that freedom of choice offers an incredibly satisfying combat loop, urging you to try just one more dungeon, or seek out just one more piece of loot.</p><p><em>Diablo 4</em> also has an incredibly engaging story. Sure <em>Diablo </em>has always had a narrative that stretches from game to game, but it’s often melodramatic and shallow. <em>Diablo 4</em> is a more grounded emotional affair with one of the best villains in Blizzard’s rogue’s gallery: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-iv-cosplay-lilith-photos-cosplayer-blizzard-1850541510&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-iv-cosplay-lilith-photos-cosplayer-blizzard-1850541510">Lillith</a></span>. We spend <em>Diablo 4</em> following her trail, always one step behind her villainous plans, and as we progress we piece together her motivations and history. At its core, Lilith’s story is about hatred and the cycles of violence the world of <em>Diablo </em>is trapped in. And Lillith is a more human villain than any in the franchise’s past, posing questions about what we as players think we know about the conflict at the heart of <em>Diablo</em>. </p><p>To me, <em>Diablo </em>has predominantly been a game about killing monsters and mindlessly collecting gear , but <em>Diablo 4</em> transforms that solid gameplay loop into a vessel by which a compelling narrative is delivered. The game’s first expansion, <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>, releases on October 8, which means if you pick up <em>Diablo 4 </em>on sale right now you can probably finish it over the week (with enough caffeine that is). Sounds like a good time to me.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is reportedly getting a co-op mode after the game's launch, and is codenamed "League."</p><p>This is according to<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Insider Gaming</a>, which notes that details on the co-op mode are scarce. The report speculates that it could allow for dual protagonists Naoe and Yasuke to fight alongside one another, although that detail is unconfirmed. Shadows was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">delayed to February 14, 2025</a>; it's unclear if the co-op mode will be available right at launch.</p><p>While Assassin's Creed is predominately a single-player franchise, it has included multiplayer options in the past.

The open-world Star Wars game suffered from a buggy rollout, and even had a patch that wiped the progress of players who bought into early access, rendering their purchase moot. Additionally, Assassin's Creed Shadows is reportedly not at a point where it's ready for release. Ubisoft has confirmed that it will ditch the season pass model and all players will receive the first expansion for free.</p><p><span>The game will release for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/why-art-tests-fail-artists-and-the-game-dev-industry<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a Senior Environment Artist with over a decade of experience, I’ve had the privilege of working with some of the most talented individuals in the game development industry. My journey has been shaped by leading large-scale projects, mentoring junior artists, and fostering innovation. However, one practice that I believe is not only outdated but also counterproductive is the use of art tests in the hiring process.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Misuse of Art Tests"><span>The Misuse of Art Tests</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In theory, art tests are intended to evaluate an artist’s capabilities and fit for a role. However, in practice, they often serve as a preliminary screening tool, filtering out candidates before their resumes are even reviewed. Some companies, for instance, use art tests as an initial hurdle, particularly for junior and mid-level artists. These candidates often invest significant time into completing an art test, believing it to be a step forward in the interview process, only to be dismissed without having their resumes genuinely considered. This approach is not only discouraging but also exploitative, especially when there’s no clear deadline, further misleading candidates into dedicating excessive time to a task that may lead nowhere.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Furthermore, some organizations treat art tests as a mandatory step, regardless of the candidate's portfolio or experience. Even when an applicant’s existing work aligns perfectly with the job’s requirements, they may still be required to complete an art test simply because it’s part of a standardized process. This rigid adherence to procedure not only undervalues the candidate's time but also risks losing highly qualified talent who might opt out of the process.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Art Tests and DEI Concerns"><span>Art Tests and DEI Concerns</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While art tests pose several issues, one of the most significant is their negative impact on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The substantial time commitment these tests require disproportionately affects individuals from underrepresented groups, including those with family responsibilities or limited free time. When opportunity is tied to one’s availability rather than their skill or experience, it undermines the very principles of DEI that our industry strives to uphold.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s troubling to consider that a young artist with fewer responsibilities might have an advantage over someone with more experience but less time. If the game dev industry truly values diversity, we need to reconsider how art tests contribute to maintaining inequality.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Art Tests Don’t Reflect Real Studio Conditions"><span>Art Tests Don’t Reflect Real Studio Conditions</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another problem with art tests is that they rarely replicate the real-world studio environment. The conditions under which these tests are completed are vastly different from the collaborative, fast-paced nature of game development. Because of this, tests can be manipulated or gamed, which can lead to a distorted view of a candidate’s true abilities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In contrast, a comprehensive portfolio and a resume that showcases years of experience offer a far more accurate picture of an artist’s potential. The ability to work well with others, communicate effectively, and adapt to changing circumstances—skills that are crucial in game development—cannot be accurately gauged in a vacuum.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Risk of Exploitation"><span>The Risk of Exploitation</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, there have been cases where art test submissions were used by companies without compensating or acknowledging the artist. This unethical practice is not only wrong but also illegal. No artist should have to worry about their work being exploited, and companies must be held accountable for respecting the work of potential hires.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="When Art Tests Might Be Appropriate"><span>When Art Tests Might Be Appropriate</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite these concerns, there are instances where art tests might be justified. For instance, when dealing with junior artists who have a limited portfolio, or when there’s a specific skill gap that needs to be addressed, a targeted art test could be appropriate. For example, if after an interview there are questions about a candidate’s ability to work within a certain art style or technical framework, a small, focused art test might be the final step before making a job offer. Ideally, such tests should be paid, but if they directly lead to employment, compensation becomes less of a pressing issue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, some companies handle art tests more thoughtfully by allowing candidates to submit existing work that fulfills the test’s criteria. This approach respects the candidate’s time while still ensuring they have the necessary skills.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As currently implemented, art tests fail to capture the full scope of an artist’s capabilities and often do more harm than good. While they might be appropriate in certain, limited circumstances, the industry needs to rethink how these tests are used. By focusing on portfolios, interviews, and more tailored approaches, we can create a fairer, more inclusive, and effective hiring process that respects the time and talent of all candidates.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s time for the game dev industry to evolve and adopt hiring practices that truly reflect the collaborative nature of our work.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony has delisted <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> from the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>The first of Guerrilla's Horizon games initially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2020-horizon-zero-dawn-pc-tech-review">arrived on PC back in 2020</a>. However, four years later, it is no longer available to purchase on Epic's <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition#:~:text=Horizon%20Zero%20Dawn%E2%84%A2%20is%20a%20multi-award-winning%20action%20role-playing">storefront</a>. Rather, the page now states Zero Dawn is "Unavailable".</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/">Steam</a> page is still live.</p>

<p>This removal from the PC storefront comes less than two weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawns-remaster-arrives-in-october-and-itll-cost-10-to-upgrade">Sony announced a remastered version of Horizon Zero Dawn</a> would be released on 31st October, across PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>The upcoming Zero Dawn remaster promises a range of enhancements on the now seven-year-old original, including "more than 10 hours" of re-recorded conversation motion capture, as well as "countless" graphical improvements.</p>
<p>Last week, it was noticed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-quietly-raises-horizon-zero-dawn-ps4-price-following-remaster-announcement">Sony had quietly increased the price of the original game on the PlayStation store</a>. The PS4 version of Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition was selling for £15.99 - and had been for some time - until it got a sudden, sharp, price increase which bumped the game up to £34.99.</p><p>On the <a href="https://epicgamesdb.info/p/5ce7e46378254948a5eb921ca32cf569/horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition">Epic Games Store</a>, Horizon Zero Dawn's price often fluctuated. It had been on sale for less than $15 multiple times over the past several months. However, prior to its recent delisting from the storefront, it was retailing for $49.99. This is the same price Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered will retail at, meaning those who purchased the original game in September would actually end up paying more if they followed the $10 upgrade route.</p>

<p>In addition to the above remaster, the series will also continue with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, turning Aloy and her robotic dinosaur enemies into colourful bricks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-is-a-playful-and-light-hearted-take-on-guerrillas-franchise">Described as a "playful and light-hearted" take on Guerrilla's franchise</a>, Lego Horizon Adventures is poised to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-digital-deluxe-edition-includes-sackboy-ratchet-outfits">launch on 14th November</a> across platforms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
