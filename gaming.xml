            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221374/fortnite-marvel-absolute-doctor-doom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After revealing <em>Fortnite’s</em> Marvel-themed “Absolute Doom” season last weekend, Epic Games is officially kicking off <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 4 by sharing <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/be-a-marvel-hero-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-4-absolute-doom">a bunch of details</a> about what you can expect when you drop onto the island in battle royale. Spoiler: there’s a lot of Doctor Doom.</p><p>As already shown, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/11/24217825/fortnites-next-marvel-collab-will-be-nothing-less-than-fabulous">Absolute Doom battle pass</a> will feature various heroes and villains you can obtain like War Machine, Gwenpool, and, of course, Doctor Doom himself. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209499/marvel-robert-downey-jr-doomsday-russo-bros-salaries">Timely!</a>) But the battle royale island will also have Doom-themed locations you can visit like the town of Doomstadt and Castle Doom, where you can find Doom’s Arcane Gauntlets to use as weapons. Doom’s gauntlets aren’t the only Marvel-themed weapons available, though; you’ll also be able to find Captain America’s shield, which is making a return from an <em>Endgame</em>-themed mode <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515617/fortnite-avengers-endgame-limited-time-mode-thanos-infinity-stones-mythic-item">from 2019</a>.</p><p>This is actually <em>Fortnite’s</em> <em>second</em> Marvel-themed season; the previous, which launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man">in August 2020</a>, featured characters like Iron Man, Storm, and another version of Doctor Doom in its battle pass. If you didn’t get the outfits in that battle pass, Epic won’t offer them again, but thankfully, Epic is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215375/fortnite-battle-pass-rewards-back-around-item-shop">changing that policy</a> starting with the pass for Absolute Doom.</p><p>There are also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24218732/honey-wheres-my-fortnite-suit">more Disney crossovers coming to <em>Fortnite</em></a><em>, </em>including three Disney villains and characters from <em>The Incredibles</em>. Given that Disney recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24065281/disney-epic-games-investment-fortnite-metaverse">invested $1.5 billion into Epic Games</a>, I suspect we’ll see a bunch more Disney cameos on the battle royale island at some point — and there’s a whole Disney-themed universe inside <em>Fortnite </em>on the way as well<em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But, for the moment, we're stuck in limbo with Fortnite offline while Epic Games deploys the season update. This is standard procedure--we get at least a few hours of downtime before each new season. It's just a matter of time now.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fortnite x Fall Guys Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2>Fortnite servers down - When does Chapter 5 Season 4 start?</h2><p>When Fortnite's servers come back up, it'll usher in a new Marvel season--its first since 2020--complete with a battle pass full of Marvel icons, new map locations based on the comic book titan's decades of lore, and lots of new weapons.</p><p>But when will that be? Typically, you can expect to see a new Fortnite season to kick off between 4 AM and 7 AM PT / 7 AM and 10 AM ET on launch day--in this case, August 16--though there have been some exceptions in the past, usually tied to when a patch takes longer to deploy than Epic anticipated. Still, if all things go smoothly, like they <em>usually</em> do, it'll be on in the early to late morning for US players, or a bit later in the day overseas.</p><p>However, because last season saw some technical difficulties during the patch deployment, <strong>this season's downtime has started earlier than usual</strong>. Thast could mean the new season also launches sooner too. If that's the case, Fortnite may be back online as early as 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET.</p><p>Once the game does return, Season 4 will introduce a whole host of changes to the battle royale island, thanks to the Doctor Doom's arrival. Players should expect new bosses, plenty of new weapons, and more secrets to be discovered, both on launch day and throughout the season. Presumably, Chapter 5 Season 4 will also play host to Fortnitemares, the game's annual Halloween event. Last year, horror icon Michael Myers came to the game, and the year before, it saw Ash from Evil Dead debut. Should we expect another horror legend to arrive? It seems like a safe bet.</p><p>Once the servers do come back up, we'll give you a massive roundup of everything new in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 on GameSpot.</p>

The date of the cease and desists arrival almost exactly coincides with H2M’s August 16 release date, which was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwBEmMPxuRU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>announced</u></a> last Friday. Its X account’s biography now only says “SHUTDOWN.”</p><p>“Today, our team members received a Cease &amp; Desist order on behalf of Activision Publishing in relation to the H2M-Mod project,” the team’s last post says. “We are complying with this order and shutting down all operations immediately and permanently.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2020/03/31/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-campaign-remastered---screen-2-1585677001593.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer revival mod H2M has been canceled.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The H2M team’s posts date as far back as July 2023 when they <a href="https://x.com/H2Multiplayer/status/1675434407560368128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>announced the project</u></a>, noting that they had already been working on a Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer remastered mod for a while. At the time, the team said, “If Activision won’t do what the fans want, we the community will.” Although the Call of Duty publisher did remaster the original Modern Warfare 2 campaign and release it in 2020, it never went as far as to remaster its multiplayer component.</p><p>H2M aimed to fill the hole with not only upgraded visuals for maps, weapons, and characters fans have loved for more than a decade but also new content, too. It meant new gun camos and animations as well as a crate of new maps based on iconic Call of Duty locations and more. This blend of old and new driven from the perspective of fans had players excited enough to drive sales of Modern Warfare Remastered seeing as the game was needed to play H2M. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/393080/charts/#3m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>, the 2017 title saw a sharp increase in player count in the last few weeks and even managed to climb Steam’s top selling list (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-4-is-one-of-the-best-selling-steam-games-right-now-but-only-because-you-need-it-to-play-an-ambitious-modern-warfare-2-multiplayer-mod-launching-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PC Gamer</u></a>).</p><p>Now, however, Modern Warfare Remastered’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/393080/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_Remastered_2017/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>recent Steam reviews</u></a> read “Mostly Negative,” with many recent comments from players calling for Activision to reverse their cease and desist request.

Some of the most notable are Beamdog Studio's enhanced edition re-releases of classics like Planescape: Torment and Neverwinter Nights, and Owlcat's recent Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader--and thanks to <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fbeamdog-owlcat-rpg-masters&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnew-crpg-bundle-has-baldurs-gate-warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-and-5-more-games-for-35%2F1100-6525842%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new Humble Bundle deal</a>, you can grab PC versions of some of the best CRPGs from both studios for cheap.

Both games are often cited as two of the best 90s CRPGs--Planescape: Torment features incredible writing, dialog, and a unique dark fantasy setting unlike most other RPGs, while Icewind Dale focuses on combat and dungeon crawling. You also get a Humble Store coupon code for <strong>85% off Mythforce</strong>, which is a first-person co-op dungeon crawler inspired by hero shooters and classic 90s fantasy and cartoons. With the coupon, you can pick up Mythforce for just $5.25 (normally $30).</p><p dir="ltr">If you pay $7, you get the aforementioned games as well as the enhanced edition remasters of <strong>Baldur's Gate I</strong> <strong>and II</strong>--which update the Bioware originals with new UI and graphics options, quality of life tweaks, and even controller support--and Owlcat's <strong>Pathfinder: Kingmaker - Enhanced Plus Edition</strong>, which is based on the popular Pathfinder TTRPG rules and setting, and mixes classic CRPG gameplay with city building.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4351014-warhammerroguetrader.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351014" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4351014-warhammerroguetrader.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351014"></a><figcaption>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4351014-warhammerroguetrader.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The $10 tier adds two more games: <strong>Neverwinter Nights: Complete Adventures Enhanced Edition</strong> and <strong>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</strong>. And if you pay $15, you get the DLC season passes for Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Wrath of the Righteous.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, for $35, you get all of the previous content plus Owlcat's latest game, <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</strong>. As the name implies, the game is set in the grim sci-fi universe of Warhammer 40,000, but rather than yet another Space Marine-focused adventure, it pulls inspiration from the lesser-known Rogue Trader TTRPG where players explore 40K's violent universe as the leader of a ragtag band of mercenaries.</p><p dir="ltr">The full $35 bundle equates to a $346 value, but whichever tier you opt for, you'll be adding some of the best CRPGs to your Steam library.

Like all Humble Bundle deals, a portion of all sales goes to charity--in this case, the Girls Make Game Scholarship Fund.</p><p dir="ltr">This bundle contains hundreds of hours worth of RPG content, but fans of classic computer-style RPGs still have plenty more to look forward to.

            <title><![CDATA[Madden NFL 25 Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/madden-nfl-25-review-in-progress.954663/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If football is a game of inches, then Madden typically manages to perfectly recapture that feeling in the minutiae of its year-to-year iterations. Every August, fans sit around and obsessively try to figure out what has changed, if the under-the-hood adjustments actually matter, if the new systems do what EA says they do, and if things truly feel any better. <em>Usually</em>, that is. Not this year. I haven’t played enough of Madden NFL 25 to render a final verdict just yet, but I can already tell that things feel very different than they do in Madden NFL 24 – and I don’t need to bring out the chains to see that good progress has been made. </p><p>EA has been hyping up Madden 25’s updated looks, and honestly, that’s where its improvements are most immediately clear. The menus are much cleaner – your options are big, clearly delineated, and easy to understand, and, miraculously, largely lag-free. This may not seem like a big deal, but if you played Madden 24 at launch, it feels like mana from heaven. It truly is the little things. My wife, who specializes in UX design and has watched me play entirely too much Madden 24 over the last year, walked by while I was playing this year’s iteration and casually remarked that “this looks like an actual menu designed by an actual person.” Hallelujah, brothers and sisters. They heard us.</p><p>All right, Will. Yeah, new menus. Big whoop. Tell us about something more substantial than that. Well, dear reader, the major modes benefit from this new focus on presentation, too, and I feel like a lot of what’s good here can be traced directly back to the improvements we saw in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-review">College Football 25</a>. In Franchise mode, you can finally create female coaches, and there are more customization options than ever before in terms of heads and apparel. There are still only ten head options for women compared to forty for men, but it’s cool that they’ve been added at all.</p><p>Superstar also benefits from this new coat of paint, despite ditching the pretense of an opening storyline (and based on what I’ve seen, voice acting) entirely, which is a shame. The upside is that once you complete the Combine, things get better. The draft actually looks and feels like the NFL draft. When the almighty Joe Throw got drafted by the Falcons 8th overall, Roger Goodell, the most hated man in football, came out and hugged him before presenting him with a Falcons jersey and posing for a picture — just like in real life. Did Joe look like some hideous golem animated by black magic compared to the mute, wax figure of Madden 25’s Roger Goodell? Yes. Does that matter? Not really. It still looks a hell of a lot better than what we had, and I appreciated all of the additional customization options I was given when recreating Joe Throw in Madden 25 — another thing this year’s Madden feels like it owes in part to College Football 25.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The draft actually looks and feels like the NFL draft this year.</p></div><p>Once I was in the Falcons facility, I walked around with head coach Raheem Morris and we discussed my goals for the preseason. Again, it’s a little weird to see everyone’s mouths move and have no sound come out, but graphically? Way better than last year, and I appreciated the moment-to-moment visual updates, whether I was chatting with my teammates in the locker room or out on the field. No longer are we trapped in hotel rooms.</p><p>Speaking of the field, there’s some neat stuff to see here, too. Things just look better all around, whether it’s character models, animations before, during, and after plays, or the new and improved touchdown graphics that pull up the scoring player’s photo. Again, it’s the little things.</p><p>Not everything’s a home run here, however; I hate the new play arts, at least the ones we see in the playbook. They’re harder to parse than the ones in Madden 24 and, conveniently, look just like the ones in College Football 25. They can’t all be zingers, I guess, but man, these can’t be replaced fast enough.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There are also a lot of big changes, like the new kickoff rules, which feel… really weird. I don’t think I like them, but that’s an NFL problem, not necessarily a Madden problem. Either way, it will take a while to get used to. Other things are more positive. I love being able to choose coverage shells rather than just appearing in base align, and I’m a big fan of being able to shift both sides of my O-line independently of one another… yet another feature we first saw in College Football 25. It might just be me, but Madden 25 even feels closer to College Football 25 in terms of speed – maybe I’m crazy, but if that actually proves to be a thing as I play more, I like the direction things are headed.</p><p>I also like that there are more mini-games to play, and that there are finally mini-games for O-linemen you can use to Focus Train them in Franchise mode. I don’t particularly <em>enjoy </em>these mini-games, admittedly, but at least they’re there and I can use them – and overall the mini-games here are hands down an improvement over Madden 24. Getting messages from my GM when I’m playing as a coach in my Franchise is also a nice touch, and I’m a big fan of the new commentary teams, particularly Kate Scott and Brock Huard. (Say it with me: it’s the little things.) </p><p>I have a lot of Madden NFL 25 left to play before I’m ready to give it a score. I have a Franchise to run, more Superstars to guide to Lombardi glory, my yearly slog in the EA Money Machine that is Ultimate Team, and so on. But I find myself… optimistic? Is that even a thing you’re allowed to be about Madden? Maybe I’m totally off base, and I’ll notice more issues the more I play. Football’s a game of inches, after all, and the smallest mistakes can lead to disaster. But right now, man, those little things? They’re feelin’ pretty good.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Will's Favorite Football Games</h3></p></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/heretics-g2-ewc-challengers-team/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Modern Warfare 3 portion of the Esports World Cup is heating up, and earlier today, a round of Challengers-level teams proved that they’re worth more than some CDL competitors. First up was Gentle Mates, which forcefully ejected G2 Esports (Minnesota Rokkr) from the event with a 3-2 win in the elimination round.</p>



<p>Then, Stallions (FC Black) booted Team Heretics out of the competition with a crushing blow. In that series, it came down to the wire on every map, with the opening Hardpoint being almost too close to call at 250 – 248.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shaping-up">Shaping Up</h2>



<p>Modern Warfare 3 isn’t performing all that well at the Esports World Cup, given how many fans of the Call of Duty League have labelled it a ‘fake event’. As an example, the elimination match between Team Falcons and Lore Gaming secured an average peak viewer count floating around 4,500.</p>



<p>Plenty have claimed it’s just to secure a bag, and in many ways, that’s true. There are stacks of cash on the line, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>Even teams leaving the tournament without a single win go away with $20,000 in their pockets.</p>



<p>Following the first round of elimination matches, the first four teams to be ejected from the tournament have bowed out:</p>



<ul>
<li>OMiT</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Team Heretics</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>
</ul>



<p>Tomorrow, we’ll see teams starting to flesh out the playoff roster, and the expectation is that it’ll be populated entirely by CDL squads. Only eight can make it that far, and presently, it looks like it’ll be:</p>



<ul>
<li>Toronto Ultra</li>



<li>Atlanta FaZe</li>



<li>Cloud9</li>



<li>OpTic Gaming</li>



<li>100 Thieves</li>



<li>Vancouver Surge</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Boston Breach</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s easy to believe in the underdog spirit in the Call of Duty world, so we could still see the likes of Gentle Mates, Stallions, or Lore Gaming make it into the playoffs.</p>



<p>Who do you have winning the MW3 category at the Esports World Cup?</p>

<p>You can now play the original <em>Diablo</em> (and its expansion, <em>Hellfire</em>) in virtually any web browser on any computer with generally excellent performance and operating-as-expected controls. It's all thanks to an open source project published on GitHub called <a href="https://github.com/d07RiV/diabloweb">Diabloweb</a> that's now being <a href="https://x.com/iequalshane/status/1823357647673868408">circulated</a> by game developers on X.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/d07RiV/diabloweb/blob/master/README.md">README file</a> in the project's GitHub repository, the project's developer (d07RiV) notes that it is based on <a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX">DevilutionX</a>, another open source project that did a lot of legwork to make <em>Diablo</em> run well on modern operating systems.</p>
<p>"I've modified the code to remove all dependencies and exposed the minimal required interface with JS, allowing the game to be compiled into WebAssembly," writes d07RiV. "Event handling (especially in the menus) had to be modified significantly to fit the JS model."
</p><p>It's pretty easy to set up; you just <a href="https://d07riv.github.io/diabloweb/">visit the website</a>, upload a file, and get going.</p>
<p>You have to upload a file because the project doesn't include the <em>Diablo</em> game files—you'll have to provide those in the form of the DIABDAT.MPQ file in the <em>Diablo</em> install directory.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>There are three above-board ways to source this MPQ file. First, you can, of course, own a physical copy of the original game. Alternatively, you can purchase the game <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/diablo">on GOG</a> and install it, then pull the file from the installation directory.</p>
<p>There's also a shareware release of <em>Diablo,</em> and you can pull the SPAWN.MPQ file from that, and it works just fine. That's not the full game, though, so that's more for if you just want to try it.</p>

<p>I played the game for about half an hour using the MPQ from the GOG version without any issues on Firefox on a Mac. (There's no Mac version of the GOG installer, though, so I had to run the installer in a virtual Windows machine to get at the file.) The game is obviously primitive compared to more recent entries in the series (or even <em>Diablo II</em>), but it is an addictive blast to play regardless.</p>

<p>Here at Ars, we're always on the lookout for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/half-life-3-totally-absolutely-confirmed-by-hidden-dota-2-update-file/">hints</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/valve-registers-european-trademark-for-half-life-3/">actions</a> that suggest the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/celebrating-ten-years-of-half-life-2-episode-3-not-coming-out/">long</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/10/half-life-2-episode-3-may-not-see-release-until-2010/">long wait</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/04/valves-newell-explains-continuing-silence-on-next-half-life/"><em>Half-Life 3</em></a> may eventually come to an end. So when users across the Internet started making note of the mysterious and intriguingly named <a href="https://blackmesa.com/">BlackMesa.com</a> recently, our ears perked up for signs of a new promotional <a href="https://arstechnica.com/technopaedia/2008/05/alternate-reality-game/">alternate reality game</a> (ARG).
</p><p>Alas, this seems like yet another false alarm. BlackMesa.com is simply the website for Black Mesa, which <a href="https://blackmesa.com/resonance-cascades">confirmed in a public statement</a> that it is "actually a real company in the Boston area... working hard to assure and secure vaccine and other biological manufacturing production."</p>

<p>— PеQu (@ImPeQu) <a href="https://twitter.com/ImPeQu/status/1821916164357771630?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The BlackMesa.com domain name dates back to at least 2006, when the address was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061014211724/http://www.blackmesa.com/">filled with search engine optimization ads by an outfit called MDNH, Inc</a>. But in 2022, a page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331041630/http://www.blackmesa.com/">advertising the domain's availability for purchase</a> was suddenly replaced by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220911192743/https://www.blackmesa.com/">a mysterious logo</a> that bears a striking resemblance to <a>the fictional Black Mesa logo</a> in the games. And then there's the hard-to-read cipher at the bottom, the kind of thing that an ARG <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/the-only-thing-more-intricate-than-mr-robots-plot-its-real-world-puzzle/">might use to hide important information in plain sight</a>.
</p><p>The site stayed like that, to little wider notice or suspicion, until August 8, when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1eo3ddx/black_mesa_now_has_its_own_website_featuring_a/">Valve fans</a> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1eoagpo/what_we_know_so_far_valve_leaks_black_mesa_web/">social media</a> began to <a href="https://twitter.com/HL_Alyx_NoVR/status/1821870694927606026">"[wake] up to a Black Mesa website"</a> that had suddenly been updated with a new header declaring, "Science requires process. Our insight defends it." Others on social media were <a href="https://twitter.com/blapman007/status/1821886779693166989">quick to note the old cipher text</a> as a well as <a href="https://twitter.com/blapman007/status/1821886790598369404">a new, obfuscated JavaScript countdown function</a> with <a href="https://x.com/ImPeQu/status/1821930270586499121">the internal name "Lambda Incident"</a>. That countdown seemed to be pointing toward <em>something</em> happening on September 30, which seems like as good a time as any to announce <em>Half-Life 3</em>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ImPeQu/status/1821916164357771630">right</a>?</p>

<p>The Valve faithful hoping this was a new version of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/04/why-complaints-about-valves-portal-2-arg-miss-the-point/">the old <em>Portal 2</em> Potato ARG</a> had their hopes quickly dashed, though. Internet sleuths soon found a digital paper trail for Charles Fracchia, a research scientist who is <a href="https://fas.org/expert/charles-fracchia/">listed</a> on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/%3Ca%20href=">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.isac.bio/charles">elsewhere</a> as the founder of "Black Mesa, a stealth company developing technologies that create provable assurance for advanced manufacturing workflows" since back in 2022. And by last Friday, the Black Mesa team <a href="https://blackmesa.com/resonance-cascades">put up a blog post</a> quashing any game-related rumors that might be circulating.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>"As much as we would be honored to be part of any Valve game—we do not work in this sector at all," the blog post reads. "We are not secretly working on <em>Half-Life 3</em>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/valve/comments/1ek5yw9/valve_is_currently_developing_a_new_game/">Project White Sands</a> (whatever that is/may be) or any other Valve title—we're just nerds working to secure the global bioeconomy." </p>
<p>The team went on to thank the Half-Life community that had sent in "a ton of messages of support and curiosity" about the company, as well as "thousands of fake inquiries" that "made us laugh." As for that old ciphertext? Turns out solving it <a href="https://twitter.com/blapman007/status/1821886785795887461">simply unlocked a recruitment message</a> seeking "engineers, cybersecurity professionals, and biologists" for the company. "KingPotatoVII please reach out, we've been trying to send you some swag for cracking the cipher a while back," the Black Mesa team wrote with a smiley face emoji.</p>

<p>Despite the revelation of the <em>real</em> Black Mesa corporation, some hangers-on haven't quite given up hope that this is all still just an extremely subtle bit of stealth marketing. "What if [actual scientist Charles Fraschia] is such a huge fan of <em>Half-Life</em>, like us, and decided to use his image/likeness to do this ARG for the game?" one Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1ent51e/what_if_this_charles_fracchia_guy_is_an_actual/">wrote last week</a>. "Maybe he reached out and absolutely went full madlad with Valve to make this a magnum opus of an ARG. ... Could be simply someone is heavy trolling us, and to be honest I’m not even mad because this is fun af!"</p>
<p>Keep hope alive, Valve faithful! <em>Half-Life 3</em> is obviously just around the corner, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/08/half-life-3-is-not-in-the-works-says-valve-voice-actor/">no matter what anyone says</a>! The truth is out there for those with eyes to see it!

            <p>
Call of Duty has become an absolute hard drive hog in recent years, with 2023's entry managing to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3s-up-to-200gb-file-sizes">consume over 200GB of storage</a> in some cases. That all might be about to change, however, as Activision has announced major changes to the way it'll be handing installs with this year's Black Ops 6, promising "smaller and more customised downloads" as a result.
</p>
<p>
Activision shared the news in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-optimizing-experience-roadmap">post on its Call of Duty blog</a>, explaining its optimisation work will begin with a revamp of "the experience formerly known as Call of Duty HQ". This revamp is set to roll out over the course of several updates ahead of Black Ops 6's October launch, and will promises to introduce a streamlined interface, direct access to games, more control over downloads, and expanded texture streaming technology to reduce file sizes.
</p>
<p>
A first update to reorganise game content arrives on 21st August. Then, following Black Ops 6's open beta on 30th August, a new user interface and other "remaining updates" are scheduled for mid-October. After these "larger initial updates", Activision says future Call of Duty downloads will decrease in size and existing files will take up less space on players' device.

<p>
Key to these plans is the decision to decouple Call of Duty: Warzone from other titles, meaning it'll no longer be installed by default. Instead, whenever players purchase an annual Call of Duty title, they'll only be required to install its files - but they can "opt in" to a Warzone install during that process, or download it separately at a future point.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, players will have new options where Call of Duty's expanded texture streaming tech is concerned. Activision says its new capabilities mean it can "cycle content that is less frequently used by players to a streaming cache, avoiding the need to download it directly to your device's storage". And once the tech is introduced, players can choose between Optimised streaming, which supplies high-fidelity graphical quality at the expense of higher internet bandwidth usage, or minimal streaming, which reduces graphical quality and bandwidth requirements.
</p>
<p>
Activision says the first update players will need to download as part of these changes is a "big one", but will ultimately see Call of Duty's footprint decrease due to its file optimisations. The publisher also notes this initial update will arrive for PlayStation 5 players across four separate downloads "due to differences in file organisation". There's more detail in Activision's blog, but the takeaway is a simple one. "As a result of these updates," the company writes, "Black Ops 6 will be a smaller download at launch than Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3."
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">certain tiers of Game Pass</a> on 25th October. And if you're curious about this year's Zombies mode, developer Treyarch has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treyarch-shows-off-call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-terminus-island-zombies-map-in-new-trailer">sharing initial details</a> over the last few weeks.

            <p>Life sim contender Inzoi is hoping to knock The Sims from its perch when it launches (supposedly) later this year. There will soon be an opportunity to judge whether that feat is likely. Krafton have announced that they're releasing a time-limited trial of Inzoi's character creator next week on August 20th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Inzoi: Character Studio will launch Tuesday, August 20th at 5am BST/9pm PT <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">via Steam</a> and will be available to play with until the same time on Monday, August 26th.
</p>
<p>Here's a trailer for the character creator:

<p>Yes, the characters are called zois.
</p>
<p>I like a good character creator, although I admit several MMOs have rendered me somewhat immune to the charms of Inzoi's particular art style in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-desert-closed-beta">the years since Black Desert Online</a>. I have other reasons to be interested in Inzoi though, including its driveable cars, editable city, and planned mod support at launch. If the character creator is the first thing I can play with, I'll take it.
</p>
<p>There's definitely space for a Sims competitor, both in my heart and in the marketplace at large. The Sims 4 is getting long in the tooth, long enough that EA are apparently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-5">working on their own sorta successor, Project Rene</a>. Life By You, Paradox's swing at the genre, ended in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-shutter-studio-tectonic-and-cancel-troubled-sims-competitor-life-by-you">11th hour cancellation</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paralives">Paralives</a> is promising and ambitious, but who knows if its small indie team can deliver or hit its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paralives-heats-up-the-race-to-be-the-next-sims-with-early-access-release-in-2025-confirms-no-paid-dlc">2025 Early Access release target</a>.
</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">plenty more screenshots of the Inzoi character creator over on that Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So some fan modders decided to recreate <em>MW2</em>'s online action and maps using <em>CoD4: MW Remastered. </em>And this mod, H2M, was set to arrive very soon.

Unfortunately, the project is not coming anytime soon, as Meta has officially confirmed that it has been put "on hold indefinitely." </p><p>A Meta spokesperson confirmed to IGN via email that the game has been put "on hold indefinitely." Additionally, the official Meta Quest VR YouTube account responded after users commented on a trailer for an upcoming Meta Quest game, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAmNSjF9Big&amp;lc=UgwielXvTo--EHoQY7x4AaABAg.A77ZzS0z8DOA7A-RrmuyA-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behemoth</a>, developed by Skydance Games. "GTA: San Andreas is on hold indefinitely while we both focus on other projects," Meta Quest VR's official YouTube account confirmed in the comments. "We look forward to working with our friends at Rockstar in the future."</p><p>GTA San Andreas VR was announced during Facebook Connect in October 2021. No gameplay footage or a release window was shown during the event. In <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/games-at-connect-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post highlighting games presented at the event</a>, Meta described GTA San Andreas VR as "a project many years in the making." </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/15/249154303-932851327587816-8092379224022713379-n-1723752133658.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A VR version of GTA San Andreas was announced at Facebook Connect in October 2021. | Image Credit: Meta</figcaption></figure></output><p>GTA San Andreas VR would not be the first time that Meta has provided a VR remake to a game, as the company previously worked with Armature Studio and Capcom to bring <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-vr-review">the original Resident Evil 4</a> to Meta Quest headsets. Additionally, GTA San Andreas VR would have been the second VR project Rockstar Games has worked on following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/10/la-noire-the-vr-case-files-review">L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files</a>, which was initially released in 2017 for the HTC Vive, before making its way onto Oculurs Rift headsets and PSVR in 2018 and 2019, respectively.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was originally released in 2004 for the PS2. Set in the early 1990s in the fictional southern California city of San Andreas, players control Carl "CJ" Johnson, who returns to his old neighborhood to investigate the murder of his mother.</p><p>GTA San Andreas' indefinite delay comes as Meta is losing billions of dollars in the VR gaming market.

Now available to preorder for $35 at Amazon ahead of its September 17 release date, this arcane cookbook contains over 60 recipes as well as accompanying details, illustrations, and photographs. It sounds like a lovely book, and if it's as awesome as the first Elder Scrolls cookbook, it could be quite popular. It also includes a travelogue with background details about the origin of each dish, exclusive illustrations, and original photography.</p><p>The hardcover book is a sequel to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elder-Scrolls-Official-Cookbook/dp/1683833988?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>wildly </em>popular 2019 Elder Scrolls cookbook</a>. Volume I wasn't just "popular for a gaming cookbook" either; it has more customer reviews on Amazon than possibly any other gaming book. It has garnered over 13,000 Amazon reviews with a 4.9/5-star average. Absurd. If you spend some time looking at gaming books on Amazon--art books, encyclopedias, cookbooks, etc.--you will quickly notice that the vast majority of titles come nowhere close to those numbers.

		<p>Vertigo Games is returning to their first big VR hit, announcing Arizona Sunshine Remake for Meta Quest 2 and 3, PSVR 2 and PC VR. The remake is coming out on 17th October, with pre-orders now live and a discounted upgrade price for owners of the original game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Arizona Sunshine Remake | Reveal Trailer | Meta Quest 2+3, PS VR2, Steam VR [ESRB]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Svid78o9GJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One of the biggest games from the early days of virtual reality gaming, Arizona Sunshine is now the better part of a decade old, and in danger of being left behind on current VR platforms. Sure, there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/arizona-sunshine-2-review/">a sequel that launched late last year</a>, but the original game was predominantly a PC VR game for early headsets, and then with ports to the original PSVR and Meta Quest.</p>
<p>The remake will be able to take advantage of the current crop of headsets, being built from the ground-up with an enhanced graphics engine to better utilise Quest 2 and 3, bring the game to PSVR 2 for the first time, and raise the limit of what PC VR can accomplish. There’s also improved VR combat and weapons, and a new mutilation and gore system.</p>


<p>Arizona Sunshine Remake will feature everything that was made for the first game, so there’s all the original DLC and updates bundled in – Dead Man DLC, The Damned DLC, Old Mine update, Trailer Park Update and the Undead Valley Update – and full support for four-player co-op in campaign and the horde mode.</p>
<p>In our original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/27/arizona-sunshine-playstation-vr-review/">Arizona Sunshine review,</a> Jim said, “If you’re serious about PlayStation VR and love first person shooters, Arizona Sunshine is a no-brainer. Mowing down mobs of the undead is immensely satisfying with a great spread of weapons and plenty of opportunities to have some fun. The campaign is well-paced, supplying small but welcome diversions to break up the action with little morsels of story here and there. At £33, some players will naturally want more bang for their buck, but the quality of content on offer here is fantastic. With the bar set even higher than before, it will be interesting to watch how developers try to emulate and improve upon Arizona Sunshine.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-foundations-beginner-box-helps-new-players-start<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in June, Wizards of the Coast announced the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> set, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-foundations-set-helps-bring-new-and-old-players-together" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Foundations</a>. It is a set designed to invite new players into the ubiquitous card game and bring back older cards beloved by series veterans. To that end, the publisher has announced new details on their upcoming Magic: The Gathering Foundations Beginner Box.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamingtrend.com/news/peak-inside-the-foundations-beginner-box-for-magic-the-gathering/">Gaming Trend</a>, the <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> Beginner Box will feature two Jumpstart half decks. This is to help teach new players the basics of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> and give them some hands-on experience with building a deck.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-beginner-box-cat-card-artwork.jpg?itok=Z8zkinxN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-beginner-box-cat-card-artwork.jpg?itok=_dzjyja5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The two half decks previewed in one of the <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> Beginner Box are themed around cats and vampires. The cat deck is mono white. The vampire deck is mono black. Alongside these two 20-card decks is a step-by-step guide booklet which will walk players through their first five turns.</p>
<p>Once this guided play tutorial is done, the box will provide players the means to express themselves. Alongside the two half decks are eight Jumpstart packets. Players can open two packets each, mix and match different themes, and build a full 40-card deck.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-beginner-box-vampire-card-artwork.jpg?itok=TDyBU1Vr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-beginner-box-vampire-card-artwork.jpg?itok=xVRcYwvj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> Beginner Box will contain the following:</p>
<ul><li>Two themed 20-card half decks</li>
<li>A tutorial guide booklet</li>
<li>Eight Jumpstart packets</li>
<li>Two playmats designed to show new players a standard game's layout</li>
<li>Two spindown dice to track life totals</li>
<li>A rules reference booklet</li>
</ul><p>There is some grounds for speculation on what other themes will be explored in other beginner boxes. Magic: The Gathering has been around for 30 years and has a rich history of creatures, characters, and settings. All of which can hook players in if presented in approachable package.</p>
<p><em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> will be available worldwide November 15.</p>

            <p>I am forever looking for a game to replace Transport Tycoon (or OpenTTD) in my affections. I know there are several railway management sims kicking around Steam, but I haven't found the one that does it for me yet. Could it be Railroad Corporation 2? It's a train tycoon game in which you lay tracks through the early 20th century, and it's launching in Early Access on September 9th.

<p>If you've ever played any of these games, you know what do. You build a choo-choo empire as you lay tracks, buy trains, hire staff, and seek to effeciently transport goods between various towns and trade depots. Railroad Corporation 2 then adds an extra wrinkle with its turn-of-the-century setting, in which you must continue to upgrade your stock to stay ahead of your competition as electrification revolutionises the railway.
</p>
<p>Expansion means more than just laying more tracks in front of your moving train, but also growing the cities you're ferrying goods between by building factories, hospitals, banks, and power plants to supply your infrastructure.
</p>
<p>There's not a lot of detail about its planned Early Access journey on its Steam page, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1677970/view/6892282513992386794">the announcement</a> does say it'll be polished and expanded "over the course of the year". At launch it'll include four campaign missions, and online multiplayer with up to four players in either co-op or versus modes.
</p>
<p>I confess, the first Railroad Corporation passed me by in 2019, but it has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/797400/Railroad_Corporation/">respectable rating from user reviews on Steam</a>. Hopefully the sequel doesn't need bricking up in a tunnel like a naughty engine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You'll then spend your time hopping between these various planes on a grand, cartoon adventure.

<p>It now has a release date: September 17th.

<p>Plucky Squire is from Jonathan Biddle, one of the makers of 2018's Sword Of Ditto, a game of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-swords-of-ditto-review">many splendid ideas but mixed execution</a>. Sounds like the perfect person to get a second swing at something. This time, Biddle has co-founded new studio All Possible Futures with former Game Freak artist James Turner and they're partnered again with Ditto publisher Devolver Digital.
</p>
<p>Plucky Squire also made it onto our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-75-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2024">most anticipated games of 2024</a>. 
</p>
<p>I think you can look at the trailer above and go, cor, yeah, that'll be anticipated because of the art, the animation, the energy and all that, but no. I think it's because it's coherent. A 2D guy who pops into a 3D world? Seen it, done it. A <em>storybook</em> guy who pops into the world external to the book? That's ludonarrative cohesion, bud, and we games journalists can't get enough of it. We'll slash some Zelda enemies with a sword until we're dusty skeletons if it's hung inside some sort of clever-clever context.
</p>
<p>What's that? You think I'm <em>already</em> a dusty skeleton? No argument here. I hope The Plucky Squire is as joyful to play as it is to look at when it launches in a month's time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There’s a deck of cards adorned with some gorgeous art, a game-accurate light-up lyrium dagger that’s hopefully not sharp enough to actually hurt anyone, and a lovely cloth map of the fictional world of Thedas. But the listing on BioWare’s store page says, in big bold letters, that it doesn’t include <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, whether in a steel book case or as a digital download code. It is just a bunch of game-related stuff, without the game itself. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/xbox-series-x%7Cs/products/dragon-age-the-veilguard-rooks-coffer-edition---xbox-series-x/B414808A.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/xbox-series-x%7Cs/products/dragon-age-the-veilguard-rooks-coffer-edition---xbox-series-x/B414808A.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameStop</a></span>, meanwhile, is selling Rook’s Coffer with the game bundled in, and that’s a decent enough half-measure, though it naturally bumps the price up.

I look at this approach and wonder why we’re not calling companies on their shit when they try and pretend these big boxes of doodads aren’t the collector’s editions we’ve always pre-ordered and shoved into a closet after launch, only without the game itself. Why are these packages only getting more distanced from the game themselves?</p><figure id="" data-id="fb85c49950643c40daa2be2d3220ba24" data-recommend-id="image://fb85c49950643c40daa2be2d3220ba24" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dragon Age: The Veilguard's &quot;Rook's Coffer&quot; contents." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dragon Age: The Veilguard's &quot;Rook's Coffer&quot; contents." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb85c49950643c40daa2be2d3220ba24" data-recommend-id="image://fb85c49950643c40daa2be2d3220ba24" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dragon Age: The Veilguard's &quot;Rook's Coffer&quot; contents." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Not every special edition in recent memory has omitted the main event, but a lot of companies have gotten more comfortable calling something a collector’s edition or selling something that looks like one without putting a game in the box. BioWare alone has been phasing out physical game copies from special editions in the decade since we last got a <em>Dragon Age</em> game. <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>’s collector’s edition had a whole-ass remote-controlled car and a steel book, but you would find no video game or download code in the box. The <em>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</em>’s “Legendary Cache” had a wearable N7 helmet, a steel book, and other things to fill your walls and shelves, but no way to actually play the three remasters. It feels like if you don’t call it a “collector’s edition,” you can get away with leaving out the game, but it still ends up being positioned as such by the companies selling it, even if it doesn’t have the label.<br></p><p>Even if a special edition includes the game through a digital code, it feels antithetical to the inherently physical nature of buying a special edition. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-dlc-review-1851097244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-dlc-review-1851097244"><em>God of War: Ragnarök</em></a></span> pulled the same thing when it included a digital code alongside a steel book case, and now I have that (admittedly beautiful) piece of metal on my shelf with nothing inside it. This is another half-measure, and one that doesn’t help people who live in rural areas with poor internet speeds. When I lived in small-town Georgia, it sure wasn’t fun to have to stare at my Thor hammer replica while I waited for Kratos and Atreus’ next adventure to download to my PS5 over the course of an entire day. But that’s what happens when you spend hundreds of dollars on physical editions for games that don’t even include a physical copy of the game.</p><p>While there are likely arguments to be made about manufacturing costs and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ask-kotaku-do-you-still-prefer-physical-games-1844822211&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ask-kotaku-do-you-still-prefer-physical-games-1844822211">growing push for easily erasable digital libraries</a></span> above all else, collector’s editions were always meant to be an extension of a game, not something entirely separate from them. It feels like companies are trying to get around those expectations by not calling these boxes of toys and replicas “collector’s editions,” but we know what these things actually are. I’d be more incentivized to buy your box of cool things if I knew the game that inspired every collectible was also on the way when I got the shipping notification. If nothing else, I guess this saves me from spending too much money on a game I might not even like. Now we’ll see if <em>The Veilguard </em>possesses me to buy another box of shit I have no space for after the fact.</p><p>,</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">It's still a Halo-style arena shooter with portals, but what has surprised me most about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splitgate-2/" data-ref-id="5000-635888">Splitgate 2</a> is how much <em>more</em> there is to go with that idea. With its new iteration of the game, developer 1047 Games has dialed in elements that help build out the game's identity, complementing what was already there with some new additions that help Splitgate 2 feel different from most other shooters on the market.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of its closed alpha, I played Splitgate 2 for about four hours, some of that with other members of the GameSpot crew to field a full squad of four. The preview we played wasn't everything the game will have to offer, but it did provide a solid look at the way new elements are pairing with old ones from the original Splitgate to help give the sequel even more of a specific, unique identity.</p><p dir="ltr">As mentioned, the underlying idea is the same: Splitgate is a free-to-play competitive multiplayer first-person shooter where the arena is covered in special walls, and on those walls, you can place portals. Shoot a portal at one wall and another at a second wall and you create a gateway that lets you enter one and exit the other, instantly traveling across the map. You can also shoot <em>through </em>the portals and chase opponents through their portals, which leads to a ton of fun ideas and chaos among people who know how to use the portals effectively as part of their competitive strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">Not much has changed about the portal element in Splitgate 2, except that 1047 Games has simplified it. Firing a portal is now handled with a single button (rather than using two like the first game). Portals come in two colors--gold and purple--and in the original game, which color portal you fired was determined by its own button, requiring you to shoot both to create a complete pathway but allowing you to do things like "triple portal" by going halfway through one side of a portal and changing its exit by shooting the other to a new place. Splitgate 2 has a new "smart portal system" that does most of that thinking for you, so you can just tap one button and not have to think about the colors so much. Splitgate 2 still allows for closer control of your portals if you need it, and we didn't do much triple portaling in our session to really test the system, but even our limited amount of messing with it suggested that the streamlined approach makes it a lot easier to do fun and ridiculous things with portals.</p><p dir="ltr">The underlying shooter mechanics are a bit on the Halo-ish side; there's no aiming down sights, for instance, but just a short zoom for most weapons, and each arena spawns in power weapons like a rocket launcher or powerful submachine gun that can give one team a significant, if temporary, advantage over the other. The original Splitgate also had some sci-fi elements, like a jetpack that gives you a bit of short-lived verticality to complement your portal abilities.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350963-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350963" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350963-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350963"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350963-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Splitgate 2 works with all those underlying elements intact, avoiding messing too much with what already worked. Instead, the sequel fleshes out everything that's not the core gunplay-and-portals idea. Movement is a little faster and more fluid, with more options like a slide ability. You can mod weapons to push one stat or another to match your specific playstyle or approach. And you can now use a light class system to give yourself a specialization on a team, like running-and-gunning or supporting your squad, to add a little variety to the way Splitgate 2 plays--without drastically altering the core feeling.</p><p dir="ltr">It's in those class abilities that Splitgate 2 began to impress. I already liked the main idea of portaling around a map to get into fast and intense firefights, and seeing experts put portals to work alongside Splitgate 2's slides, twitchy jumps, and jetpack bursts is always a bit dazzling. With the class abilities, alongside some adjustments to how game modes work, Splitgate 2 puts a greater emphasis on teamwork, while amplifying the game's tendency to create standout moments and surprising plays. And even in our limited playtime, we saw quite a few of them.</p><p dir="ltr">Splitgate 2 sports three classes, referred to as factions in the game, that each have a slightly different focus. The Aeros faction focuses on fast movement and flanking, with a main, short-lived ability that boosts your health over max while increasing your movement speed, a stim that can heal you quickly after a fight, and a disc you can throw at opponents to stun and slow them so you can take advantage of your speed.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meridian faction mostly plays support, dropping either healing grenades or an area-of-effect dome that speeds up time for you and your team--quickening your fire rates, reload speed, and health regeneration--while slowing down time for your opponents. They also can fire off a wallhack ping that lets you see opponents through walls, which sounds overpowered until you recognize that players can and often are wormholing their way around the map with portals. Finally, the Sebrask faction takes a more militaristic approach, with weapons that fire a little more slowly but hit harder than others, and the ability to throw either a sticky frag grenade or a smoke grenade that can short-circuit portals. Sebrask's main ability is a deployable forcefield that blocks enemy bullets but not friendly ones, giving the class a more defensive posture.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350964-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350964" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350964-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350964"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350964-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While the different factions all play a little differently from each other, the key elements of how Splitgate works keep them from being too powerful. None of the classes are so strong that you can't drop them in a few shots thanks to Splitgate 2's fairly quick time-to-kill, and even the slowest faction, Sebrask, is still pretty fast. All players use portals, sprinting, jetpacking, and sliding to fight, and while each faction has slightly different options for weapons, passive perks, and abilities, the speed with which you can kill or be killed and your agility in getting around act as solid equalizers.</p><p dir="ltr">The factions do a great job in giving players incentives to work together and take on particular roles on a team, though, and Splitgate 2's best advancement over the original formula is pushing more teamwork and less lone-wolf play. That's done both through the class system and with Splitgate 2's approach to game modes. We only played two modes during the preview session--team deathmatch and Hotzone, Splitgate's take on King of the Hill--but both have been tweaked for both a greater focus on teamwork and to help create breakout gameplay moments.</p><p dir="ltr">In both cases, the game modes are separated into multiple rounds. In deathmatch, that means the first team to score 15 kills wins the round; the match then resets and both teams start again, until one team wins three rounds. The approach tends to give a losing team the chance to regain ground and turn a loss into a win, rather than suffer a lengthy pummeling. It also equalizes the match, since power weapons spawn on the same timer in each round.</p><p dir="ltr">In Hotzone, the round approach heavily pushes teamwork, thanks to adjustments in how teams score points and how respawning works. Like in other King of the Hill game modes in other games, the idea is to hold a specific piece of territory for a set amount of time, with a team scoring a point for "capturing" the territory--three captures wins the round. But unlike in other modes, both teams share a capture timer, meaning one team can sit on a control point for 29 of the required 30 seconds, and the other team can swoop in, kill them, and grab that last second on the timer to get the point. It's a pretty brilliant adjustment to the mode, encouraging teams to either think defensively to hold the zone or try for a last-second, heroic team strike using their portals and abilities in concert.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350970-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot5_frontierfpv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350970" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350970-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot5_frontierfpv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350970"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350970-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot5_frontierfpv.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350971-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot4_ozone.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350972-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot_zenithinterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350973-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot_zenithexterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350974-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350971,1300-4350972,1300-4350973,1300-4350974" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4350971-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot4_ozone.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4350972-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot_zenithinterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4350973-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot_zenithexterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4350974-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350971-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot4_ozone.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350972-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot_zenithinterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350973-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot_zenithexterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350974-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Complicating matters is the respawn timer, which starts at five seconds and then increases over the course of a round to a total of 20 seconds. That cuts players' abilities to just keep throwing themselves at the hotzone over and over, and instead requires coordination in order to make an effective push against an entrenched team. However, if your team racks up kills while you're respawning, the timer gets cut by three seconds with each kill, so there's an incentive to keep fighting. Coupled with the round-based approach, the Hotzone adjustments made for some ridiculous moments in our play session, as well as deflating losses because our team hadn't thought through our strategy and were easily bested by a more-coordinated group.</p><p dir="ltr">Throughout the play session, Splitgate 2 was a lot of fun, however. It manages the original's feel of being easy to pick up but offering a high skill ceiling, and all the adjustments between the games feel like natural outgrowths of the underlying arena-shooter ideas. Just having portals available in a competitive shooter makes for a lot of chaos. But the adjustments to Splitgate 2's gameplay modes and the addition of team abilities feel like both complements to and checks against the potential for better players to overwhelm you with their cunning use of teleportation and quick movements. It's clear 1047 Games has thought deeply and critically about its game beyond its initial gimmick, and it was surprising how well all the pieces worked together in unison.</p><p dir="ltr">What I liked best about Splitgate 2 was how much of an identity it brings to the competitive shooter space. It harkens back to a very specific era in shooter history and is obviously greatly influenced by games like Halo, Unreal Tournament, and Tribes, but it also feels very different from everything else in the shooter field right now. It's a fast, intense shooter with a lot of great design ideas working in concert, and at least across four hours, it felt like a worthy successor to and an advancement over the original game.</p>

		<p>2022’s bizarre indie hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/trombone-champ/">Trombone Champ</a> is being all its slidey trombone shenanigans to VR later this year, with Trombone Champ: Unflattened set to launch across Meta Quest, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2</a> and Steam VR this autumn.</p>
<p><iframe title="Trombone Champ: Unflattened | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NCtd5i_qchk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Trombone Champ: Unflattened comes from Flat2VR Studios, a studio that is all about translating flat screen games into virtual reality.</p>
<p>In this case it’s a pretty big reimagining that, instead of having your toot happy Mii-alike character on screen and notes moving from right to left, you will pick up a virtual trombone and actually move the slide around yourself. It is… well, it’s an awful lot closer to playing an actual trombone than you might expect.</p>
<p>The game will feature a playful narrative involving baboons and absurd, laugh-out-loud moments”, while also featuring a slew of weird trombones (including one with a fish replacing the bell), and customisation options to recolour your instrument.</p>

<p>Let's Build A Dungeon marries the business aspects of Game Dev Tycoon with a more hands-on approach to constructing your company's game, and there's a first trailer below.

<p>Players will need to hire designers, coders and testers to staff their development studio, but also place buildings and trees to populate the fantasy game-within-a-game, as well as filling dungeons with traps and chests to keep virtual players busy and happy and paying their monthly subscription.
</p>
<p>I feel like the quintessential management game anecdote is making the chips more salty in Theme Park so that customers would buy more soda - whether or not that was actually possible in the game - and I hope something similar is true of Let's Build A Dungeon. I want to make the final dungeon boss incredibly difficult to defeat so that players never feel as if they've truly finished the game, until we've added a new dungeon with a new hard boss, and then we can go back and nerf the old one.
</p>
<p>Apparently you can playtest your RPG to experience it as an actual player would, and there's enough of an toolset here that you can also create your own story, dialogue and cutscenes, then share your creation with other real players to try. Wild.

If you’re less experienced or simply want to relax as you build your perfect homestead, you can do that. If you want to take on the challenge of exploring caves and temples, you can do that too. You can play solo or with up to four players in co-op. It’s all up to you.</p><p>That freedom of choice starts right at the beginning of the game. Once you’ve designed your character, you’ll start a new life on Luma Island with nothing but some tools and a small trailer to sleep in. After a quick tutorial, your first major task will be to visit the nearby town to pick your profession. You’ll have seven options to choose from: cook, brewer, treasure hunter, blacksmith, fisherman, jewelrycrafter, and archeologist.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/07/town-at-night-1723060244991.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>This choice is more than just some flavor for your character, it’s an important decision that will determine your character’s goals, some of which are tougher than others. Each profession is clearly labeled with a difficulty level, so you won’t be choosing blindly. Picking a starting profession also doesn’t lock you out of the others. You can be all seven professions if you’d like. Your first choice is free, but from that point on, adding new professions will cost in-game money. If you’re playing co-op, everyone can choose their own separate profession; you’re not locked into following the same path as your friends.</p><p>The easiest professions — such as cook and brewer — are focused on gathering materials on your homestead. You’ll use an axe to gather wood and a pickaxe to gather stone, then use those materials to build craft benches like a sawmill or kiln. You’ll then use these craft benches to turn your wood and stone into more complicated materials, which will then be used to create more advanced recipes.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/07/beginning-farm-1723060244988.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Upgrading your tools will make it easier to gather rare materials, which open up even more things you can make. And using a hoe, you can turn patches of grass into farmable land, where you can plant and water seeds to grow crops. That gives you full control over how far your homestead expands.</p><p>This gameplay loop means you’ll consistently have new goals to work toward to master your profession and expand your homestead. If you focus on farming and gathering, you won’t find yourself in dangerous situations very often, making these professions the ideal choice for new gamers or people who want a simple, relaxing experience. You’ll be spending your time gathering, building, planting, and enjoying the game’s vibrant environments and soothing soundtrack.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/07/heavily-built-farm-during-day-1723060244990.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If you’re a more experienced player or are looking for more of a challenge, the hardest professions — such as jewelrycrafter and archeologist — will be more your speed. These professions require searching for loot in Luma Island’s dangerous caves and temples, which have traps and wild animals that will attack on sight. So you’ll need to have a whip at the ready.</p><p>Temples and caves have different rewards and provide different challenges. For example, temples might be full of traps that require you to pay attention to your surroundings. Caves are pitch black and require you to craft torches and strategically place them so you can see where you’re going and where you might get attacked. They each have a different way of keeping you on your toes, but they also hold unique rewards like new blueprints and particularly valuable loot. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/07/spike-trap-in-a-temple-1723060244990.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If you die while in a cave or temple, you’ll lose some of the resources you gathered during that trip. When you enter them, a new section of the HUD will be added that says “lost on death.” As you might expect, you’ll lose the items displayed in that section if you die. Luckily, if you ever get to a point where you want to evacuate a dungeon, each room provides a way for you to escape without having to backtrack all the way to the beginning.</p><p>This temple exploration can also lead you to solve the big mystery of the island. In town, there’s a sealed temple that you need ancient keys to open. Completing temples in each zone will reward you with tablets that will open that zone’s final sanctuary. There, you can find the ancient keys needed to open the sealed temple. What lies within? You’ll just have to figure that out for yourself.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/07/snow-area-1723060244990.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Regardless of what profession you choose, you’ll need some help from magical creatures called Lumas. You get them by finding and hatching Luma Eggs, and there are 15 unique Lumas in the game. Once they’ve hatched, they’ll help you find treasure and provide you with Luma Energy, a resource that is needed for recipes of all professions.</p><p>Ultimately, Luma Island is all about giving you options and letting you choose how you want to play it. Alone, with friends, as one profession, as all of them, or anywhere in between. It’s developed and self-published by indie studio Feel Free Games, will be available on PC, and is planned to release later this year. You can wishlist the game on <u>Steam</u> or join the community on <u>Discord</u>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
