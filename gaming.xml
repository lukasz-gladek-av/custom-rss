			<p>If there's one thing that should be known about me, it's that <strong>I am a Trekkie</strong>. You can keep your <strong>Obi-Wan</strong>, the <strong>Solos</strong>, and the <strong>Skywalkers</strong>. I will pick <strong>Jean-Luc Picard</strong>, <strong>Benjamin Sisko</strong>, and <strong>Kathryn Janeway</strong> every day of the week. That's what makes <strong>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</strong> such a compelling title to me. Even if I hadn't been sent a copy to review, I would have bought this because, as I've said, Star Trek.</p>



<p>Now, with my love of the source material out in the open, I'm going to say that <strong>this has the potential to really work for Trek fans, particularly fans of the Voyager voyage</strong>, but there are elements of it that may put people off. Before I start, though, I want to say how much I love listening to the Voyager theme on the main menu.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Star-Trek-Voyager-Across-the-Unknown-Review-02-Voyager-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Let's get the actual story out of the way. <strong>It's Star Trek: Voyager</strong>. The initial cutscenes show the Voyager getting yeeted to the Delta Quadrant, and you take over from there. Throughout the story, <strong>you have opportunities to change how it plays out</strong>. The first choice can actually finish your playthrough in a matter of minutes; will you use the caretaker's relay to send you back? It is an option, but one that takes away from exploring "what could have been".</p>



<p>Sometimes these choices are key parts of the core timeline; other times, side-quests that cover the filler episodes, and it can result in you getting crew members that were only vaguely touched upon in the show. Tuvix, or two versions of B'Elanna (I got those), or another is the extremely well-remembered <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Pelk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pelk</a>. Sometimes, <strong>your decisions can also result in you getting technology that can be a massive boost elsewhere in the game</strong>, helping you through some moments where you are meant to fail.</p>



<p><strong>It's something I genuinely enjoy about Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</strong>. I don't remember all the events of the show; it's been a few years since I re-watched it, but there are elements I remember, and being able to change events and make my own journey is something that I find really compelling. Could I have done a better job than Janeway? Would I have gotten rid of Tuvix? The answers are maybe, and yes, yes, I would.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Star-Trek-Voyager-Across-the-Unknown-Review-03-Tuvix-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>It's difficult for me to mark down the game when it comes to story for the simple reason that it has the story of an excellent show to follow, and even expand on, and it does that well. <strong>Now we come to where Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown will likely put a number of people off</strong>, and that's the presentation of this story, and, arguably, a chunk of the gameplay around it.</p>



<p><strong>The story is presented almost universally in text</strong>. At the start of each chapter (sector), you'll get a little voiceover from what I believe are the original actors who played Tom Paris and Tuvok, and that's the extent of any audio dialogue. Everything else is in text, and that could - and likely will - put some people off. We're talking adventure-game or choose-your-own-story book levels of text.</p>



<p><strong>Every choice is text-based</strong>, with a percentage success chance based on varying factors - from a character's level to the level of a certain room within your ship (more on that later). <strong>There are also away-team missions, which are - again - text-based affairs</strong>, with you being given three options of what to do, and your chance of success is based on the ability of the character (or multiple) you choose to take the action, provided they have that particular ability.</p>



<p>Now, that is at least somewhat tactical. <strong>You are shown before you select the characters which abilities you are going to be able to choose from in the event, so you can plan ahead</strong>, since every time you use a character, they will be fatigued for the next step, meaning it is always best to rotate and give yourself the best chance to get through an event. Even better when you level up your characters, keep morale high, and their skills can net you an even bigger success, giving you extra rewards and experience.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Star-Trek-Voyager-Across-the-Unknown-Review-04-Away-Team-Success-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Outside of the text-heavy gameplay, <strong>there is a bit of combat</strong>. Again, it's a little tactical. You can choose which part of an enemy ship to target and assign energy to different elements of your ship. You can also order your ship to protect a certain side if the shields have been knocked out. <strong>It's a shame you don't have direct control over your ship</strong>, as there are times when it seems to be unable to circle an enemy, something that seems to happen all the time when facing larger enemies like Borg cubes.</p>



<p>Would it have been nice to have had full control over the ship? Of course, though, with the clear budget offering of Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown, <strong>I'm not going to hold it against it.</strong> I could also argue that, narratively, you are Captain Janeway, and she gave orders to the crew; she didn't take control and fly the Voyager herself. We're getting into Star Trek: Bridge Crew levels of detail now, though.</p>



<p>This is to say that the combat is quite hands-off, but it works. Which brings us to the other core aspect of the game, <strong>survival and exploration</strong>. Each sector has a number of systems for you to move between, letting you pop to different systems, asteroid belts, or other points of interest, to gather resources. <strong>I would argue the game likely goes a little too far with its resource management</strong>, with 10 different resources to keep track of. You can add another three if you count crew, the number of worker crews (needed to build, repair, or upgrade rooms), and your crew's morale.</p>



<p>Add to this resource caps, unless you build storage rooms for the four core resources, bio labs for borg nanites, and another, the impact on morale if you don't have enough beds for your crew, and more, and <strong>it becomes a fraught balancing act</strong>. Especially as you're wanting to upgrade rooms for extra benefits, upgrade your engine for more power, and essentially turn Voyager into a superweapon.</p>



<p>Adding to this balancing act is the fact that <strong>if you stay in a sector for too long, morale starts to deteriorate as the crew becomes increasingly homesick</strong>. Of course, if you're like me, you want to stay in a system as long as possible, as you can use the free time to research even more scientific advancements, essentially farming to buff yourself for the endgame.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Star-Trek-Voyager-Across-the-Unknown-Review-05-Science-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Much like other similar survival games, of which <strong>FTL: Faster than Light</strong> is the only one I can currently think of, it is a balancing act, and you need to decide what's best for you and your crew. I will say that <strong>I genuinely enjoyed the time I've spent playing Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</strong>, and there will be a reasonable amount of replay value in discovering where the side-stories and the paths not taken lead.</p>



<p>If I have two criticisms, and I do, it's that <strong>the side characters I had survive seem to be done dirty in the end credits</strong>. The actual surviving characters of the show get their text outtros, explaining how they fared, and the characters who didn't survive in the actual series get what feels like a perfunctory "Janeway swelled with pride as they lived happily ever after". The remaining criticism is that, <strong>aesthetically, it's a mixed bag</strong>. The UI is a bit clunky, and visuals in combat feel like they were just the still models downsized. A minor thing that didn't honestly bother me, I play Football Manager after all, but some may have an issue.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Overall, <strong>I do genuinely enjoy Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</strong>. I am certainly the target audience: someone who loves Star Trek, someone who likes playing this sort of tactical game, and someone who is a fan of these types of stories. If you're some of the above, I would say <strong>give the game a go</strong>, even if it isn't a masterpiece.</p>

					<h2>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown is a text and story-heavy trek that follows the story of Voyager as it returns from the Delta Quadrant, but allowing you to change the events of the story in a game that has impactful choices wrapped around an FTL-style survival game and copious amounts of resource management. Not a masterpiece, the sum feels like more than the whole, though I will admit my view may be clouded as a fan of Star Trek, Voyager and the genre.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Well detailed story, with a number of branching elements, with even side-stories feeling valuable to explore and complete.
</li><li>Good resource management, if possibly a bit much for some, that fits in well with the survival theme of the game.
</li><li>Offers a good tactical range, particularly in building, which can make you self-sufficient in some resources. Makes you think &amp; plan.</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Aesthetically a mixed bag, with a clunky UI and somewhat choppy combat visuals.
</li><li>The ship in combat can seem to take your orders as vague suggestions.
</li><li>End credits of non-surviving (in the show) characters feel perfunctory.</li>						</ul>

<p>A new video has emerged showcasing a Rainbow Six Siege exploit that can take over your entire screen. </p>



<p>The developers of Rainbow Six Siege recently revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-year-11-roadmap-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Year 11 roadmap</a>, which features “more Siege, more often”. As we wait for the R6 Invitational to end, players have spotted a new exploit that can completely block the player’s field of view. Learn more about it below. </p>



<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-exploit-uses-charlie-kirk-image-for-screen-disruption">Rainbow Six Exploit Uses Charlie Kirk Image for Screen Disruption</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege player Bikini Bodhi has posted a new video on their official <a href="https://x.com/BikiniBodhi/status/2023840148581216684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), showcasing the image exploit. In the video, we see Bodhi running and talking to his team when he is suddenly flashed with an image of Charlie Kirk’s face swapped with IShowSpeed. The image takes over Bodhi’s entire screen, making it a massive disadvantage for the player. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the comments section, Bodi was asked whether this was a new cheat or a stream thing. He responded that this is not a cheat but an exploit, where the player can link their name to an image. This image can then pop up and cover the opponent’s entire screen, leaving them in the dark. </p>



<p>This is not the first time Rainbow Six Siege players have been experiencing full-screen disruptions caused by image pop-ups. Back in 2022, players were seeing lewd and gore-filled images popping up that were blocking almost the entire screen. </p>



<p>In other news, Solid Snake has been unveiled for Rainbow Six Siege’s ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solid-snake-rainbow-six-siege-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Operation Silent Hunt</a>.’ Additionally, the game’s creative director has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-creative-director-stepping-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped down from his role</a>.

<p>Pokémon fans have plenty to enjoy in 2026 with the franchise’s 30th anniversary, including the Pokémon Go Tour Kalos event that takes place right after Pokémon Day.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" id="52102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a>‘s annual tour event places focus on a specific region in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> history, and the Kalos tour follows on from a return to Lumiose City in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a/" id="2273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. As always, the event features the debut of new Pokémon and Shiny forms, so there is plenty to enjoy.</p>



<p>For all the details on when the Pokémon Go Tour Kalos takes place, and the exact times you will be able to play, Insider Gaming has everything you need to know.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-pokemon-go-tour-kalos">When is The Pokémon Go Tour Kalos?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shiny addition. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour Kalos starts on February 28 and runs until March 1, with millions of players across the world uniting to participate.</strong></p>



<p>Following in-person events in Los Angeles and Tainan, Go Tour Kalos is available virtually for all players worldwide, with both free and premium offerings.</p>



<p>The event puts Pokémon X and Y, which introduced the Kalos region, in the limelight, but there are also debuts from other regions. Mega Victreebell and Mega Malamar, both of which made their debut in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, are both available for the first time during the event.</p>



<p>Additionally, Shiny Diancie makes its Pokémon Go debut, alongside two special Pikachu variants wearing Calem’s hat or Serena’s hat. Both Pikachu variants have an increased chance of appearing in their Shiny form, along with the Kalos starter trio: Froakie, Chespin, and Fennekin.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-start-time-for-pokemon-go-tour-kalos">What is the Start Time For Pokémon Go Tour Kalos?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour Kalos begins at 10 AM local time on Saturday, February 28. The staggered release means players in Australia and the Oceania region will be the first to enjoy the new content.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike other platforms and games, there’s no way to change your region in Pokémon Go to access the content earlier than your scheduled release time. While there are some spoofing options available, they are against the Pokémon Go terms of service and could result in your account being banned.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-end-time-for-pokemon-go-tour-kalos">What is The End Time For Pokémon Go Tour Kalos?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour Kalos ends at 6 PM local time on Sunday, March 1. Again, the staggered release means players in the Oceania region see the event conclude earliest, while those in the Pacific will finish later.</strong></p>



<p>As already mentioned, there’s no way to change your region in Pokémon Go to give yourself more time to enjoy Go Tour Kalos, and it’s highly recommended that you don’t try to find a workaround.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Replaced, the highly-anticipated cyberpunk platformer from Sad Cat Studios, has been delayed.</p>
<p>Replaced is the rather wonderful looking 2.5D "retro-futuristic" sci-fi platformer, which is set in an alternate 1980s America that has been scarred by a nuclear catastrophe. It plops players into the shoes of Reach, an AI who becomes unexpectedly trapped inside a human's body.</p>
<p>But while we were once expecting to get our hands on Replaced next month, the developer has decided to delay its release a notch. In a statement, Sad Cat said while Replaced is "technically finished", it feels a few more weeks to get the game fully "polished, stable, and true to the vision we've shared with you" would be beneficial. As such, Replaced will now launch across PC and Xbox Series X/S on 14th April.</p>
<p>In the meantime while we wait, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highly-anticipated-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-gets-demo-and-you-can-play-it-this-week">there is a Replaced demo currently available to try out via Steam</a>. Sad Cat called the response to Replaced's demo thus far "the ultimate fuel" for the development team. "To be honest, putting it out there was nerve-wracking, but seeing your gameplay, reading your reviews, and hearing your excitement has been overwhelming in the best way possible," Sad Cat said in the statement announcing Replaced's delay.</p>
<p>"We are constantly reading your comments, and that feedback is helping us make the final tweaks that will make the full game shine."</p>
<p>Sad Cat closed by thanking its community for its "patience and support" in the years since Replaced was first unveiled. "Many of you have followed us on this journey every step of the way, and seeing your passion is what makes these final days and nights of development worth it," the studio said. "We are super close to the finish line and we can't wait for you to experience the final results of years of hard work."</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Replaced has had its release date moved. Back in 2022, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/belarusian-based-sat-cat-studio-delays-upcoming-game-due-to-russias-war-in-ukraine">studio was forced to delay Replaced due to the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>. Then, in 2023, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-into-2024">delayed into 2024</a>, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/25d-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-into-2025">delayed once more into 2025</a>.</p><p>I was recently lucky enough to go hands-on with Replaced. "I really think Replaced has the potential to be something special. I fully expect I will need tissues by the end of it, though, because I have theory about where things are going and well, yeah, emotions. And while emotions alone don't always count for much, it's the brutality and relevance of its dystopian setting that makes such a human heart matter," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/replaced-preview">Eurogamer's Replaced preview</a>.</p>

            <p>Despite what confused Call of Duty players who changed teams would have you believe, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is a notable modern military FPS that's doing <em>fine</em> a few months in, usual bumps in the road included. Now, Season 2 has finally arrived <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-until-february-but-more-content-for-season-1-and-events-are-on-the-way">following a delay</a>, and it's kickstarted new positive and negative discussions.</p>
<p>Even though more maps, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-getting-battlefield-4-map-golmud-railway">fan-favourites from past games</a>, are coming this season, the first phase of S2 is all about Contaminated, a sprawling new location that offers different type of engagements, from medium-range to combat in trenches to close-quarters chaos in closed environments. It's an especially good fit for the attack/defence structure of the classic mode Breakthrough, yet it also adds a new mechanic to the game that's giving some players a headache.</p>
<p>As teased in the explosive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQLakPdVhEc">gameplay trailer</a> released last week, chemical weapons are a key part of this season's narrative and gameplay. It means Contaminated features huge chemical chaos at certain points (as shown off in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZJMlK1rHz0">extensive gameplay videos</a> from prominent figures in the FPS space), as the new map's exterior areas are engulfed in giant gas clouds that force every player to use masks, which make return after being a crucial element of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>.</p>
<p>The problem? Some players are having trouble equipping them (whether it's due to messy key binds or bugs) or straight-up dislike the mechanic. On the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/">Steam forums</a> for the game, it's common to find posts like "Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?" and "Gas I'm not a fan of. Died too many times putting mask on and off." Meanwhile, others praise the new map and the different rhythm it brings: "Say what you want, but this season/patch is a huge step in the right direction, so I don’t understand all the hate and negative reviews."</p>

<p>It's the usual back-and-forth, really, perhaps exacerbated by the fact Battlefield 6 admittedly leaned a bit too heavily on a CoD-like vibe to onboard more players at launch, which led to much of the player base fighting over whether the game should borrow more from its biggest (and currently defeated) competitor or stick to what made the series special. So far, it looks like EA and Battlefield Studios are doubling down on large-scale warfare that brings it back even closer to the series' roots, but it's not surprising to see it lose part of its launch-months weight as its future comes into focus.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/">On Reddit</a>, however, the vibes are more positive even if the usual bugs and performance woes that big updates introduce need to be dealt with. "My faith in BF6 has been restored," a veteran said before listing a number of changes that made the game feel better beyond new additions like the aforementioned map and extra weapons. Many joined the chorus, praising the new brand of chaos that Contaminated has brought: "I liked the map... bushes, trenches, bunker... I love it." Some are even more optimistic after just <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/2022008332488146971?s=20">Phase 1 of S2</a>: "Battlefield Feels Like War Again, And That Is A Very Good Sign," a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1r760za/s2_battlefield_feels_like_war_again_and_that_is_a/">thread</a>'s title states.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the more realistic players are just wondering how long it'll be before the volatile community turns on the devs again: "How long does it take to be back at only hate posts on Reddit?" Immediately, many users suggested it would be a matter of hours or even minutes. Never change, Battlefield veterans. Never change.</p>

<p><em>Mewgenics</em>' success is perhaps even more impressive when considering that the game is a turn-based tactics title, and while that type of game definitely has its niche, it's fairly rare for tactical RPGs to achieve crossover success like this.</p><p>If you're wondering exactly what <em>Mewgenics </em>is, it's a mixture of tactical turn-based RPG and roguelite that involves breeding cats, then sending them out on dangerous missions to do battle with McMillen's signature grotesqueries.</p><p>The game offers more than a thousand unique abilities for you to discover, as well as a number of class "collars" that allow you to create teams of cats in order to take advantage of their ability synergies.</p><p>Not only that, but you can also look forward to over 900 items to collect, as well as "countless environmental interactions", ensuring that every run "throws fresh tactical puzzles at you".</p>

            <p>
Moon Beast have released a pre-alpha demo for their action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkhaven">Darkhaven</a>. You know, the one from the former Blizzard North devs, which harkens back to Diablo 2 while stirring in a dynamic world and terrain destruction reminiscent of Minecraft. I did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-hardest-game-in-the-world-to-make-how-darkhaven-hopes-to-rebottle-diablo-2s-lightning-by-channelling-minecraft">a big interview feature</a> about it. Now, you can play a very early build and decide whether I've been quaffing the Kool Aid.
</p>
<p>
I spent an hour with a Darkhaven build myself last week, and while it’s got a long way to go, I did have fun. It’s very Diablo, with familiar red and blue health and mana bulbs on the left, and its own version of Blizzard’s old paperdoll character equipment screen. The moment-to-moment is as you’d expect – enemies spawn like intrusive thoughts and you slaughter them for gear, using special abilities with a cooldown.
</p>
<p>
The immediate difference is that when you get into a louder fight, you often resculpt the geography by accident. Explosive spells and heavier weapons punch out foxholes and shatter walls, though certain quest-related or otherwise vital buildings are indestructible. I had a brawl that ended with myself and 10 hobgoblins trapped in a single, flaming crater.
</p>
<p>
I’ve also tangled with one of the gameworld’s vaunted dynamic events. I touched a sarcophagus in the woods that promptly spewed necro-pollen in all directions, slowly transforming the landscape into an undead kingdom. You’ll need to curb-stomp the lich at the centre of such outbreaks, or else give over your entire map to the Stygian powers. I didn’t play long enough for that to happen, but it nagged at my mind as I explored in the other direction, beating up trees with hyperactive roots that lock you in place.
</p>

<p>
So far, I think the equippables modestly bear out Moon Beast’s promise of “bold, expressive” loot that is worth holding onto and fooling around with, rather than trading to something with higher DPS every couple of minutes. I base this claim on the fact that I can actually remember a few of the dozens of weapons I acquired, without checking screens. There was a dagger that hit fast and lit things on fire. I also found some shoes that let me walk on water, the better to avoid those uppity trees. 
</p><p>
There are weapon rarities, and you can socket gems to mod their stats. It’s a purposefully slim selection next to the myriad flimflams and boondoggles of present-day Path Of Exile and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, though this is an early build and I’m sure the complexity will layer up. Also, you’ve got a jump and dodge button, with the ability to scramble over elevated objects, which makes this a little more immediate, closer to an action-platformer at times.
</p>
<p>
On the whole, I enjoyed my first hour in Darkhaven’s WIP world more than I enjoyed my first hour in Diablo 4, but I’m still waiting for the magic to kick in. The tactical applications of map destruction feel elementary so far: it’s mostly knocking down select dungeon walls to access treasure rooms, though I did spend a while slowly digging a moat around a boulder, so that I could aggro some toxic gnomes from safety. 
</p>
<p>
Moon Beast are hoping to put together worlds in which several global calamities might intersect, forcing you to undertake mighty defensive building projects; hours later, you might wander among the ivy-bound ruins of those earthen ramparts, identifying the exact place where the horde were repulsed. I would play such a game, but the fact that there’s a Kickstarter involved makes me cautious. You could pave a road to hell with broken Kickstarter promises.
</p>
<p>Moon Beast caution that the Darkhaven demo is at once more open-ended and ricketier than a "final quality" preview build. "The goal is simple: let you get hands-on with Darkhaven’s core gameplay and direction right now, and help us pressure-test what works as we move forward," they write.</p>
<p>"Yes, you’ll see rough edges, balance will shift, some things are still placeholder, and you may hit bugs," it continues. "But! You’ll also be playing a demo that’s closer to a real pre-alpha than a tiny curated slice."</p>
<p>The demo boasts "several hours" of play, with one character class, six skills across three trees, character progression capped at level 8, and one major world event (the Lich invasion) triggered via the main questline. There's multiplayer, too, but Moon Beast say that it's "our most experimental feature" and they might take it offline for tweaks. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571870/Darkhaven/">Find out more on Steam</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/</link>
            <guid>1439146</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/embark-studios/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/embark-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embark Studios</a> revealed its future plans for ARC Raiders, with the first four months of 2026 all laid out nicely with a roadmap. So far, fans enjoyed the smaller Headwinds release back in January, but it’s finally time for a bigger update, with Shrouded Sky on the horizon. </p>







<p>It’s these substantial updates that keep live-service titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> alive and kicking, and although Bird City was a fun distraction, the Rust Belt could do with some big changes. Well, it looks like those updates are inching ever nearer, as Shrouded Sky is set to soar into the game pretty soon.</p>



<p>Here’s when you can expect Shrouded Sky to arrive in ARC Raiders, as well as what content has been confirmed for the update.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-shrouded-sky-release-in-arc-raiders">When Does Shrouded Sky Release In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Embark Studios has confirmed that the Shrouded Sky update will arrive in ARC Raiders on February 24, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Whilst it may have been surprising to see some content for January back when the roadmap was revealed, it was February that everyone was excited for. </p>



<ul>
<li>More Insider Gaming: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders Event Tracker—Every Map Condition Schedule</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Shrouded Sky is expected to launch at the usual update times for ARC Raiders, but in case you’re unfamiliar with those, Insider Gaming has them listed down below:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">ARC Raiders Headwinds Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">1:30 AM—February 24</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">3:30 AM—February 24</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (EST)</td><td data-align="center">4:30 AM—February 24</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">9:30 AM—February 24</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">8:30 PM—February 24</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-shrouded-sky-confirmed-content-for-arc-raiders">All Shrouded Sky Confirmed Content For ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Halfway through already. Image by Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As announced with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a>, six new pieces of content can be expected to drop with the Shrouded Sky update for ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>These are the following: </p>



<ul>
<li>New Map Condition</li>



<li>New ARC Threat</li>



<li>Player Project</li>



<li>Raider Deck</li>



<li>Map Update</li>



<li>Expedition Window</li>
</ul>



<p>As things stand, only a small teaser trailer has been revealed online, showcasing a weather vane picking up some high speeds in the wind. A wind-based Map Condition would align with the small gust teaser image seen on the roadmap, but specifics are still up in the air.</p>







<p>It’s caused fans to erupt with new theories as to what the new Map Condition or Updates could be, with some suggesting that Buried City’s sand dunes could see some shifts under strong winds, uncovering hidden buildings and loot for raiders to find. </p>



<p>Check it out for your yourself down below.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for the rest of the content, speculation is at an all-time high. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-expedition-2-release-date-requirements-rewards-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-expedition-2-release-date-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Expedition Window</a> was already widely known, and the new Raider Deck will be a welcome addition for the game’s progression, as will the new Project. However, what they’ll include is anybody’s guess.</p>



<ul>
<li>More Insider Gaming: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-secret-loot-spots-you-need-to-know-in-arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/7-secret-loot-spots-you-need-to-know-in-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 Secret Loot Spots You Need To Know In ARC Raiders</a></li>
</ul>



<p>What fans are perhaps most excited for, though, is the New ARC Threat. Judging by the small teaser image, general suspicions are that a new airborne ARC will hit the game soon, with some suggesting it could even be a swarm-like enemy. </p>



<p>Once more updates are revealed for the Shrouded Sky update, Insider Gaming will refresh the article with the latest details. </p>

<figure><a title="BlazBlue Entropy Effect X Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162034/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/entropy">Entropy</a>, a scientific concept defined by randomness and disorder, is a fitting name for a roguelike.</p>
<p>Since <strong>BlazBlue</strong> began as a fighting game series it’s seen a multitude of spin-offs, now finding itself in the realm of 2D platform action and roguelike principles. Its whopping assembly of eighteen-playable-characters helm from various BlazBlue entries, including <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/blazblue_calamity_trigger">Calamity Trigger</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/blazblue_continuum_shift">Continuum Shift</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/blazblue_chrono_phantasma">Chrono Phantasma</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/blazblue_centralfiction_special_edition">Central Fiction</a>. And, impressively, each has a completely independent and idiosyncratic combat style, even if the actual inputs you utilise are fairly samey across the board.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273430/BlazBlue_Entropy_Effect/">BlazBlue Entropy Effect</a> was released back in 2024 on Steam. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blazblue_entropy_effect_x">Entropy Effect X</a> isn’t exactly the same game, but rather a definitive reworking. It cuts a lot of fat from the original, replacing the robot hub world with a lab of anime colleagues. It also streamlines events into an all-new, series-canon storyline that promises to be more coherent. Its success on this front is up for debate, however. Entropy Effect X also boasts new bosses, new Mind Crystal challenges, and new variable difficulty modes - but sadly loses crossplay functionality in the process. It also drops the original’s English dub for subtitled Japanese language only.</p>

<p>Entropy Effect’s X’s premise feels somehow reminiscent of <strong>Tron</strong>. Beginning as an amnesiac, a team of scientists send you into a mainframe subspace that blends reality with unreality; a kind of dystopian, futuristic nightmare world in decay. Your goal is to retrieve ‘Shards of Possibility’ in each run, and regardless of whether you fail or succeed you’re beamed back to HQ for a bit of story evolution, character unlocking, and an opportunity for some general retooling.</p>
<p>The plot, honestly, is total technobabble nonsense, and the kind of thing that oft rears its head in Japanese games. In its attempt to be profoundly deep it ends up being verbose, confusing, tedious, and skippable. There are, however, fully animated flashbacks that pop up whenever a Shard of Possibility is obtained, filling in the backstory of humanity’s collapse. They’re short, beautifully done, and worth sticking around for.</p>
<p>The eighteen-strong battle roster are all legacy BlazBlue cast members, unlocked in an order of your choosing. Each can be broadly increased in power and even have their attributes fused. The levelling process is handled by running through stages, obtaining MP, HP and DP level-ups, secondary skills, expanding movesets, and increasing critical stats. You can focus on building up one or several avatars, but getting all eighteen to full capacity will take months of commitment.</p>

<p>Each character is surprisingly diverse, borrowing unique elements from their fighting game profiles. Bullet is grapple strong, able to grab enemies and send them piling into others behind, while Noel is ranged, wielding dual handguns that can fire from distance. Hibiki has shadow skills that have secondary attack properties, and Takaoka can create clones, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Once deployed into the subspace in search of a Shard, Entropy Effect X is graphically slick through and through, and, while character and enemy sprites are on the small side (which doesn’t work so well in handheld) it still shines in terms of animation and panache. Night City, your first port of call, is very much a 2D Cyberpunk bedfellow, only with more deterioration. Mechanically, it’s snappy, and if you played last year’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> you’ll feel very much at home with its dashes, aerial attacks, and smorgasbord of evolving secondary attack properties.</p>
<figure><a title="BlazBlue Entropy Effect X Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162031/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While it’s strictly 2D side-on, its scaling system feels similar to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a>, and with additional skill elements like Electricity, Fire and Ice - and the ability to focus on one suit for power increases - it has a lot in common with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>. One oversight, though, is no combo counter. In a game that rewards perfect screen clears, especially on higher difficulties, a combo counter would be a good visual aid. This is especially true since the sprites are on the small side, and focusing on your blows amidst a flurry of enemies can be tricky. You’ll often find you lose energy without knowing what hit you as a result.</p>
<p>Entropy Effect X’s action happens on a screen-by-screen basis. You enter an area, randomly generated in its platforms and pitfalls, and clear all enemies before moving on. Exiting each screen offers a choice of several randomised options: grab new secondary skills or exchange existing ones; enter a shop to spend points on MP, HP or skill boosts; or even try your luck on a Gacha roulette that can net you lucky enhancements. At critical points during your run you can unlock permanent combat expansions for things like air-juggle techniques or combo extenders.</p>

<p>Initially, though, things feel a little dull and hollow, with a visual style that’s cold and impersonal. Continue playing, learning, and expanding however, and things start to simmer, putting pressure on you to pay attention to your upgrading process before you dive again. Its mammoth bosses are impressive, too, with patterns that demand reflex if you’re going to earn your next Shard.</p>
<p>Like all roguelikes, the longer you play the more Entropy Effect X starts to flourish. You can get neck deep in the game’s countless upgrades, and using the ‘Entropy’ system to increase a run’s difficulty makes it more formidable, but rewards with more powerful buffs. While higher difficulties are altogether more involving, they also require unlocking by finishing Normal Mode first.</p>
<p>Initially, grinding is the only way to go. Health increasing elixirs are in short supply and, owing to the random nature of things, you never know when you’ll be granted a “rest space” or other gratuities that can regenerate health. To this end, you’ll find yourself replaying early stages several times. This is fine on paper, but it does lack the initial reward momentum of something like Absolum, and if you’re committed to building a strong Avatar you’ll need to overcome the repetition.</p>

<p>The game’s conundrum though, is how one responds to its dizzying complexity. While on the face of it, Entropy Effect X is a blistering action combat game, its structuring is daunting. Generally, it feels overwrought from the get-go.</p>
<p>Like its sprawling, confusing narrative, the game itself is incredibly dense on the front end. The options and choices provided when exiting a screen are labeled in ways that make little sense, and you’ll need to repeat them countless times to remember what they all lead to. The language used in its tutorials is science textbook wordy, often using a home-grown vernacular that you haven’t a hope of understanding until you’ve given it hours of attention.</p>
<p>While the system has arguably too many configurable options, its convolution may still appeal to a certain strain of player. The problem is more in how things are explained — or not, as the case may be. You can comb through help screens to try to figure out how everything works, or plough through blindly with a nagging feeling that you’re overlooking key features.</p>

<p>Additionally, the way the action is broken up is somewhat intrusive. Having tooling options when exiting a screen is fine, but when you're clearing them in thirty-seconds it becomes a little tiresome to keep entering between-screen spaces for upgrades or gacha rolls. Many of the exit options, like health increases or skill switches, could easily happen on the spot rather than having you move to interim areas.</p>
<p>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X is remarkable in its scope, dizzying in its depths, and impressive in its ambition. Its cast of characters is enormous, its combat taut, and its boss encounters impressive. Like any roguelike, it’s all about repetitive grind, but this isn’t a game that’s initially player-friendly. There are so many options, many of which are ambiguous, that it takes time to get a handle on all the possibilities and to tease out a strategy. To this end, it may turn some off before it has the chance to turn them on.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blazblue_entropy_effect_x">Blazblue Entropy Effect X</a>'s convolution will be a turn off for some, and for others a dream. There are some questionable design decisions in its lack of a visual combo counter, diminutive sprites, and stop-start upgrade screens, and the average action gamer will feel swamped by its narrative and overload of possible configurations. At the same time, it’s an undeniably impressive in scope: a mathematical formula of character building that's as flexible as it is complex.</p>
<p>Boomers should probably step away, but for those who live to mine roguelikes to the nth degree, it’s something of a treat.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Mario Tennis Fever Is The Definition Of A Meh Video Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mario-tennis-fever-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-switch-2-gameplay-2000669771</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As I played through <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em>‘s barebones campaign and its other forgettable modes, like some scoring challenges, one word emerged from my brain to describe this latest installment in the series: perfunctory. That’s not great. Making it worse, though, is that Nintendo is selling this uninspired tennis game for $70. Ouch.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-tennis-fever-trailer-nintendo-switch-2-2000658134">Out now on Switch 2,<em> Mario Tennis Fever</em></a> is the latest example of Mario and his pals (and enemies) getting together to play a sport. Sometimes they play golf, sometimes soccer, every so often some baseball, they’ve even played basketball together on occasion. This time around, the sport of choice is tennis, and once again this <em>Mario Tennis</em> adventure is developed by Camelot, a studio that has been making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelot_Software_Planning"><em>Mario</em> sports spin-offs since 1999</a>. And if all you want is a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-tennis-on-switch-is-mostly-fun-but-frustrating-1826985674"><em>Mario Tennis </em>game</a> with a few modes, a decent roster of characters, and multiplayer support, then <em>Fever</em> checks all those boxes. The problem is that it does so with about as much enthusiasm as someone filling out paperwork at the DMV.</p>

 <h2>Tennis, anyone?</h2> <p>The big star of <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> is the game’s adventure mode, which functions as a single-player campaign as well as a tutorial for how to play. It only took me about three hours to get through this adventure, and yet that was still too long. <em>Fever</em>‘s adventure mode is all about Mario, Luigi, and a few other key characters getting turned into babies after being attacked by a monster while getting a magic apple to heal Daisy from a horrible illness. To become adults again, they decide the best course of action is to fight the monster, and so they go to a tennis academy as babies to learn how to play a sport they’ve played so many times that there’s an entire franchise dedicated to it. Maybe this sounds goofy and silly. Trust me, it is not.</p> <p>Cutscenes in <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> are static, dull, and feature little movement or excitement. I’ve watched Powerpoint presentations that are more energetic and engaging than the cutscenes and narrative moments in <em>Fever</em>.</p>

  <p>Between these bits are tennis matches and tennis-themed minigames. None of these are awful, but they all tend to be very short, and I rarely felt like I was digging into some new feature or mechanic. For example, a big new element in <em>Fever</em> is a series of powerful tennis rackets that let you spawn fire, ice, mud, electricity, and other zany effects to disrupt your opponent. They can be powerful in adventure mode, but the game barely spends time on any one racket, so I never felt like I mastered anything before I was zipped off to a new location for more boring cutscenes and dialogue.</p>

 <p>As Baby Mario works his way through the adventure mode, he levels up, but you don’t have any control over what stats are improved, nor does the game offer side content for which levelling up is a big help. So the level-up system might as well not exist at all. Eventually, you beat the final boss, and the game ends with one more boring cutscene of characters not moving and chatting. Roll credits.</p> <h2>Seriously, does anybody want to play tennis?</h2> <p>Outside of the short and bad campaign are a series of other game modes that vary in quality from “okay” to “meh.” There are some score challenge mini-games that you can play against the computer or a friend. There’s a freeplay option that lets you and up to three other players locally play some tennis while changing the rules and other variables. There’s also a mode that lets you play using motion controls, but it only includes a handful of the special rackets, which seems bonkers and makes this option a waste. Just play <em>Wii Sports</em> tennis instead.</p>

 <p>My favorite mode is tournament, which pits you against different NPCs in a series of nearly uninterrupted tennis matches that lead to one final match to win that particular bracket. It’s not a revolutionary offering, but it at least focuses on the best part of <em>Mario Tennis Fever:</em> the actual act of playing tennis.</p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Come on, there aren't many other arcade-y tennis games to choose from."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer</p>                 <p>Camelot Software Planning</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Colorful and wacky arcade tennis game </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Looks nice, feels fine to play, Fever rackets are fun</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Adventure mode is boring and bad, other modes are mostly forgettable, tennis gameplay feels floaty, $70</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Nintendo Switch 2</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Finished adventure mode in three hours, play around six hours of other modes solo and against other players</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date:</p>                 <p>February 12, 2026</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p>To be clear, I don’t think the tennis gameplay in <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> is fantastic, as it lacks the depth I want from even the most arcade-y sports games and never felt precise enough for me. But it is easily the best part of the game. Hitting a ball really hard and aiming it at just the right spot to score feels sweet. Long rallies can get intense and, in my time with the game, almost always led to some cheering (or groaning) from folks watching or playing. So the fact that tournament mode focuses entirely on the tennis part of <em>Fever</em> made it easily my favorite way to play this latest <em>Mario</em> sports spin-off.</p> <p>Oh, and yes, there is online multiplayer, and it works, and… that’s about all there is to say, as it doesn’t feature any truly remarkable options. It’s<em> Mario Tennis Fever,</em> but online. Not exciting, but nice to have.</p>

 <p>Look, I get it. Sometimes you just do enough and move on. I’ve done that before in life. I can’t even count the number of times I turned in assignments in school that were just enough to pass and nothing more. Or how often I’d do just enough cleaning as a kid to convince my mom or dad that I’d picked up my room. The thing is, in those cases, I never charged anyone $70 for the privilege of receiving my minimum-effort offerings.<em> Mario Tennis Fever</em>, on the other hand, does just enough to be considered a new <em>Mario Tennis</em> game and calls it a day while charging a premium to play. Wait for a sale or go pick up a used copy of <em>Mario Tennis Aces</em> instead.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/18/virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-brings-back-the-highs-lows-and-weirdness-of-90s-vr/</link>
            <guid>1439098</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a lot of people wishing that the mid-2020s were more like the mid-1990s, but I don’t expect many were doing so for a chance to experience the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/virtual-boy">Virtual Boy’s</a> brief heyday. Yet here we are, with Nintendo releasing both a plastic recreation and a jazzed up cardboard edition of the Virtual Boy to go alongside the console’s addition to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a>. It’s playable with Switch, Switch OLED and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, so we’ve done just that.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch Virtual Boy unboxing and first impressions –&nbsp;can 90s VR make a comeback?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qGmf65wkZaY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The plastic shell of the Virtual Boy has been recreated in a charmingly accurate fashion from a distance, but you see plenty of fakery when you pay closer attention. All of the physical controls, sockets and sliders of the original Virtual Boy –&nbsp;the IPD slider, the volume wheel, controller port and all the rest –&nbsp;are now just surface details, and like a treasure chest that reveals itself to be a Mimic in a D&amp;D campaign, the red shell at the top of the body now opens up to reveal a cavernous maw, eager to consume your console.</p>


<p>Far more accurate are the backward tilted legs, sturdily holding the headset in place, and stubbornly allowing just a single adjustment. There’s no up or down here, just a tilt back and forward, and it means that you have to really lean in to get your Virtual Boy on. If potential eye strain weren’t enough reason for Nintendo to suggest regular breaks, then bad posture and possible back pain were another. While remaining authentic to the original is admirable in some ways, it means this remains an annoyance for anyone that isn’t my cat. I found that the box the Virtual Boy came in brought the headset up to a sensible viewing height for me.</p>
<div id="attachment_469015"><p id="caption-attachment-469015">The Virtual Boy is for ages 7+, but my cat is 3, so it was not turned on at this time.</p>
</div>
<p>Another slight disappointing element is the inelegance of Nintendo’s solution to the difference in shape and size of the Switch and Switch 2. Another detail on the underside of the Virtual Boy is that the protuberance that the stand grabs onto is also a basket to catch and support the console, the inside having a funnel and hinged flap to ensure it’s in roughly the right place, with a little bit of wiggle room. The basket is screwed onto the body of the Virtual Boy, and it’s sized for the Switch 2 by default, with a separate plate for the original Switch and Switch OLED included in the box.</p>
<p>I’d argue that’s overkill, and a needless faff for Switch 1 owners, when really a plastic insert would have done the trick. Heck, in a pinch when wanting to swap back and forth and compare screens, I just shoved my little finger in to give a modicum of support, and a plastic wedge could have made this more easily universal, in my opinion.</p>
<div id="attachment_469011"><p id="caption-attachment-469011">The Virtual Boy Switch 1 support is a bit of a basket case.</p></div>
<p>Another problem with the baskets? There’s no space for a USB-C charging cable or any kind of power pass through. Switch 2 could, I suppose, play with the top lid cocked open for the top charging port, letting outside light leak in more easily. In general, now you’re playing with (battery) power.</p>
<p>What really matters is what’s happening inside the headset, and you’ll have to peer into this mysterious box to see it. Back in 1995, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW7M8H99x7Y">Nintendo had to pull some remarkable mirror-waggling tricks</a> to get the single-colour LED strips to trick your eyes into seeing images, but in 2026, it’s the standard VR headset method of viewing a screen through distorting lenses. In both case, however, you look through a thick red filter, cutting out all of the other colours that the screen can display.</p>
<p>So, between Switch, Switch OLED and Switch 2, which console gives the best Virtual Boy experience? With this plastic Virtual Boy? I’d have to say the Switch 2. The simple fact is that it’s a higher resolution screen, allowing it to display the 384×224 of a Virtual Boy screen in a smaller space, so you can take in the full image more easily as it appears further away. Each console displays at 1:1 by default, and I feel that with the Switch and Switch OLED in particular, this makes it too large within the headset so that I’m occasionally moving my viewing angle to see if I’m missing something in the corners –&nbsp;and when this is a 3D effect, messing around like this and shifting focus can give you a real headache.</p>
<div id="attachment_469012"><p id="caption-attachment-469012">The Switch OLED renders the Virtual Boy much larger than on Switch 2.</p></div>
<p>It’s a big difference. The Switch 2 puts Wario Land into a 35mm wide postage stamp per eye, before passing through the lenses, while the Switch comes in at 41.5mm and the Switch OLED at 46.5mm. It’s a huge difference, and it makes the pixel grid much, much more visible. You can adjust the zoom within the emulation, to at least shrink the image size, if not the pixels on the Switch OLED –&nbsp;Switch 2, meanwhile, has a wider zoom range and can go up to 1.3x in size to effectively match the Switch OLED at 45mm. I’ve never used an original Virtual Boy, so cannot say what is most authentic, but I’d personally rather see more of the game view than less.</p>
<p>OLED does have its advantages, though, with the cardboard edition in mind. With an OLED panel, any pixel on the screen that’s not in use is off. It’s pitch black. Meanwhile, the backlights of the Switch 2 and Switch bleed through the black and make it a dark blue, to my eyes. The red lenses cut out all but the red light, helping to even the playing field with the plastic Virtual Boy, but the cardboard one doesn’t have the red filter, which can make the Switch OLED king in this scenario.</p>

<p>And so we come to the games. The game selection menu passes through the filter in an ominous red hue, but this is actually a bit of a lie, as it’s rendered in full colour by the console. The games themselves are all-red all of the time, though. Seven games are featured on day one, from 3D Tetris to Golf, Red Alarm, Teleroboxer, and the most noteworthy by far, Virtual Boy Wario Land.</p>
<p>Coming a year after his debut as a protagonist on the Game Boy, Virtual Boy Wario Land pioneered multi-plane platforming, with Wario able to use jump pads to bounce to parts of the world further away from the camera, and really pushed the number of parallax layers featured to give the environments its 3D depth. There’s smaller details too, like blocks having multiple layers to them, even little grassy fronds on the ground having a couple layers, giving added depth here, and the sprite scaling as things move in and out of the screen is really nicely done. Practically the first thing you encounter are spiked balls swinging towards your view, and it shows the smoothness of this.</p>

<p>Teleroboxer does a similarly good job with the boxing robots you fight having lots of layered sprites to create a canny 3D effect, and The Mansion of Innsmouth has the classic first person 3D dungeon crawling aesthetic as you move through corridors, while blasting monsters with an on-screen cursor. But for true 3D, you’ve really got to look to Red Alarm, a Star Fox style rail shooter with the world rendered in red wireframe –&nbsp;with just a single colour, this was probably the best path to take, but does mean you can see enemies through obstacles.</p>
<p>And then there’s 3D Tetris, which takes the notion of the block-dropping puzzle and makes it feel like Star Trek’s 3D chess. The classic tetromino shapes are put to one side, and you’re instead given other blocky assortments, layering them down on multiple flat layers. It can be tricky to make out how things are being placed with the shifting 3D view of the Tetris lasagna you’re making, and it’s odd to have split blocks to drop as well. Thankfully the right of your view has a simple 2D representation of the layers and where each block will land. It’s a bit of a cheat, but makes this more playable.</p>

<p>The main problem with the Virtual Boy’s game line up is that it never had the chance to mature. 1995 means that we were still getting experiences and ideas from the SNES or Game Boy, in part thanks to the single colour displays, and it was a time when sports games like Golf and Mario’s Tennis were… well, they were just fairly standard golf and tennis games. Neat to see, but not exactly ground-breaking.</p>
<p>All in all, the Virtual Boy for Nintendo Switch feels authentic (even if closer inspection does make it appear more toylike), and does a solid job of rendering the console’s small selection of games. It is a shame that, when this costs £67, Nintendo didn’t push on to remake the Virtual Boy controller, improve the ergonomics of using the headset, or even build in the ability to charge and play at the same time. That high price means that Virtual Boy will remain a retro curio for Switch owners and gaming history enthusiasts.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> now has a bunch more possibilities when it comes to one of the most important fantasy RPG build archetypes, thanks to the deployment of its anniversary update. Three new character races are on offer alongside the established humans and elves, and you can arm them with a quarterstaff which caters to mages who think puny wands and books aren't quite showy enough.</p>
<p>As you might recall, some of the stuff included in this anniversary update was orignally supposed to arrive in Avowed late last year, but ended up being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-new-game-plus-fresh-kind-of-weapon-and-photo-mode-are-now-coming-in-a-beefy-anniversary-update">delayed by Obsidian</a>.</p>

<p>The three new races you can pick from once you've installed this latest Avowed update, the full notes for which are on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2457220/view/511857117305504144?l=english">Steam</a>, are dwarves, orlans, and aumaua. I'm going to assume you know what a dwarf is, but for reference orlans are the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> universe's short, hairy and pointy-eared fellows. Aumaua are the big battlers whose skin sometimes resembles fish scales - Avowed's most memorable companion Kai is one. </p><p>If you opt to play as a dwarf, you'll benefit from an additional point to your might and constitution stats, while orlans get boosts to perception and resolve. Aumaua, meanwhile, get plus two to might, because fish Hulk smash. Personally, I think next time I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-facial-mushrooms-hide-a-fantasy-romp-thats-well-worth-your-time-disagree-and-my-arquebus-awaits">hop into Avowed</a> I'll opt for one of the first two races, because the update's new weapon is perfect for an angry little ball of deadliness.</p>
<p>It's a quarterstaff, which Obsidian describe as a "bludgeoning weapon that comes complete with wand style stun finishers", making it ideal for roleplaying as a mage with an ego the size of Eora. Small person, possibly with furry ears. Big magic stick to fuel their big magic ego. The hijinks write themselves.</p>
<p>Avowed's anniversry update also brings the likes of a new game plus mode and the ability to snap some photos as your angry little ball of deadliness beats their way through the Living Lands with their big stick of spells.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Pokémon Pokopia Have Multiplayer? Co-Op & Split-Screen, Explained]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon fans are set to be treated well in 2026, the 30th anniversary of the franchise, and Pokopia will make waves when it arrives, with a variety of multiplayer offerings.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> is set for release on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-countdown-exact-release-date-start-times/" id="177262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 5</a>, putting players in control of a humanoid Ditto in a relaxing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/life-simulation/" id="2994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-sim</a> game where humans have mysteriously disappeared, leaving a world of Pokémon behind.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering about the multiplayer options for Pokopia, including whether split-screen is supported, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-pokemon-pokopia-have-multiplayer">Does Pokémon Pokopia Have Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rebuild. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Pokopia supports co-op multiplayer in a variety of ways, including the ability to game share with players who don’t own the game themselves.</strong></p>



<p>Pokopia’s sharing feature, which also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-will-be-available-on-original-nintendo-switch-sort-of/" id="157583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enables those on the original Switch console to play</a>, brings players who don’t own the game themselves into the fold. However, the host must be online, and a fresh connection is required every time you want to play Pokopia in this way.</p>



<p>Multiplayer options also allow for up to four players to play simultaneously across a selected island, akin to Animal Crossing, which can be conducted via local wireless or online multiplayer. A Nintendo Switch Online membership is required for the latter.</p>



<p>Additionally, there is also a Cloud Island, a co-op mode where players create a blank town from scratch together, separate from the game’s main story. The main difference is that the host does not need to be online for the island to be accessible, and there’s no limit to the number of players who can join the island, although only four can be online at a time.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/6-things-i-learned-from-attending-pokemon-euic-2026/" id="177317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">6 Things I Learned From Attending Pokémon EUIC 2026</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-does-pokemon-pokopia-have-split-screen-multiplayer">Does Pokémon Pokopia Have Split-Screen Multiplayer?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Pokopia does not support multiplayer across a single system, and additional Nintendo Switch consoles are required to play in the same household.</strong></p>



<p>All local co-op is network-based, requiring connection to the same wireless network, or held via online connection, which requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p>



<p>While this may be frustrating, it shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise, as Pokémon Legends: Z-A and other Pokémon games largely don’t offer split-screen playing, with the exception being Pokémon Let’s Go Pikachu and Eevee.</p>

            <p>Today, in News I Didn't Expect To Ever Write, I bring to you <a href="https://kao-shinseikatsu-game.com/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D33721277683654488724186108689161205022%7CMCORGID%3D952B02BE532959B60A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1771392119">Souji Souai LOVE</a>, a free game by chemical and cosmetics giant Kao Corporation that stars idols, only the idols are cleaning products. As in... their heads are bottles of detergent and other products. Japan once again proves its marketing game is centuries ahead of the rest of the world's.</p>
<p>The shocking news came to our attention via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/finally-an-idolmaster-clone-game-where-the-idols-are-all-detergents-and-cleaning-agents/">Automaton</a>. The site details the game is a 20-minute visual novel-style sim that has players embody a "rookie producer" tasked with making sure the group Shining4's debut performance isn't a failure. In traditional VN fashion, you must get to know each team member better and help them with menial tasks, such as... cleaning toilets (using their heads, I guess).</p>
<p>"It's exactly like one of my wacky animes," you might be thinking, and yeah, you're totally right. Souji Souai LOVE doesn't feature <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-EFRFk4fA0">little girls transforming into cars after drinking gas</a>, but it's odd enough from the get-go, and its catchy central song goes the extra mile to sell us on Kao's pitch:</p> <figure>

<p>Needless to say, a decent amount of money, time, and talent went into this marketing stunt, and Japanese social media users are shocked the company even got singer and voice actor Yoshiki Nakajima (The Idolmaster: SideM) and J-pop artist Kent Ito, among others, to voice these characters. "The four idols are Kyukyutto (dish soap), Bath Magiclin (bathtub cleaner), Toilet Magiclin (toilet bowl cleaner), and Quickle Wiper Three-dimensional Wet Sheets (for cleaning floors), all based on real-life products," Automaton's report revealed.</p><p>The game can be played through <a href="https://kao-shinseikatsu-game.com/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D33721277683654488724186108689161205022%7CMCORGID%3D952B02BE532959B60A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1771392119">Kao's official homepage</a> and works on PC and mobile. It may not be for everyone, but considering how much time the average Internet user spends every day doomscrolling on social media, this seems like a better use of a fraction of one's daily phone time.</p>

            <p>After showing off a selection of PlayStation-exclusive charms for in-game weapons, the Marathon social media account has indicated that similar charms will be coming to other platforms like PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>This post, <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2023835955149623660">made in response to a community question on the matter</a>, states:"We'll have weapons charms for Steam and Xbox players as well, which we'll share more about in the future!"</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2023819735737967016">The charms shown off</a> for PlayStation players include little weapon cosmetics referencing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. So for PC and console, one wonders what sort of other games will get nods in the form of such attachments.</p>
<p>Things really seem to be ramping up for Marathon. Not only did it take up a big spot during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">the recent Sony State of Play</a>, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">Server Slam test</a> happening between the 26th February until the 2nd March. Finally, players will be able to make their own mind up on whether the game is a hit or a miss.</p><p>The game has certainly ran into its fair share of hurdles during development. Initial feedback on previous tests <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">weren't entirely positive</a>, with many criticising the PvE aspect of the game as well as missing features like proximity voice. There was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">a massive plagiarism scandal</a>, which required developers to comb through the game to remove elements of work belonging to artist Antireal.</p>
<p>The game's journey to launch is nearly at an end, with the game launching next month on the 5th March. Will you be checking it out? Let us know!</p>

			<p>As far as triple-A-ish games go, <strong>Highguard</strong> might go down in history as one of the games that spent the least time in the spotlight, and even when it did, it was all for the wrong reasons.</p>



<p>The game <strong>was a complete secret</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">until The Game Awards 2025</a>. The CEO of game developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong>, <strong>Dusty Welch, </strong>would later reveal that their original goal was to <strong>shadowdrop the game</strong> in late January, much as <strong>Respawn's Apex Legends</strong> did back in 2019 (on which several members of the team had worked). However, when <strong>Geoff Keighley</strong> suddenly came to Wildlight with the offer to close out The Game Awards ceremony with a Highguard trailer, Welch felt it would have been foolish to refuse.</p>



<p>As they say, <strong>hindsight is 20/20</strong>, but there's no doubt that <strong>that unveiling has backfired majorly</strong>. Viewers wanted to see a big new <span>single-player game as the show's closing announcement, not another hero shooter, and&nbsp;<strong>immediately criticized both Keighley and Highguard itself</strong>, setting the stage for&nbsp;</span>negative sentiment that hit the game like a hammer.</p>



<p>Rather than delaying the game and perhaps trying to address some of the early complaints, Wildlight <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still launched Highguard as planned</a></strong> in late January. Unsurprisingly, the Steam page <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was quickly filled with negative reviews</a></strong>, just as Dusty Welch had admitted the trailer didn't showcase their game well.</p>



<p>Last week, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that Wildlight <strong>had already been forced to lay off most of the team</strong>, following the game's terrible launch. A few days ago, one of the developers who was laid off <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/former-highguard-dev-calls-out-players-for-slandering-the-game-before-they-played-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized players</a> for failing to give Highguard a chance</strong>.</p>



<p>Now, <strong>the game appears to be on its deathbed</strong>. The 24-hour concurrent player peak on Steam was just 1,507 players, and the <a href="https://playhighguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a> has been down for several hours. Those few players who actually enjoy the game are worried its closure might be announced at any moment. Meanwhile, Stephen Totilo has <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=188295226&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=5eh0e&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Chinese giant <strong>Tencent</strong>, one of the biggest gaming publishers, was the secret investor behind the game. </p>



<p>What do you think of Highguard and its seemingly brief life? Did it deserve more or not? Let us know in the poll and comments.</p>

			<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">PC gaming</strong> has been in a rough spot in the past few years, with too many games launching with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">technical and optimization issues</strong> that are left unresolved. However, there are times when a game's optimization is judged based on a game's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ultra settings</strong>, which creates a situation where developers—such as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/ys-x-proud-nordics-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-nintendo-switch/">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a></em></strong> <strong>PC</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PS5,</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Switch 2</strong> version developer <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PH3's Peter "Durante" Thoman</strong>—have to <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"protect players from themselves"</em> and balance optimization with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">future-proofing</strong> their games.</p>



<p>Speaking in a lengthy interview with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/19632-ys-x-proud-nordics-durante-interview-ph3-switch-2-dlss-ps5-pro-switch-1-trails-beyond-the-horizon-port-challenges-tea-2026-exclusive">RPGFan</a></em></strong>, the legendary developer, who some may remember for fixing the flawed PC port of the original <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Dark Souls</em></strong> with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19">DSFix</a></strong>, was asked for clarification about the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"protecting players from themselves"</em> statement made when talking about the PC port of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Trails beyond the Horizon</em></strong> regarding some players cranking up the settings to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ultra</strong> and complain about optimization.</p>



<p><em>"I don’t think it’s 'a lot' of players, but this does happen. And it is very annoying – not (just) because it’s our work, but because it’s genuinely <strong>counter-productive</strong>,"</em> Durante said. <em>"We try very hard to implement a huge amount of settings in order to make our <strong>PC versions scale</strong> from low-power devices like the <strong>Steam Deck</strong> all the way to an RGB-riddled gaming rig with a <strong>500 Watt monster GPU</strong>."</em></p>



<p>Not many PC ports offer this level of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">scalability</strong> nowadays, <span>which creates a critical issue, according to the&nbsp;<em><strong>developer of the Ys X: Proud Nordics</strong></em>&nbsp;port</span>. </p>



<p><em>"That’s the crux: as a developer, we get to decide what e.g. <strong>'Ultra'</strong> means. And people judging the <strong>'optimization'</strong> of a game based on how it runs at <strong>'Ultra' settings</strong> creates <strong>perverse incentives</strong> for this,"</em> Durante said. <em>"Taking this to its logical conclusion, if we were to remove the <strong>'Ultra' settings</strong>, rename <strong>'Very High' to 'Ultra'</strong>, and make no other changes, then this metric would say that our game is now much more <strong>'optimized'</strong>."</em></p>



<p>With this widespread misperception, it's not easy for any developer to offer <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">highly scalable settings</strong> that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">future-proof</strong> games. However, there's plenty of value in doing so. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"As a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC gaming enthusiast</strong> for over 20 years now, going back to older games with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">new hardware</strong> and seeing them in a new light is something I greatly enjoy – and disincentivizing developers from adding <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">high-end options</strong> goes directly against that,"</em> Durante concluded.</p>



<p>Ultimately, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Durante’s stance</strong> is a call for a more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">nuanced understanding</strong> of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC and console performance</strong>, which seems to have been lost in the past few generations. By refusing to cap a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC port's settings</strong> to its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">console equivalent</strong>, or only slightly beyond it, developers would prioritize the platform's greatest asset: its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">longevity</strong>. </p>



<p>I’ve experienced this firsthand when <strong>revisiting older</strong> titles like <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</em>. Seeing it <strong>scale to modern resolutions and framerates</strong> years later is what makes PC gaming unique. If CD Projekt Red had <strong>capped those settings back then to match the hardware of the time</strong>, I would have never experienced the game in the new light Durante mentioned.</p>



<p>Hopefully, more developers will offer more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">future-proof Ultra settings</strong>, although with the number of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remasters</strong> consistently getting announced, I don't personally believe this will happen anytime soon.</p>

            <p>Amid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">soaring SSD prices</a>, slower-but-cheaper mechanical hard drives may have offered an attractive reprieve for anyone wanting to embiggen their PC storage on a – and I know it’s increasingly difficult to use this word without breaking down into desperate laugh-crying – budget. Unfortunately, that probably ain’t happening either, as leading HDD manufacturers Western Digital and Seagate have both revealed that they’ve already sold “pretty much” all of their mechanical drive stock that was allocated for 2026.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by German tech site <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/WD-and-Seagate-confirm-Hard-drives-for-2026-sold-out-11178917.html">Heise</a>, the admissions (or boasts, depending how you look at it) came during <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864150-western-digital-corporation-wdc-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript">WD</a> and <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4863159-seagate-technology-holdings-plc-stx-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript">Seagate’s</a> respective earnings calls in January. WD CEO Tiang Yew Tan said that in addition to maxing out production for 2026, "robust commercial agreements" for 2027 and 2028 are already in place with major buyers, while Seagate’s CEO William Mosley claimed the company’s HDD output capacity is "fully allocated" through the rest of this year.</p>
<p>Naturally, the bulk-buying of these hard drives – which is already causing shortages and heighted prices for home PC users – is being performed by the same entities that are driving the ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">SSD and RAM shortages</a>. Namely, big tech companies wanting to build and kit out enormous data centres from which to run their AI products, like those genAI tools that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-than-half-of-gamedev-professionals-see-genai-as-harmful-according-to-gdcs-latest-survey">game devs hate</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hooded-horse-ban-ai-generated-art-in-their-games-all-this-thing-has-done-is-made-our-lives-more-difficult">publishers are banning</a>. Cool! This industry-wide rush has, for months, been causing a DRAM chip shortage that’s managed to widely knacker PC component availability, gouge prices, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scratch-that-the-steam-machine-is-delayed-after-all-and-valve-confirm-ram-shortages-will-affect-pricing">delay Valve’s new Steam Machine</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">kill off Crucial</a>. Seems we can add hard drives to the list of casualties, a development that also spells more bad news for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> prices. If mech drives aren’t available as a cheaper alternative, that’s yet more demand being piled on SSDs, which would inevitably make supplies even scarcer and ticket prices even heavier.</p>
<p>For now, at least, a quick canter through the Internet shops suggests that hard drive supplies haven’t yet dried up entirely, and they’re still cheaper than equivalent-capacity NVMe SSDs. Still, they are snared in the same pricing trap: this <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Seagate-Barracuda-internal-Drive-Modellnr/dp/B0BYT7BD4Y">1TB Seagate Barracuda</a> is £80 at the time of writing, but was £52 at the end of January, and £43 in December 2025. And with replacement stock having apparently been flogged to Microsoft and the like, don’t expect that to drift back down anytime soon.</p><p>I recently asked some specialist hardware manufacturers, as part of an upcoming feature, whether they’d advise PC upgrade seekers to take the money hit now or wait until things (hopefully) calm down in 2027. Responses were mostly mixed, but everyone agreed – as do I – that if you <em>can </em>keep going with your current components, SSD or HDD storage included, you probably should.</p>
