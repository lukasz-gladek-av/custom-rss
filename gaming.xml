                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fast-fusion/" data-ref-id="5000-671284">Fast Fusion</a> has the distinction of being one of the few Switch 2-exclusive games available now, and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/fast-fusion/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people seem to like it quite a bit so far</a>. Not content to rest on its laurels after the game's release, developer Shin'en is releasing a free content update later this week for the game that includes three new racetracks.</p><p>As originally reported by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/exclusive-fast-fusions-first-major-update-arrives-this-week-with-three-new-tracks" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Life</a>, Fast Fusion's update will launch on June 26 and will include three new tracks, significantly expanding the game's offerings. From screenshots, these tracks will explore both urban and more natural areas, and will feature various types of weather.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB5Hf2HIroc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XB5Hf2HIroc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In addition to this content drop, the update will also bring some tweaks and changes to help improve the game's performance. Shin'en is adding a "Pure" graphics mode that turns off upscaling and renders the game at 1440p dynamic resolution while docked and 1080p while handheld, in an effort to reduce any graphical blurriness caused by DLSS. The studio is also fixing some bugs and making progression slightly easier. You can check out the full patch notes below.</p><p>Fast Fusion is the third entry in the Fast series of hovercraft racing games, and it boasts 4K/60FPS gameplay (enabled by DLSS). In addition to being one of the few exclusive games to the new console, it's also very accessible, costing only $15. Check out the launch trailer above to see the game in action.</p><h3>Fast Fusion Update 1.3 Patch Notes</h3><ul><li>Added Carbium Cup with three new tracks.  <ul><li>Alpine Trust</li><li>Sunahara Plains</li><li>Zenshoh Habitat</li><li><em>These tracks are based on FAST RMX tracks but with all new graphics and changed track layouts to allow to be played perfectly with the new Hyperjump feature.</em></li></ul></li><li>New PURE rendering mode without any upscaling, rendering at 1440p docked, 1080p handheld (dynamic resolution).</li><li>New GPU particle system for snow.</li><li>Two new jukebox entries.</li><li>Easier progression (lower price for 3rd cup).</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game shut down when changing render mode.</li><li>Stability and performance improvements.</li></ul>

Destroyed robots drop cash that can be used to purchase class upgrades. According to the <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/List_of_game_modes#Mann_vs._Machine" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Team Fortress 2 wiki</a>, there are currently 29 missions and five operations (groups of missions played in sequence) for Mann vs. Machine.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, 13-years-later, Valve is looking to update Mann vs. Machine with the community's help. Valve, in the signature comedic style it always uses when writing about Team Fortress 2, is asking players to submit Mann vs. Machine maps and missions by August 27 for possible inclusion in the update.</p><p dir="ltr">Valve's tongue-in-cheek <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=247188" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> clarifies that the update, or at least a portion of it, will be arriving right before Halloween, but that the submitted maps do not need to all be Halloween-themed (though some of them could be, Valve later states).</p><p dir="ltr">"The king of the fictional land where this all happened (ancient Greece), decreed on stone tablets that even though the update was dropping right around the ancient Greek candy-harvest festival of Halloween, the maps did not need to all be Halloween-themed (first tablet) and in fact shouldn't be (second tablet)," Valve writes.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time Valve has asked for help to create new Team Fortress 2 content. The class-based FPS received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-gets-14-new-maps-as-part-of-major-summer-update/1100-6515934/" data-ref-id="1100-6515934">14 new community-made maps</a> as part of a major summer update in 2023. Valve earlier this year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2s-source-code-is-out-fan-made-games-may-be-next/1100-6529588/" data-ref-id="1100-6529588">released Team Fortress 2's entire source code</a>, giving the community the power to "change, extend, or rewrite TF2."</p><p dir="ltr">One of Team Fortress 2's most popular mods, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-classic-coming-to-steam-this-year/1100-6529710/" data-ref-id="1100-6529710">Team Fortress 2 Classic</a>, is set to officially be released on Steam later this year. The mod returns the game to how it was in 2008, albeit with new weapons, modes, and quality-of-life features.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite being nearly 20-years-old, Team Fortress 2 still has a strong following on Steam and is one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-free-steam-games/2900-5335/" data-ref-id="2900-5335">best free games on Steam</a>. Over the past six months, the game has maintained anywhere from around 40,000 to 56,000 concurrent players, and actually reached a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-which-was-released-16-years-ago-just-broke-a-player-record/1100-6515946/" data-ref-id="1100-6515946">concurrent player peak of over 250,000</a> in 2023 following the release of the previously mentioned summer update.</p>

<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1fe7b5293e580/metroid-prime-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Some poor sod over at Nintendo recently made a pretty hefty mistake in creating a huge poster for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> with the words "Out Now" printed very clearly for all to see.</p>
<p>Nintendo has already stated that the printing was a mistake, but now the company has now ensured that no further confusion occurs by swapping the poster out for one that merely says "2025". This was highlighted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GlitchNDaSystem/">GlitchNDaSystem</a> over on Reddit and covered by our friends over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-no-longer-out-now-as-london-underground-advertisement-is-updated">Eurogamer</a>.</p><p><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>We still wonder just how such a drastic blunder slipped through Nintendo's iron clad fortress and made its way onto the walls of the London Underground, but at least it's all fixed now.</p>
<p>There's still no date for the long-awaited sequel, but by process of elimination, we would probably place it quite neatly in the month of either September or November. We've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> in July, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag X Drive</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> in August, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> in October.</p>
<p>A launch in December wouldn't be completely out of the question, but it feels a little too close to the Holidays for our liking. Plus, we need to put <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> somewhere, too!</p>
<p>So much to play, so little time...</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/phyres-role-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-explained-in-latest-developer-diary/">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> developer The Chinese Room has been hit with layoffs, confirmed the game's publisher, Paradox Interactive. It's unclear how many developers have been impacted, though Paradox claims that development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 "<em>is unaffected</em>" by the cuts.</p>
<p>The first reports of the layoffs came from now-former developers at The Chinese Room, who took to LinkedIn to announce that they had lost their jobs. Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-still-wakes-the-deep-developer-the-chinese-room-is-making-layoffs">Game Developer</a>, one employee wrote, "<em>We are none of us safe from the headsman's axe when redundancy time comes around</em>." At least nine former employees have confirmed they were laid off, though the total number of cuts remains unknown.</p>
<p>Following the LinkedIn posts and Game Developer's report, Paradox Interactive confirmed the layoffs to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/bloodlines-2-developer-the-chinese-room-has-laid-off-employees-but-paradox-says-the-game-is-still-coming-in-october/">PC Gamer</a>, with a statement that reads "<em>Development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is unaffected by the recent staffing changes at The Chinese Room; the game is still scheduled for an October release. We wish those affected the best of luck on their future endeavors</em>."</p>
<p>It's no secret that development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been through the wringer, so to speak, as we've been waiting on this game since it was first announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/">2019</a>. It was also at risk of being canceled at least once before, when it was being developed by Hardsuit Labs.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room took over development in 2021, and has been picking up where Hardsuit Labs left off while also developing its own titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep/">Still Wakes The Deep</a>. These layoffs are the latest event in the long development journey that Bloodlines 2 has gone through.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/">Earlier this year,</a> Paradox Interactive confirmed that Bloodlines 2 is due for an October release date, though a specific release date has yet to be provided. According to Paradox, the game is "<em>done</em>," and the studio is working on polishing it and squashing every bug it can up to its October date. After all this time, seeing what arrives when Bloodlines 2 is out and on shelves will be interesting. Hopefully, it's a triumphant return for the series and the game that fans have been waiting for.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Roblox is introducing two new systems that are designed to further encourage creators to bring players onto the social games platform on a regular basis. The systems, part of what Roblox is calling Creator Rewards, will roll out beginning July 24th.</p><p>One is the Daily Engagement Reward program, which gives Roblox creators 5 Robux for an “active spender” on the platform who spends at least 10 minutes in their experience in one day. 5 Robux isn’t a lot on its own — depending on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24311337/roblox-robux-app-store-fees-worth-more-party">where you buy Robux</a>, that can translate to <a href="https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux">about five cents</a> — but if an experience brings back thousands <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview">or millions</a> of people every day, that could add up quickly. Roblox may also change the payout in the future, it says <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/introducing-creator-rewards-earn-more-by-growing-the-community/3777628">in a blog post</a>.</p><p>To be eligible for the reward, a creator’s experience must also be one of the first three experiences an active spender (which the platform defines as a user who has spent at least $9.99 in the last 60 days) launches each day.</p><p>The choice to offer these payouts after the first three experiences isn’t an exact science, Roblox CPO Manuel Bronstein tells <em>The Verge</em>. It’s more that those first three experiences are why you may come to the platform in a given day, he says, while you might visit experiences after those first three because you found something new through recommendations or because of a friend’s suggestion.</p><p>Bronstein doesn’t think creators will change their experiences to optimize just for that 10-minute threshold. “Continue to build a great product, continue to build a great game, continue to build a great experience, and you will benefit from this reward,” he says.</p><p>He also points out that these engagement-based rewards aren’t the sole mechanism for Roblox creators to make money. The “vast” majority of transactions for Roblox developers come from transactions that they generate on the platform, according to Bronstein, and creators can also monetize with things like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/9/23343459/roblox-age-guidelines-metaverse-ads-developer-conference-announcements">ads</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/15/23962567/you-can-now-buy-subscriptions-in-roblox-experiences-that-offer-them">subscriptions</a>, and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667470/roblox-creators-physical-merch-in-game-shopify-amp">selling physical goods</a>.</p><p>This new reward system will replace the current <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/monetization/engagement-based-payouts">engagement-based payouts program</a>, which pays out Robux based on playtime from people who are subscribers to <a href="https://www.roblox.com/premium/membership">Roblox Premium</a>. Bronstein says that program didn’t reward user acquisition or user reactivation, and wasn’t as transparent as Roblox wanted it to be. (He also says this new program isn’t a response to Epic Games’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/28/23659492/fortnite-creator-economy-2-0-epic-games-catch">engagement-based payouts system for <em>Fortnite</em></a>.)</p><p>The second program Roblox is adding is the Audience Expansion Reward, which pays creators a revenue share of purchases from Roblox users who join or return to the platform because of them. Roblox will apply the credit if a player joins the platform through a creator’s link or if a player searches for a creator’s experience on Roblox by name and plays for at least 10 minutes. This new system will eventually take over for Roblox’s <a href="https://create.roblox.com/affiliate">current Creator Affiliate program</a>. This program will offer a 35 percent revenue share to creators on up to the first $100 those new or returning users spend in their first two months on Roblox.</p><p>Roblox says it’s on track to pay out $1 billion to creators this year. Last year, it paid out more than $922 million, which far exceeds the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349588/epic-paid-fortnite-creators-a-total-of-352m-in-2024">$352 million Epic paid to <em>Fortnite</em> creators</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/691308/roblox-daily-engagement-audience-expansion-reward-program-payouts-creator-rewards]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There's no way I'm learning this for the first time after ten or so years of people exploring every nook and cranny of this game. That's the thought that went through my head when I spotted a tweet from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher 3</a> quest designer Philipp Weber earlier this month, revealing that one of the Blood and Wine DLC's quests had a secret cut epilogue.</p>
<p>I've played quite frankly far too much of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> over the years, and I'd never heard of it. Of course, I'm just one bloke, and hardly an endless encyclopedia containing every single bit of trivia about a decade old game. That's when I raked through the internet, and couldn't find any mentions of the cut epilogue. Surely Weber hadn't kept this under his hat for about a decade, not even mentioning it when folks found what he'd called a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZZ9p1HbeHs">"last secret"</a> by investigating the exact same quest. Er, yes, he had.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First, I'll give you the context. The tweet from Weber that started off my wild goose chase came in response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/1l7uk19/fun_fact_vivienne_from_blood_and_wine_has_a_mom/">a Redditor</a> discovering cut models for Vivienne De Tabris' parents while digging around in TW3's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3s-redkit-mod-tools-launch-may-21st-enabling-a-new-era-of-ambitious-overhauls">REDkit modding tools</a>. For a refresher, De Tabris is the cursed lady-in-waiting from the quest 'The Warble of a Smitten Knight'. It's the one where Gerry takes part in the knightly tournament and you're about to read some spoilers for it.</p>
<p>Cue Weber posting that "originally the Warble of a Smitten Knight used to have a flashback scene where we would see Vivienne's parents at the pond, being watched by a nymph who was envious of their love. She was the one who cursed their unborn baby, setting the whole story into motion.</p>
<p>"We used to have a secret quest epilogue in which you could find this nymph, but had to cut it due to scope," he continued, "However, we were able to reuse the nymph's model for the Lady of the Lake and add her to the quest for Aerondight. Originally, she was not even supposed to be seen."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">This post shows a nice example of how cut content can sometimes also be a good thing. We lost Vivienne's parents, but gained a Lady of the Lake. <br>Blood and Wine for the Witcher 3 was a huge expansion, but to make it we still had to cut some scope.<br>(1/3)<a href="https://t.co/XJz4bIFOr9">https://t.co/XJz4bIFOr9</a> <a href="https://t.co/28vfghTDpy">pic.twitter.com/28vfghTDpy</a></p>— Philipp Weber (@PhiWeber) <a href="https://twitter.com/PhiWeber/status/1932419237714526465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Very cool, but not just that. An answer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdKNtepEt0o">the debates</a> some Witcher fans have been having for years about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/1ekqcv0/witcher_3_the_identity_of_the_creature_who_cursed/">the identity of the nymph</a> that cursed Vivienne, with some having speculated that Hearts of Stone baddie Gaunter O'Dimm or one of Velen's crones could be behind it.</p>
<p>And not something that, as far as Weber knows, was public knowledge prior to him tweeting about it on a Tuesday more than nine years on from Blood and Wine's release in May 2016. "I never revealed the secret," the current Witcher 4 narrative director told me yesterday in response to my reaching out to him the day the tweet appeared in our lives, "but after the 10th anniversary and since people found the models already, it felt like an appropriate time!"</p>
<p>It goes to show you, TW3 really is a gift that just keeps on giving. I look forward to learning for the first time once ten more years have passed that Geralt's <a href="https://www.vg247.com/witcher-3-mod-geralt-centaur-horse-man">secretly a horse man</a> while he's saving the world from the Wild Hunt.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-witcher-3-dev-kept-mum-about-a-secret-blood-and-wine-quest-epilogue-for-nearly-a-decade-until-someone-dug-up-some-cut-parents]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix’s Adolescence Is A Moving, If Sometimes Heavy-Handed, Warning About The Internet]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/adolescence-netflix</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix%E2%80%99s-adolescence-is-a-moving-if-sometimes-heavy-handed-warning-about-the-internet.1227102/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have four nieces and nephews, two boys and two girls. I try to be a good bridge between their mom and the world of pop culture, games, and the internet. This sometimes means calling them out when they’re using inappropriate slang they think my sister and I don’t know; it sometimes means reassuring my sister that some joke or trend isn’t the moral panic the local news or her Facebook friends make it out to be.</p><p>But I often worry about my youngest nephew, who’s feeling his way through cusp-of-puberty questions about manhood and gender. The last time I saw him, over the winter holidays, his speech was peppered with references to Elon Musk, AI, and cryptocurrency that I have no idea how he knows about. He plays a lot of video games, and he watches a lot of YouTube; while my sister carefully controls the former, a single mom with four kids doesn’t have the time or, really, the ability to monitor his YouTube habits closely enough. I’ll sometimes peek over his shoulder when I visit, trying to get a sense of who he’s watching, but beyond hideous hours of Mr Beast, I have no idea where he’s getting some of the stuff it’s so obvious he’s parroting from somewhere.</p><p>All of this gave me a particular interest in Netflix’s <em>Adolescence</em>, a four-episode series that came out in March. The show opens with police busting into the home of the Millers to arrest 13-year-old Jamie on suspicion of murdering his classmate Katie. The show’s claim to fame is shooting each episode in <a href="https://variety.com/2025/artisans/news/adolescence-one-take-episodes-netflix-1236339292/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one continuous shot</a>; in the first episode, this means that after the adrenaline of the police’s violent entry wears off, we follow Jamie on the entire ride to the police station and the process of getting booked in, the formality by turns calming and unnerving.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Adolescence | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wk5OxqtpBR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Each episode’s refusal to look away has a unique effect on the drama. I found the most moving episode to be the second, where the inspector prosecuting the case, Luke Bascombe, goes to Jamie and Katie’s school looking for information. Without the ability to cut to the most important moments–Luke interviewing Katie and Jamie’s friends, a conversation with his own son–we see the chaos and tension of the school halls and get a sense of the environment that shaped Jamie and Katie’s relationship, where everyday interactions are laden with violence and double meanings.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve seen the most attention paid to the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/adolescence-recap-episode-3-netflix.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third episode</a>, where a psychologist interviews Jamie while he’s being kept in a psychiatric facility. Jamie speaks in manosphere talking points, bragging about sexual interactions with women and criticizing Katie for being flat-chested. It’s <em>Adolescence</em>’s most heavy-handed episode, clearly wanting to warn parents about the world of Andrew Tate and his ilk. Young actor Owen Cooper does an incredible job as Jamie here, jumping dramatically from being a confused kid trying to find his place in the world to a threatening, sexist… well, <em>man</em>. The psychologist asks Jamie questions about what he thinks masculinity is, how men should act, and about the men in his own life. I’ll be honest that I found some of this a bit too simplistic, nudging the show into Lifetime movie territory, but at the same time, things manage to not become too reductive. Through how Jamie embraces and backs away from internet talking points, through how he wavers between pain over how his classmates teased him for being an “incel” and embracing the label to push the psychologist away and justify his actions, we see someone whose worldview isn’t fully formed yet. Jamie is less some villain and more someone standing at the crossroads of different ways to be, absorbing all the messages around him, trying identities on to test how the world around him reacts, with dire consequences. But the show also doesn’t let him off the hook for this, emphasizing the seriousness of the messages kids are receiving without forgetting that they’re still just kids.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="How the Cast of Adolescence Prepared for the One Shot | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FZfb7liTeUw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The final episode shows the effect all this has had on Jamie’s family, and raises questions about his parents’ culpability that are hugely moving while still stumbling a little too eagerly into on-the-nose territory. <em>Adolescence </em>is rarely a subtle show, but this is balanced out by its filming technique, which never lets it overly foreground its most obvious pieces. It made me think a lot about my own nephew, who, when I’ve pointed out that some of the things he says are hurtful, has earnestly backtracked in a way that gives me hope. It can be too easy to default to “well, they’re a good kid” as an excuse not to have hard conversations about the things kids are seeing and saying, and <em>Adolescence</em> felt like a good reminder that I should do more than assume my nephew will just grow out of it. I'd be curious to hear what actual parents think of it; it's a worthwhile watch, if often a difficult one.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/adventure-gamers-online-casino-gambling-website-sale-parasite-seo"><h3>Adventure Games, Poker And Casinos Do Not ‘Overlap’, You Weirdos</h3></a><p>No normal person could type 'Recognizing the growing convergence between gaming and gambling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gamestop-trading-card-game-problems-scalpers"><h3>GameStop’s Expanding Trading Card Business Could Make A Tough Situation For Workers Worse</h3></a><p>“Unlike hardware, it has high margin potential,” GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen said to shareholders</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/adolescence-netflix]]></content:encoded>

And, if you're not subscribed yet, you can still <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/subscribe">take advantage of early-bird pricing</a>!</p><p>We spent two days embedded in Gearbox's headquarters in Frisco, Texas, playing exclusive content and talking to many folks behind the highly anticipated looter-shooter. We were the first to get our hands on all four Vault Hunters in the Borderlands 4 base game. We were also the first to explore the Carcadia Burn region, participate in various side activities throughout Gearbox's seamless world, and get a guided tour of Dominion, the Timekeeper's walled city. Within the pages of the cover story, you'll learn exclusive details from our hands-on sessions with the game, as well as our interviews with several members of the leadership and development teams at the studio. And those details will go even more in-depth as our month of coverage rolls out at <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/borderlands4">GameInformer.com/Borderlands4</a>.</p>

<p>But this issue is so much more than just that 12-page cover story. Within the pages of this issue of <em>Game Informer</em>, you'll also find Kyle Hilliard's hardware review of Nintendo Switch 2, Charles Harte's report from Summer Game Fest 2025, and Marcus Stewart's reflections on the Donkey Kong Country area of Super Nintendo World. In addition, I did a deep dive into Shinobi: Art of Vengeance and interviewed several professional skateboarders about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/05/08/honoring-two-of-the-most-critically-acclaimed-games-ever" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="11674bee-efb9-4aa2-998d-abf67c077cf4" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>'s impact. We also have an excellent piece on the creation of the titular alien in Alien: Isolation from contributor Sab Astley, as well as an interview with Sonic the Hedgehog's original designer, Naoto Ohshima, from contributor James Mielke.&nbsp;</p><p>That's on top of our standard preview suite, which includes recent coverage of games like Grand Theft Auto 6, Resident Evil Requiem, Ninja Gaiden 4, 007 First Light, Marvel Cosmic Invasion, The Outer Worlds 2, and much more! And of course, you can expect the latest reviews of games like Doom: The Dark Ages, Mario Kart World, Elden Ring: Nightreign, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and others.</p>

            <p>Did you know there's a 3v3 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> fighting game? Well there is! It's called Ultimate Sonic Smackdown, and you can play it right now.</p>
<p>Indie studio Arcforged has released the game to the public for free. In an announcement trailer released today, you can see a variety of Sonic characters duke it out in 2D. All you've got to do is join the game's official Discord server and get playing!</p>
<p>You may have guessed it from the title, but Ultimate Sonic Smackdown is actually a drastic overhaul of an older fan game: Sonic Smackdown. That game was a traditional 1v1 fighter, and has been playable online via <a href="http://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> or at US tournaments for a while now.</p>

<p>This iteration, four years in the making, is a wilder evolution of the game. A tagging system means more hectic fights, more options for offence, and the opportunity to team up your favourite Sonic characters in your chosen squad. It's the latest in a sparse scattering of Sonic the Hedgehog fighting games, first established by the official, Sega-developed Sonic the Fighters released in arcades in 1996. Its Sega Saturn port was cancelled.</p>
<p>As a tag fighter, Ultimate Sonic Smackdown joins a bizarrely packed collection of similar games coming out soon. You've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hunterxhunter-nenximpact">HunterxHunter NenxImpact</a> coming in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a> which is bound to come out sooner or later, c'mon guys. Then you've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/invincible-vs">Invincible Vs</a> coming next year, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>! So suddenly, a style of fighting game that had basically no modern representation is stacked with incoming options.
</p>
<p>Sonic has a rich history of fan games. Famously, Sega hired Christian Whitehead to be lead developer on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-mania">Sonic Mania</a>, following his work on unofficial ports of older Sonic games. There's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-unleashed-available-for-pc-at-last-thanks-to-fan-made-port-with-uncapped-framerate">also a fan-made PC port of Sonic Unleashed</a> which is rad, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-triple-trouble-gets-fan-made-16-bit-makeover">a 16-bit makeover of Sonic Triple Trouble</a> from a few years back.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-fantastic-fan-made-sonic-fighting-game-in-the-wild-and-you-can-play-it-right-now]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/painkiller-remake-officially-set-for-october-9-launch.1227072/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Saber Interactive and Anshar Studios have announced the release date for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/painkiller-returns-in-fall-2025-reimagined-with-co-op-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Painkiller remake.</a> This 'modern reimagining' of the classic 2004 first-person shooter game from People Can Fly will be available on October 9 for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are open now on all storefronts. The Standard Edition of Painkiller can be purchased digitally for $39.99. It includes the “Iron Crusade” skin pack, which features skins for all four playable characters — Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch — as well as skins for six weapons: the Electrodriver, Stakegun, Shotgun, SMG, Hand Cannon, and Rocket Launcher. Pre-orders of the Standard Edition on consoles will come with the “Burnished Pride” retail-exclusive weapons pack, which includes additional gold skins for the aforementioned six weapons. The Deluxe Edition of Painkiller is priced at $49.99. It comes with the “Iron Crusade” pre-order bonus skin pack and three additional post-launch DLCs, each including six weapon skins and four character skins.</p>
<p><iframe title="Painkiller - Pre-order Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-a4ywaWme2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Just like in the original Painkiller, the player character is sentenced to Purgatory for crimes against Heaven. However, the Voice of the Creator gives them one last chance at redemption: blasting through hordes of demons in brutal, fast-paced combat using an array of infernal weapons. Players will fight their way through gruesome, gothic environments to stop Azazel, the fallen angel, from invading Earth, and earn salvation – either alone or with up to two other players in online co-op mode, which is a change from the original, a single player-only experience.</p>
<p>There will be lots of traversal options, such as jump, grappling hook, and dash, for players as they traverse the vast landscapes. They'll face grotesque terrors that range from hordes of demons to titanic terrors such as the monstrous offspring of Azazel, the Nephilim. Character progression sees tarot cards used to upgrade the player character's abilities. Each playable character has unique perks to boost energy, health, power, and damage.</p>

Laptops running a 5050 GPU are expected to start at $999, with <a href="https://marketplace.nvidia.com/en-us/consumer/gaming-laptops/?locale=en-us&amp;page=1&amp;limit=12&amp;gpu=RTX%205050&amp;gpu_filter=RTX%205090~8,RTX%205080~16,RTX%205070%20Ti~9,RTX%205070~7,RTX%205060~3,RTX%205050~1,RTX%204080~1,RTX%204070~8,RTX%204060~7,RTX%204050~8,RTX%203050~1,RTX%202050~3">availability of some models beginning today</a>. Early models launching before Nvidia’s Game Ready Drivers are released will have drivers for the 5050 GPU pre-installed. GDDR7 VRAM is more power efficient than GDDR6, allowing the laptop version of the 5050 to fit into slimmer notebooks without getting quite as hot.</p><p>The choice to go with GDDR6 on the desktop cards feels like an odd one, even though it should outperform the laptop version with GDDR7. The desktop RTX 5050 matches the RTX 5060 with 8GB of VRAM, but being GDDR6 and having 1,280 fewer CUDA cores ensures it should have a noticeable gap in performance with the card directly above it.</p><p>Nvidia is claiming the 5050 will be able to deliver “an immersive ray-traced experience with high settings in single-player games such as <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Avowed</em>, thanks to DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation.” Its chart shows the 5050 achieving over 150 fps in that scenario with 4x MFG turned on. However, keep in mind that the fine print indicates that’s all while the GPU was paired with a $479 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24288948/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a> CPU running at 1080p resolution. In full raster, Nvidia claims the RTX 5050 is about 60 percent faster than the two-generations-old RTX 3050.</p><p>The RTX 5050 is the direct replacement of that RTX 3050, which remains one of the most popular GPUs <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fhwsurvey%2Fvideocard%2F" rel="sponsored">in use on Steam</a>.

            <p>I know <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/war-thunder">War Thunder</a> only as 1) the vehicular combat sim Emily Gera somehow penned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/british-invasion-war-thunder-adding-tanks-from-blighty">erotic poetry</a> about - "O succulent tank porn and its lusty armour"... Emily! What r u doing. STAHP - and 2) an unofficial information arm for the world's militaries, fuelled by the power of pedantry.</p>
<p>Back in July 2021, an actual tank commander <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/war-thunder-player-posts-classified-document-to-prove-tank-is-inaccurate">posted classified documents</a> for the Challenger 2 tank on the game's forums in order to prove that the game's representation of said tank is inaccurate. Now, somebody's done likewise for the pride of the United States Air Force: the British-made Harrier Jump Jet.</p><!--more-->
<p>In this latest blowout, a user uploaded a section from a US Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization manual for the AV-8B and TAV-8B Harrier airplanes. Said manual is not approved for public release and restricted to authorised US government bods and their contractors. Gaijin Entertainment's community manager has confirmed that the document breaches the forum's rules on such things, and has handed the user in question a temporary ban.</p>
<p>This and the previous leak of strictly need-to-know ballistic smut were spotted by the <a href="https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/classified-data-once-again-leaked-on-war-thunder-forums/">UK Defence Journal</a>, an unaffiliated group of hardcore wonks, including former service members. The latter org say that War Thunder has been a source of leakage at least nine times in total, with previous victims including France's Leclerc, China's ZTZ-99, the Eurocopter Tiger, the Eurofighter Typhoon and the US F-16, F-15E and F-117 jets. In each case, they say, the leak happened because some nerd wanted to win an argument. This is how the world ends, isn't it.</p>
<p>The UK Defence Journal also cite an anonymous former RAF engineer who sizes up the latest breach as follows:</p>
<p>"This probably isn't the biggest leak ever, not at all. These kinds of manuals float around online, especially older ones. But that doesn't change the fact that if it's marked as controlled or restricted, platforms like War Thunder have no choice but to take action."</p>
<p>War Thunder isn't just in the military realism business. The developers are partial to the occasional Gatling gun burst of whimsy, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/flying-saucers-take-over-war-thunder-for-april-fools-week">this weeklong flying saucer takeover</a>. No erotic tank designs for the moment, alas, though I guess there's always the modding scene. I am not going to look up the modding scene. I don't want to upset myself.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/war-thunder-player-once-again-leaks-classified-military-documents-to-win-an-argument]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Chances are if you like the SteamWorld series that this won't matter very much to you, but for those of you (like me) who've never touched a single game, here's something neat: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/steamworld-dig">SteamWorld Dig</a> is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252410/SteamWorld_Dig/">completely free on Steam right now</a>. That's free to keep forever, to be clear, not one of those free weekend types of deals. It's not free for that long, mind, only from now until June 26th, and I can't give you a specific time on that day, so if you're remotely interested you might as well just add it to your library.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There doesn't seem to be a particular reason as to why it's going free, though there is also a sale on a couple other games in the series right now. Its sequel, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/steamworld-dig-2">SteamWorld Dig 2</a>, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/571310/SteamWorld_Dig_2/">currently 94% off</a>, which is as good as free, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/steamworld-build">SteamWorld Build</a> is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2134770/SteamWorld_Build/">currently 80% off</a>, with its Mechanized DLC and soundtrack also 35% off. You've got options essentially!

Starting life on the Nintendo 3DS, SteamWorld Dig is a steampunky, western-themed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> where you play as a robot called Rusty. There's a bit of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a> element to it in that you can destroy blocks as you dig further and further, but there's a much bigger focus on exploration and resource gathering as opposed to the repeatable gameplay of the roguelike.
</p>
<p>
Whether we'll see much more of SteamWorld is the next big question though. Last year, Thunderful, the owner of the series, had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steamworld-creator-thunderful-announces-80-100-more-layoffs-as-part-of-second-round-of-restructuring">two sets</a> of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thunderful-group-to-implement-restructuring-programme-affecting-around-20-percent-of-staff">layoffs</a>, putting the next entry in the series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-steamworld-is-a-third-person-co-op-action-game">SteamWorld Headhunter</a> on hold for the time being. Doesn't exactly scream confidence.

Well, today is your day thanks to three months for $0.99 for the former and three months free for the latter. It's an epic day for game devs and players too thanks to a cracking deal on a 32" Alienware curved gaming monitor and a massive sound bundle over on Humble.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The epic Sam's Club Pokémon TCG Classic deal is back, and it's undercutting big box stores and the collectors market by nearly $100 in some cases. I've looked up the top-valued cards from the box, so you know if it's worth it or not below. Spoiler alert, it is! Let's get into it:</p><p id="3-months-free-audible"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="3 Months Free Audible">3 Months for $0.99 Audible Deal</h2></p><div catalogid="bac8eeb1-cb76-4ce5-8784-e2fb014e64c5" id="223445"><div id="223445" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3 Months Audible Premium Plus for $0.99</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Audible’s doing that 99c a month deal again for Premium Plus, and it’s a steal. Amazon Prime Members get three months free, so make sure to check for an active subscription before looking for this deal. You get three audiobooks to keep, full access to the big library, and it works even if you’ve had a sub before as long as it’s not active now. I just logged in, saw the banner, and grabbed it. <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em> is already in my library, and I’m eyeing that massive new Sanderson one next. Less than three bucks for all that? Easy win.</p></div><p id="3-months-free-kindle-unlimited"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited">3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited</h2></p><div catalogid="bac8eeb1-cb76-4ce5-8784-e2fb014e64c5" id="223446"><div id="223446" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve never really stuck with audiobooks before, but this Kindle Unlimited deal finally got me into them properly. Right now you can get three months free if you’ve got Prime, and it works on your phone or tablet, not just a Kindle. I gave it a go, downloaded a couple of books, and now I’ve actually started finishing them while I’m out walking or doing stuff around the house. It’s made getting through my backlog way easier and I didn’t have to pay a thing to try it. If you’ve been on the fence, this is a solid excuse to dive in.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Classic</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sam's Club Pokémon TCG Classic deal is back, and it's massively undercutting other big box retailers and the secondary market. Just for comparrison, the top four cards from this set, Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur and Mewtwo, are worth the same price as this discounted offer. This deal is well worth it and should be snapped up as soon as possible.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Stock Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As usual we're looking at over-inflated pricing at big box stores, but it's a dependable source of sealed product for trainers looking to add to their collections or rip open boosters. Although we'd recommend checking out secondary market prices first, as big retailers are now regularly selling over market value now too.

These sets reintroduce Mega Evolution ex cards in a powerful new form, now Stage 2 Pokémon worth 3 Prize Cards when knocked out.

                <p>Hitman developer IO Interactive is currently putting Agent 47 on the backburner while focusing on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">the upcoming James Bond game</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/007-first-light/" data-ref-id="5000-522472">007 First Light</a>. However, the new Bond title may take some cues from Hitman: World of Assassination' live-service approach by adding new missions post-launch.</p><p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak hinted at the possibility of providing Bond with ongoing support during an extended interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/how-hitman-absolutions-wasteful-toilets" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>.</p><p>"We obviously have tons of experience now from World of Assassination, and tons of experience on how to extend a single-player experience by giving desirable free content to players," said Abrak. "The first objective with 007 First light is to come out with the best possible, most impactful journey for gamers. Again, without giving too much detail, you could expect that we'll be applying some of our learnings from World of Assassination to Bond."</p><p>Abrak went on to note that First Light will feature greater stealth, action, and seamless combat options that let players switch between ranged attacks and melee on the fly. He added that Bond will follow his character's long-standing tradition of driving exotic cars.</p><p>"That gives us more challenges to play with," added Abrak. "In Hitman, you have these live challenges. And besides the things that we are able to do in Hitman, we can do more actiony things and more kinetic challenges in Bond."</p><p>The most recently released Hitman elusive target mission may be a good model for any live-service 007 First Light content. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-villain-coming-to-hitman-today-as-elusive-target/1100-6532213/" data-ref-id="1100-6532213">Mads Mikkelsen reprised his role as LeChiffre</a> from the first Daniel Craig James Bond movie, Casino Royale. If First Light can draw upon some of the classic villains from Bond's previous films, then there are ample opportunities to revisit some fan-favorites.</p><p>007 First Light isn't connected to any previous Bond incarnation and features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-trailer-reveals-the-first-ever-james-bond-origin-story/1100-6532111/" data-ref-id="1100-6532111">the title character during his origin adventure</a>. IO Interactive will release 007 First Light on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC in 2026.</p>

            <p>Sony has announced four new games on the way to its PSVR2 headset, three of which are coming this year.</p>
<p>One of those is Dreams of Another, the next game from Q-Games - the studio behind the PixelJunk games. Dreams of Another is from multimedia artist Baiyon, the director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pixeljunk-eden">PixelJunk Eden</a>.</p>
<p>The game sees players control "The Man in Pajamas", but has the philosophy of "No Creation Without Destruction". As such, shooting in this game creates the world around you from circular particles.</p>

<p>I was able to play the game (though not in VR) at the Game Developer Conference earlier this year, and found its use of "point cloud rendering" to be particularly mesmerising. I can only imagine how it'll look in VR, in both third and first person. Dreams of Another is due for release later this year.</p>
<p>Before that, though, there's Grit and Valor - 1949. A tactics rogue-lite, players take the role of a commander in an alternate timeline World War 2 to win battles by moving pieces chess-style on a tactical grid. It's due out on 21st August.</p>

<p>Also coming later this year is Hotel Infinity, a follow-up to Manifold Garden from Studio Chyr. This surreal puzzle game has players exploring an abstract hotel to solve riddles. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manifold-garden-review-rewiring-strange-architecture-in-the-void">Manifold Garden received a rare Essential from Eurogamer</a>, so expect good things from this one.</p>

<p>Last up is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/24/introducing-meteora-a-cosmic-survival-racer-for-ps-vr2/">Meteora</a>, a "cosmic survival racer" coming to PSVR2 next year. Players will navigate "explosive asteroid belts, electrically charged debris, and icy barriers" as a meteor racing across space. Energy Crystal can increase your mass and Stardust boosts your velocity, but should you focus on survivability or speed?</p>
<p>You can read more about all four games on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/24/reveals-and-updates-on-upcoming-ps-vr2-titles/">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Sony has been criticised for not supporting its PSVR2 headset. In its latest State of Play showcase, only one VR game was included - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-more-than-a-decade-classic-stealth-series-thief-is-being-revived-for-psvr2">Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow</a> - though this will also be released on other VR platforms.</p>
<p>The Meta-owned Beat Games also recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/support-for-beat-saber-on-ps4-and-ps4-ends-shining-a-light-on-psvr2s-lack-of-success">ended support for Beat Saber on PS4 and PS5</a>, what many consider to be VR's killer app.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Microsoft announced it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-dips-its-toes-into-vr-with-limited-edition-xbox-themed-meta-quest-headset">collaborated with Meta on a limited edition Xbox-themed Quest 3S headset</a>, as the company dips its toes into the world of VR.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-remembers-psvr2-exists-announces-four-new-games-coming-soon]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="DS2 MARIO REF" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b1f45ab2d49ad/ds2-mario-ref.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Kojima Productions</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, as you'll likely know, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Stranding</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1">Hideo Kojima</a>'s incredibly good walking simulator, has got itself a fancy big sequel this week in the form of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, and we've been playing it in what little free time we've got (well, this writer has, at least) over on the old PlayStation side of things.</p>
<p>You'll be pleased to know that this writer has discovered some vague, possible Mario references in the second game, and it's only early days!</p>
<p>The references-of-sorts relate to some Mushroom Badges, which are available to sew onto a backpack in the game from the get-go. There a few different mushroom badges, even a triple set - just like in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a>! Can it be a coincidence?</p>
<p>As it turns out these Mushroom Kingdom-styled mushies, rather than just being random as all hell, are actually found in the game world of Death Stranding 2, and its predecessor, (hey, they pop up when you pee!), so it stands to reason that the badges are simply tied innocently to this whole mechanic.</p>

<p>However, we're suspect of this being entirely and purely coincidental, especially given the choice of a Fly Agaric mushroom over any of the millions of other types you could have chosen.</p>
<p>Yes, you may argue that this type of mushroom appears in lots of games, possibly way more than any other, but then you'd be kicking this theory right in the Sam Porters, which isn't very nice. Anyway, the game, as you can see from our images, calls them "Golden Toadstools", so we're still 100% behind our working theory!</p>
<p>If you've played the original Death Stranding, then this probably won't surprise you. You'll already know, possibly by way of a lot of cringing, that the game contains references to Mario and Princess Peach, with one very on the nose line in particular, as seen in the clip below (warning, it's worse than you may remember).</p>

<p>Rightio! There are many discussions online about comparisons between the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/princess_peach_showtime">Mario and Peach</a> relationship mirroring that of the leads in Death Stranding, but we'll let you dig your own hole there.</p>
<p>We'll be sure to check back in if we find any Bullet Bill in Death Stranding 2 in the meantime.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Is this yet more proof that Hideo Kojima is the world's biggest Princess Peach fan? Let us know what you reckon!</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/painkiller-reboot-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/painkiller-reboot-release-date-announced-for-october.1227015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>3D Realms has announced the release date for its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>reboot, and if you've been waiting for the chance to try this one out, you'll be able to do so later this year.</p>

<p>First <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/painkiller-revival-fall-2025" rel="nofollow">announced back in March</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>reboot, which is developed by Anshar Studios, will be arriving across PC and consoles on October 9th. No mention of a Switch or Switch 2 version of the game has been made.</p>

<p>Since the release date has been announced, pre-orders for&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>are now also open, and if you pre-order the game, you'll get yourself a set of Iron Crusade character and weapon skins into the bargain.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-release-date-reboot.jpg?itok=LEL57opS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-release-date-reboot.jpg?itok=A7gIWcZu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>is coming to a PC or console near you in October.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, it's a reboot of the 2004 boomer shooter, which was arguably one of the first games to actively eschew the then-modern trappings of shooters in favor of a more retro-friendly style.</p>

<p>The game was developed by People Can Fly, the studio that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly" rel="nofollow">currently helping out The Coalition</a> with development on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: E-Day&nbsp;</em>(and, sadly, also the studio that recently had to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/people-can-fly-layoffs-projects-canceled" rel="nofollow">cancel two projects and lay off staff</a>).</p>

<p>Unlike the original&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, the new version will revolve around co-op play, and it'll contain hero shooter elements as well; you'll play as one of four characters, each of whom has their own unique perks with which to slay demons.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, though; this version of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>is still all about killing hordes of rampaging monsters, and it looks like the outlandish weapons and over-the-top feel of the original&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>have made it across to the reboot intact.</p>




<p><em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>arguably shares some challenges with Bungie's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, another shooter that's turned a beloved single-player classic into a multiplayer-focused title. Last week, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">Bungie delayed&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em></a>, citing a need for extra development time to make the game shine.</p>

<p>Whether or not that happens to&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen, but for now, the game is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013491" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/painkiller/9NMSW622HWNH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 10th.</p>

            <p>Microsoft are reportedly gearing up to lay off more staff next week, in what would be the fourth round of major job cuts at Xbox in 18 months.</p>
<p>This is according to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division">Bloomberg</a>, which says that Xbox managerial staff are "expecting substantial cuts" across Microsoft's gaming arm.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Not yet clear how many people, but it's expected to be big," reporter Jason Schreier wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3lseaakusns2s">Bluesky post</a> about the report. Bloomberg had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-18/microsoft-planning-thousands-more-job-cuts-aimed-at-salespeople">previously reported</a> that Microsoft was set to cut thousands of jobs next week, with its salespeople being the main folks affected.</p>
<p>The site notes that Microsoft declined to comment on this latest report.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been laying off staff en masse on a depressingly regular basis over the past couple of years, with 10,000 workers being let go in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsofts-mass-layoffs-will-affect-starfield-halo-infinite-and-gears-of-war-developers">January 2023</a>, 1,900 in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">January 2024</a>, and 650 in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">September 2024</a>. They also let go of around 6,000 people across the company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-is-laying-off-even-more-of-its-staff-with-potentially-almost-7000-workers-at-risk">just last month</a>.</p>
<p>It's a frankly horrifying rate of contribution to the ever-deepening sea of layoffs that the games industry's been drowning in for the <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">past few years</a>. A lot of it has come following Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uk-regulator-provisionally-approves-microsofts-activision-blizzard-buyout-following-ubisoft-deal">acquiring Activision Blizzard</a> – it’s the usual cost-cutting after a massive investment. That said, Microsoft aren’t exactly struggling on the money-making front. They <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/microsoft-msft-q3-earnings-report-2025.html">reported net income</a> of $25.8 billion for their most recent financial quarter.</p>
<p>Bloomberg notes that this latest round of Microsoft layoffs would come just before the company rolls into a new financial year after June 30. Is it cool to chuck human beings out of their livelihoods just to make a spreadsheet look a bit tidier?? No, but sadly it keeps happening.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-reportedly-set-to-lay-off-staff-yet-again-with-substantial-cuts-expected-at-xbox]]></content:encoded>

It was a game that was built from depths: depths of skill, knowledge, intelligence and narrative. It remains exactly as brilliant today as it was a quarter of a century ago.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196572" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Rebirth, A Remake, And A Remaster" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="94" data-playlist="196572,196742,196049" data-current="196572"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Rebirth, A Remake, And A Remaster</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22127.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In fact, it works better today than it did ten years back.

A decade ago, doing this required installing a handful of different mods, and there was no way to actually play it in its vanilla version. And right away, I was pulled back in, crazy clip-cloppy footstep sound effects and everything. I feel ready to yet again dive back into this world of overlapping conspiracies, deep philosophy, and juggled morality.</p><figure id="" data-id="5694b9bf4044cd9c414ad680a8f66871" data-recommend-id="image://5694b9bf4044cd9c414ad680a8f66871" data-format="jpg" data-width="1741" data-height="980" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="JC orders a drink at a bar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="JC orders a drink at a bar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eidos / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5694b9bf4044cd9c414ad680a8f66871" data-recommend-id="image://5694b9bf4044cd9c414ad680a8f66871" data-format="jpg" data-width="1741" data-height="980" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="JC orders a drink at a bar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So what makes <em>Deus Ex</em> so special?

It’s a combination of so many factors coming together so superbly, with a dream team of developers, financial backing, an exquisitely good story, and a complete lack of expectation from its future audience.</p><p>In 1996, when the economy was booming in preparation for the colossal bursting of the dot-com bubble, John Romero and Tom Hall, flush with success from id Software and its massive gaming series <em>Doom</em> and <em>Quake</em>, set out to create a new Texan developer: Ion Storm. Together, they spent lavishly, fought explosively, and created two compellingly dreadful games. First was <em>Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3</em>, and then the infamously disastrous FPS <em>Daikatana</em>. However, alongside all this, former Looking Glass (<em>Thief</em>, <em>System Shock</em>) developer Warren Ellis had been asked to create a parallel studio, Ion Storm Austin.</p><p>Distinct from Romero’s Dallas studio, Ellis had creative freedom and a pool of money, and quickly hired talent he knew from his days at Looking Glass, including Harvey Smith (<em>Dishonored</em>). In just 28 months, a tiny team of 20 pulled together (albeit with production troubles, serious frustrations, and “knock-down drag-out fights”) one of the most immersive, intricate games the world has ever known.</p><figure id="" data-id="ae4760c5d4af9db9fdc5cf468d3e0c52" data-recommend-id="image://ae4760c5d4af9db9fdc5cf468d3e0c52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoilers!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Spoilers!" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eidos / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ae4760c5d4af9db9fdc5cf468d3e0c52" data-recommend-id="image://ae4760c5d4af9db9fdc5cf468d3e0c52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoilers!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the original <em>Deus Ex</em>, before its unfairly maligned Xbox-led sequel and its goth-eyed post-2010 prequels, you play as JC Denton, a cybernetically augmented human who works for a government agency called UNATCO. He discovers his brother Paul is working for a terrorist organization, the NSF, all amidst a global pandemic called the Grey Death. Very quickly, your assumptions about good and bad, right and wrong, are questioned, and you’re drawn into an intricate web of conspiracies and conflicting alliances.</p><p>This plays out...kinda how you want it to! There’s obviously a core, unavoidable plot, but how you approach it will dramatically affect the story you allow yourself to be told. It can be an ultra-violent FPS, where you blast through enemies with rockets and explosives, or a super-spy sim as you assassinate opponents, or you can be an unseen stealth pacifist, determined to kill no one, relying entirely on tranquilizers and stun guns. Every mission can be approached in multiple fashions, from spectacularly smashing through the roof of a building for an all-out gun fight, to slipping in through the vents such that no one ever knew you were there.</p><figure id="" data-id="6472ff76f78891a75cf72bb2f1267753" data-recommend-id="image://6472ff76f78891a75cf72bb2f1267753" data-format="jpg" data-width="2002" data-height="1127" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gunter with his mad red eyes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gunter with his mad red eyes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eidos / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6472ff76f78891a75cf72bb2f1267753" data-recommend-id="image://6472ff76f78891a75cf72bb2f1267753" data-format="jpg" data-width="2002" data-height="1127" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gunter with his mad red eyes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ve told this anecdote too many times before, so apologies, but it captures the essence of what makes <em>Deus Ex</em> quite so extraordinary: At the time of its 2000 release, I was writing for the UK version of <em>PC Gamer</em>, where the reviews editor was one Kieron Gillen (now best known for his comics work, but once my colleague at <em>RPS</em>). Gillen had played the game for his world-class review (I’d link to it, but Future Publishing treats people’s efforts to archive its magazines with hostility—instead I’m copying out of my physical edition), which contained the words:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Games—like most other forms of entertainment—have a terrible habit of making you less than you are normally, simplifying you into a stripped-down cartoon...<em>Deus Ex</em> is one of the few games that succeeds in making you more than you are. Because <em>Deus Ex</em>’s universe is, obviously, reduced, you feel as if you have more freedom than you do in reality, which, like <em>Fight Club </em>for example, reminds you of your own freedom in reality. It’s a slap in the face, it reminds us how good videoart can be. And this <em>is</em> art. It’s beautiful. And I’m going to stop now before I start to cry...</p></blockquote><p>I was playing it soon after, and occasionally calling Kieron to chat about what was happening. On one call I said to him, “I couldn’t believe it when my brother died.”</p><p>“My brother didn’t die!” Kieron responded in bemusement. And then we both had a moment in silence, realizing that this game was offering even more than we’d already thought.</p><p><em>Deus Ex </em>was a game in which the finest details rung with intelligence, in which every book you found contained provocative ideas or conflicting philosophies, in which characters responded to you in subtly different ways depending upon how you were playing the game; on this micro level it felt malleable and responsive to you and how you reacted to it. But to discover that it was also offering the same flexibility to massive story beats was just mindblowing.</p><figure id="" data-id="0517da25ace10a826de274bd8d8cefbb" data-recommend-id="image://0517da25ace10a826de274bd8d8cefbb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large stone hand reaching over a globe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large stone hand reaching over a globe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eidos / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0517da25ace10a826de274bd8d8cefbb" data-recommend-id="image://0517da25ace10a826de274bd8d8cefbb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large stone hand reaching over a globe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The game’s influence on the industry is impossible to overstate. While the circumstances and relative creative freedom afforded to its development are extremely hard to come by twenty-five years on, you can see the game’s DNA in so many of the games we love today. Even beyond the more obvious, all the immersive sims born in its shadow (<em>BioShock</em>, <em>Dishonored</em>, <em>Prey...</em>), so many developers cite <em>Deus Ex</em> as a major source. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s quest director Mateusz Tomaskiewicz named <em>Deus Ex</em> when asked for his main inspirations. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-quest-director-says-deus-ex-was-a-big-inspiration-and-not-just-the-sunglasses/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-quest-director-says-deus-ex-was-a-big-inspiration-and-not-just-the-sunglasses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to <em>GamesRadar</em></a></span> he said,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>This one had a great impact on me as a developer and player back when I played it for the first time many years ago. And what I really liked about that game was completing the missions in many ways. It was not only based on dialogue decisions, since you also had the things that were on the map and its different points of entry that allowed you to get into buildings, as well as elements that opened different paths in history.</p></blockquote><p>But most importantly, it’s still a hell of a game to play today. Sure, its art is a bit crummy—it was criticized for this when it was released! God, those wall textures. But it matters so very, very little once you’re deep in its story, learning what it has to teach, reacting against what you find abhorrent, embracing what draws you in. (I’ll never forget my moment of pure horror when, working as a youth worker as I also was during the game’s release, one of the teenagers told me how furious he was about being forced to leave UNATCO, as to him they were clearly the good guys. Uh-oh.) </p><p>It’s currently just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$3.49 on GOG</a></span> (although it often comes down to a lot less than that on both GOG and Steam), and if you’ve never played it, then prepare to have your life properly, actually changed.</p><p>Happy birthday, <em>Deus Ex</em>! Thanks for changing my life too.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-25-years-ion-storm-looking-glass-warren-ellis-1851784985]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A new mystery game inspired by Disco Elysium, 12 Minutes, and The Outer Wilds has been revealed by Turkish game studio Elyzio. Called Pera Coda, the game is described as an adventure full of surreal mystery, and it takes place in a city seldom explored in video games: Istanbul.</p><p>In Pera Coda, players will take control of Deniz, an attorney trapped in a subconscious state between life and death. Forced to become the judge and defendant in an existential trial, Deniz must confront traumatic memories to uncover hidden truths and solve a growing mystery as he explores a surreal recreation of the Turkey's largest city.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhONOEfReXQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uhONOEfReXQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"This is both a love letter to our city and a universal human story about guilt, regret, and the search for peace," said Pera Coda art director Ahmet Kazanci. "[The game is] rooted in a surreal reimagining of Istanbul, real locations, rich with local nuance and emotional texture that are rarely seen in games. Istanbul becomes both a stage and a mirror, where East meets West, chaos meets calm, and each district reflects a piece of your fragmented self."</p><p>Elyzio says that players can expect intuitive point-and-click gameplay mechanics, as the studio is aiming for players to feel immersed--not overwhelmed--by the interactions around them. The narrative-heavy game features "no combat, no grind" and the recreation of Istanbul is viewed through an isometric lens. A release date has not yet been revealed, but it is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3607300/Pera_Coda/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam right now</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youll-soon-be-able-to-play-the-re-imagined-disco-elysium-for-android/1100-6532654/">Disco Elysium fans will soon be able to play the mobile version</a> of the award-winning game. Developer ZA/UM has described it as a "total reimagination" and it'll be available for Android devices starting August 5.</p>
