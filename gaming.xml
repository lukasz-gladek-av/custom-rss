<p>Ubisoft has spent a long time working on XDefiant, and now it’s reportedly shutting down—according to reports. The 2024 shooter is seen as a big rival to Call of Duty, so let’s find out everything we know about XDefiant’s future, and if you need to play for big changes.</p>



<p>The online first-person shooter landscape is primarily dominated by the same faces. When you narrow it down to military shooters though, the pool shortens more so. Battlefield 2042 notoriously launched to negative reception, and many contemporaries are either hero shooters or third-person titles. XDefiant was supposed to be just that, a defiant stance catering to shooter fans tired of the annual Call of Duty release.</p>



<p>XDefiant’s beta performed well, Ubisoft responded to player feedback as they said they would, and the worldwide launch was hotter than a dinner part with The Cleaners faction. Let’s see if things have gone south since, and what it could mean.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-xdefiant-shutting-down">Is XDefiant Shutting Down?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Now I have to turn my back on you. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>XDefiant is officially shutting down in June 2025, and the shooter is set to receive hugely reduced content updates moving forward.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming first broke the news on Dec. 3, that XDefiant is shutting down for good. The major details revealed, that “a skeleton crew [is] maintaining the title until June 2025,” and that once Season 3 launches, this signals the end of XDefiant’s regular content schedule, instead, the occasional update is expected to follow based on already-made assets and parts. This is in stark contrast to recent reports that XDefiant wouldn’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-executive-producer-denies-claim-the-game-will-shut-down-after-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down after Season 4</a>.</p>



<p>Worse still, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-about-xdefiant-closure-and-the-future-of-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot issued a company-wide memo</a> to “pay tribute to the tremendous work done by the XDefiant’s teams,” but discussed downsizing by way of “<strong>The closure of the San Francisco and Osaka studios</strong>, and the <strong>ramp down of the Sydney production site</strong>.”</p>



<p>It’s understood Ubisoft is refunding players for any cosmetic purchases and Founder’s Packs. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-xdefiant-shutting-down">Why is XDefiant Shutting Down?</h2>



<p>According to sources close to the situation, “<strong>Poor player numbers and a lack of player spending</strong>” are the reasons for XDefiant shutting down in 2025.</p>



<p>XDefiant is a free-to-play, live-service title, and as such, it means the shooter’s revenue comes from the voluntary purchases of players. Battle Passes, Skins, and specialist currency are all part of the XDefiant e-commerce system. It appears XDefiant players were not spending enough money on optional cosmetics, leading the shooter to “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-fallen-behind-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fall behind expectations.</a>“</p>



<p>It seems bizarre in hindsight, as XDefiant’s debut registered a whopping <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one million unique players in under three hours</a>. The numbers skyrocketed to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-8-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eight million unique players by the end of its first full week</a>. It wasn’t to be though, as player numbers began to tail off, and XDefiant’s downfall slowly unfolded during the next few months.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you sad to see XDefiant hang up its holsters already? Could Ubisoft have done anything differently with the FPS title? Let us know down below. Be sure to look at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-not-dying-ubisoft-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant roadmap</a> detailing the final planned content.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-release-date-revealed-for-march.1051698/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed the release date for upcoming anime fighting game&nbsp;<em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls</em>, which promises to offer the chance to engage in battles just like the ones you've seen in the manga and anime.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>will arrive on March 21st. It's heading to PC and consoles, but like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-switch" rel="nofollow">many games launching in the next year or so</a>, it seems to be skipping the Switch.</p>

<p>Many characters from&nbsp;<em>Bleach&nbsp;</em>are set to make an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Rebirth of Souls</em>, including Ichigo, Kenpachi Zaraki, and Renji Abarai, among others. If you're a&nbsp;<em>Bleach&nbsp;</em>fan, then it's likely your favorite fighter will make the cut.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-release-date-ichigo-renji.jpg?itok=95Ar6YLL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-release-date-ichigo-renji.jpg?itok=Kkf9mIWh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>promises to be the definitive&nbsp;<em>Bleach&nbsp;</em>arena fighter.</figcaption></figure><p>Each character in&nbsp;<em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>will have access to unique sword abilities to help them turn the tide of combat, just as you'd expect.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco is also promising that&nbsp;<em>Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>will allow you to use a single strike to "spell defeat for your opponent", so it sounds like you'll need to have your wits about you to avoid getting put down before the fight has even begun.</p>

<p>Additionally, as battles progress, you'll "unlock new forms and new blades" to help you snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. In short, it sounds like the game is aiming to mimic the desperate last-gasp shonen fights for which&nbsp;<em>Bleach&nbsp;</em>became so well-known.</p>

<p>You can check out the new release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>This isn't&nbsp;<em>Bleach</em>'s first foray into the world of video games, although it's arguably the first major 3D arena fighter to be based on the property (if, that is, you <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-jump-force-trailer-shows-off-bleach-characters-pretty-visuals" rel="nofollow">don't count&nbsp;<em>Jump Force</em></a>, which I'm assuming a lot of folks would rather not do).</p>

<p><em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1689620/BLEACH_Rebirth_of_Souls/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10001710" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-pre-order/9MW2PF98HPNG/0017/9VHRG4FW3X1N" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 21st.</p>

But in the end, I prevailed and walked away with the Lullaby.</p><h2 id="h192192"><a id=""></a>Where To Get The Lullaby Unique Assault Rifle</h2><figure id="" data-id="b30cb5f7d8031914254083d3257e8108" data-recommend-id="image://b30cb5f7d8031914254083d3257e8108" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player stands outside an abandoned army warehouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player stands outside an abandoned army warehouse." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b30cb5f7d8031914254083d3257e8108" data-recommend-id="image://b30cb5f7d8031914254083d3257e8108" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player stands outside an abandoned army warehouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I initially learned about the location of Lullaby, I thought its proximity to the Lesser Zone would mean a cakewalk compared to the Riemann SMG up north. I was incorrect, though. You see, the Chemical Plant is filled with enemies, and due to the A-Life quirks, they continuously spawn. By the time I clambered through the upstairs window to open the Journalist’s Stash to acquire the Lullaby, two more bandit groups and another small horde of Snorks spawned and were fighting in the streets below.</p><p>But for now, let’s focus on acquiring the unique assault rifle. To get it, start by climbing up the truck outside the front entrance until you’re aligned with the second floor, then hop across to the awning hanging over the front door.

<p>As 2024 winds down, another game studio has closed its doors for good. Deceive Inc. developer Sweet Bandits Studios has announced that it is shutting down, effectively immediately.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/a-message-from-sweet-bandits.2340721/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">forum post</a> on Tuesday, the Canadian studio announced that it is “no more” after reaching “the breaking point for the studio”.</p>



<p>“After a long and difficult road of trying to get Deceive inc. in a state where it could thrive, we have reached the breaking point for the studio, unable to continue this adventure with you,” the studio said.</p>



<p>“While this is a moment of great sadness for us, we are happy to have been given the chance to create this universe and share it with you all. We were amazed by the passion of this community and this has been a driving force for us all along, pushing us to try and make this project reach the potential it has. We’ve put our heart and soul into this game and nothing makes us happier than seeing it resonate with other people across the world.”</p>



<p>Sweet Bandits launched Deceive Inc. in 2023 to a “very positive” response from players on Steam. According to the studio, they are working with publisher Tripwire Interactive in order to maintain the game and keep it online.</p>



<p>“We will share news with everyone once we have more details,” they said. “In the meantime, servers and game access will continue as they have been.”</p>



<p>While the company didn’t confirm how many people have lost their jobs, the <a href="https://www.sweetbanditsstudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio’s website</a> says that it had 18 employees. It’s unclear, however, if that number was still accurate.</p>

<p>"This isn't just about playing a game; it's about embarking on a personal driving journey," said Polyphony Digital president Kazunori Yamauchi in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/04/my-first-gran-turismo-launches-on-ps5-and-ps4-december-6/">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p>"We've made sure the experience is intuitive, allowing anyone to get behind the wheel and master the essentials, such as cornering, braking, and acceleration. By playing it, users will build confidence one lap at a time, tackling new challenges that'll steadily refine their driving skills."</p><p>My First Gran Turismo features simplified versions of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>'s modes, including Race Events, Time Trials, and Music Rally stages. There are 18 unique cars to drive and iconic tracks from series past like Kyoto Driving Park, Deep Forest Raceway, and Trial Mountain Circuit.</p>
<p>Gran Turismo first released on the original PlayStation and became its best-selling game. Earlier this week it made our list of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-10-ps1-games-that-mattered-the-most">the most important games on the console</a>.</p>

            <p>Sony has given us our first look at controller-free hand tracking on PlayStation VR2, thanks to footage which has started making the rounds on social media.</p>
<p>The footage in question is of a demo at the Siggraph Asia 2024 computer graphics conference in Tokyo. This demo sees the user taking part in a cleaning mini-game. The actions on screen are achieved by using hand gestures, with no controllers required (see first embed below)</p>

<p>Sony's demo booth additionally lists the tracking rate at 60 fps, claiming the system "displays the hands smoothly" with "low latency". According to the text, the hand tracking tech will be able to detect 12 types of gesture.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that while PS VR2 hasn't had hand tracking up until this point, other VR sets such as Quest 2 and 3 have hand tracking as standard.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Sony for further comment on the PS VR2's potential hand tracking future. We will update you when we know more.</p>

			<p>Fitness Boxing 3: Your Personal Trainer is a genuinely enjoyable and fairly well-thought-out way to exercise, just so long as you’re confident in your ability not to hurt yourself when punching thin air. As a fitness nut of sorts, I like finding new ways to workout, but the main thing that any exercise method needs to be is fun. Ultimately, if I don’t feel like it’s working and it’s generally an unenjoyable slog, I’m never going to do it, and yes, I am pooping on cardio as a whole here because I hate it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fitness Boxing 3: Your Personal Trainer – Overview Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gTrnSqzU3JM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>However, one thing I adore is immediate feedback, and while some of the voice options in Fitness Boxing 3 can feel a little bit robotic, the mix of noises, haptic rumble, and your incredibly happy personal trainer telling you how great you are, means that every workout feels genuinely good. I’d still love to see amped-up versions of classic Nintendo tracks in favor of the generic dance songs that are present here, but maybe that’s just because I think F-Zero music is already worth working up a sweat to.</p>


<p>Each workout offers you a time upfront along with the moves you’ll be doing during it, and a rough calorie burn that you’ll get from it. There’s some new modes here, including Mitt Drills and Sit Fit Boxing, which is great for accessibility, but for most people on most days you’ll be doing the daily workout that the game puts together for you once you’ve put in your goals and body stats. This is a nice way to eliminate the hassle of booting up the game and worrying about what you should be doing, and being able to choose from a 20, 30, or 40-minute version of your daily workout is a wonder for anyone who’s on a time limit, which you probably are.</p>


<p>What I really like though, is that during workouts, and sometimes after them, your personal trainer will suggest shifting to a slightly harder workout, or a short high-speed one to really get you sweating. I’m actually a qualified personal trainer, and this is something I do a lot, so it’s incredibly funny to be on the other end of it. It’s just a nice way to get you doing a little bit more when you’re already doing something, and it’s genuinely very effective.</p>
<p>Along with the punchy workouts themselves, you can also customize a bunch of things throughout the game, like the hair colour, eyes and clothes of the personal trainer. This is nice, if you need a specific version of a person to tell you to do things. We’re not judging you, and neither is the game, given that you can build up a rapport of sorts with the trainers to unlock special kinds of training.</p>

<p>You’ve then got a bunch of stats you can track and scores to beat as well, which is another nice incentive if you’re feedback-driven – you probably are if you’re looking into Fitness Boxing 3 as a way to train.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I really like Fitness Boxing 3 as a training tool. I've been incorporating it into my workout routine getting my cardio in the morning with Fitness Boxing 3, and then doing my weights at lunchtime for a more complete experience. If you're looking for a fun way to start moving, then this could well be it.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Xseed has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em>, a strategy JRPG from the creators of the&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape&nbsp;</em>franchises.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer, the game will launch for PC and Nintendo Switch on April 24th, so you'll only have a few more months to wait to get your hands on it. There's no word of a release for other major platforms yet, sadly.</p>

<p>It's good to know that&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa</em>'s Kazutaka Kodaka and&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape</em>'s Kotaro Uchikoshi have managed to get this one over the line. Back in June, Kodaka <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/danganronpa-creators-new-game-risking-lives" rel="nofollow">said that he and his team were "risking their lives"</a> to secure financing for the game and get it made.</p>

Can you tell?</figcaption></figure><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>will tell the story of Takumi Sumino, a "totally average teenager" who's whisked away to the titular Last Defense Academy following an attack on his hometown by monsters.</p>

<p>Sumino, along with 14 other students, must keep their school safe for 100 days as part of the Special Defense Unit, and as they fight, they'll learn how much they're "willing to sacrifice to take back their normal lives and save the world".</p>

<p>Appropriately enough, the premise feels rather like a marriage between&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape</em>, and since&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line&nbsp;</em>is the brainchild of the creators of those franchises, that probably shouldn't come as a surprise.</p>

<p>You can check out the new "Extreme Despair Trailer" for&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>below. As you can probably surmise from that title, we're not exactly in for a laugh-a-minute comedy extravaganza with this one.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as Nintendo Switch, on April 24th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-developer-torn-banner-studios-announced-layoffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Torn Banner Studios, the developers behind No More Room in Hell 2 and Chivalry 2, have announced layoffs amid a “restructure” at the company. </p>



<p>The news was announced on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/torn-banner-studios_a-message-from-steve-piggott-torn-banner-activity-7269735996861091841-xf_y/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> by CEO Steve Piggott.</p>



<p>“Today I want to share some unfortunate news for Torn Banner Studios,” Piggott said. We have made the very difficult decision to undergo a restructure and reduce some of our talented workforce.</p>



<p>“As a fully independent, self-funded developer, we’re up against many challenges. Our team is navigating this process with a tremendous amount of care and appreciation for those that are impacted. Torn Banner Studios would not be the place it is today without the dedication, passion, and accomplishments of these great people.”</p>







<p>Piggott continued to say that No More Room in Hell 2’s development will continue on, and that the studio is “fully committed as we move forward with a full 1.0 release in 2025”. The game, he says, is “central to our goals as a studio”.</p>



<p>“We are still actively working on everything we’ve spoken about in our roadmap, and more,” he said. “Torn Banner will continue to work hard to develop the game alongside our community.”</p>



<p>The studio’s other game, Chivalry 2, will have servers remain active after the game received its final update earlier this year.</p>



<p>Those being let go at the company will receive severance packages and are able to keep their work computers.</p>



<p>“We’ll also be working hard to help people find positions at other studios where we can,” Piggott added.</p>



<p>At this time, it’s unclear exactly how many people are being let go from Torn Banner Studios in this round of layoffs. Insider Gaming has reached out for clarification, and will update this article should a response be received.</p>



<p>The gaming industry has seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more than 14,600 confirmed jobs</a> lost across 170+ companies in 2024. Based on Insider Gaming sources, the real number — including unannounced layoffs — totals over 16,000.</p>

It features a high rate of fire, exceptional accuracy, and moderate range/ Its relatively low damage per shot is offset by the high DPS . Lastly, it goes for approximately 32,000 coupons if you choose to sell the rifle.</p><p>Of course, the Riemann SMG in <em>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl </em>is only one of the many unique weapons across the Zone.

                <p>Humble has revealed its December lineup of games, and this month, there's a great selection of intriguing sci-fi, sandy action, and cyberpunk fun to pick up. In case you haven't used it before, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble Choice costs $12 monthly</a> and offers several perks, including a monthly batch of PC games that are yours to keep forever, even if your cancel your subscription. Other benefits include exclusive discounts at the Humble store and access to the Humble Vault--an additional rotating library of games exclusive to members.</p><h2>Humble Choice December 2024 Games</h2><ul><li>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</li><li>Old World</li><li>Atlas Fallen: Reign of Sand</li><li>Crime Boss: Rockay City</li><li>The Invincible</li><li>Moonstone Island</li><li>Inkulinati</li><li>Venba</li><li>Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip</li></ul><p>This month you can grab Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, a spiritual successor to Sega's Jet Set Radio. Like the games that inspired it, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk has a cel-shaded art style and it's set in a city where local gangs compete for clout by being as <em>extreme</em> as possible. There are various ways to get around New Amsterdam--from rollerblades to skateboarding--and you can leave your mark on the city with fresh graffiti. Assemble your crew, explore the five boroughs, and avoid the fuzz as you take on rival crews and strange enemies.</p><p>Another noteworthy game this month is Atlas Fallen, a solid action-adventure that recently received new enemies, quests, a reworked campaign, and a revamped progression system through a major update. It's a satisfying game where you wield strange powers to take on deadly beasts and cruel gods, so if you've been looking to pick this up, then this is a good time to do so following its overhaul.</p><p>For anyone looking to explore a seemingly deserted alien planet, you can check out The Invincible. Billed as a story-driven game inspired by the sci-fi stories of Piolish writer Stanislaw Lem, The Invincible is a philosophical look at humanity's place in the cosmos. Then there's Crime Boss: Rockay City, a bad game about pulling off heists and escaping with some sweet loot. It's basically Payday with a cast that includes Chuck Norris, Vanilla Ice, Danny Glover, Kim Basinger, Danny Trejo, and Michael Madsen, and reviews were lukewarm at best when it launched last year.</p><p>Other highlights this month include the cozy life-simulator Moonstone Island, medieval turn-based strategy with a unique look in Inkulinati, delicious storytelling in Venba, a colorful tale of burnt rubber and love in Monster Roadtrip, and incredibly deep strategy in Old World.</p><p>As a reminder, 5% of every Humble Choice membership is donated to charity, and this month, proceeds will go to the humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief. If you're looking to grab a few Humble Bundle deals this month, you can also check out the list below of what's currently available.</p><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fscifi-shooters&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sci-Fi Shooters Bundle</a> -- 8 items for $19</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fdisney-classics-black-friday&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Disney Classics: Black Friday Bundle</a> -- 17 items for $10</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fthe-telltale-collection&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Telltale Collection</a> -- 8 items for $12</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Frawcember-to-remember&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Raw Fury: Rawcember to Remember Bundle</a> -- 14 items for $15</li></ul>

Developer GSC Game World <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-gets-day-one-patch-improvements-but-problems-remain-across-pc-and-xbox/1100-6527951/" data-ref-id="1100-6527951">released a day-one patch</a> to address some of Stalker 2's lingering issues. However, the title is still missing the A-Life 2.0 system that was initially promised on its Steam page. Now, GSC Game World is opening up about why A-Life 2.0 isn't in the game and how the Steam page was changed.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, creative director Maria Grygorovych explained that A-Life 2.0 is still in Stalker 2; it just isn't working as intended yet. The first Stalker used the initial A-Life--which was created as an AI program to give NPC characters in the world of the game a life of their own beyond any interactions with the players. A-Life 2.0 was meant to be the next generation of that program, if it can be made to function correctly.</p><p>GSC CEO Ievgen Grygorovych told IGN that as the game's launch date neared, the team attempted to shrink the area around the player affected by A-Life 2.0 before they encountered game-breaking bugs that forced the team to turn off the feature for now. Maria Grygorovych added that the change in the game's Steam description came from someone in the marketing department who made the edit without telling her. Both Grygorovychs also insisted that the developer is still committed to implementing A-Life 2.0 and ironing out its issues.</p><p>"For now we [are] committed to players to make it work and it can be done from directions both optimizing, giving more resources to A-Life, fixing bugs, making it work properly, and then putting more efforts to make it more advanced," said Ievgen Grygorovych.</p><p>As if that issue wasn't enough to deal with, Russian propaganda outlets recently began accusing of Stalker 2 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/russian-propaganda-claims-stalker-2-is-drafting-players-into-the-ukrainian-military/1100-6528177/" data-ref-id="1100-6528177">drafting players into the Ukrainian army</a>. The documentary <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/war-game-trailer-chronicles-the-making-of-stalker-2-during-wartime/1100-6526549/" data-ref-id="1100-6526549">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> demonstrated how GSC Game World's team was affected by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Half of the team was forced to flee the country to finish Stalker 2, while the rest remained and some among them choose to fight in the war. Regardless of the game's ongoing issues, Stalker 2 has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/day-one-game-pass-launch-stalker-2-crosses-major-sales-milestone/1100-6527971/" data-ref-id="1100-6527971">sold over 1 million copies across PC and Xbox</a>, and it remains available on Game Pass.

<p>In <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/a-message-from-sweet-bandits.2340721/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the forum of <i>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</i>publisher Tripwire, lead designer and Sweet Bandits co-founder&nbsp;Philippe Pelletier Baribault, also known as Baribandit, says he and his company have "reached the breaking point", and that they are "unable to continue this adventure".</p>

<p>Baribault says he and Sweet Bandits walked a "long and difficult road of trying to get&nbsp;<em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>in a state where it could thrive", but that they haven't managed to achieve this goal, hence the studio's closure.</p>

It's possible, then, that&nbsp;<em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>won't be shutting down.</p>

<p>In fact, right now, servers and access to the game will remain active, although a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/820520/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">quick look at the game's SteamDB numbers</a> indicates that this might not be the most meaningful decision, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Even if&nbsp;<em>Deceive Inc.</em>'s servers do remain available for play, however, it doesn't look like we'll be getting any new games from Sweet Bandits in the future, which is a shame.</p>




<p><em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deceive-inc-release-date-unmasked-for-march" rel="nofollow">released back in March last year</a>. It's a competitive multiplayer shooter based on espionage and subtlety; you're better off sneaking around rather than going in guns blazing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems that the game's quirky, cartoony art style and focus on stealth rather than arena combat failed to help it find an audience.</p>

<p>That said, Sweet Bandits' demise is just the latest tragedy in a long line of studio closures, project cancellations, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">widespread industry layoffs</a> that have affected both big companies and small developers alike.</p>
