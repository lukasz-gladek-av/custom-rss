The long-awaited successor to the Switch will be available on June 5th for $449.99. It will be available for preorder in the US from select retailers starting on April 9th, as both a standalone console or bundled with <em><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">Mario Kart World</a></em></em> for $499.99.</p><p>As predicted, the Switch 2 features a larger 7.9-inch LCD display, with support for 1080p resolution and HDR, 256GB of built-in storage, and up to 6.5 hours of battery life. The Joy-Cons are bigger, too, and now magnetically attach to the console instead of relying on a pair of sliding rails to snap into place. They also offer mouse-like functionality with select games, and the right Joy-Con sports a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24107678">“C” button</a>, which can be used for in-game chat features, screensharing, and other actions.</p><div><p>As for games, the Switch 2 will launch with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">Mario Kart World</a>,</em> along with third-party games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/623660/split-fiction-review-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two">Split Fiction</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23881536/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-2-0">Cyberpunk 2077</a></em>. The console <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will also be backward-compatible</a> with original Switch games and support enhanced versions of select titles, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641365/nintendo-zelda-botw-totk-switch-2-edition-announced"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the</em> <em>Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>.</p></div><p>Below, we’ve rounded up all the preorder information you need if you want to be one of the first to get your hands on it. We’ll be updating this post regularly as more information becomes available, so bookmark this page if you’re keen on learning more ahead of the launch.</p><div><p id="qNz1cS"><h2>How to preorder via Nintendo</h2></p></div><p>The only confirmed retailer as of now is the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Fhow-to-buy%2F" rel="sponsored">My Nintendo Store</a>, which comes with a string of eligibility requirements — one of which requires you to register your interest in advance of April 9th. To do so, you’ll need to sign in with your Nintendo account and choose which console configuration you prefer (and which accessories). Then, you’ll receive an invitation email when it’s time to buy it, assuming you’ve satisfied several other conditions.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->450</span></p><div><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 offers a 7.9-inch display with 1080p resolution and HDR support. It also features improved processing power and larger Joy-Con controllers, which magnetically attach to the sides of the console.</p></div></div><p>As of right now, the reservation process is limited to Nintendo account holders in the US and Canada who are at least 18 years old. Invitations will be valid for 72 hours and will be “prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis,” according to Nintendo; you’ll also need to have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months and have logged 50 hours of gameplay on the original Switch as of April 2nd, 2025, to be eligible. What’s more, you must have opted in to <em>share</em> gameplay data with Nintendo (you can see if you’ve done so <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/privacy">in the privacy section</a> when logged into your account).</p><p>Once invitations have been sent to account holders who have met these criteria, Nintendo says it will send invitations to “remaining eligible registrants” on a first-come, first-served basis. Unsurprisingly, the invitations will be nontransferable and sent to the email address you used while registering your interest with Nintendo. Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account, at least during the initial invitation period, with the first batch of invitations going out on May 8th.</p><p>Additional invitations will follow periodically, though Nintendo hasn’t specified details beyond that.</p><div><p id="how-to-preorder-elsewhere"><h2>How to preorder elsewhere</h2></p></div><p>As mentioned above, Nintendo is the only retailer thus far that has provided any insight into how preorders will work when they open on April 9th. That said, you can already sign up at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/jjuweufjmbxay">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2F20019700.html" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a> to receive notifications about the upcoming console and games. Presumingly, this will also include preorder details once they’re available.</p><p>Like with previous launches, we anticipate that Amazon, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fnintendo-switch-games-video%2F-%2FN-p86ax%3Ftype%3Dproducts" rel="sponsored">Target</a>, and Walmart will all have limited stock of the console, as well. But despite Nintendo “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606817/nintendo-switch-2-production-demand-q-a">taking risks</a>” to ensure it can meet demands, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638668/you-might-have-a-hard-time-getting-a-switch-2">reports indicate</a> that US retailers might not have enough Switch 2 consoles to meet preorder demands. With any luck, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">Nintendo’s stringent reservation requirements</a> will thwart any potential scalpers.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's called Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD, and it's coming to the console at launch on June 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Bravely series of RPGs was begun as a spin-off of sorts of Final Fantasy back in the 3DS era, with Bravely Default: Flying Fairy being the first in the series. The games feature a unique battle mechanic where players can either opt to "Default" or defend, and store energy to then "Brave" and make multiple moves in a single turn.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bravely Default making a return is a big deal, as both Bravely Default and Bravely Second, its direct sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bravely-default-3ds-games-shutting-down-online-features-soon">had their online city-building features shut down</a> in 2023. This version appears to bring back the online features in some fashion, alongside "upgraded features and enhancements" and a number of new minigames. The exact nature of these upgrades is still up in the air, so we'll have to wait to find out exactly how much is different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch already has one Bravely game, Bravely Default 2 (not to be confused with the aforementioned Bravely Second), which came out in 2022 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bravely-default-2-review">which we gave an 8/10</a>, calling it "a long, familiar JRPG journey with excellent customizable combat and beautiful backdrops that pass the time as you work through its extended stretches of grinding."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at the Nintendo Direct today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It’s far from a release date and could absolutely be pushed, but for now, it’s the most promising update for Hollow Knight: Silksong we’ve gotten in years.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally confirmed for just Nintendo Switch and PC, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-trailer"><u>Xbox (and Game Pass)</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-ps4-and-ps5"><u>PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5</u></a> versions being added later, Team Cherry has been slowly ramping up the conversation around Silksong after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-hollow-knight-silksong-news-at-e3-2021"><u>going quiet for a long time</u></a>. It was announced a whopping six years ago almost to the day, and outside of the occasional pop-up, it has laid dormant since. The studio behind the Hollow Knight follow-up did promise that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-release-window-next-12-months"><u>launch would soon arrive back in 2022</u></a>, but as the months came and went, hope began to dwindle that Hollow Knight: Silksong would ever arrive - until recently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Cherry kicked off 2025 with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">a mysterious tease related to a chocolate cake recipe</a>, leading desperate fans to hope that a re-reveal would arrive in April. Of course, we now know that, somehow, the riddle-solving Hollow Knight fans were right to expect a reveal alongside the Switch 2 Direct. Although today’s 2025 release window promise offered little in terms of actually showing what the game has to offer, it’s at least something to mark on your calendars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Time will tell if Team Cherry will finally be able to nail down a Hollow Knight: Silksong release date before the year is out.

Over on the official Nintendo store, the company is implementing some pre-order measures to ensure bona fide Switch players are getting their pre-orders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My Nintendo Store</a>, those with a Nintendo Account can register their interest in pre-ordering a Nintendo Switch 2 system and "select accessories" from the Nintendo Store. Those who express interest will then get an invitation email once their turn in line comes up, valid for 72 hours. The catch? You'll need to have put in some time on your old Switch, and been a Switch Online member.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Invitation emails will be prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis to registrants who have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership and a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours, as of April 2, 2025," according to the fine print on the site.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo also notes that invitations are "non-transferable" and will be sent to email addresses associated with the Nintendo Account that registers interest. For the system and each accessory, there will also be a one-per-account limit during the invitation period. Currently on the site, you can express interest in either a base Nintendo Switch 2 system, or the one bundled with Mario Kart World.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Orders will be shipped after purchase, and the approximate shipping date will be provided when ordering. Nintendo also specifies: "Please note that release-day delivery is not guaranteed due to processing and shipment times."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not said outright by Nintendo, all of these measures seem dedicated towards ensuring that someone buying a Switch 2 through this process is someone who wants to purchase and play a Switch 2 for themselves, rather than flip it online.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 Console Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Scalping has been a frequent problem for new releases of sought-after products. Notably, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bots-scalpers-ruining-chances-of-getting-ps5-xbox-series-x-nintendo-switch-oled">scalpers pursuing the new hardware</a>, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-destined-rivals-launch-ran-into-the-same-old-issues-with-scalpers-shortages-and-outages">been dealing with ongoing scalping and shortages</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve found some success in its queue system for the Steam Deck, utilizing a method that tied Steam accounts to purchases alongside checks for whether an account was made before, or after, a certain window. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/opinion-steam-deck-queue-system-fight-scalpers">It worked</a>, and it's not surprising now to see Nintendo taking similar measures with the My Nintendo Store process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, there will be other ways to pick up a Switch 2. But hopefully options like this can help some long-time Switch 1 owners avoid the potential chaos of locking down a launch day Switch 2 pre-order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's called The Duskbloods, and it's coming in 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 - The Dusk Bloods</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer opens with a man slumped on a chair, asleep or perhaps dead. A woman's hand reaches up to his dangling one from the floor, while a woman's voiceover says, "I give you my blood. I give you my life. Turn a wheel, and transport him to a night of moonlight, to humanity's very dusk." As she withdraws her hand, she leaves a symbol carved on the back of his.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the trailer showcases a dark, gothic world: chapels, railroads, towering buildings, dim lighting, cemetaries, bats, enormous statues, and a host of very FromSoftware enemies. At one point, a character flies around with a jetpack. There's a big, creepy moon. We see melodramatic swords, guns, and other weapons used as well as magic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your character, the guy in the opening, appears to be a vampire, as there's a moment where he bites into the neck of an enemy and absolutely menaces it. It also looks like you'll be able to play in co-op in some form, as we see another person summoned alongside the player and seemingly about to fight with them. FromSoftware itself took to social media to announce that Duskbloods is a "PvPvE-focused multiplayer action title."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We are pleased to announce "The Duskbloods" - a PvPvEfocused multiplayer action title for the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2. Release is currently planned for 2026. We hope you look forward to it. <a href="https://t.co/aAVXeuDrVI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aAVXeuDrVI</a></p>— FROMSOFTWARE (@fromsoftware_pr) <a href="https://twitter.com/fromsoftware_pr/status/1907442980665143744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Essentially, this looks like the Bloodborne sequel everyone's been asking for, but it's not named Bloodborne. That's likely because Bloodborne is owned by Sony, which hasn't seemed interested in doing any kind of follow-up to the game despite high fan demand. The Duskbloods appears to be FromSoftware's answer to that fan demand, and Nintendo Switch 2 players get the benefit of it. And it looks like FromSoftware is going all-in on Switch 2 support, as it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nintendo-switc-2">also bringing Elden Ring to the platform</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave Bloodborne itself <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review">a 9.1/10 at launch</a>, saying it "delivers an exhausting and exhilerating journey into the depths of madness."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at the Nintendo Direct today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

That means Zelda, of course, as well as Rauru, Sonia, and the other holders of the Secret Stones. It tells the story of what Zelda was doing during the events of Tears of the Kingdom after she traveled back in time, in which she joined forces with the last remaining Zonai, Rauru, his sister Mineru, and his wife Sonia, to fight against Ganondorf and his forces.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 - Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer gave us a look at some of the abilities of all these champions, including Mineru in her mech, Zelda's magic, Rauru with a cool sword-spear thing, and a quick glimpse of the other Sacred Stone wielders as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will be the third Hyrule Warriors game, following the original Hyrule Warriors and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, which similarly told a prequel story to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

          <p>We've known for a few months now that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support backward compatibility for older Nintendo Switch games, and as of today's presentation, we also know that some Switch games will get special <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendo-hints-at-enhanced-switch-2-edition-games-for-new-console/">Switch 2 Editions</a> that add new features and support higher resolutions and other features.</p>
<p>Nintendo's product pages for the Switch add more details, including the status of backward-compatibility testing for original Switch games and a small handful of first-party Switch games that will get "free updates" to enhance them for Switch 2.</p>
<p>First, some good news. There will be a second tier of updates for original Switch games that Nintendo says "may improve performance or add support for features such as GameShare in select games." These won't include the extra features or higher resolutions of Switch 2 Edition games, but they'll be available for free, and they ought to improve playability. Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/">lists</a> a dozen first-party Switch games that will benefit from free Switch 2 updates:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Arms</em></li>
<li><em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em></li>
<li><em>Super Mario Odyssey&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</em></li>
<li><em>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</em></li>
<li><em>The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</em></li>
<li><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></li>
<li><em>Game Builder Garage</em></li>
<li><em>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</em></li>
<li><em>Pokémon Scarlet</em></li>
<li><em>Pokémon Violet</em></li>
<li><em>Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Nintendo says "the contents of these free updates will differ depending on the game."</p>
<h2>Compatibility testing is ongoing</h2>
<p>We still don't know whether non-updated Switch games running on the Switch 2 will perform better by virtue of the updated hardware; we'll have to wait to test the console ourselves to know for sure. (There are, for better or worse, many Switch games with performance issues that we could use to test.)</p>

<p>Though Nintendo's plan is to support the vast majority of the Switch library on the Switch 2, there are some games that won't run, some games that will have specific requirements, and others that are still being tested.</p>
<p>All of Nintendo's first-party games have passed "basic compatibility testing," meaning they should play more or less as reliably as they do on current Switch hardware. The one incompatible game is the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/my/switch/adfx/index.html">Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04 VR Kit</a>, which requires you to put the Switch into a cardboard VR headset; since the Switch 2 is a lot bigger than the original Switch, it won't work.</p>

<p>Actor Val Kilmer—star of <em>Top Gun, The Doors</em>, and <em>Batman Forever</em>, among other roles—<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/val-kilmer-dead-1236356842/">has died</a> at the age of 65 of pneumonia, Deadline Hollywood reports.</p>
<p>Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2015 and while chemotherapy and two tracheotomies helped him defeat it, the procedures destroyed his voice. He spoke in a rasp or used an electric voice box for the remainder of his life and largely left acting. (He made a brief cameo in 2022's <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, for which his voice was digitally altered.) The 2021 documentary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_(film)"><em>Val</em></a>, narrated by his son Jack Kilmer, followed his life and health struggles.</p>
<p>Kilmer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/movies/val-kilmer-dead.html">had a reputation</a> for being eccentric and difficult to work with, but he also had his champions, and his talent was undeniable. “While working with Val on <em>Heat</em>, I always marveled at the range, the brilliant variability within the powerful current of Val’s possessing and expressing character," Michael Mann, who directed the actor in 1995's <em>Heat</em>, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/val-kilmer-remembered-by-michael-mann-heat-director-1236356976/">told Deadline</a>. "After so many years of Val battling disease and maintaining his spirit, this is tremendously sad news.”</p>
<p>Sure, there were some stinkers over the course of Kilmer's career, but he leaves behind an impressive list of roles that have stood the test of time. His portrayal of rock star Jim Morrison in <em>The Doors</em> (1991) was widely praised, as was his work in the 2004 black comedy <em>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</em> opposite Robert Downey, Jr.</p>
<p>And who could forget his deliciously profligate Doc Holliday ("I'll be your Huckleberry") in 1993's <em>Tombstone </em>or his colorful turn as Elvis Presley in<em> True Romance </em>that same year? Then there was the cocky "Iceman" opposite Tom Cruise's Maverick in 1986's <em>Top Gun</em>&nbsp;and Madmartigan in the classic fantasy adventure <em>Willow</em> (1988) that turned him into a major star.</p>
<p>But here at Ars, we'd like to remember him as Chris Knight in <em>Real Genius</em>, the rebellious, irreverent science whiz kid at the fictional Pacific Tech (a thinly disguised Caltech) who befriends a shy young 15-year-old freshman (Gabriel Jarret). It was only his second feature film role, but Kilmer was unforgettable. So we're re-upping our 2020 tribute to the film in Kilmer's honor.</p>

<p><em>[Original article:]</em></p>
<p><em>Back to the Future</em> justly dominated the summer box office in 1985, but it's too bad its massive success overshadowed another nerd-friendly gem, <em>Real Genius,</em>&nbsp;which debuted one month later, on August 9. Now celebrating its 35th anniversary, the film remains one of the most charming, winsome depictions of super-smart science whizzes idealistically hoping to change the world for the better with their work. It also boasts a lot of reasonably accurate science—a rare occurrence at the time.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Genius"><em>Real Genius</em></a>&nbsp;came out the same year as the similarly themed films&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_Science_(film)"><em>Weird Science</em></a>—which spawned a <a href="http://(That%20year%20that%20saw%20the%20release%20of%20Back%20to%20the%20Future.)">1990s TV sitcom</a>—and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Science_Project"><em>My Science Project</em></a>, because 1980s Hollywood tended to do things in threes.&nbsp;But I'd argue that <em>Real Genius</em> has better stood the test of time, despite being so quintessentially an '80s film—right down to the many montages set to electronic/synth-pop chart-toppers. The film only grossed&nbsp;$12.9 million domestically against its $8 million budget, compared to $23.8 million domestically for its fellow cult classic,&nbsp;<em>Weird Science.</em>&nbsp;(<em>My Science Project</em> bombed with a paltry&nbsp;$4.1 million.) Reviews were mostly positive, however, and over time it became a sleeper hit via VHS, and later, DVD and streaming platforms.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for the 35-year-old film below.)</strong></p>

<p>Fifteen-year-old Mitch Taylor (Gabriel Jarret) is a science genius and social outcast at his high school. So he is over the moon when Professor Jerry Hathaway (William Atherton), a star researcher at the fictional Pacific Technical University, stops by the science fair to inform Mitch he's been admitted to the university. Even better, Hathaway has handpicked Mitch to work in his own lab on a laser project. But unbeknownst to Mitch, Hathaway is in league with a covert CIA program to develop a space-based laser weapon called "Crossbow," designed for precisely targeted political assassinations. The only remaining obstacle is the weapon's power source: they need a 5-megawatt laser and are relying on Hathaway to deliver.</p>
<p>The first act is a nerdier version of the classic fish-out-of-water tale, as Mitch arrives at Pacific Tech and tries to fit in. His roommate, Chris Knight (Val Kilmer), is a senior who was once a bright young star like Mitch but has since rebelled against the high-pressure academic grind and embraced a goofy YOLO approach to life, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPEWBEa8pqg">urging his fellow students</a> to allow themselves to blow off a little steam now and then. Mitch butts heads with Kent (Robert Prescott), a less gifted older protegé of Hathaway's who is jealous of the attention Mitch receives. He finds friends and allies not just in Chris, but also fellow science nerds "Ick" Ikagami (Mark Kamiyama) and Jordan Cochran (Michelle Meyrink), a hyperactive young woman who rarely stops talking or inventing gadgets, and by her own admission almost never sleeps.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>Then there is Lazlo Hollyfeld (Jon Gries), a former star student who cracked under the pressure and is now an eccentric hermit living in the dormitory steam tunnels. Fun fact: Lazlo's steam tunnel hideout, accessible through Mitch's closet, is <a href="https://www.oocities.org/valteamo/science2.html">an elaborate homage</a> to Leonardo da Vinci. As depicted when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8kCQQUjHM">Mitch finally figures out</a> how to gain access, it features a multidirectional elevator built out of a small car controlled by a rotating screw. The car descends to a horizontal track and is propelled forward by a hidden drive chain. The automated scribbler Lazlo uses to submit more than a million entries to the Frito-Lay Sweepstakes was inspired by a sketch in one of Leonardo's notebooks.</p>
<p>Eventually, Mitch and Chris succeed in solving the power problem for their laser, only to realize (thanks to Lazlo) that it will be used to build a powerful directed-energy laser weapon. The five of them team up to foil Hathaway's big military test of the system, in their usual eccentrically ingenious way.</p>

<p>It fell to film consultant <a href="http://physics.usc.edu/Faculty/Gundersen/">Martin A. Gunderson</a> of the University of Southern California (who has a bit part as a math professor) to help ensure that <a href="https://www.oocities.org/valteamo/science2.html">the science</a> and campus culture depicted in the film were plausible, even if certain liberties were taken. Certain details were deliberately left out, <a href="https://www.oocities.org/valteamo/science2.html">according to Director Martha Coolidge</a>, such as those for Mitch's flash-pumped ultraviolet laser at the science fair, and technical details pertaining to a directed-energy laser weapon. ("We didn't want to inspire any lethal tinkering.")</p>

<p>I've always appreciated how closely the laboratory laser setups hewed to reality: Gunderson himself provided the blue-green argon laser and tunable dye laser used in those scenes. Chris uses <a href="https://www.oocities.org/valteamo/science2.html">a cube beam splitter</a> to create the laser light show announcing the Tanning Invitational pool party that incurs Hathaway's wrath. That said, a 5-megawatt laser&nbsp;had certainly not been achieved in 1985. While Chris' construction of a xenon-halogen laser to solve the power problem was purely theoretical at the time, the underlying scientific details were later outlined in<a href="https://www.chem.uci.edu/~aapkaria/manuscripts/14.pdf"> a scientific paper</a>—a fitting example of how science and Hollywood can both benefit from such collaborations.</p>

<p>For the "Smart People on Ice" scene, the <a href="https://www.oocities.org/valteamo/science2.html">crew used</a> a frozen volatile gas, pumped through thousands of feet of tubing beneath the corridor flooring that was connected to a refrigeration unit to keep the gas cold. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kHNpWnbul8">as Ick explains</a> when Kent asks him what will happen when the ice melts, the frozen gas shifts directly from a solid to a gaseous state, rather than melting into a liquid.</p>
<p>Then there is the famous popcorn scene that marks the group's triumph over Hathaway. Mitch, Chris, Ick, Jordan, and Lazlo fill his newly renovated house (accomplished with funds embezzled from his CIA grant) with unpopped popcorn covered in tinfoil. They place a prismatic-like piece of glass on the window sill and hijack the computer during Hathaway's big military test to redirect the laser energy through that window. The kernels start popping, expanding to fill the entire house until it quite literally bursts at the seams.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://film.avclub.com/william-atherton-1798219915">a 2010 interview</a> with the AV Club, Atherton revealed that the studio had six ten-foot-high air poppers devoted to popping popcorn all day for three months, filling a massive storage tank. Since the popcorn had been treated with fire-retardant to keep it from combusting, additional measures had to be taken to ensure the birds didn't eat it. All that popcorn was then carted out to a new subdivision being built in Canyon Country just northwest of Los Angeles and then stuffed inside a Victorian frame house specifically built for the film. That way the crew could pull the whole thing down in the climactic scene with the help of an elaborate network of conveyor belts, hydraulic lifts, airblowers, and vacuum hoses. "Now they'd do it digitally, I guess, but in those days, you had to pop the dang popcorn and put it in a truck and schlep it out to the valley," <a href="https://film.avclub.com/william-atherton-1798219915">Atherton said</a>.</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>As evidence of the film's enduring popularity with the nerdy set, the Mythbusters <a href="https://mythresults.com/car-vs-rain">decided to test</a> the feasibility of popping that much popcorn in 2009 with a laser and destroying a house. The initial test went well: the team successfully popped a single kernel wrapped in aluminum foil with a ten-watt laser. Unfortunately, they weren't able to get a sufficiently powerful laser for their scaled-up experiment, relying instead on a large pan used to cook the popcorn via induction heating. They also built a scaled-down model of the house in the film with a piston on the floor pushing popped popcorn upward to see if it could generate sufficient force to break apart the house. Alas, the Mythbusters determined it would require several tons of force. So myth: busted. But it's still an entertaining movie comeuppance.</p>
<p><em>Real Genius</em> is admittedly a bit cheesy. The plot is predictable, the characters are pretty basic, and the dialogue can be clunky. And it goes without saying that the sexually frustrated virgin nerds ogling hot cosmetology students in bikinis during the pool party reflects hopelessly outdated stereotypes on several fronts. But the film still offers smartly silly escapist fare, with a side of solid science for those who care about such things. And its yearning idealism is a good antidote to the current prevailing cynicism.</p>

EA Sports has offered some scant clarification as to whether or not its EA Sports FC and Madden NFL games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">announced today as coming to the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, will be fully-fledged annual entries such as FC 26, or more limited 'Legacy'-style versions. The Switch 2 versions, EA says, will aim for parity "as much as the hardware allows."
</p>
<p>
"We're excited to bring two of our most beloved franchises - EA SPORTS FC and Madden NFL - to Nintendo's Switch 2, giving fans even more ways to play the sports they love, anytime and anywhere," opened EA's statement, provided to Eurogamer. "Both experiences are being built specifically for the new handheld platform, grounded in what fans enjoy from our franchises across platforms. We look forward to sharing more soon."
</p>
<p>
The developer-publisher also added a few other points of slight clarification, in response to hypothetical questions. For the question of whether or not there would be feature and/or visual parity with current-generation consoles such as the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, the response was:

<p>
"We'll share more details on the Madden NFL and FC experiences for Switch 2 at a later date, but our goal is always to deliver a consistent player experience across platforms as much as the hardware allows." 
</p>
<p>
It was also non-committal on questions about crossplay - more to share "at a later date" - as well as whether entries named FC 26 and Madden NFL 26 will feature on the consoles at all, whether other EA Sports games will come to the platforms, and really any other details, too. To the hypothetical question of whether these Switch 2 versions are different SKUs to current and upcoming EA Sports games, the response was that the Madden NFL and FC "experiences" are "designed for the Switch 2."
</p>
<p>
"We're excited to bring two of our most beloved franchises, EA SPORTS FC and Madden NFL, to Nintendo's new handheld platform, Switch 2. It's a great opportunity to reach even more fans - especially younger players - with the sports they love," EA also added.
</p>
<p>
In previous years, EA Sports has released "Legacy Edition" games for handheld consoles like the original Switch, with heavily stripped-back features and simply updated team rosters and stats for each new, full-priced entry. Last year, for FC 25 on the Switch, there was a more significant version however, which has led to hopes EA Sports will continue to provide versions closer to those on the other current-gen consoles.
</p>
<p>
As for how to interpret those responses, well, in brief: it looks like we probably won't get full feature parity, and the games may even launch under different names to the PS5, Xbox, and PC versions, but at least a more substantial entry than the Legacy years gone by isn't off the table (yet).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware has announced&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, a multiplayer-focused Switch 2-exclusive PvPvE game with more than a hint of the creator's other franchises about it.</p>

<p><em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>was revealed as part of today's Nintendo Direct presentation, alongside the likes of Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launch lineup game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, which is coming in July.</p>

<p>The debut trailer for the game looks suitably&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>-esque, with a lot of Victorian-era architecture looming over imposing-looking backstreets, although the arrival of a futuristic-looking train does throw the usual FromSoftware vibe off a little (in a good way!).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-duskbloods-switch-2-fromsoftware-moon.jpg?itok=RjvN1WrO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-duskbloods-switch-2-fromsoftware-moon.jpg?itok=pDjlOX4k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yup, that looks like a FromSoftware creation alright.</figcaption></figure><p>There's plenty of classic FromSoftware imagery and music in the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>. Whether it's an imposing-looking cathedral with a massive stained-glass window or a horrific monster crawling towards the camera in an underground lair, it looks like you'll get your money's worth from this one.</p>

<p>While this trailer does show off some of the gameplay you can expect from&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, it's a typically elliptical FromSoftware creation, so it's not giving too much away. You'll see brief moments of gameplay rather than extended sequences.</p>

<p>Indeed, not much about the game is given away at all in its initial announcement; it'll revolve around something called "moontears", and blood appears to be a prominent theme in&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, but we'll likely learn more in the coming months.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p><em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>is one of many games coming to the Switch 2 in the next year or so; others include ports of games like&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>, as well as a new&nbsp;<em>Hyrule Warriors&nbsp;</em>game and many more.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>when it launches exclusively for Switch 2 sometime next year. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

A cheaper way to get the game is by bundling it with the Switch 2 console, as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</a> costs $500. The standalone console is priced at $450, so you're essentially saving $30 when bundled together.</p><p>Nintendo revealed heaps of other accessories for Switch 2, including an updated Switch 2 Pro Controller with new back buttons, Joy-Con that can function as a mouse, and a Charging Grip to help keep your Joy-Con juiced up for your next play session. There's also a Nintendo Switch 2 Camera built for GameChat, so you can easily connect with friends without needing the companion mobile app.</p><p>For a look at all the official Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, check out the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/accessories/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Store page</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo never considered making the Switch 2 a piece of "high-performance hardware" aimed at consumers who wanted more-powerful tech. Takuhiro Dohta from Nintendo's Entertainment Planning and Development Department made the comments in part of the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lengthy Q&amp;A session</a> following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">A Nintendo representative asked Dohta and Kouichi Kawamoto, also from the Entertainment Planning and Development Department, why the team decided to call the system the Switch 2. Kawamoto said the team toyed with the idea of calling it the Super Nintendo Switch, but in addition to Nintendo already having a system with "Super" as a descriptor--Super Nintendo--the team didn't want people to focus on the console's specifications.</p><p dir="ltr">"Switch 2 is a new system with improved performance, but we'd like players who get their hands on it not to focus on the specs, but rather to think of it as the latest system developed by Nintendo," Kawamoto said. "So, in the hope that it becomes the new standard for Nintendo Switch, we named it Nintendo Switch 2."</p><p dir="ltr">Dohta expanded on Kawamoto's comments and suggested that focusing on the Switch 2's hardware improvements over the original system might alienate people who just want to play more Nintendo games.</p><p dir="ltr">"From the beginning of development, we wanted Switch 2 to be a system that can be enjoyed by a wide variety of players," Dohta said. "I also wanted to create an experience that as many players as possible could enjoy, rather than an experience made specially for those who prefer high-performance hardware. So, we wanted a name that would communicate simply to potential customers that, if you're considering buying a Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 is the newest system."</p><p dir="ltr">That said, Nintendo did build the Switch 2 with more power than its predecessor. During the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct, Nintendo said the console will support 60fps for games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/">Metroid Prime 4</a> and includes HDR even in handheld mode. That's in addition to improved speakers and support for 3D audio.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, 2025</a>, for $450.

Switch 2 was almost called the Super Nintendo Switch, but Nintendo felt it "didn't feel right" to use the same naming convention as the SNES due to Switch 2's backwards compatibility.
</p>
<p>
In a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/">Ask The Developer discussion</a>, Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto discussed how the team landed on the right name for the new console.
</p>
<p>
"There were a lot of ideas for the name, and we really struggled to find the right one," he said. "We even considered ideas like 'Super Nintendo Switch'. However, Super NES, which came out after the NES, couldn't play NES games. Since Switch 2 can play Switch games, it didn't feel right to use the same naming convention as Super NES. Switch 2 is a new system with improved performance, but we'd like players who get their hands on it not to focus on the specs, but rather to think of it as the latest system developed by Nintendo."

<p>
He added: "So, in the hope that it becomes the new standard for Nintendo Switch, we named it Nintendo Switch 2."
</p>
<p>Does that mean we can expect a Nintendo Switch 3 in the future?</p>
<p>
Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta continued: "From the beginning of development, we wanted Switch 2 to be a system that can be enjoyed by a wide variety of players. This hasn't changed from Switch to Switch 2. I also wanted to create an experience that as many players as possible could enjoy, rather than an experience made specially for those who prefer high-performance hardware. So, we wanted a name that would communicate simply to potential customers that, if you're considering buying a Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 is the newest system."
</p>
<p>
Surmised Tetsuya Sasaki, from the Technology Development Division: "I thought the name was simple and easy to understand, since development began with the idea that Switch 2 would be a proper successor to Switch."
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the interview, Dohta also confirmed the Switch 2's eShop will be improved.
</p>
<p>
"Thanks to the system's performance capabilities, Nintendo eShop on Switch 2 has been improved and runs smoothly even when displaying a large number of games," said Dohta. "We believe the act of finding the game you want to play is itself part of the game system experience."

            <p>While the Switch 2 is backwards compatible with original Switch games - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">some are even receiving an upgrade</a> - there are still a number of games with compatibility issues on the new console, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo has released details on compatible games, with 122 Nintendo games and over 15,000 third-party games playable on the new console. This is shown in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/">Steam Deck-esque system on the Nintendo website</a>.</p>
<p>Only one game is completely incompatible with Switch 2 and that's the Labo VR Kit, as the Switch 2 console cannot be inserted into the Toy-Con VR Googles. Sorry cardboard fans.</p>

<p>However, there remain a number of third-party games that either have start up issues on Switch 2, or are playable but have in-game compatibility issues. While those specific issues are unknown, they are all being investigated.</p>
<p>The biggest game with start up issues is Fortnite, though a specific Switch 2 version of the game is planned - it's unknown when this will be released, but at least one of the biggest games in the world will eventually be playable on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>In total, there are <a href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN.pdf?_gl=1*xvm77x*_gcl_au*MTY1ODE0OTE3NC4xNzQxNjA5OTkx*_ga*MTQ5ODE5NDYyNS4xNzQzNjAzNDkx*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*MTc0MzYwNzMyNi4xNy4xLjE3NDM2MDgyNjIuMC4wLjA.">141 games with start up issues</a>, including the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, Doom: Eternal, Final Fantasy, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a>.</p>
<p>As for games with <a href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-launchable_compatibility_issues_EN.pdf?_gl=1*xvm77x*_gcl_au*MTY1ODE0OTE3NC4xNzQxNjA5OTkx*_ga*MTQ5ODE5NDYyNS4xNzQzNjAzNDkx*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*MTc0MzYwNzMyNi4xNy4xLjE3NDM2MDgyNjIuMC4wLjA.">in-game compatibility issues</a>, there are 47. That includes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a>, Fall Guys, Harvestella, and Overcooked! All You Can Eat.</p>
<p>In addition, there are a number of games that are playable on Switch 2 but require an original Switch Joy-Con to play - these are mostly motion-controlled games.</p>
<p>For instance, the Joy-Con 2 won't fit in the Ring Fit Adventure Ring-Con; they don't include an IR Motion Camera for 1-2-Switch, WarioWare: Move It! or Game Builder Garage; Everybody 1-2-Switch will be more difficult as the force feedback of vibrations has been reduced in Joy-Con 2; Joy-Con 2 don't fit in the leg strap for the soccer mode of Nintendo Switch Sports.</p>
<p>There are also compatibility issues with the Labo Variety Kit, Robot Kit, and Vehicle Kit.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-bananza-is-dks-first-3d-platformer-in-26-years.1152813/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, a brand new game in the&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>series and the beloved ape's first 3D platformer since 1999's&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong 64</em>.</p>

<p>As revealed during today's Switch 2 Direct show,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>will launch exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17th, so it'll just miss the console's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">launch date of June 5th</a>&nbsp;and won't be included as part of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">Switch 2 launch lineup</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>game, the story of&nbsp;<em>Bananza&nbsp;</em>revolves around DK uncovering a treasure trove of golden bananas, only for them to be stolen away by the nefarious VoidCo, causing him to set out on a quest to retrieve his hoard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-minecart.jpg?itok=5qnpfEqb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-minecart.jpg?itok=4kX4NB7v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>is DK's first 3D platforming outing in many years.</figcaption></figure><p>Donkey Kong sports a design inspired by his old-school arcade self in&nbsp;<em>Bananza</em>, and I think it's pretty cute. He's got a rather expressive face that lends itself well to the world in which he finds himself for this adventure.</p>

<p>The trailer shows DK platforming his way around a few open-looking environments, as well as burrowing down into the ground to explore the level below the surface.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It isn't clear to what extent you'll be able to seamlessly transition between above-ground levels and underground stages, but I'd expect that given the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">still-relatively-modest tech specs</a>, that's not going to be the case.</p>

<p>In any case, you can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, which shows off a fair bit of gameplay and DK's endearing redesign, right here.</p>




<p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of games coming to the Switch 2. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, which is coming at launch alongside new versions of&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, as well as games like EA's hugely successful&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>when it <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/donkey-kong-bananza/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">launches for Switch 2</a> on July 17th.</p>

The teaser trailer debuted during Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct video presentation, where it was revealed that it’s set to launch in 2026 with famed <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Dark Souls </em>director Hidetaka Miyazaki at the helm. No other details were provided.</p><p>The trailer and name are very evocative of <em>Bloodborne</em>, the cult classic title that’s remained exclusive to Sony’s PlayStation consoles. But according to <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1907432474759569770">a post by Nintendo of America on X</a> and <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/duskbloods/article/250402_1.html"><em>The Duskbloods</em> website</a>, the new title differs in that it’s a player vs player vs enemies (PvPvE) format multiplayer game. FromSoftware may be known for single-player focused epics (with limited co-op) like the <em>Dark Souls</em> series and <em>Elden Ring</em>, but well before <em>Duskbloods </em>launches we’ll be getting its first multiplayer-only game in the form of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></em>.</p><p>Nintendo teased that more will be revealed about <em>The Duskbloods</em> in a Creator’s Voice article with Miyazaki, set to publish on the official Nintendo website on April 4th. That should be helpful, considering the trailer goes heavier on style and flair than it does on details. There’s definitely a <em>Bloodborne</em>-y vibe with its gothic setting, and there seem to be vampiric Twilight Blood Clan characters. And it’s FromSoftware, so there’s of course some excellent looking enemies, monster designs, and fashion for days.</p><p>The moment that hangs on the vast expanse of The Duskbloods’ world may even indicate an open-world of some kind, but I’ll leave it up to the FromSoftware lore experts to go hard on their deep-dives and dissections of the three-and-a-half minute trailer.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> is getting a Tarnished Edition on Switch 2, but you are an enlightened individual who cares not for Switchery - why else would you be reading RPS, a website dedicated to PCs, the very best console? Are you some kind of Nintendo fan-enthusiast-zealot, here to gloat about the fact that the Tarnished Edition is a Switch 2 exclusive? 
</p>
<p>
Is that what you think? Well if that <em>is</em> what you think, I've got something to tell you. Something that may shock and discredit you. And that thing is as follows: I'm not wearing a tie at all! I mean, the Tarnished Edition's new stuff is almost guaranteed to turf up on PC at some stage.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Catch the trailer for the Tarnished Edition below. It's out on the Switchbox in 2025, and includes the original open world action-RPG and last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> expansion, which Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">described</a> as "basically a sequel" and "a knotty, dense expansion that's home to some of the best moments in Elden Ring, but also some of its most frustrating."

You should notice a few new pieces of armour and equipment. There's one that resembles Lucatiel of Mirrah's gear from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a>. The biggest addition, so far, is a new customisation feature for Torrent, your summonable spectral steed. The trailer treats us to a few glimpses of a saddle with flapping red banners.</p>
<p>According to a press release from publisher Bandai Namco, "the additional content in the title will also be available on other platforms". I know, it doesn't specifically mention PC, but come on. Why would PC not be included among "other platforms". Denying us this would be like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">denying us a spiritual Bloodborne sequel</a>, before we've even got a PC port of the first game.</p>
<p>I will keep my eyes peeled for Steam updates. In the meantime, you might want to check out <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, a co-op multiplayer spin-off in which three players farm maps for upgrades in order to fight a series of bosses.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enter-the-gungeon">Enter the Gungeon</a> feels like one of those quintessential indie games right? It came out almost a decade ago way back in 2016, which felt like the peak "indie games are here and they can go toe to toe with the big boys" era. It had all the hallmarks, like throwback pixel art, quirky designs, easy to pick up and put down. So it feels a bit funny to see that a sequel, quite aptly titled Enter the Gungeon 2, was revealed during a presentation for, what was it called now, the Nintendo Switch 2? Something like that, doesn't matter, point is: Dodge Roll are making a sequel, and yes, it is coming to PC too, don't you worry.

I think its first, very short trailer (seriously, only 30 seconds, can't blame <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> for not wanting to cough up cash for a longer one) is a bit funny too, in that the game is 3D now. This isn't a knock on how the game looks, I think the style has been translated very well between dimensions, that giant enemy made up of tinier lil bullet guys speaks to me. But it really does show you how much the industry has changed in a decade when an iconic indie like Enter the Gungeon makes a switch like this.

The trailer didn't reveal all that much honestly, it really does look like the game but in 3D, and it is still a bullet hell, action, roguelike game. Over on Steam it says that you'll "battle through areas familiar and unknown", and that there'll be an "expanding roster of Gungeoneers full of both familiar and new faces as you rescue and extract marooned heroes from the depths of the Gungeon." 
</p>
<p>
There's no release date to be found just yet, so another classic case of "this exists, we'll see you when we see you." Fair enough! Anyway, congrats Enter the Gungeon fans, you're doing better than the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">Bloodborne for PC crowd</a>.
