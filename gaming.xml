            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="5f8d219631ef7"><a title="Rockbeasts / Demon Tides" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5f8d219631ef7/rockbeasts-demon-tides.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've already rounded up all of the Switch announcements from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025-all-switch-1-and-2-reveals">The Game Awards 2025</a>, but that wasn't the only showcase that Mr Keighley served up this holiday season.</p>
<p>As ever, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nCX95t5cWY">Day of the Devs</a> was on hand to highlight a bunch of upcoming indies that we can look forward to in the next year or two. It was a slightly slimmer showing on the Switch front than we have seen in previous years (at least, as far as <em>confirmed</em> Switch releases go), but there were still two titles that have already announced a Switch (2) launch.</p>
<p>First up, we have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rockbeasts">Rockbeasts</a>, a '90s "rock-and-roll management RPG", that sees you put in charge of a grunge rock band comprised of anthropomorphised wilderbeast... and a fish. It sounds like a lot, and it looks like it, too. The gameplay has a bit of everything — rhythm games, management sims, visual novels — and the whole thing has a visual style that looks like it's just stumbled out of a <strong>Bojack Horseman</strong> episode.</p>
<p>In short, we're <em>very</em> interested to find out more. Rockbeasts doesn't have a firm release date at the time of writing, but the devs <em>did</em> confirm that it will be launching on Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2. Rock on, dude!</p>

<p>The second Switch game showcased in the latest Day of the Devs was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demon_tides">Demon Tides</a>. You might remember this one from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-day-of-the-devs-the-game-awards-edition-2024-every-announcement-confirmed-switch-games#demon-tides-2025-switch-unconfirmed">last year's DotD event</a>, and yes, it still looks awesome. This is the next 3D platformer from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/demon_turf">Demon Turf</a> dev Fabraz, combining super slick-looking movement with the most toe-tapping of hip-hop scores.</p>
<p>Once again, there's no Switch release date for this one just yet, though Fabraz has confirmed that Fangamer will be handling a <a href="https://x.com/Fabrazz/status/1998833988883107978">physical release</a>, so that's something to look forward to!</p>

<p>Naturally, there's every chance that we will see a fair few of the other games from the latest Day of the Devs showcase pop up on Switch at some point down the line. Switch 2 is still very much the new kid in town, so we'd be surprised if indie devs don't want to capitalise on its relative hotness and bring their titles over.</p>
<p>We've added the full Day of the Devs: The Game Awards 2025 Edition showcase below, so you can take a look at all the games revealed and make your own predictions about whether they will be heading to Switch or not.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/sales-and-specials/holiday-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store Holiday sale</a> has just started, mere weeks after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-opens-black-friday-cyber-monday-premium-editions-sale-now-with-gifting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Friday/Cyber Monday one</a>, and it begins with a big freebie: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hogwarts-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy</a>. Avalanche Software's acclaimed open world third-person action/adventure game released in 2023 can be added permanently to your Epic Games Store library through December 18 at 5 PM.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Epic Games has partnered with publisher Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (which might be sold to <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paramount Skydance</a>, depending on which company gets Warner Bros.) to promote Hogwarts Legacy across its games. Players who spend at least two hours in the world of Hogwarts Legacy (via the Epic Games Store) by December 18 at 11 AM Eastern Time can earn the Chocolate Frog Back Bling in Fortnite. This, of course, also applies to those who may have previously purchased the game via the store and spent two or more hours in the game. Later in December, the Fortnite Shop will feature outfits and accessories inspired by the Wizarding World. Players can customize each outfit to represent one of the four Hogwarts houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/G773K-qWkAAiJWZ-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>Rocket League is also celebrating the Harry Potter franchise as part of its annual Frosty Fest event. In the Hogwarts House Rivalry, players earn points by playing matches while representing a house. Players will also be able to celebrate their favourite house with challenge rewards and shop items. More details will be announced later this month.</p>



<p>Hogwarts Legacy <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the best-selling game in 2023</a>, beating even Call of Duty that year. <span>A Definitive Edition featuring additional content&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank">was reportedly in the works</a>&nbsp;with the help of Rocksteady; however, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-canceled-by-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled this project</a>.</span> </p>



<p>A sequel was officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-wb-games-biggest-priority-but-itll-take-a-couple-of-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> to be WBIE's top priority, which was no surprise given its excellent sales (over 35 million units to date). Of course, it will take some time to materialize. Hogwarts Legacy <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released in February 2023</a> and received support for a while; taking a guess, Avalanche Software could be targeting a launch for the sequel at some point in 2028.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-this-15-6-portable-monitor-at-its-lowest-price-since-launch-for-a-year-end-sale-already-selling-out-fast-2000652662</link>
            <guid>1381666</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re a multitasker looking to expand your viewing area for better productivity, adding a portable monitor to your setup can be a smart move. These are easy to carry with you on the go and convenient to set up literally anywhere you want, plus most options fall into a fairly affordable range. Thankfully, there’s a way to bring one home for even less today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6365/">Right now, you can grab the 15.6-inch InnoView portable monitor for just $57, after Amazon generously dropped it by 44%</a>. The discount lets you save a whopping $45 on your purchase, and there is no shipping fee to worry about, either. However, while the retailer hasn’t specified an expiry date for the offer, we’re not expecting it to be around for long. It’s best to get yours in sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6365/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Visuals on a Bright Screen</h2>
<p>For under $60, you’re getting a 15.6-inch display. The size matches most standard laptops, so it’ll instantly feel quite familiar. It pushes a resolution of 1920x1080P, which is paired with HDR technology to expand the overall brightness and color range in content. You’ll enjoy better color accuracy, with brighter whites and deeper blacks for a more lifelike visual experience, regardless of what you’re using the monitor for.</p>
<p>The screen supports a 178-degree full viewing angle that delivers consistent visuals from every side, so you don’t exactly need to sit directly in the front to see what’s happening. It’s especially handy when you’re sharing the monitor with a bunch of people, as everyone will be able to see it clearly without awkwardly shifting around. The built-in speaker takes care of the sound, while the low blue light support lets you use the screen for an extended period without compromising your eye health. The latter is something those who often pull all-nighters will appreciate.</p>



<p>InnoView monitor comes with a scratch-resistant smart protective cover made of durable PU leather, which not only keeps it safe from daily wear and tear but also doubles as a stand to prop the thing up. It features two grooves that are used to adjust the angle of the screen based on what you require. Maybe keep it upright when you’re using it at your desk, or tilt it back for a more relaxed angle while streaming your favorite show or catching up with friends on a video call!</p>
<p>As for compatibility, it plays nicely with a range of devices (HP laptop, Lenovo laptop, Dell laptop, Asus laptop, Macbook, iPhone, game console, tablet, PS, Xbox, etc), as long as they support Thunderbolt 3.0/4.0 or USB 3.1 Type-C DP ALT-MODE. The two fully-functional Type-C ports and one HDMI port offer a straightforward plug-and-play functionality, which makes it easy to get started with using the monitor right away.</p>
<p>All things considered, if you’ve been looking for a way to reduce frequent window/tab hopping and enjoy more screen space, we highly recommend adding a portable monitor to your setup. With this one, you can work with multiple programs at the same time, instead of juggling everything on your main display. You can also extend your phone’s visuals when taking a video call, plus play your favorite games remotely. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6365/">This deal brings its price down to $57, but it’s likely going to expire soon. It’s best to snap yours before the offer expires or the stock runs out.</a> That said, now is also a good time to stock up on other tech essentials like earbuds and tablets, since there’s plenty going at a discount. We’ve been covering the best deals that are actually worth your money, so be sure to check back for the latest drops.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The homestretch of the 2025 holiday shopping season is going to be full of surprises, flash deals, and more as manufacturers pull out all the stops to hit their year-end numbers. That’s good news for shoppers, as anyone on the hunt for a great new smartwatch will see when they notice this Amazon deal on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6362/">One of the best new wearables of 2025, the big 46mm model of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is at its all-time low price right now, just $400.</a></p>
<p>Amazon’s red-flagged this 20%-off deal with a big “selling fast” sign, which could very well mean a rapidly shrinking inventory that could cause the deal to vanish as suddenly as it appeared. Not surprising, considering how the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is one of the best Android smartwatches at its original $500 price point, and now it’s $100 under that number.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Shape Shifter</h2>
<p>One of the cool features of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is that it’s designed to take on an elegant, traditional look, complete with a detailed rotating bezel that directs you to your apps, and a face that looks like a luxury chronograph even when you get up close to it. With that face, the beautiful stainless steel bezel and crown, and a black eco leather and band, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is perfectly at home on a date or at a formal occasion.</p>
<p>Its best work, of course, happens when you’re active, and in need of a reliable health and workout tracker with a robust suite of apps and features. It has a built-in Running Coach feature that takes into account your age, weight, heart rate, and even your oxygen level as you run, keeping you at a pace that works for both your fitness and training goals and your overall health. The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic also has one of the better Sleep Coaching features of any midrange smartwatch, along with helpful metrics that aren’t commonly found in smartwatches like Vascular Load readings to track the amount of stress on your heart, and an Antioxidant Index that tracks the level of antioxidants in your body to help inform your food and lifestyle choices.</p>



<h2>Smart, Watch</h2>
<p>Any Samsung Galaxy smartwatch is going to come loaded with the best smart tech and interactivity with the rest of the Samsung universe. That means Galaxy AI and Google Gemini to serve as your hands-free assistants on the go whenever you need something, instant updates from your calendar and any other app you want to keep abreast of, and of course seamless connections to the Samsung family of smartphones, wireless earbuds, tablets, and laptops.</p>
<p>Call this Amazon deal one of the better somewhat-last-minute finds of the holiday shopping season. But whatever you call it, do it soon, because t<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6362/">he 46mm Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is flying out of inventory faster than anticipated at its all-time low price of $400.</a></p>

I have to say, it does tickle me that pretty much anyone involved with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> just seem to still want to make Left 4 Dead. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-anacrusis">The Anacrusis</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/back-4-blood">Back 4 Blood</a> both were made by folks who worked on the original co-op shooter, and now the original lead designer of it Mike Booth is back with yet another incarnation, 4:Loop, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/left-4-dead-dev-mike-booth-has-teamed-up-with-jj-abrams-to-make-another-four-player-shooter-with-purple-aliens-this-time">revealed at Geoff's Ads and Statues Evening</a>. As part of that reveal, Booth took part in a little interview over on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/announcing-4loop-a-new-four-player-co-op-shooter-from-sie-and-bad-robot-games/">PlayStation Blog</a> where he touched on the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> mechanics, and how excited he is for people to break them.
</p>
<p>
Booth explained that he's been a fan of roguelikes since the original Rogue, and how the genre appeals to him because of the ways you can be creative in achieving certain goals. "Some runs even feel like you have such a great combination of tools that you 'break the game,'" Booth said, also noting that with 4:Loop he does still just want to let people "jump in and play."
</p>
<p>
We'll come back to that game breaking stuff in a moment, but first here's how Booth explains the core loop. Essentially, you and three of your buds need to try and destroy an alien mothership, with each mission you embark on letting you make different choices to improve equipment. Along the way, you might pick up certain items that help you out in tricky scenarios.
</p>
<p>
One such scenario Booth described was an instance where a playtester was trying to outrun a lethal beam of some sort that basically means game over if you can't get to the escape zone in time. Said playtester had picked up an item called a blink berry, which you can sort of throw like a grenade, and wherever it lands it'll teleport whatever it hits to somewhere random. So, the playtester threw it at themself, was teleported away, and made it to the escape zone in time.
</p><p>
"I built both of those game mechanics and had never even considered that strategy," Booth said. "I’m excited to see how our gaming community 'breaks the game' in other unexpected ways." Apparently there's bit of "meta-progression" where you learn things about the world and how it works that "give you an edge for your next run."
</p>
<p>
From the sounds of things it won't be a full-on roguelike, maybe more towards a roguelite, something to keep runs fresh rather than just taking hordes of aliens on over and over again. No release date attached to this one yet, so, just keep replaying Left 4 Dead like you I'm assuming you already do.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-airpods-pro-3-is-now-as-cheap-as-the-pro-2-sale-price-and-even-lower-than-its-black-friday-deal-2000652626</link>
            <guid>1381627</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple unveiled its latest pair of earbuds – the Apple AirPods Pro 3 – in September this year, and our audio experts loved the upgrades these brought. They launched at the standard $249 price, but we just spotted a deal that lets you pick them up for less today.</p>
<p>Amazon has now dropped the AirPods Pro 3 to $199, after taking 20% off, bringing the pair back to its lowest price ever. All shoppers get to enjoy free delivery with their purchase, and placing your orders today can help you get them just in time for Christmas. If you’ve been meaning to upgrade your audio gear, or surprise a music lover in your life this holiday season, now is the time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Sound, Better ANC Capabilities</h2>
<p>These look quite similar to AirPods Pro 2, but feature a slightly redesigned shape with new foam-infused silicone ear tips for a better fit. The new acoustic architecture gives sound quality a boost, delivering rich, deep audio that lets you enjoy your favorite tracks and podcasts with detailed clarity. It lets you feel every instrument, with vivid vocals like never before.</p>
<p>Active noise cancellation capabilities have improved, too, as this pair is capable of removing up to 2x more unwanted noise than AirPods Pro 2; great for when you want to stay fully immersed in the moment with your favorite track playing. The ANC mode works well when you don’t want background sounds to distract you. You can enable it when you’re working in a busy cafe or trying to focus on an important task in the office. Of course, this level of noise blocking doesn’t work for every situation – sometimes it’s better to stay present and aware of what’s happening around. For that, there’s the transparency mode, which lets some ambient sound in.</p>



<p>Regardless of the mode, AirPods Pro 3 customize the sound signature for your unique ear geometry and fit with its next-generation Adaptive EQ. What’s more, these protect your hearing health, too. You can take an at-home hearing test that checks your hearing in a broader range of everyday conditions, or use the pair as a hearing aid when you need the voices around you amplified. Those often exposed to loud environmental noise can put them on to prevent hearing loss as well. Other health features include heart rate sensing, which monitors your heart rate, plus calories burned for up to 50 different workout types.</p>
<p>Another solid selling point is the Live Translation feature, which uses Apple Intelligence to offer real-time translation for face-to-face conversations around the world. Basically, the earbuds pick up on what someone is saying and translate it instantly, letting you reply in your preferred language using your iPhone or their AirPods. As for the battery life, you’ll enjoy up to 8 hours of listening on a single charge with Active Noise Cancellation on, and up to 10 hours in Transparency using the Hearing Aid feature.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/">This deal brings the price of this feature-packed pair to $199, from $249</a>. It’s a big discount, sure, considering how these just launched, it’s still a welcome drop. It won’t last long, though, so it’s best to get your orders in quickly before it wraps up. Ordering now will also help you enjoy free shipping with your purchase!</p>

<p>Shipping Spring 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've had mixed opinions on the CRKD Nitro Deck for the Switch, but now the company has come out swinging with a brand new iteration – and it's compatible with both Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>The <strong>Nitro Deck 2</strong> starts shipping in <strong>Spring 2026</strong> and looks to be a significant upgrade over the previous model. It seems the company has the Switch 2 in mind with this new product, but those still on the original Switch can still get in on the action. You'll just need to utilise the additional centrepiece to make up for the height difference, while turning the dial on the back to decrease the length of the chassis.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Deck 2 has offset analogue sticks which, for the first time, aren't situation directly above and below the d-pad and face buttons. They utilise capacitor-based technology are said to be free from potential drifting issues. It also features additional back buttons, adjustable deadzones, turbo mode, and more.</p>
<p>The d-pad design and stick tops can also be swapped out, but be mindful that these additional parts are sold separately.</p>

<p>Pricing is confirmed at <strong>£89.99</strong> for the Nitro Deck 2 itself, while any addition d-pad/stick packs are <strong>£19.99</strong> each. Pre-orders are available now via the <a href="https://crkd.gg/pages/nitro-deck-2">CRKD website</a>.</p>

<p>Currently confirmed for "PC and Consoles"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><strong>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</strong> was one of the most surprising reveals at this year's The Game Awards, marking a huge return to the RPG series that put Bioware on the map.</p>
<p>The original developer is nowhere to be seen, however, with this new title now in the hands of Arcanaut Studios, founded in July 2025. Its CEO, Casey Hudson, is heading up development for Fate of the Old Republic (FOTOR..?), having previously directed the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_wars_knights_of_the_old_republic">Knights of the Old Republic</a> and the <strong>Mass Effect</strong> trilogy.</p>
<p>This is a pretty big deal, then. It's clear that the new game is early in development given how recent the studio itself was formed, and as such, no specific platforms have been confirmed beyond a rather vague "PC and Consoles". So we have no idea if this thing is heading to the Switch 2 or not, but we reckon it's a little too early to make the call either way.</p>
<p>The trailer itself gives us next to nothing, as you'd expect. It shows what is likely to be the main protagonist landing on a planet with two companions before making her way into a derelict crash site. There, she encounters a mysterious creature and ignites her lightsaber. That's it!</p>
<p>Lots of questions, then. Is this game even considered canon at this point? Our knowledge is a <em>little</em> rusty these days, admittedly, but our understanding is that the canon equivalent of the 'Old Republic' is now the 'High Republic'. All of that 'pre-Disney' stuff is now part of the 'Legends' continuity.</p>
<p>Still, it looks cool, and we'll be keeping a close eye on it in the months (and years) to come.</p>

            <p>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve is releasing in 2026, publisher Bandai Namco has revealed. The game, coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, was announced during last night's The Game Awards.</p>
<p>It's been seven years since Ace Combat 7 (and JPEG dog - if you know, you know), so this next entry is being developed on Unreal Engine 5 for the first time. Bandai Namco is promising an "emotionally charged" campaign, plus multiplayer modes, although firm details won't arrive until next year.</p>
<p>The first trailer for Ace Combat 8 can be viewed below:</p>

<p>In the campaign players will take on the role of an ace pilot (are there any fighter pilots who aren't ace?) in the fictitious Strangereal, with a fairly classic sounding plot that sees you fighting against the odds alongside three new pilots. Will you be able to be able to live up to the hopes of the people of the Federation of Central Usea? I assume yes, as it won't feel very heroic otherwise!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a> released on PS4 and Xbox One back on 18th January, 2019. A PC version arrived two weeks later in February, while a Switch port was released onto Nintendo's hybrid console on 11th July, 2024.</p>

<h2 id="unconfirmed-for-switch-2">Unconfirmed for Switch 2</h2>
<p>The following titles weren't graced with a Switch 2 logo at the end of their reveal trailers, but we think there's a pretty good chance of several them coming our way at some point down the line — either because the dev has sent their games to Switch in the past, or because the series has history with Nintendo consoles.</p>
<p>So here are all the games, in alphabetical order, that we're currently sticking on our 'unconfirmed' list, accompanied by coverage from our good friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The morning after The Game Awards, and anyone over here in Europe is likely reaching for the caffeinated drinks right now. There were an amazing batch of announcements, including massive franchise entries like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-casey-hudson/">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>, through to exciting indies like Coven of the Chicken Foot. My highlight might be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/star-wars-galactic-racer-speeds-us-back-to-a-galaxy-far-far-away/">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>, but then, I’m weird. I’ve been playing some great games this week, and that includes Aaero2 which I’ll have a review of next week, and the incredible <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/skate-story-review-the-grind-of-a-lifetime/">Skate Story</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> was first up, and he’s been on an indie game tear, playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/death-howl-review/">Death Howl</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/09/unbeatable-review/">UNBEATABLE</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/11/aethermancer-early-access-review-when-creature-collecting-goes-rogue/">Aethermancer</a> for review. He told us, “I didn’t really gel with Death Howl, unfortunately, despite it having some decent gameplay. UNBEATABLE is fun but the story mode is all over the place. The arcade mode is a much better experience. Aethermancer is shaping up to be a fun roguelike where you capture monsters to fight for you, but lose them at the end of a run. It makes you experiment with different party setups. I’ve also started Star Wars Outlaws, which I think I got as a present last Christmas. I’m still very early in the game but looking forward to exploring every inch of the map.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> stopped up late working on our TGA coverage with Tef, but that didn’t stop him from posting his stellar <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/terminator-2d-no-fate-review/">Terminator 2D: No Fate review</a>, which he definitely enjoyed for its throwback 90s arcade charms. That was the pitch and it absolutely lived up to it.</p>


<p><strong>Ade</strong> was next up, and he’s been playing Wizard of Legend 2 in local coop with Laura. He explains, “Apparently, the game wasn’t too well received back when it was launched but it’s great fun now! Like a multiplayer Hades really.” He also spent time with one of December’s biggest releases, saying, “I’ve also just started Metroid Prime 4 and I can exclusively reveal that it’s good and that I’m not finding Myles MacKenzie nearly as irritating as the internet told me I would. Actually, I shockingly – whisper it – find him quite endearing.”</p>
<p>When <strong>Laura</strong> wasn’t playing Wizard of Legend, she got up to more family making in Jurassic World Evolution 3, saying, “This week a baby T-Rex was born and frankly that’s trumps anything else anyone will tell you today!”</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> told us that, “Megabonk has claimed me” which feels like a cry for help. He continued, “I’ve nearly got every achievement and am trying to beat the high scores of my mates. I’ve also played a little of World of Final Fantasy, as I want to replay it, but not as much as I want to be a skeleton on a skateboard.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has had a fancy hat on and been playing Thief VR for review, while sneaking in a spot of Cyberpunk and Megabonk.</p>
<p>Sadly, <strong>Steve</strong> has only been playing ‘being off work with the flu’ so we all hope that he gets better soon!</p>
<p>Finally, a somewhat sleepy <strong>Tef</strong> has dipped back into Metroid Prime 4, finding all the collectibles but still contemplating a fresh run to do a 100%. Aside from that he dabbled with a bit of Nintendo World Championship NES Edition and Loop Hero.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Drops Sizable Free ‘Thank You’ Update After Sweeping the TGA 2025 Floor; AMD FSR 4 Added]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-drops-sizable-free-thank-you-update-amd-fsr-4/</link>
            <guid>1381579</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 literally swept the floor during last night's The Game Awards 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">winning nine out of ten of the prizes it got nominated for</a>, including Game of the Year and Studio of the Year for its developer. It's a massive victory for a relatively small indie team that <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandfall-interactive-made-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-under-10-million-to-prove-it-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent less than $10 million making this title</a>.</p>



<p>As if gamers couldn't love them enough already, the French developer has now dropped the <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-start-franchise-post-launch-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously teased</a> sizable (and free) new update, version 1.5, which adds new features like <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fidelityfx-sdk-2-0-fsr-4-0-2-now-available-next-gen-neural-rendering-technologies-fsr-redstone-ready-for-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMD FSR 4</a> on PC and even new content, such as Verso's Drafts, a new playable environment that takes the characters of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover. Verso's Drafts is located on the world map right next to Lumière and becomes accessible from Act III. Esquie's underwater ability is required to access the environment.</p>



<p>That's far from the only addition of the so-called 'Thank You' update. New Luminas and weapons have been added; there are new costumes for each member of the Expedition, giving players even more customization options; there are new boss battles for late-game players to overcome in the Endless Tower, variations of iconic bosses from the main game that are designed to be even more challenging.</p>



<p>The "Old Key" quest item has been added to the final area of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. This specific item was previously only obtainable during the game's prologue, so this addition gives players a second chance to collect all journals within a single playthrough. New text and UI game localizations are available in Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19, with more to come, according to Sandfall.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Update 1.5 also introduces the following features: </p>



<ul>
<li>Lumina Sets, which enable players to save up to 50 different Lumina loadouts, allowing them to adapt their fighting tactics at any moment. </li>



<li>An Abandon Battle option in the pause menu is available and it can now be opened in battle.</li>



<li>A Photo Mode is now in the game with plenty of settings and options for players to get creative with while capturing their favourite moments from the game. It's accessible at any time from the pause menu.</li>



<li>A HUD Scale setting has been added to the game so that players may adjust the size of in-game HUD elements from 80% to 120%.</li>



<li>Input remapping is available for controllers.</li>



<li>The game is now officially certified for the Steam Deck and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ROG Xbox Ally</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are, of course, plenty of bug fixes too. You can read the full changelog <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/491585297311596633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Game Awards 2025 has come and gone, and as you might expect, there were a ton of reveals, announcements, and new trailers during last night's ceremony. Here's everything that was shown off during The Game Awards this year!</p><hr><h2><em>The Free Shepherd </em>kicks things off</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>D'awww. Look at the lil' dog.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first trailer we got to see was for a rather cute-looking herding game by the name of <em>The Free Shepherd</em>. It's got <em>Herdling </em>vibes, and it lands on PC and PS5 in 2027.</p><h2><em>Decrepit </em>looks ideal for <em>King's Field </em>fans</h2><p>If you like first-person dungeon crawlers like <em>King's Field</em>, <em>Arx Fatalis</em>, or the <em>Might and Magic </em>games, then <em>Decrepit </em>looks like it'll be for you. This one's coming to PC, and you can sign up for its playtest now.</p><h2><em>Audio Mech </em>is a musical adventure you can play tomorrow</h2><p>Next up, it's a new game from the folks behind <em>Audio Surf</em>, and <em>Audio Mech </em>will let you set any music to the action, including streaming. A demo is coming to Steam tomorrow!</p><h2><em>Pragmata </em>finally has a release date</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>We finally know when <em>Pragmata </em>is coming.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Capcom's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pragmata-thrusts-you-into-strange-new-earth" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dfa99aa5-9c5b-422d-88a1-08160cdee4be" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">weird action-strategy hybrid...thingy</a>, <em>Pragmata</em>, finally has a release date. It's launching on April 24th on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2, and a demo for consoles is available too!</p><h2><em>Solasta 2 </em>brings RPG goodness in March</h2><p>Have you been hankering for some good old-fashioned <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-style dungeoneering? If so, then <em>Solasta 2 </em>is here to whet your appetite. It's launching into Early Access on March 12th.</p><h2><em>Tankrat </em>has...well, lots of tanks</h2><p>Our next reveal brings post-apocalyptic <em>Mad Max </em>vibes along with it. <em>Tankrat </em>is a vehicular combat game that has a strong junkyard aesthetic, and it's coming to PC and PS5 in spring next year.</p><h2><em>Bradley the Badger </em>is an unexpectedly gory platformer</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption><em>Bradley the Badger </em>looks...odd.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I'll admit I wasn't expecting <em>Bradley the Badger</em>'s titular mammal to brutally stab one of his enemies through the gut during the debut trailer, but hey, surprises are fun! This ambitious-looking game is coming to PC via Steam.</p><h2><em>Stupid Never Dies </em>looks pleasingly old-school</h2><p>Next up is a hack-and-slash-style action game with a graffiti-inspired aesthetic and plenty of enemies to mow your way through. <em>Stupid Never Dies </em>is what <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-producer-founds-new-studio-at-netease" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="872fe8bd-eb94-4ab0-bdbb-86eb30e948c8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">GPTRACK50</a> has been working on, and it comes to PC and PS5 next year.</p><h2><em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic </em>isn't the <em>KotOR </em>remake</h2>
<p>I know you're waiting on tenterhooks for news of that <em>Knights of the Old Republic </em>remake, but this isn't it. It's a whole new action RPG in the <em>Star Wars </em>universe, and it boasts the involvement of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mark-darrah-and-casey-hudson-leave-bioware" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c7cc9db0-f244-434c-b9b0-07e2c1b3c006" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">ex-BioWare bod Casey Hudson</a>.</p><h2><em>John Carpenter's Toxic Commando </em>has a release date</h2><p>Next, we got to see a snippet of the brutal and heavily 80s-inspired <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6b106e7f-a32b-4f2b-aea8-fe1cd5f39efb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</em></a>, which will be arriving on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on March 12th.</p><h2>Surprise! That statue was for <em>Divinity</em></h2>
<p>Hey, who'd have thunk? That mysterious statue out in the desert was for a new <em>Divinity </em>game by Larian Studios, so it looks like that's the developer's next big focus after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-has-way-over-10-million-players-mod-support-has-been-in-works-since" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a6faddb2-01d3-46aa-a769-c7be021e6a4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hugely successful <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p><h2><em>4Loop </em>is a <em>Helldivers</em>-esque co-op shooter</h2><p>Next, it's <em>4Loop</em>, a <em>Helldivers</em>-style co-op shooter in which you and your squad are constantly reprinted (hence the "loop" of the title) to do endless battle with robots. PC and PS5 for this one, but no release date.</p><h2><em>Coven of the Chicken Foot </em>looks whimsically fun</h2><p><em>The Last of Us </em>director Bruce Straley's new game is next, and <em>Coven of the Chicken Foot </em>looks...not a lot like that game, actually. It's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/last-of-us-director-announces-intimate-puzzle-platformer-coven-of-chicken-foot" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e089c2ce-c3ac-4580-a171-b9aee3afdbfd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Last Guardian</em>-style companion puzzler</a> coming at some point in the future.</p><h2><em>Ontos </em>is <em>Amnesia </em>studio Frictional's new game</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>Frictional's next game is the very unsettling-looking <em>Ontos</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Frictional Games has developed a reputation for itself for making genuinely creepy, thought-provoking horror, so let's hope new sci-fi spook-'em-up <em>Ontos </em>continues that legacy. It'll arrive next year.</p><h2>Hey, Leon's in <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>!</h2><p>Another of gaming's worst-kept secrets was revealed next: Leon Kennedy is in <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, and he's playable as well. February for this one, remember?</p><h2><em>Order of the Sinking Star </em>looks suitably mind-bending</h2><p>Here's a puzzler for everyone who's smart enough to handle it (which, if I'm being honest, probably isn't me). <em>Order of the Sinking Star </em>is a reality-bending puzzle game coming sometime next year.</p><h2><em>Exodus </em>looks a little bit <em>Mass Effect</em></h2>
<p>Has <em>Mass Effect </em>left a hole in your life? Are you looking for a new sci-fi space opera to laugh and cry to? <em>Exodus </em>may well be the game for you. It's brought to you by Wizards of the Coast, and it's coming in early 2027.</p><h2><em>Warlock: Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>has those high fantasy vibes</h2><p>Next, it's...erm, well, we don't really know what <em>Warlock: Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>is just yet. We will do by summer 2026, though, when a gameplay reveal has been promised.</p><h2><em>Screamer </em>proves once again that driving and storytelling can work</h2><p>I'm honestly extremely glad that narrative racing games appear to be trying to make a comeback, and so is the beautifully-animated <em>Screamer</em>, apparently. March 26th for this one.</p><h2><em>Control Resonant </em>promises another mind-bending story</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>More <em>Control </em>is on the way!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you played the original <em>Control</em>, you'll know it was a wild and at least partly nonsensical (in a good way!) journey, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/control-2-announcement-promises-more-mind-bending-fun" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5caf8cb7-4c43-4da3-a766-14ea52221751" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">long-awaited sequel</a> <em>Control Resonant </em>promises more of the same next year.</p><h2><em>Gang of Dragon </em>looks very <em>Yakuza</em>, which is apropos</h2><p>Next, it's a trailer for <em>Gang of Dragon</em>, the debut game from <em>Yakuza </em>creator <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-creators-team-up-to-create-nagoshi-studios" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5bc54607-2218-4966-b372-9d5bd3fca3c5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Toshihiro Nagoshi's new studio</a>. Unbelievably, it looks a lot like <em>Yakuza</em>-slash-<em>Like a Dragon</em>, although there's sadly no release date.</p><h2><em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight </em>arrives in May</h2><p>The new <em>Lego Batman </em>game, which retells many of the Dark Knight's most iconic stories in Lego form, is arriving on May 29th, and you can pre-order it now. Wahey!</p><h2><em>Tomb Raider Catalyst </em>is the next big <em>Tomb Raider </em>game</h2><p>Cards on the table: I'm not really a pre-rendered game trailer fan. I want to see what the game plays like! That said, that's all we got for <em>Tomb Raider Catalyst</em>, but at least we got to see a new interpretation of Lara Croft. 2027 for this one.</p><h2>Surprise! It's actually two <em>Tomb Raider </em>games</h2>
<p>Crystal Dynamics announced a second <em>Tomb Raider </em>game next in the form of <em>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</em>, a remake (yes, another one) of the first game in the series. It looks a bit more modernized this time around, though. 2026!</p><h2>Hey, <em>Forest 3 </em>looks pretty weird</h2><p>Endnight Games is working on a third <em>Forest </em>game, it turns out, and this one's taking...a more science fiction-y direction? It'll probably be a while before we hear from it again, at any rate.</p><h2><em>Orbitals </em>is one for classic anime fans</h2><p>Next up, it's <em>Orbitals</em>, a rather beautiful-looking retro anime-style sci-fi adventure game that also appears to be co-op. It's coming exclusively to the Nintendo Switch 2 next year.</p><h2><em>Diablo 4</em>'s next expansion is <em>Lord of Hatred</em></h2><p>Are you ready for yet more clicking on things to get EVEN BIGGER numbers and colors? <em>Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred </em>sure hopes you are. You can expect this one on April 28th.</p><h2><em>Lords of the Fallen 2 </em>is a Soulslike - who'd have thunk?</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>Oh, look! <em>Lords of the Fallen 2 </em>is a Soulslike!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>CI Games showcased <em>Lords of the Fallen 2 </em>next, and it's got pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a Soulslike, to wit: lots of monsters, lots of killing, and, uh, the Pet Shop Boys. 2026 is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-2-2026-epic-exclusive" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a29f068a-b045-498e-a3eb-221278f803c0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">when this one is coming out</a>.</p><h2><em>Saros </em>launches in April</h2><p>Housemarque's next game, <em>Saros</em>, which continues the roguelite action trend of <em>Returnal</em>, is launching on April 30th, the studio announced last night. Get your pre-orders ready!</p><h2><em>No Law </em>has serious <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>vibes</h2><p>At first, I thought <em>No Law </em>would be some kind of <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>expansion, but nope: it's a new game from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-ascent-developer-neon-giant" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a6b43493-28f9-4c5a-b90d-f0cb178c2f71" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Krafton and <em>The Ascent</em>'s Neon Giant</a>. You can wishlist it now across platforms!</p><h2><em>Total War: Warhammer 40k </em>is finally happening</h2>
<p>It's a match made in heaven (or perhaps the Warp), and so the existence of <em>Total War: Warhammer 40k </em>probably shouldn't come as a surprise. You can expect it on PC and consoles, although we don't know when.</p><h2><em>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve </em>soars in next year</h2><p>That's right: another <em>Ace Combat </em>game is coming! <em>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve </em>looks to continue the series' signature blend of high drama and, well, high drama when it launches next year.</p><h2><em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer </em>has podracing action for you</h2><figure role="group">

<p>Hey, do you miss the glory days of <em>Star Wars Episode I: Racer</em>? If so, then <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer </em>is the podracing game for you. It's launching next year!</p><h2><em>Out of Words </em>feels a bit <em>Unravel</em>-y</h2><p>Next, it's puzzle-platformer <em>Out of Words</em>, which has a rather lovely (if very <em>Unravel</em>-esque) woolen aesthetic. You'll be able to check this one out next year as well.</p><h2><em>Phantom Blade Zero </em>is action-packed, and it has a release date</h2><p>Action game <em>Phantom Blade Zero </em>was up next, and we've got a release date for this definitely-not-a-Soulslike, too: September 9th on both PC and PlayStation 5.</p><h2>The Blue Bomber returns in <em>Mega Man Dual Override</em></h2>
<p>The good news: Mega Man is returning in a brand new sidescrolling adventure. The bad: we'll have to wait until 2027 to play it. Still, it looks like classic Mega Man, which is great.</p><h2><em>Highguard </em>is a free-to-play fantasy FPS from Respawn</h2><p>If you were hoping for the return of <em>Titanfall </em>during this Game Awards, then sadly, you'll be disappointed. We did get to see a new free-to-play fantasy FPS called <em>Highguard</em>, though, which is launching in January.</p><hr><p>We made it! That's everything that was announced during this year's Game Awards ceremony. Join us around the same time next year for more!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
When <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex-remastered">Deus Ex Remastered</a> was revealed back in September, it quickly became apparent how Simply Not Great this thing looked. There was way too strong of a "we have to make this thing look new and modern and well lit" vibe to it that did not go down very well with pretty much anyway. It even tried to convince us that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-deus-ex-remastered-i-simply-do-not-believe-you-need-an-rtx-2080-to-run-at-recommended-settings">you'd need an RTX 2080 to run it at the recommended settings</a>! The gall! And here we are, almost three months later, with word that the game has been delayed.
</p>
<p>
Not only has it been delayed, but it's been delayed indefinitely. Yesterday, developer Aspyr shared a statement on Bitter announcing the delay, writing that they've "listened to what you had to say, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> Remastered will no longer launch on February 5, 2026. We look forward to sharing more updates with you when the time comes."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of Deus Ex Remastered. We've listened to what you said, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, Deus Ex Remastered will no longer launch on Feb. 5, 2026. <a href="https://t.co/NhalyPLm8q">pic.twitter.com/NhalyPLm8q</a></p>— Aspyr (@AspyrMedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Further than that, anyone that's preordered the game will receive a full refund. The statement doesn't provide any details other than that, nor when Aspyr expect to share any other details about the remaster. 
</p>
<p>
If you were someone desperate to jump back into a slightly flashier version of Deus Ex (but as Mark noted at the time of the remaster's announcement, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex">you can bag the OG for only £6</a>, so I'm not sure why you'd want such a thing), I'd keep your expectations in check for now. Such an overhaul will take quite a while.
</p><p>
It is worth noting that it's not just the graphics that got a new look. There are supposed quality-of-life improvements like autosaves, faster loading, controller support, little things we take for granted now essentially. When the time comes, it might be a nice new way to play the game, but for now, put it at the back of your mind.

            <p>Compulsion Games has revealed that its current Xbox console exclusive, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, will be coming to other consoles in Spring 2026. The game, which is set in a fictionalised American Deep South and makes use of a stop-motion inspired art style, is now confirmed to be releasing on PS5 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/south-of-midnight-review">Eurogamer's review</a>, Chris Tapsell	said that "South of Midnight is gloriously pretty, a game of sumptuous environmental detail and rich attention," but that it can "get tiresome to play." It was awarded 3 stars.</p>
<p>No details on how each version of South of Midnight will be tailored to the new platforms has been released, but a <a href="https://x.com/CompulsionGames/status/1999265661600645401">tweet by Compulsion</a> does mention the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, suggesting we might be getting some form of enhancement for Sony's beefed up console.</p>
<p>South of Midnight walked away as a winner from The Game Awards 2025, the game claiming the Games for Impact award at the show. You can see the dev team accept the award in the clip from the event embeded below.</p>

<p>Cosmic conundrums</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Keplar Interactive and Japanese indie dev Shapefarm have announced that their brand new intergalactic puzzle adventure, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/orbitals">Orbitals</a>, is coming exclusively to Switch 2 <em>sometime</em> in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Revealed during <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/the-game-awards-goty-for-2025-is-clair-obscur-expedition-33">The Game Awards</a>, which we shouldn't hold against it, Orbitals sees two players take on asymmetrical co-op tasks to stop cosmic storms from ruining their space station. Sounds quite tense. Set in a brand-new retro anime galaxy, the game is a debut effort from Shapefarm, and it's been built "from the ground up" for cooperative play, so we're looking forward to being treated to some smart puzzles, thanks.</p>
<p>You and your partner will set about utilising unique space tools, piloting a ship through meteor fields, or even just hanging out to revel in a retro anime vibe that's based off 1970s manga. So that's why the trailer, which you can see up top, looks so very cool.</p>
<p>Indeed, the devs have gone to the trouble of partnering up with Studio Massket, a storied Japanese animation house, to create a fully original anime world complete with hand-crafted cutscenes. Oh, and it's got full English and Japanese dubs (and you can check out the Japanese version of the trailer at the bottom of the page).</p>
<p>It's nice, too, to see a game that's aiming to utilise all the new tech capabilities we've got on Switch 2, with GameShare, GameChat, and all that caper used to further enhance the experience.</p>
<p>Here's some more info and some official screens to further whet your appetite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Orbitals captures the warmth and style of classic Japanese anime, brought to life with authentic detail and clear reverence by the Tokyo-based development team at Shapefarm.</p>
<p>Developed in Unreal Engine 5, Orbitals takes full advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware to deliver an unforgettable co-operative experience regardless of your preferred way of connecting together.</p>
<p>Either by teaming up with two pairs of Joy-Con 2 controllers on a single Nintendo Switch 2 device for split-screen local co-op, using the system’s GameShare feature to share Orbitals with another local player on a compatible Nintendo Switch 2 or Nintendo Switch device, or by matchmaking online with their friends and taking advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2’s built-in microphone and GameChat for crystal-clear communications, players around the world can team up and save the day together as one inseparable team.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>All right, I've definitely got a weakness for Star Wars games which shift the camera away from all the glowy sword fights and space politics, instead zooming in on galactic ne'er-do-wells getting up to mischief. I blame my dad's influence. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> stuck that chord for me, and Star Wars: Galactic Racer looks like it'll combine similar appeal with the trump card of chaotic off-road racing.</p>

<p>Announced during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced-for-pc">last night's Geoffs</a>, Galactic Racer's a speeder speedfest from Fuse Games - a new studio led by ex-Criterion devs with Burnout and Need For Speedy flavour to their CVs. Though, watching its trailer and reading through <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-galactic-racer-reveal-trailer?image_id=star-wars-galactic-racer-reveal-01_d7c67bb8">an interview</a> Fuse co-founder Matt Webster and Lucasfilm Games vice president Douglas Reilly have given to the official Star Wars website, my brain's been taken to a different racing place.</p>
<p>The trailer shows off packs of landspeeders and speederbikes swooping and slamming as they hover through trails that wind through the likes of a ship graveyard on desert world Jakku and the snowy wilds of Ando Prime. It's obviously leaning into the podracing vibes we've seen videogamed in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-episode-1-racer">Star Wars Episode I: Racer</a>, even starring Phantom Menace speedster Sebulba, but in practice, the action sounds like Evolution Studios' old PlayStation mud-fests.</p><p>"We’ve drawn real inspiration from runs-based games so the player will have meaningful, consequential decisions to be making on how they chose their path to become an elite racing pilot — from the vehicle they choose to start with, the upgrade choices they make to create a build that really suits their playstyle and what events they select in determining their path to become champion of the League," Webster said in the interview. "Along the way you’ll compete with rivals, journey to new planets, and master different classes of repulsor craft — or speeders — each with their own distinct capabilities.</p>
<p>"We have a range of racing repulsorcraft for players to discover in the game, each of which have unique handling characteristics to master. Speederbikes, for example, are fast and ferocious, you’ll be braking heavily into corners, really leaning in and then massive drops of acceleration as you power your way through the exit. Also notice that in many of our events, our different speeder classes race at the same time, with exciting physical interactions as those differing racing lines come together."</p>
<p>Given the off-roady courses, that last bit about routes aimed at the different strengths of different craft  diverging and coming back together is the aspect that's put my mind back in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monument-valley">Monument Valley</a>. Obviously, it's not like Galactic Racer's floaty rides will be getting stuck in the mud or splattering through it with chunky tyres, but cutting through narrow chasms in your nimble skim speeder to avoid being side-swiped by a bulkier landspeeder on a more open track definitely is.</p>
<p>All in all, the prospect of battling through the underground racing scene as Shade - "a lone racer with a dream of glory and revenge" - has definitely got my engine running at this point.</p>
<p>If the same applies to you, Star Wars: Galactic Racer's wishlistable on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4078430/STAR_WARS_Galactic_Racer/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>Film adaptations of video games are pretty hot at the moment, with the likes of The Minecraft Movie and The Super Mario Bros. Movie making big money. Next year we're getting a new take on Street Fighter, and now we've got the first look at it in action.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV2qoDVnfxs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>The trailer, which clocks in at under one minute, shows off many of the movie's (and game's) main characters, including Guile (wrestler Cody Rhodes), M. Bison (David Dastmalchian), and Akuma (wrestler Roman Reigns). If you know what you're looking for you can see Guile's flash kick and the classic car smashing bonus stage from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-2">Street Fighter 2</a>.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Got to get those bonus points! | <span>Image credit: <cite>Paramount Pictures/Legendary</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>Neat, right? What's even neater is the car carrying the same IC29 licence plate from the game.</p>
<p>Street Fighter is releasing in cinemas on 16th October, 2026. The latest game in the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, released back in June 2023 on PS4, PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S, and was followed by a release on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> for the console's launch in June this year.</p>
<p>What do you make of the trailer, and did you spot any more moves from the games? Surely it's got to be better than the Jean-Claude Van Damme-starring adapation from 1994.</p>

<p>Launching 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Fans of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> might want to pay attention, because another co-op adventure is heading to the Switch 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/out-of-words">Out Of Words</a> launches in <strong>2026</strong> and is a stop motion co-op adventure from developers Kong Orange, Wired Fly, and Morten Søndergaard, with publishing duties from Epic Games. You'll explore the "wild, colorful realm of Vokabulantis" as Kurt and Karla, two mouthless individuals who must work together to overcome the odds.</p>
<p>The game got its public debut at Summer Game Fest in 2025 and received plenty of critical acclaim from those who went hands-on with the demo. It's lovely, then, that it's now been confirmed for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Find your lost voices in a co-op platformer adventure. Together with a friend, via online cross-platform or couch co-op, explore the wild, colorful realm of Vokabulantis as Kurt and Karla in a story about the first time they held hands — where everything you see is crafted by hand."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Game Awards also confirmed the existence of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mega-man-dual-override">Mega Man: Dual Override</a> for the Switch 2 (with the latter also heading for the original Switch ).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Highguard is a new PvP raid shooter from the creators of<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=apex+legends"> Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=Titanfall">Titanfall</a> which mixes guns with magic, plus some light horseback riding.&nbsp; You play as a Warden who must fight for the Shieldbreaker, which in turn lets you smash into the enemy base.</p>
<p><iframe title="Highguard - Official Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rh6Pi6h_css?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The rest of the game is being kept under wraps but we can see from the trailer it looks good, and while the hero character designs are impressive they do seem to fall in to the usual stereotypes. Maybe one day we will get a hulking, growly, muscle brute who’s actually a wizard with long-range attacks rather than a rage-filled, close combat animal.</p>
<p>The trailer also shows some of the abilities the heroes have and they are suitably splashy and spectacular and remind me of the Supers found in Destiny 2. In fact some of them seem very similar, the animations are very close, but I guess there’s only a finite number of ways you can wave your hands around to cast a spell.</p>
<p>There’s some horseback riding, but you can also ride a bear (don’t get any ideas), or a panther. Also in the mix is what appears to be medieval take on the Thundertank from Thundercats. The only thing that made me wince whilst watching the Highguard trailer was the blonde character shouting “Bring the heat”,&nbsp; that phrase has been used so many times in video games it is cheesy as hell.</p>

<p>The game is free-to-play which should give a decent start but the world of F2P shooters is already packed with the likes of RedSec, Fortnite, Overwatch 2, and COD Warzone and we have seen many games try and break in to that market and fail</p>
<p>Highguard will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on January 26th, 2026, will you be singing up to play?</p>

            <guid>1381546</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bandai Namco Aces has announced ACE COMBAT 8: WINGS OF THEVE <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during The Game Awards 2025</a>. About a year and a half ago, an actor's resume <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-ace-combat-8-squadron-42-and-gearboxs-next-game-all-target-2025-launch-according-to-actors-resume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'leaked' its existence</a>, suggesting a 2025 launch, but the game will instead be released next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X. Still, we don't suppose many fans of this franchise will complain. This is the first mainline installment in seven years, after all.</p>



<p>As you'd expect, the press release claims it will take the IP to new heights. Harnessing the power of Unreal Engine 5 in addition to proprietary technology, the studio promised players a visually stunning, ultra-realistic aerial thrill ride. It will feature an immersive campaign mode that places players in the role of an ace pilot, embroiled in an emotional tale of identity and duty as they fight for the survival of their homeland. ACE COMBAT 8: WINGS OF THEVE will also feature multiplayer modes that thrust players into high-speed aerial dogfights against friends and foes.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ACE COMBAT 8: WINGS OF THEVE Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKIE3ClcDyA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The press release notes that the new game continues the legacy of the ACE COMBAT franchise, which has consistently pushed the boundaries of game visuals and action-packed, arcade-inspired gameplay in the flight shooting genre. Players will fly various real-world fighter jets from around the globe in a game characterised by stunning visual detail and effects. They will navigate realistic expanses of clouds, finely rendered terrain and landscapes, and inclement weather. Bandai Namco Aces also teased thrilling cinematics and the option to view them from a first-person perspective, which could potentially enhance the immersion of the story.</p>



<p>The announcement trailer provides a first glimpse of the game's in-depth Campaign Mode, in which players take on the role of an ace pilot in Strangereal, a fictitious war-torn world. The weight of decisions, the pressure of command, and the bonds forged in battle will feel very real. With their nation, the Federation of Central Usea (FCU), occupied and its navy destroyed, players take on the role of the 'Wings of Theve' – a legendary ace whose name is synonymous with Theve, the capital of the FCU, and who is a symbol of hope for every citizen in their homeland. Joined by three new fighter pilots, they embark on a mission to reclaim their homeland and eliminate the threat to their people, carrying the hope of every FCU citizen and taking on the name of their capital city.</p>

			<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>, publisher KOEI TECMO and developer Team NINJA announced that a new demo of their upcoming dark samurai action RPG, Nioh 3, will be released on January 29, 2026 on PlayStation 5 and PC (via Steam). The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-visual-performance-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous demo</a>, as you might recall, was only available for PS5. Players will be able to sharpen their blades in the new demo in solo mode or in online multiplayer mode with up to three other players. Cross-play is not supported for online multiplayer, according to the press release, and this limitation applies not only to the demo but also to the full game. After completing the demo, fans will be able to carry over their save data to the final game.</p>



<p>Pre-orders are now open. The Standard Edition is priced at $79.99, while the Digital Deluxe Edition costs $119.99. This version includes the Season Pass (also available for separate purchase), as well as the following items: </p>



<ul>
<li>Nioh 3 season pass bonus "Chijiko Netsuke Charm" (accessory)</li>



<li>Infernal Weapons Set (14 types)</li>



<li>Kodama Netsuke Charm (accessory)</li>
</ul>



<p>The season pass is a set including add-on DLCs. The DLCs include new stories, enemies, yokai, boss characters, and equipment. The aforementioned season pass bonus items will be released on the same date as the base game. Add-on DLC 1 is set to become available by the end of September 2026, and add-on DLC 2 is set to become available by the end of February 2027.</p>



<p>A SteelBook edition is also available to pre-order and includes the base game and two exclusive DLC bonuses. Players can also pre-order a special PlayStation 5 physical edition exclusively through the <a href="https://store.nisamerica.com/products/nioh-3-treasure-box" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NIS America Store</a>. The Nioh 3 TREASURE BOX includes the base game, a Scampuss Furball Netsuke Charm Keychain, a Nioh 3 Original Desk Pad, the Official Artbook, and a Nioh 3 Selection Soundtrack CD.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Additionally, new exclusive bonuses for players who purchase the game early have been revealed. These players will receive bonus armour sets inspired by protagonists from previous titles: the “Youngblood Armour (Samurai)”, worn by William in Nioh, and the “Lone Wolf’s Armour (Ninja)”, worn by Hide in Nioh 2. These items can be obtained by redeeming the “Hellfrost Armour Set” early purchase bonus in the game. Lastly, a special discount is available on the Steam version of Nioh: Complete Edition, which offers players a 90% discount on the first title in the franchise.</p>



<p>Nioh 3 launches on February 6, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and PC. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Wccftech's Francesco De Meo</a>, who recently played the game at a preview event, it feels like the culmination of every previous Team NINJA title. The developers also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-dev-made-sure-there-wont-be-sudden-difficulty-spikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assured fans that the game won't feature sudden difficulty spikes</a>.</p>

            <p>
The future is here! Or, I guess it's around 40,000 years away, but that's still more or less here for the Total War series, which'll be tackling a futuristic setting for the first time in last night's reveal of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-is-real-and-features-orks-space-marines-the-aeldari-and-for-some-reason-david-harbour">Warhammer 40,000 spin-off reveal</a>. It's got most of what you'd expect, like those mean ole Space Marines, and big, dramatic, explosive battles with so much going on on screen you'll get a hernia. But there were a few details shared in a post-reveal blog post that go into some small bits that weren't a part of the big reveal.
</p>
<p>
Right at the bottom of said <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/total-war-warhammer-40000">blog post</a> is an FAQ, with the first notable question there being "where are the Chaos Space Marines?" As it stands, the only revealed factions so far are the regular Space Marines, Orks, Aeldari, and Astra Militarum. In response to that question, Creative Assembly explained that the Chaos Space Marines won't be there at launch, but they'll "absolutely" be a part of their plans "at some point, along with all the other iconic factions from the setting."
</p>
<p>
Then there's the question of modding. From right off the bat, the team wants to support modding on the Steam Workshop from launch, but it's the official modding tools you'll have to wait a while longer for. This is down to Creative Assembly's new Warcore engine, and they note that they'll have more details to share on that "close to launch." Oh, and don't worry, there won't be any blood DLC because the "41st Millennium is a setting of eternal war, so blood and dismemberment is key to creating an authentic experience."
</p>
<p>
The blog post also makes mention of a "small roundtable with members of the development team" coming next week on December 16th. Important to note that you shouldn't expect a big look at gameplay, it sounds like more of a light chat about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game. A full look at its story and gameplay will apparently come in spring, so hang tight for now.

		<p>I know I really like Ace Combat, but in the world of gaming storylines, I couldn’t tell you one little detail about the somewhat crazy geo-political shenanigans that the series is known for. Still, we can all hope that the story becomes a touch more affecting with the announcement of the latest entry, Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve, with its Top Gun-inspired aerial combat due for release at some point in 2026 and coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="ACE COMBAT 8: WINGS OF THEVE Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKIE3ClcDyA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming from Project Aces and Bandai Namco, Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve is a direct sequel to Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown which released all the way back in 2019. This time out, you’re a fighter pilot, adrift at sea in a rescue boat until the outdated aircraft carrier, Endurance, pulls you aboard. The ageing vessel, its decks crowded with refugees, has already retreated far from the front lines.</p>
<p>On this ship, you’re given a new name: “Wings of Theve”. A legendary ace, a symbol of hope, a name tied to Theve, the FCU capital. But, as it turns out, that legend was a lie; it was just a story made to keep morale alive. Now, you must carry that name and take to the skies with three new comrades at your side, fighting to reclaim your lost homeland.</p>
<p>Ace Combat 7 earned a hefty <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/18/ace-combat-7-review/">9/10</a> when it launched, where I said, “In Ace Combat 7, dogfighting games have a new Top Gun. The VR sadly turned my stomach, but the series’ trademark action is bigger and better than ever, with the spectacular weather effects introducing a level of realism and drama that will win over any wannabe Mavericks.”</p>

<p>I definitely can’t wait to check out some more aerial combat, and I’ll certainly try to remember more of the story this time out, with the new first-person cutscenes looking like they’ll put you right at the centre of the action.</p>
