            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed the first sales figures for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, and it probably won't surprise you to learn that the game has dwarfed the two most recent entries in the series in terms of launch weekend figures.</p>

<p>Per a Capcom <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>managed to reach eight million sales within the first three days of its launch. That, as Capcom points out, is the quickest a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game has reached that figure.</p>

<p>For comparison's sake,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World&nbsp;</em>hit <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/monster-hunter-world-shipped-5-million-units-in-a-weekend" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">five million</a> sales within the same period, while&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>, which was initially exclusive to the Nintendo Switch, reached four million.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m-hunting-horn.jpg?itok=1dV9mxLT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m-hunting-horn.jpg?itok=cX-gdTxy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's fair to call&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>a runaway success.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this isn't just the fastest a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game has reached that eight million milestone; it's also the fastest any Capcom game has managed to do so. It's fair to say Capcom has a bona fide success on its hands with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p>

<p>If you've been following&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' launch, its impressive sales performance probably won't surprise you. The game debuted to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">well over a million players on Steam at launch</a>, breaking records for both the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>franchise and Capcom as a whole.</p>

<p>The signs were there even before launch;&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' first open beta, which was held across PC and consoles back in November, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">attracted more Steam players</a> than any game in the series had managed up to that point.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>was expected to do so well before launch that&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-monster-hunter-wilds-day-off" rel="nofollow">gave the majority of its staff the day off</a> on Friday, recognizing that many employees would just call in sick to play the game anyway.</p>




<p>The game's success hasn't come without a cost. Although critical reviews are broadly positive, players have provided much more mixed feedback for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, especially <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on PC</a>, with many pointing to lackluster performance and poor multiplayer implementation.</p>

Fans have been patiently waiting for the new hardware for years, excited to see what the future holds for the successor to one of the best video game consoles ever made. I’m excited too, but I also know that no matter what Nintendo has planed, the Switch 2 doesn’t have a prayer of recapturing the magic of the original Switch launch. Perhaps no future console does. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,196181,196230" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This week marks the eighth anniversary of the handheld console hybrid’s release and somehow the device is still going.

No other console has gone on this strong and this consistently for this long, and none of it might have been possible without the constellation of factors that serendipitously collided to make the Switch launch one for the history books.</p><p>First there was the drama surrounding Nintendo, the storied gaming company whose name had once been synonymous with “video game console,” but whose Wii U had bombed so spectacularly that many thought it should exit the hardware business entirely. At only 13.56 million units sold, the white box with the clunky tablet controller performed even worse than the GameCube. Nintendo’s handheld at the time, the 3DS, was similarly its worst performing portable ever, though by a much smaller margin. </p><p>Nintendo had long ago abandoned the gaming graphics arms race, but by the mid-2010s it seemed like it had abandoned common sense as well, taking overly ambitious swings at superfluous hardware gimmicks instead of making decent hardware in service of great games. The fact that the Switch did exactly that, bringing Nintendo franchises into HD for the first time ever, felt like a remarkable coup considering the basement-level expectations coming out of the Wii U era. </p><p>But it also made a great first impression based on a novel insight: portable gaming doesn’t have to be secondary. The conventional wisdom at the time was that no one wanted to play big, deep games on the go. They had <em>Candy Crush</em> for that. The rise of smartphone gaming was thought to be one of the main factors in dooming the PlayStation Vita. It turns out that Sony just didn’t make the right games. Being able to take console-like experiences from home on the go, or just to the bedroom, made the sleek but otherwise humble-looking Switch feel revolutionary. </p><figure id="" data-id="tkfwdk9s8d1vtrkgpwqa" data-recommend-id="image://tkfwdk9s8d1vtrkgpwqa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Link looks off at the mountains.

Most systems launch with a few visually dazzling but mechanically shallow games. They gesture at what the new tech is capable of but belie the developers’ inexperience in being able to completely capitalize on it. Few console launches get full-fledged sequels in one of the biggest franchises around, let alone a GOTY that redefines a genre. <em>Breath of the Wild</em> was all of those things, and eight years later its reverberations throughout the medium are still being felt.</p><p>The real magic of the Switch launch was feeling both of these things smashed together: a mechanically deep, richly emergent, gorgeous open-world adventure on a small tablet that could (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-is-your-favorite-gaming-handheld-of-all-time-1844962828&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-is-your-favorite-gaming-handheld-of-all-time-1844962828">almost</a></span>) fit into your pocket (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-gear-are-you-using-with-your-new-nintendo-switch-1793234536&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-gear-are-you-using-with-your-new-nintendo-switch-1793234536">or sock</a></span>).<em> Breath of the Wild</em> was a return to form for a series that had previously grown stiff and predictable, on a device that showed leaving the graphical arms race behind wasn’t a retreat from making great games, but the opposite. Hundreds of amazing games came to the Switch in the years that followed, but have any of them ever topped that feeling of first leaving the Great Plateau in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>? The fact that it’s even still debatable is remarkable. </p><p>There’s one final, less impressive reason why the Switch 2 will have a hard time living up to the  original Switch’s launch window hype: there’s no graveyard of Wii U games to cannibalize this time around. <em>Mario Kart 8</em> was ported to Switch within its first two months, eventually becoming its most popular game ever. Plenty of other first-party Wii U orphans have been rescued this way, filling out the Switch’s release calendar as needed while Nintendo consolidated its console and portable game development teams into a single, streamlined machine. </p><p>Maybe the Switch 2 will launch with a brand-new 3D <em>Mario </em>whose sprawling levels and inventive designs rival those of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. Maybe <em>Mario Kart 9</em> will revolutionize the racing series the way <em>Breath of the Wild </em>did for<em> Zelda</em>. Maybe somehow, someway, a new mainline <em>Zelda</em> will also hit the Switch 2 in its first year even though <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>will only be three years old. In any case, though, it’s still only possible to experience the feeling of playing those types of games on a handheld for the first time once, and that already happened eight years ago. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds sold 8 million units in the first 3 days of release, becoming the fastest-selling game in Capcom’s history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was released on February 28, 2025, and the game has been breaking records since the first day. The game brought in over 1.3 million players on Steam alone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">within the first 12 hours</a> and is still managing to bring in more than 1 million players within the past 24 hours (at the time of writing). Their latest record, with 8 million sales in 3 days, has made Monster Hunter Wilds the fastest-selling game in the series and Capcom’s history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the announcement <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a>, the developers discussed what it took to sell over 8 million copies in such a short span of time. With the new instalment in the series, the developers wanted to take Monster Hunter to a broader audience. So, they conducted several global initiatives, such as appearing at global game showcases, hosting online beta tests, and hosting individual showcases to spread the word.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from the initiatives, the developers have also worked on several core aspects of the game that have helped Monster Hunter Wilds reach this significant sales milestone. Through the Forbidden Lands, players experience a new, dynamically changing open world where they can be in the harshest environment at one moment and then suddenly find themselves in a “rich natural environment teeming with life”. The game is also the first in the series to feature cross-play co-op, which helps more players across platforms enjoy the game together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jagex has announced a change-up at the highest level, with CEO Phil Mansell stepping down and being replaced by Jon Bellamy. Phil has been in the role of Chief Executive Officer at Jagex since 2017 but has been with the company for more than a decade. Jon Bellamy noted that he is excited to communicate his ‘broader vision’ for RuneScape soon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-handing-over-the-baton">Handing Over The Baton</h2>



<p>In a press release, Phil Mansell expressed his sentiments at stepping back from the role of CEO at Jagex:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After an incredible 14 years leading RuneScape and 8 years as Jagex’s CEO, I’m stepping back and handing over the baton to Jon Bellamy. </p>



<p>Working alongside such a talented and passionate team, we’ve significantly grown the Company and player community, cementing Jagex as an innovator in community-driven games and genuine leader in this industry. </p>



<p>As the Company embarks on its next chapter, I am delighted to be handing over to a leader who I know cares about our games and business as much as I do – and I look forward to supporting him as he builds upon the strong foundations we’ve created.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bellamy echoed those sentiments:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a great honour to assume the leadership of Jagex and to help steward a game franchise that means so much to so many millions, myself included. I am also excited to get to work with the outstanding team, whom I know well from my time on the Board, to ensure our games continue to be the best in the world. </p>



<p>I plan to spend some time now with the team, reviewing our ambitions for Jagex, and plan to communicate my broader vision to the RuneScape community in the near-term.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mansell was most recently in the press following an awful proposal made by Jagex to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-ceo-addresses-recent-runescape-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overhaul the paid membership model</a>. It rankled with the community and was taken with an awful reception, and Mansell branded the proposal ‘clumsy and inconsiderate’.</p>



<p>He said that they had failed to think the proposal through from the perspective of a player, and the plans were ultimately scrapped.</p>



<p>Last year, Jagex was in talks regarding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-billion-dollar-buyout/">a potential billion dollar buyout</a>, but that conversation eventually faded out of the press.</p>

Unfortunately for Studio Fizbin, the decision to close its doors can't even wait another two weeks for the release of its final game, Reignbreaker.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/studio-fizbin-shutting-down-after-reignbreaker-s-mid-march-release" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Studio Fizbin founder Alexander “Pepe” Pieper shared the news on <a href="https://www.studio-fizbin.com/fizbins-last-magic-trick" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the company's official site</a>. According to Pieper, the end of Studio Fizbin is happening in part because the dev team doesn't have a new project to work on after Reignbreaker is finished. Studio Fizbin's parent company, Thunderful, is also drastically cutting back on its internal development. Consequently, Studio Fizbin will be closing its doors after an 11-year run that included titles like The Inner World, The Inner World: The Last Wind Monk, Say No! More, Minute of Islands, and Lost at Sea.</p><p>However, Studio Fizbin will remain open long enough to ensure that its new roguelike action game, Reignbreaker, is "going to be the best game we've ever released." Following the game's debut on March 18, Studio Fizbin will provide post-launch support for Reignbreaker while helping its employees find new job opportunities in the industry.</p><p>"We want to thank every single one of our fans for your purchases, your fan art, your comments, your reviews, your passion, and your seemingly endless support," wrote Pieper. "And finally, we'd like to give the biggest thanks to our team--those who are here until the end, and the many others who have found a different path on the way. Fizbin and its games are defined by its team members, and you all made this the most inspiring place to perform the world's most difficult magic trick: making games."</p><p>Last year, there were large layoffs across the video game industry, and 2025 is already off to a rough start with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/three-studios-have-already-shut-down-in-2025-including-godfall-developer/1100-6528785/" data-ref-id="1100-6528785">the closure of Godfall developer Counterplay Games</a>, as well as Warner Bros.

            <p>
Activision's social media post advertising a new entry in the Guitar Hero series is market research for a game that doesn't exist, and is not meant to be an actual announcement, Eurogamer understands.
</p>
<p>
The fake advert - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-accused-of-ai-slop-yet-again-this-time-for-new-guitar-hero">which has been dubbed "AI slop" for its use of poorly-generated imagery</a> - is one of several tests currently being run across the publisher's social media profiles. 
</p>
<p>
These adverts also include new smartphone games in other Activision franchises such as Call of Duty and Crash Bandicoot that also don't exist (yet) either. 
</p>
<p>
Clicking on some of the adverts will take you through to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GuitarHero/comments/1j0jbh3/instagram_ad_for_a_new_guitar_hero_mobile_game/">mocked up mobile store page</a> organised by marketing service Geeklab, and then onto a survey that reveals "this isn't a real game, but could be some day!"
</p>
<p>
Market research questions then include queries asking users what made them click on the advert and what gameplay features they expected the game to include, based on the fake advert.
</p>
<p>
Activision posts on Instagram and Facebook have similarly advertised "Call of Duty: Zombie Defender", "Call of Duty: Sniper" and "Crash Bandicoot: Brawl".
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Activision plans to develop two new Call of Duty titles for mobile platform:</p><p>🔸 Call of Duty: Zombie Defender<br>🔸 Call of Duty: Sniper</p><p>AI-generated advertisements are being used to gauge player interests. If there is enough interest, the project will go into development. These… <a href="https://t.co/PWA1KjLd4h">pic.twitter.com/PWA1KjLd4h</a></p></div>— Leakers On Duty (@LeakersOnDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/LeakersOnDuty/status/1896536223478403382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
Artwork for the latter game, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Activision/videos/569180362817791/">hosted on Facebook</a>, again shows obvious use of AI image generation. One squirrel-like character appears to be missing half a face.

<p>
Will any of these Guitar Hero, Crash Bandicoot or Call of Duty smartphone games ever see the light of day? That remains to be seen. If and when they do, however, here's hoping Activision hires some actual humans to work on their artwork.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">Activision recently added a warning label to the Steam page for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> confirming the game "uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets", after players spotted various in-game examples - including a zombie Santa Claus with six fingers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-is-now-available-on-pc-first-comparisons-highlight-visual-improvements-introduced-by-ray-traced-global-illumination.1124619/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-ray-tracing-improvements-comparison/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced is now available on PC, introducing plenty of new features that are sure to breathe new life into the latest main entry in the series.</p>
<p>The new version of the game includes, as announced a few days back, new features such as new ray tracing settings like ray-traced global illumination and ambient occlusion, that push the game's visuals beyond those offered in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game, NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR 1 and 3 support, faster loading times with DirectStorage support and more. Now that the upgrade is out, we have also learned that all settings can go as high as Ultra and that the game features a Scene BVH Quality, thanks to a new screenshot provided by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/gabdeg.8633/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gabdeg</a> on the ResetERA forums. Unfortunately, HDR support is nowhere to be found, which is a shame.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GTA-V-Enhanced-RT-settings.png"></a></figure>

<p>It's too early to say if the new ray tracing features included in the Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced PC release improve the game's visuals universally, but from the <a href="https://imgsli.com/MzU1MTE5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quick comparison</a> put together by gabdeg, it's clear they do have a significant impact. Another <a href="https://imgsli.com/MzU1MTIx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comparison</a> put together by another ResetERA forums member, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/vic20.61250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vic20</a>, highlights how much ray-traced global illumination makes a difference. Performance also seems to be solid, according to the first few reports, so it definitely looks like Rockstar Games has done a great job improving their highly successful game.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced is now available for all PC users as a free upgrade, while the Legacy version will continue to be available to allow those with PC configurations that do not match those for the upgraded version of the game to continue playing normally. More information on the Enhanced release can be found <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/">here.</a></p>

                <p>Capcom has announced that Monster Hunter Wilds has sold 8 million copies in three days, a new record for the company. This is the fastest-selling game in Capcom's history, surpassing the previous record-holder Monster Hunter World by a sizable margin. When it first launched several years ago, Monster Hunter World reached five million sales in three days <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240312.html" rel="nofollow ">and has so far reached 25 million lifetime sales</a>. Monster Hunter Wilds still has some way to go to reach and possibly surpass that number, but with extensive post-launch plans in place, it has a fighting chance to do so.</p><p><a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html" rel="nofollow ">According to Capcom</a>, several open betas, a big marketing push, and the broad appeal of Monster Hunter Wilds have helped it reach this milestone, and the company remains "firmly committed to satisfying the expectations" of players. On Steam, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hits-top-5-all-time-on-steam-for-concurrent-players/1100-6529828/">Monster Hunter Wilds has set a record on that PC platform</a> by reaching the top five for concurrent players, with 1.3 million people on March 1, 2025. The other top four ahead of Monster Hunter Wilds are PUBG, Black Myth: Wukong, Palworld, and Counter-Strike 2.</p><p>Overall, the Monster Hunter franchise is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/capcoms-best-selling-game-franchises-of-all-time-and-whats-next-for-each/2900-6294/">second-best-selling Capcom franchise of all time</a>, with Resident Evil still holding the top spot. Even with Wilds adding 8 million more sales--and counting--to the franchise, Resident Evil holds a significant lead with 176 million sales in total for the franchise. It's not too surprising, given that the franchise launched several years before Monster Hunter and it has more games in its library.</p><p>"There are a few missteps along the way--of both an artistic and technical variety--but Wilds is another excellent entry in Capcom's beloved series," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/">Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>.

                <p>The Mobile World Conference: Barcelona event kicked off this week, and amidst several new tech reveals from dozens of companies, one of Samsung's divisions had an interesting concept for the potential future of portable game consoles. Essentially, Samsung envisions a scenario where bulky game consoles can be made more portable, using foldable-screen technology to fold them up and make them easier to carry around.</p><p>Samsung Display--a branch of the company that develops screen technology that other firms can purchase for their devices--showed off a Switch-like device at MWC: Barcelona (via <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-shows-off-quirky-pincer-phone-folding-console-and-flexi-briefcase-concepts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNET</a>), demonstrating how a console could be made smaller by simply folding it in half. There are of course potential issues to watch out for that are common to foldable devices, as screens can only be folded so many times before they develop a signature crease, but the idea behind this concept design makes for a fascinating glimpse at what could be.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/sondesix/status/1896670398324031921" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Samsung Display shows off some crazy new concepts at MWC 2025.<br>✅ Flexible Briefcase: this cabinbag unfolds into an 18.1" tablet<br>✅ Flex Gaming: a 7.2" gaming console with a foldable screen<br>✅ Next-gen OCF OLED panel that allows for a 5,000 nits peak brightness in a 10% window,… <a href="https://t.co/XBUHE5pbJ1" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/XBUHE5pbJ1</a></p>  — Alvin (@sondesix) <a href="https://twitter.com/sondesix/status/1896670398324031921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>While current devices like the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> don't have a foldable screen, these companies could adopt this technology for future hardware. For now, it looks like the best way to carry around a portable games console will be to invest in a carrying case for it. The other alternative is to go retro, as older devices like the Game Boy, Nintendo DS, or the PlayDate are more pocket-friendly in design.</p><p>Modern smartphones are also capable gaming devices--Asus even sells one designed specifically for mobile gaming--and with a cradle device like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-controller-up-for-preorder-half-the-price-of-backbone/1100-6527392/" data-ref-id="1100-6527392">Backbone</a>, it's easy to make a session on one feel similar to a console experience.</p>

                <p>Konami has announced a brand-new entry in the fabled RPG series, Suikoden. It's called Suikoden Star Leap and it'll be on iOS and Android. Star Leap is free-to-play with microtransactions, and it's the first Suikoden game since 2012's Suikoden: The Woven Web of a Century, which was on PSP but never released outside of Japan.</p><p>The game follows a silent protagonist who's the son of the village chief, Hou. One night, the village is attacked. The hero, along with his friends Hisui, Shirin, and Shapur, embark on a new journey to restore peace to the village once again. Like every Suikoden game, Star Leap has 108 recruitable characters and the rest will be revealed at a later date.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKOZqkjPcWk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WKOZqkjPcWk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Star Leap also sees the return of pixel-art graphics, like the first two Suikoden games had, and breaking away from the 3D models of the previous three games.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202503/34239" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a>, producer Shinya Fujimoto said that Star Leap takes place between the events of Suikoden V and Suikoden I. Additionally, the first chapter of Star Leap will heavily feature Odessa Silverberg, the original leader of the Liberation Army in Suikoden I that the protagonist eventually becomes in charge of.</p><p>While no release date has been revealed for Suikoden Star Leap, a remaster of the first two Suikoden games is releasing soon. The bundle is called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster-preorders-are-25-off-on-pc/1100-6526150/" data-ref-id="1100-6526150">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars</a> and launches on March 6 for PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. It features brand-new quality-of-life features such as adjustable battle speeds and auto-saves.</p>

            <p>Inzoi - the upcoming and rather realistic looking Sims-like - is set to launch in early access later this month, and ahead of that people want to know one very important thing: what's the sex situation?</p>
<p>Sex is, of course, a pretty common feature in Maxis and EA's The Sims series, where it is known as WooHoo. And Inzoi players want to have a deeper understanding of what will be the WooHoo equivalent in Krafton's own life-sim.</p>

<p>The Inzoi team recently hosted a Q&amp;A session <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1162040845181124618/1162040845181124621/1345026317103534131">via the game's Discord</a>, where it was asked: "In Inzoi will you be able to have interactions for the purpose of creating babies?" (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/theres-sort-of-sex-in-inzoi-its-developers-explain-as-terminally-horny-life-sim-players-ask-about-getting-freaky-and-watching-their-zois-shower/">PC Gamer</a>). So, essentially, let's talk about sex, baby, but without actually using that word.</p>
<p>Here's what assistant director Joel Lee had to say about sex in Izoi: "There is a feature in the game that you obviously know what's happening, the male Zoi and the female Zoi are together, likely in bed, with the intention of creating babies. How visually apparent is that? That's where you have to go to your imagination. </p>
<p>"What you're seeing is not what you're seeing; you have to assume that's what's happening. Is that clear enough for everyone? It's there. Sort of. Maybe not to the level that everyone would have been expecting."
</p>
<p>Reading this, I assume this means Inzoi won't feature the same over-the-top interactions such as shaking bushes, love hearts popping out of rocket ships and a bombastic firework finale like we see in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>. That is perhaps understandable, given Inzoi is going for a more realistic tone (even if the characters do wear towels in the shower).</p>
<p>I am still not sure exactly what sex in Inzoi will look like, though. Also, given the game will feature same-sex relationships, I presume sex won't only be limited to - in Lee's words - the intention of creating babies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gorgeous-sims-like-inzoi-delayed-into-next-year-to-give-it-a-stronger-foundation">Izoi is set to release in early access on 28th March</a>, via Steam. Our Ian along with Outside Xbox's Jane went hands on with Inzoi last year. You can check out their thoughts on the game - including its toilet animations - below.</p>

<p>In the meantime, and if you want to have some life-sim-WooHoo-related-fun, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-turning-up-the-heat-with-its-super-sexy-lovestruck-expansion-pack">EA released the Lovestruck Expansion Pack for The Sims 4</a>. This pack added new romantic interactions, which include a new kiss, a sultry dance and three new WooHoo spots.</p>
<p>It also added a sexy aubergine costume, because of course.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Trusted leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun">billbil-kun</a> has released details of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 which is set ot be officially announced later today.</p>
<p>He has revealed the game will be released on 11th July 2025, and if you pre-order the game you will get a ‘Wireframe Tony Shader’ along with the ‘Foundry demo’ when it is released, so presumably a demo of the game will be announced at some point.</p>


<p>The game has a Collector’s Edition which costs a whopping $129.99, a Deluxe Edition for $69.99 which includes Doom Slayer &amp; Revenant Skaters, the Unmaykr Hoverboard and ‘In-Game Music’, and the bog standard edition, which will cost you $49.99. The Deluxe and Collector’s Editions will get three days of early access. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 will&nbsp;be released on Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and PS5, but no mention of a PS4 version.</p>
<p>This all comes off the back of long-running reports and rumours surrounding a follow-up to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/03/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-thps-ps4-xbox-pc/">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2</a> remake. Following that game’s 2020 release, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/06/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-plans-shelved-after-blizzard-entertainment-absorbed-vicarious-visions-says-tony-hawk">Tony Hawk said</a> that a follow-up was planned, but shelved after Vicarious Visions was absorbed into Blizzard Entertainment, rebranded as Blizzard Albany and set to work on the Diablo series.</p>
<p>Rumours about the project were revived recently when skater Tyshawn Jones<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3umK3xG7Ly4&amp;t=1314"> said in a radio interview</a> that he is set to be in an upcoming <em>Tony Hawk</em> game remaster.</p>
<p>Right now, it’s not clear who is working on Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4. There’s nothing stopping Blizzard Albany from working on this as they still exist within the overarching Activision Blizzard structure, and depending on workloads since the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/08/diablo-iv-review/">Diablo IV</a> in 2023, and surrounding the Vessels of Hatred DLC last year.</p>

<p>Looking back at THPS 1+2, we awarded the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/03/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-thps-ps4-xbox-pc/">a stellar 10/10</a>, saying “Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+ 2 is a labour of love and an ode to the series’ glory days. Every inch of the game has been perfectly restored and updated for modern consoles and it’s an absolute delight to play from start to finish. This is a must-buy for skateboarders, gamers and everyone else in between.”</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is all about crafting the best gear to perfect your build and allow you to take on some of the game's strongest monsters and in your quest for power, there will come a time when you will need more than just monster parts to craft the strongest gear. Among these items are the Hunter Symbols, which are awarded to the best hunters after completing certain quests.</p>
<p>The Hunter Symbols in Monster Hunter Wilds come in three different number variants and are awarded after completing quests involving <strong>Tempered Monsters</strong>. These monster variants, which are considerably more powerful than the base ones, will start roaming maps after you defeat them in post-game story quests, starting with the <strong>Main Mission 4.3: Wyvern Spark and Rose Thorns</strong> quest. To get <strong>Hunter Symbol I</strong>, you will have to complete quests involving 5-Star Tempered monsters, while to get <strong>Hunter Symbol II</strong>, you will have to complete quests involving 6-Star Tempered monsters.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250304123727_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>To get <strong>Hunter Symbol III</strong> in Monster Hunter Wilds, you will have to <strong>complete quests involving 7 and 8-Star Tempered monsters</strong>, which are Rey Dau, Jin Dahaad, Uth Duna, Nu Udra,&nbsp; and Gore Magala for 7-Star rank, and Arkveld for 8-Star rank. Before you can actually encounter the Tempered variants of the Apex predators above, however, you will first have to complete the final story mission, <strong>Mission 6-1</strong>, and reach <strong>Hunter Rank 41</strong>. Be sure to gear up before you attempt to fight these Tempered monsters, as they are the current strongest monsters in the game!</p>

            <p>The developers of workplace comedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/say-no-more">Say No! More</a> and anti-establishment roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reignbreaker">Reignbreaker</a> are closing down, and the news comes just two weeks before their final punky action game is due to come out. Studio Fizbin has been struck by ongoing cuts at their parent company Thunderful, they say, and despite pitching follow-up projects to work on after Reignbreaker's release, none of those will go ahead. Which means they'll be winding down at the exact moment you'd hope they'd be celebrating a payoff from years of work. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Our parent company Thunderful made the decision to drastically reduce internal development in November 2024, which, as Thunderful’s CEO Martin communicated in the latest quarterly report, also affected Studio Fizbin," said founder Alexander Pieper in a statement <a href="https://www.studio-fizbin.com/fizbins-last-magic-trick">on the studio's website</a>, as noticed by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/studio-fizbin-shutting-down-after-reignbreaker-s-mid-march-release">Gamedeveloper</a>. "Since then, we’ve been exploring various opportunities to work on after finishing Reignbreaker. Unfortunately, none of these projects will move forward, leading us to make this difficult decision.</p>
<p>"This means that Reignbreaker will be Studio Fizbin’s final game."</p>
<p>Publishers Thunderful recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steamworld-makers-announce-100-layoffs-cancel-projects-and-say-theyll-publish-more-games-by-other-studios-but-fewer-of-their-own">slashed 80-100 jobs across their studios</a>, and said they'll now focus on publishing games by outside studios, rather than developing their own. It looks like the full effects of that decision are now being felt. </p>
<p>If you haven't seen it yet, Reignbreaker is a very purple and black action roguelike about bringing down a tyrannical queen with plenty of spear chuckin' and upgrade choosin'. When James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reignbreaker-is-an-anti-establishment-roguelike-thats-clearly-pro-hades">played its monarch-toppling chaingunnery</a> he noted "flashy isometric fights" and "pausing for a chat with some charismatic, lovingly hand-drawn, likely flirty side character." Sound familiar? James thought so too. "It’s so very, very Hades," he said. </p>
<p>As for the theme, it's a response to the "rise in right-wing authoritarianism all around the world, the growing class divide and exploitation", according to community manager Ian Stewart. If any of that sounds intriguing, you can play the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129810/Reignbreaker/">demo on Steam</a> yourself. The game is due to release on March 18th.</p>
<p>Before this Studio Fizbin made a bunch of games that have been well-liked by RPS staff, such as point and click adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-inner-world">The Inner World</a>, hand-drawn puzzle platformer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minute-of-islands">Minute Of Islands</a>, and the comedy anti-capitalist refuse 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/say-no-more">Say No! More</a> which Alice B (RPS in peace) called "short but immensely satisfying". Here's a snippet of her thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>It casts universal capitulation as a global, systemic problem, and, at the same time, being realistic and setting boundaries as a path to everyone being healthy and happy. But not in a preachy way. In an absurd way.</blockquote>
<p>Fizbin will spend their remaining time as a studio working to ship the game, says Pieper, as well as providing some post-launch support to Reignbreaker, and supporting workers in finding new work. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>All eyes are locked on Assassin’s Creed Shadows and its forthcoming review embargo date. This is one of the most important Assassin’s Creed releases ever, and the critical reception could have a huge bearing on the game’s success.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> releases in the middle of a crowded March 2025. It needs to fight off the popularity of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-hazelight-studios-next-game-it-takes-two-sequel-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios</a> and its new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> release, and combat the physical forces of 2K’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>. Ubisoft has enough without worrying about other new titles.</p>



<p>Shadows is reportedly not getting delayed again and will release in March. An abundance of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-releases-statement-on-assassins-creed-shadows-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadows leaks</a> has already shown many people the game and what it has in store. But for everyone else, the Assassin’s Creed Shadows review embargo is crucial.</p>

<figure><figcaption>The date is crawling up to us. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows Review Embargo Date is reportedly set for March 18—two days before the game’s official release date.</strong></p>



<p>In an exclusive Insider Gaming report, we revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft is confident about Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ March 20, 2025, release date</a>. Our sources have also indicated “<strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows reviews will be live on March 18, 2025.</strong>“</p>



<p>It’s fairly standard for review embargos to go live between two and five days before launch. It’s more concerning when a review embargo date is the day of the game or after launch. This is usually an indicator the developer and/or publisher isn’t happy with the product and therefore leaves the embargo until after players have bought the game.</p>



<p>Ubisoft looks to be assured, and we should be getting <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> 48 hours before launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-review-embargo">What is a Review Embargo?</h2>



<p><strong>A review embargo is the earliest point where a publication can release its final review.</strong></p>



<p>In this case, the Assassin’s Creed Shadows review embargo is set by Ubisoft. Reviews can’t be posted before this embargo, and any that are likely need to be taken down and can cause complications between parties.</p>



<p>Review embargos have become a focal point of game launches in modern times. Players are eager to see, hear, and read reviews before they invest in a game. With Ubisoft’s mixed history with game launches—particularly Assassin’s Creed (look at AC Unity)—the early reception to Shadows could be make or break.</p>



<hr>



<p>If our information turns out to be incorrect, we will be sure to update this article. For now, you can start counting down the days until the Assassin’s Creed Shadows review embargo lifts. What scores will the RPG get? What average score will be enough for you to commit to a purchase? </p>

            <p>
Nintendo has trumpeted its latest legal success in the company's ongoing fight against pirated games as "significant" not only for itself, "but for the entire games industry".
</p>
<p>
The Mario maker today confirmed it had won a final victory over French file-sharing company Dstorage, which operates the website 1fichier.com, following years of legal wrangling and repeated appeals.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's victory means European file-sharing companies must now remove illegal copies of games when asked to do so, or be held accountable and cough up potentially sizable fines as punishment.
</p>
<p>
In 2021, the Judicial Court of Paris ordered Dstorage pay Nintendo €935k (£773k) in damages after it was found to be hosting pirate games. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-wins-case-against-french-filesharing-service-hosting-pirated-games">Dstorage launched an appeal, which then failed in 2023, and was ordered to pay Nintendo further costs</a>. But the case didn't end there. 
</p>
<p>
Dstorage finally took the matter to the highest French judiciary court, where it argued that a specific court order was required before it needed to remove content from its hosting services. This bid has also now failed, ending the long-running matter for good.
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo is pleased with the court's finding of liability against Dstorage," reads a statement from the Mario maker shared with Eurogamer this morning. 
</p>
<p>
"Together with its recent decision of 15th January 2025, confirming that a major French Bank had rightfully terminated a payment processing agreement with 1fichier.com due to lacking anti-piracy measures, the French Supreme Court leaves no doubt that sharehosting providers like 1fichier.com are not a safe haven for storing and sharing illegal content.
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo promotes and fosters development and creativity, and strongly supports developers who legitimately create new and innovative software. Nintendo's message to consumers is not to download pirate copies of Nintendo games as this increases the risk that this will interfere with the functionality and experience that playing legitimate Nintendo games on authentic Nintendo hardware provides."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's campaign against game piracy has regularly hit the headlines over the past year, perhaps most notably with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">the shutdown of Switch emulator Yuzu - whose creator agreed to pay Nintendo $2.4m</a> (£1.89m). 
</p>
<p>
Last summer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-war-against-switch-piracy-ramps-up-with-two-fresh-cases">Nintendo tracked down the moderator behind the infamous SwitchPirates reddit</a> and claimed the individual ran "several pirate shops" that sold "massive libraries of pirated Nintendo Switch games". Nintendo is seeking damages in the millions of dollars.
</p>
<p>
In November 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-streamer-who-said-he-could-broadcast-its-pirated-games-all-day">Nintendo filed a lawsuit against a streamer who regularly played pirated copies of Nintendo games ahead of release</a>, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>. The streamer had previously boasted he "could do all this all day" as he had "1000 burner accounts".

			<p>The Suikoden series revival will not stop with the HD remasters of the first two entries in the series launching this week, as revealed during a livestream that aired a few hours ago.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://youtu.be/TIjGwGAJJ4s?si=sIKc_fHQknKkO5CO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live broadcast</a>, Konami confirmed that the series will continue with a new mobile game called Suikoden STAR LEAP. Set between the fifth and first entry in the series, the game will feature a story that is part of the canon of the series, beautiful 2D graphics inspired by the first two entries in the series, returning characters like Viktor, Flik, and Odessa, many of the gameplay features that define the series, such as the ability to recruit 108 characters and more. While it will be a gacha game, it has been confirmed that the 108 Stars of Destiny can all be obtained without pulls, and only legacy characters will be obtainable with the typical gacha mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Suikoden STAR LEAP | Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WKOZqkjPcWk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Suikoden STAR LEAP will offer fans of the series the chance to experience a new story set in the series' universe, the aforementioned animated show, on the other hand, is clearly meant to expand the series' reach beyond its existing fanbase. In the works by Konami's animation studio and NBC Universal Entertainment Japan, the animated show will introduce new fans to the deep lore of Suikoden II. Hopefully, it will not shy away from showing some of the original game's most chilling sequences, which all involve one of the game's main villains, the iconic Luca Blight.</p>
<p>The Suikoden Live livestream also featured new information on merchandise, which will mostly be released only in Japan, orchestral performances of the series' iconic music, and more. You can check the full livestream below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Suikoden Live Broadcast | KONAMI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIjGwGAJJ4s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This week is going to be a great one for fans of the series, as the Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remasters: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars finally launch on PCs and consoles worldwide on <a href="https://wccftech.com/suidkoen-i-ii-remaster-release-date/">March 6th</a>. The collection includes the first two entries in the series, complete with plenty of enhancements, including visual improvements and new quality-of-life features.</p>

Capcom has released details of today's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> patch, which fixes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-progress-breaking-npc-bug">the game's progression-blocking bug in the main mission Chapter 5-2 "A World Turned Upside Down"</a>.
</p>
<p>
The update, numbered as version 1.000.04.00, is available to download now on all platforms. You must download the patch to continue playing online, and restart the game to make sure it is applied.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a list of fixes, Capcom also warns of several other issues it is currently aware of, but is yet to resolve. This includes an issue where a network error occurs after someone fires an SOS flare right after a quest begins - so, for now, don't do that.

			<p>We’ve all heard of Pokémon cards. The Pokémon TCG, as it’s officially called, is a longstanding and much-loved trading card game that dates back to my childhood. I spent many hours battling and trading with my school friends, despite teachers quickly deciding they were contraband and enlisting the dinner ladies who patrolled the playground, cruelly trying to part me from my foil Gyarados.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve dabbled with the TCG, trying the different digital offerings that the company puts out. The latest such release is Pokémon TCG Pocket — a stripped-down version of the game available on Apple and Android phones. The question is, is it any good, or is it just another way to part you from your money?</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon TCG Pocket: Triumphant Light | Coming February 28!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/urmBeWH0bxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The basic idea of Pocket TCG is that you can open two packs of five Pokémon cards per day for free — or more if you spend money. You slowly build a pool of cards from which you can build decks to battle real or digital opponents, getting XP and completing collection missions along the way.</p>
<p>The battle rules have been simplified, too. You have a 20-card deck instead of 60, while Energy is now automatically generated once per turn, helping keep your deck as slim and streamlined as possible. Finally, you only need to defeat up to three rival Pokémon to secure victory, instead of the usual six.</p>

<p>So far, so good —&nbsp;it’s a Pokémon card gatcha machine that you can play for free, or dump money into if you want to quickly pad out your collection. But is it worth trying to play free-to-play?</p>

<p>I’ve been playing the game since launch, well aware that games like this ultimately come in two flavours: one all flash with no depth. It tastes amazing and the additives get their hooks in you. But what burns hottest burns quickest, and you can’t have too much of it without getting bored.</p>
<p>The second flavour is the tried and tested favourite that you will keep coming back to. There’s less intensity, but a depth and complexity that is actually compelling. It’s the kind of thing you’ll keep coming back to, enjoying it just as much every time you do.</p>
<p>I’m happy to report, after a few months with the game, that playing Pokémon TCG Pocket is like eating a premium scoop of mint choc chip ice cream. Whenever it feels that it’s getting samey, you get a nice chunk of something new and exciting to keep you going.</p>
<p>As with all card games, batches are released in sets and expansions. The first set in the game, Genetic Apex, was split between three different packs for Charizard, Pikachu and Mewtwo respectively, while Space-Time Smackdown added Dialga and Palkia in January. Each has a unique card pool, which means you need to swap back and forth to collect ‘em all.</p>

<p>Every 12 hours, you can open one pack of cards for free. While you may not always get the card you want, you might open a signature card that unlocks a ‘rental’ deck that you can play for free 10 times. Collect three linked Pokémon, say the three Legendary Birds or the same Gardevoir five times, and you’ll win Emblems, Avatars, Shop Tickets and Wonder Hourglasses — the latter of which can net you free cards by Wonder Picking from someone else’s pack.</p>
<p>With enough cards (or a rental deck), you can battle the game’s AI or other real players, winning Pack Hourglasses that will reduce the time needed to open the next new pack of five cards.</p>

<p>The problem is that there are some obvious best decks in the meta — as per all TCGs. However, there’s no guarantee that you will open that Gardevoir for your Mewtwo EX deck, or get the Moltres EX for your Charizard EX deck. This means opening more packs, either relying on dumb luck or saving up Pack Points earned with each opening to try to ‘buy’ the single you need. At 5 points per pack, and 2500 points for the fanciest stuff, you’re going to be opening a lot of packs if you genuinely want to collect ‘em all.</p>
<p>And then there’s the ill-fated trading mechanic — it was so bad that fans at launch demanded the game takes the ‘T’ out of its name.</p>
<p>So, as you can imagine, you could burn money on this game. However, this isn’t at all necessary, and the game is fun to dip in and out of a couple of times per day, even without owning all the most powerful cards.</p>

<p>After downloading the game on a whim, curious to see what the latest offering from the Pokémon TCG looks like, I am pleasantly surprised and still engaged with this game. After an initial flash of excitement with Genetic Apex, this has settled to a slow burn. I still enjoy opening the app a couple of times per day and seeing what I open. If I have 10 minutes to spare, a quick battle against the AI is still fun.</p>
<p>The game clearly wants your money, but it doesn’t hound you for it, and it’s perfectly playable without spending a penny. It won’t keep your attention for hours on end, and that’s fine. As far as slow games go, Pocket TCG is very good. I’m just thankful this doesn’t exist for Magic the Gathering, as I’d be far more ready to part with my money…</p>

            <p>There comes a time in every cat owner's life where they must ask themselves: how large would this creature need to be before it attempted to bat me around like a catnip mouse? I suspect the answer is "only as large as it needed to be", so it's fortunate that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' Palicoes are apparently bred for helpfulness. Is installing a mod to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> that makes them tall as humans a form of gene splicing? Don't worry, hunter. Gene splicing is how nature heals itself.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/35">The mod is called 'Kitty Big'. </a>There isn't much to say about it beyond that. You don't need to continue reading now, so here's a little story for anyone left.</p>
<p>Once, a peaceful and prosperous hamlet was terrorised by a beast that demanded regular sacrifices, lest it drag its lumpen form down from its mountain dwelling and drain the lifeblood from the villagers.</p>
<p>Not just any sacrifice would appease its capricious tastes, however. Some days, it demanded the flesh of storied warriors. Others, humble farm hands. Occasionally, it wanted those little cocktail sticks with pineapple and cheese on, which was bollocks because where do you even find pineapples in this climate?</p>
<p>One day, the people of the hamlet decided they'd had enough of catering to the beast's whims, especially since the one thing the creature was useful for - dispersing snippets of wisdom in response to specific queries and occasionally reverse image searching a nice shirt you didn't know where to buy - had recently been borked by a colony of parasites taken up residence in the monster's brain stem. So they refused to make any more sacrifices. And they all got eaten.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is that sometimes you just have to give Google what it wants. Today, that's the words '<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' followed by whatever mildly interesting nugget of disposable information I can dig up between my first and second morning coffee. Nice mod, though. I'll probably use it once I buy the game, which won't be until <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">they've sorted out the performance</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Split Fiction is an intertwining narrative from the creative mind of Josef Fares. It requires you to guide two unique characters from start to finish, but we’re here to see if you can only play the game in co-op or if solo play is permitted.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a> is firmly behind us now. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-hazelight-studios-next-game-it-takes-two-sequel-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios has a new game called Split Fiction</a>. We’ve been treated to periodic trailers and footage since its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal at The Game Awards 2024</a>. Anyone familiar with It Takes Two or A Way Out should instantly feel at home with Split Fiction.</p>



<p>It has tons of mini-games and tandem gameplay sections, and requires teamwork to succeed. Many co-op games allow you to play with an AI partner, so let’s see if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> is the same.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-split-fiction-be-played-solo">Can Split Fiction be Played Solo?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A co-op boom is happening. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><strong>Split Fiction cannot be played solo and is a co-op title requiring a human companion.</strong></strong></p>



<p>This is how Josef Fares wants his games to be experienced. It Takes Two was such an emotional gut punch as you felt every story twist alongside a real player. A Way Out was the same, and Split Fiction continues this thematic direction by requiring two real-life players—not AI.</p>



<p>If you don’t believe me, check out the official <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/ea-originals-discussion-en/announcement--faq-split-fiction%E2%84%A2---launching-march-6-2025---pre-order-now/5037251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction FAQ</a>. Under the “Is it possible to play with an AI?” question, the answer states: “<strong>No, this is a co-op-only game uniquely tailored for two friends to play together.</strong>“</p>



<h2 id="h-will-split-fiction-add-solo-play-to-split-fiction">Will Split Fiction Add Solo Play to Split Fiction?</h2>



<p><strong>I think the chances of Split Fiction adding a solo option through a patch are slim-to-none.</strong></p>



<p>Again, Hazelight Studios’ previous work—A Way Out and It Takes Two—didn’t add this option. Given the official stance on solo play, it feels unlikely to be added in Split Fiction either. If you’re a fan of Fares and Hazelight games and want a solo-driven journey, all is not lost.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/02/13/josef-fares-split-fiction-interview-we-will-not-co-op-22554563/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>, Fares said: “We will not only do co-op, we will definitely do other stuff with a Haze-like twist. We want to do something different like a twist… like what we did with the co-op. But co-op is great and, I mean, you can tell great stories and there’s so much to be explored there.”</p>



<p>Who knows where the studio goes once Split Fiction is wrapped up and in the history books.</p>



<hr>



<p>It Takes Two was a bona fide Game of the Year winner. It’s going to take a lot for Split Fiction to replicate its success, but it’s not impossible. Are you picking up Split Fiction as quick as a flash?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-season-delayed-verdansk-return-now-expected-next-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Activision has delayed the rollout of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone Season 3, including the anticipated return of the latter's classic Verdansk map. 
</p>
<p>
Season 3 was previously due to arrive around 20th March. Now, it'll hit two weeks later on 3rd April.
</p>
<p>
"Season 3 is a big moment for Call of Duty: Warzone and Black Ops 6, and we're taking the time to deliver a great experience starting on 3rd April," Activision wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1896636715143704641">post on social media</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"More to come following Call of Duty: Warzone's fifth anniversary next week..."
</p>
<p>
Verdansk was Call of Duty: Warzone's original map, available when the battle royale's first iteration arrived back in 2020. Now, it's widely-expected to return in time for the game's fifth anniversary.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty is the latest battle royale to lean on nostalgia and bring back a classic map in the hopes of boosting player numbers, following the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.
</p>
<p>
The move to return to a fan-favourite map follows a patchy start to this year's Call of Duty content, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-bans-another-136000-cheaters">Activision having to focus time to address player concerns over rampant in-game cheating</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-block-ops-6-players-accuse-activision-of-using-ai-slop">admitting to the use of in-game AI imagery</a>, and selling a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-players-lament-battle-passes-in-between-battle-passes-with-squid-game-event">separate expensive Squid Game battle pass</a>
</p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>

"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk," our Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 review</a>.
