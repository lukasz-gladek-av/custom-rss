Coldplay frontman Chris Martin remarked that the couple was either “having an affair or they’re just very shy,” but the internet did what it does best and found out who they were, and the entire thing has played out very publicly and invasively. And now that the footage has been seen by millions, it’s being parodied at sporting events that have a kiss cam.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Footage from several sporting events has been showing up online in the days since the Coldplay show, with some venues rebranding their kiss cam as the “Coldplay Cam.” Normally, these crowd shots displayed on a huge screen give couples a chance to express their love for one another for all to see. Sometimes, there are awkward misunderstandings where the folks behind the camera capture siblings or friends, and they have to flail about so everyone knows they’re not a couple. But right now, all anyone seems to want to do is run away from the camera to reference the now-infamous scene. Some venues are even encouraging it, searching for couples who are embracing the same way the caught couple was at Coldplay’s show. One of the funnier examples was when the Phillie Phanatics’ mascots unexpectedly re-enacted the whole thing shot for shot.</p><p>The whole situation has split the internet.

                <p>After a three-year silence, a developer behind the ambitious Fallout: Bakersfield has revealed a new trailer for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-1993/" data-ref-id="5000-815">Doom</a> total conversion mod that transforms id's shooter into the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout/" data-ref-id="5000-929">Fallout</a>, and it almost looks too good to be true.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Alexander "Red888guns" Berezin is one of the leading developers behind the project. The mod looks to recreate Fallout 1's Ghoul city of Necropolis as a FPS campaign using GZDoom, a modified version of Doom that supports modern features like dynamic lighting, high resolution textures, better rendering, and more not possible in id's original game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e8WrmOibpM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6e8WrmOibpM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It's immediately clear that Berezin knows the look and feel of the first two Fallout games inside and out, as the new four-minute Fallout: Bakersfield trailer perfectly captures not only the visual style and aesthetic but also the tone of original Fallout games.</p><p dir="ltr">Better yet, the trailer shows how Berezin has blended the iconography of Doom and Fallout seamlessly together, with a UI that is immediately reminiscent of Doom (complete with a guy's face in a little box in the middle of the screen) but brilliantly melded with the Pip-Boy aesthetics of Fallout. There's even a neon green text box in the left corner of the screen that displays environmental information and damage dealt, just like in the original Fallout.</p><p dir="ltr">The mod is a non-commercial project and will be playable for free, though it might still be a while before players can get their hands on it. The end of the trailer reveals various stats about the project and estimates it to be around 60% complete. A release date shown in the trailer flickers with various question marks that slowly transform into a year. While at first it looks like the year "2027" will be displayed, it quickly swaps back to a question mark, perhaps implying that Fallout: Bakersfield's release date is still in flux.</p><p dir="ltr">While the wait for Fallout: Bakersfield might be a long one, the wait for official new Fallout games may be longer. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-is-now-reportedly-fully-greenlit/1100-6533153/" data-ref-id="1100-6533153">Fallout 5 was reported to have been recently greenlit</a> but is likely still many years away.

                <p>2023's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is still getting new updates, and the next one is a big one.

		<p>Ubisoft has announced that the next update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> will bring a third-person update, New Game + and more to the otherworldly action game when it arrives on… 5th December 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - 3rd-Person Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bej3ockJuIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Yes, that’s right, Ubisoft has announced a patch and given it a firm launch date four and a half months ahead of time. I’m not really complaining about this, and it’s great to know that there’s more updates and content coming to this game, but it’s a bit odd to be so specific so far in advance. The reason is that this forthcoming update will arrive shortly before the release of Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third film in James Cameron’s blue person film franchise.</p>
<p>The third-person mode is seeing Massive Entertainment completely overhauling character animations, tweaking controls and audio, and the camera to adapt the game from first person to third person, in a shift that’s not too dissimilar to the work needed for Capcom’s third-person mode for Resident Evil Village.</p>
<p>Beyond that, a New Game+ mode will be added, letting you replay the story and keep inventory and skills, while facing tougher enemies. It’s standard stuff.</p>

<p>“We’ve always envisioned Avatar Frontiers of Pandora as a living world that evolves with our players,” said Omar Bouali, Creative Director at Massive Entertainment. “This update is a celebration of our community’s passion and we’re thankful to our players for their support—it means the world to our team.”</p>
<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora has been well-supported by Ubisoft, with two story packs – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/10/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-the-sky-breaker-dlc-launches-in-july/">The Sky Breaker</a> and Secrets of the Spires – being released alongside quality of life updates that added <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/24/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-gets-40-fps-performance-mode-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/">a 40FPS mode</a>, rebalanced combat and more.</p>
<p>We loved Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora when it launched late last year. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/19/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review/">our review</a>, Dom said, “Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is an astonishing achievement, with exquisite visuals and a remarkable balance between pacifism and action. This is an enthralling alien world that plays host to a unique FPS.”</p>

			<p>Rematch has surpassed 5 million unique players across all platforms, developer Sloclap announced. It's a strong milestone for the game, just one month after launch, even with it missing key features like crossplay support, which it will continue to miss for another 6-9 weeks, according to Sloclap.</p>



<p>Sloclap announced the milestone with a <a href="https://x.com/sloclap/status/1947325700681159130">post on its official account on X</a>, where it thanked players for the support and reiterated its commitment to "<em>make Rematch better</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Like any live game, that process is going to take time, but it's perhaps taking longer than players would have expected, with crossplay support being the hot-button topic, due in part to how Sloclap handled the lack of crossplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">Hours before it was set to launch</a>, Sloclap let players know that Rematch would be launching without crossplay. Sloclap had tried to prepare it for launch but decided far too late to let players know that it wasn't going to happen. Later, Sloclap apologized for the error, as Rematch also launched with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-pushes-hotfix-for-rematch-network-stability-issues-as-rematch-hits-1-million-unique-players-in-first-24hrs/">bevy of bugs and matchmaking issues</a> that it was focused on fixing, but made sure to emphasize that crossplay functionality was at the top of its priority list.</p>



<p>In the studio's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138720/view/534356176690741599?l=english">latest developer update</a>, Sloclap went over a number of features it is working on based on player feedback, while also apologizing for the problems some players continue to face, even as the game is in a much better state than it was a month ago.</p>



<p>In the short-term future, Rematch is getting a patch sometime this week that will enable players to remap controls while playing with a controller, add colorblindness options as an accessibility update, and fix a number of bugs. There's also netcode fixes to come, though there's no exact timeline as to when all these updates will arrive. Best to keep an eye on the game's social accounts if you want to know exactly when everything goes live.</p>



<p>New ranked queues, improvements to keyboard and mouse controls, the ability to report toxic players, regional server fixes, and overall upgrades to matchmaking and its ranking system are also all under review from Sloclap as it continues to work on Rematch. It doesn't seem like there's a specific timeline for any of this, but some of the issues players are reporting, such as complaints about the structure of the current ranking system, take time and experimentation to be fixed, and even then, it still won't please everyone.</p>



<p>Needless to say, while it's great for Sloclap that Rematch has had such a strong launch month, with more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-suprasses-1-million-units-sold-and-3-million-unique-players/">1 million copies sold</a> and now more than 5 million players having checked out the game with more than 60 million hours played across the globe, that will all be for nothing if it can't stay on top of its issues. </p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">I reviewed Rematch for Wccftech</a>, it was clear to me that the gameplay was very tight and highly polished, something that didn't really come as a huge surprise from the team that made such a solid melee fighter in Sifu. But its technical issues and structural issues beyond what happens on the pitch are what bring it down. I've still been playing a game of Rematch every day or so, but it would be nice to have a gameplay session where I don't lose a game because my tackle didn't register and the opposing team was able to score. Or one where we didn't have to scramble to protect our net because suddenly the keeper couldn't pick up the ball.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll start to see these fixes come in soon, and for the sake of the player base and matchmaking, crossplay will arrive closer to that six-week mark than nine weeks. </p>

Ravening hordes of inhuman creatures biding their time, plotting the downfall of every ordered kingdom, salivating in anticipation of the bountiful slaughter soon to come.&nbsp;In this dark and bloody age, bold deeds and great courage are called for.</p>

<p>You have chosen to take up a hopeless fight, to stand when the coward would flee and the wise would kneel. You must oppose the swelling tide of strife and war, of flame and fury, or be smothered by it. Let others wallow in their false peace, let them hate you trying to drag them from it. For if you are skilled and lucky, if you choose worthy allies, take up stalwart arms or master perilous magics, you may even live to see your grim work done. Welcome to <em>The Old World RPG</em>, and your journey starts with the&nbsp;<a href="https://cubicle7games.com/warhammer-the-old-world?utm_campaign=Reviewer+&amp;utm_content=+&amp;utm_id=The+Old+World&amp;utm_medium=Reviewer+&amp;utm_source=Reviewers+" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> Player's Guide</a>.</p>

<p>This is the first release planned for the <em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em>, but we have covered several of Cubicle 7's other <em>Warhammer</em> RPGs in the past, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Starter Set</a>, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Age of Sigmar Soulbound Starter Set</a>.</p>




<h2>The Older World</h2>

<p>For those new to the setting, it's worth noting the differences between the various Cubicle 7 fantasy <em>Warhammer</em> RPGs, for which there are now 3. <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar Soulbound</em>&nbsp;is set in the latest edition of <em>Warhammer, Age of Sigmar, </em>or<em> AoS </em>for short, the current setting of Games Workshop's fantasy wargame. Here things are slightly different from the original <em>Warhammer</em>, and the narrative has moved on, and some race names have changed (along with some new races added, and some races removed).</p>

<p><em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em>, <em>WFRP</em> for short, is set in the original <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy setting, which no longer has an active wargame supported by Games Workshop. <em>The Old World</em>&nbsp;is set 300 years before the original <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> setting, prior to the rise to power of some races. This makes it a prequel setting for <em>Warhammer</em>, like the <em>Horus Heresy</em> is to <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. Both the <em>Horus Heresy</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-old-world-review-hit-refresh" rel="nofollow">The Old World</a> have wargames currently produced by Games Workshop, and Cubicle 7 has announced an upcoming RPG set in the <em>Horus Heresy</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-roleplaying-game-players-guide-2.jpg?itok=R580YYC5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-roleplaying-game-players-guide-2.jpg?itok=3OvsCLUo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Credit:&nbsp;<em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> Player's Guide.</figcaption></figure><h2>Adventurous Beginnings</h2>

<p>The <em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> Player's Guide provides players with the background for life in the Old World, with a focus on the Empire, and in particular, Talabecland, and within it, the town of Talagaad, which is the core setting for the initial <em>Old World</em> products. It details the other provinces of the empire, and the lands beyond, as well as a large section on religion and magic, but the core focus is character creation and the rules, and if it's going to be anything like <em>Soulbound</em> or <em>WFRP,</em> there will be plenty of supplements detailing the various areas of the Old World.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> uses a D10 system, which is entirely different from the D6 system that <em>Soulbound </em>and<em> Wrath and Glory</em> use, or the D100 percentile system that <em>Imperium Maledictum </em>and<em> WFRP</em> use. In<em> The Old World RPG,&nbsp;</em>players&nbsp;roll a number of 10-sided dice (D10) equal to their characteristic, like weapon skill, reason, strength, etc. Each score that rolls under their skill number is a success. So if you had a melee skill of 5 and a weapon skill characteristic of 3, you would roll 3 dice, and each score of 5 or less would be a success.</p>

<p>What I like most about the system is that there's a load of Lore skills that your character can take, and each can provide bonuses to tests if the lore can be leveraged. This can be as simple as knowledge of a city when making an athletics or a stealth test. You can use your knowledge of the city to your advantage when trying to outrun or sneak up on an opponent. Some skills are also dependent on lore. The use of blackpowder weapons is one example, where you need the lore skill to use the physical skill.</p>

<p>Tests are modified by adding or removing dice. If a fellow player uses their action to help you, for each success on their roll, you get an additional dice, or if you're firing a bow at someone who's in cover, you'll lose dice from your roll. Tests can also be grim or glorious, depending on whether the dark gods are working against you or if the odds are substantially in your favor. For glorious rolls, you can reroll all your failed rolls in your test, and if the test is grim, you have to reroll all of your successes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-roleplaying-game-players-guide-3.jpg?itok=ke3OhbzX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-roleplaying-game-players-guide-3.jpg?itok=u9rqS8Fg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Credit:&nbsp;<em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> Player's Guide.</figcaption></figure><h2>Old World Optionality</h2>

<p><i>The Old World RPG </i>character creation has a lot of options for variety in the player's guide. You can play 1 of 6 races, a human, from either the Empire or Bretonnia, a dwarf, a halfling, or a Wood or High Elf. There are then 30 careers to choose from, some of which are locked to races. Only Wood Elves can be Waywatchers, only Empire Humans can be Priests, and only Dwarves can be Brewguards, for example.</p>

<p>You can then add further detail to your character with 59 available talents. Some of these have prerequisites, like race, characteristics, or other talents. These are initially gained during character creation by rolling on a table associated with your chosen race, but they can also be bought with experience points at the final stages of character creation or during play.</p>

<p>Status also plays a huge part in the game, and each class has a tier associated with it, Brass, Silver, or Gold. This tier details your starting equipment options and assets, how much money you have to spend during game sessions, and also how other characters will interact with you. Brass NPCs may respect or fear a Gold character, but they will struggle to blend in, just as Brass characters will find Gold settings awkward.</p>

<p>Your life beyond the adventure is also featured in games, and every few sessions, players take part in endeavors, such as learning skills and spells, resting, or wandering the wilds. If you test a skill during an endeavor, each failed roll is marked on your character sheet, and when those marks are higher than your skill, your skill goes up and the marks are removed. Experience points are also gained during play, and these can be used to gain talents or increase skills, but I like the endeavor system for grounding characters and showing what their lives are like between their glorious adventures.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-roleplaying-game-players-guide-4.jpg?itok=E0BXqjzz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-roleplaying-game-players-guide-4.jpg?itok=e-tNQuDV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Credit:&nbsp;<em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> Superbacker Bundle on the <a href="https://cubicle7games.com/warhammer-the-old-world?utm_campaign=Reviewer+&amp;utm_content=+&amp;utm_id=The+Old+World&amp;utm_medium=Reviewer+&amp;utm_source=Reviewers+" rel="nofollow">Cubicle 7 website</a>.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Future Of The Old World</h2>

<p>The <em>Old World RPG</em> Player's Guide is entirely aimed at the players of the game. To play the game, you will also need a Gamemaster, who will run the game, and they need the Gamemaster's Guide, which details how sessions work and provides a whole host of details on the setting and rules, and stats for NPC adversaries and monsters.</p>

<p>A big part of creating a group of characters is how they are all connected, and a Grim Portent session shows how they are and what they are facing. It's mentioned in the Player's Guide, but the Gamemaster's Guide shows how to run this session and how to tie it in to your campaign.</p>

<p>Cubicle 7 has a whole host of releases planned for the initial wave of <a href="https://cubicle7games.com/warhammer-the-old-world?utm_campaign=Reviewer+&amp;utm_content=+&amp;utm_id=The+Old+World&amp;utm_medium=Reviewer+&amp;utm_source=Reviewers+" rel="nofollow">Warhammer The Old World RPG</a> physical products. Anyone purchasing the Player's Guide now will get access to the PDF, and those purchasing the Gamemaster's Guide will get a digital copy later this month. Other physical products planned for a Q1 2026 release include character sheets, maps of the Grand Duchy of Talabec, where the initial releases are planned, and several reference card packs to save you looking through the rulebooks mid-action in-game. There are also several bundles available, including a Collector's Edition for those who want to go all in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I am a long-time fan of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-games-in-order">Capcom’s Street Fighter series</a>, having hurled my first Hadouken all the way back on the Super Nintendo with Street Fighter 2 Turbo, and have loved the fighters ever since. These days, folks are mostly playing Street Fighter 6, but I've been dabbling back with its predecessor. Instead of pressing buttons and inputting directions on my controller’s D-pad, I've been playing cards and rolling dice with Kess Entertainment’s Street Fighter V: Champion Edition - Legends board game. While I may have had a fine enough time with it, it always felt more in line with another of Capcom’s series than it did with the one-on-one brawler that is Street Fighter.</p><div catalogid="a80f3b24-ffb1-474a-905c-86621260cdbb" id="225553"><div id="225553" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Street Fighter V: Champion Edition - Legends Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Street Fighter V Legends is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a> in which one to four players work together to take down one of the heads of the evil Shadaloo organization, led by the evil M. Bison. Among them are Bison himself, Balrog, Vega, and Sagat. Each player selects a character to play as from the roster of the original eight world warriors: Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Guile, Dhalsim, Blanka, E. Honda, or Zangief, with each character bringing their unique attacks that fans of the video games will instantly recognize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With your character selected, you then get to choose a deck of cards that represents your fighting style – one of my favorite aspects of the game. In Street Fighter, the actions you can take on your turn are based on cards that you draw and play from these respective decks of cards, with each deck tailored to different strategies and named after common terms in the fighting game communities that have built up around the video games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take, for instance, the “Shoto” deck, which has more projectile cards, as though you are spamming Ryu or Ken’s Hadoukens. Or there's the Rushdown deck, which is more about maneuvering around opponents and hitting them hard with attacks like the Cross Up.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>With your character selected, you then choose a deck of cards that represents your fighting style – one of my favorite aspects of the game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On each turn, players place down and activate two of these cards from their hands, rolling dice to dish out damage, and with each card adding various resources to their available pool, which can then be spent to use their character’s special abilities. These resources include punches, kicks, and my personal favorite, joysticks. The six included decks offer some sense of asymmetry to how a character can play. I wish this was pushed a little farther to highlight further the different playstyles used in competitions, but their inclusion is still a neat easter egg that I appreciate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games of Street Fighter V take place in one of four possible stages that you build from poster-board tiles that come with the game. Each stage has some unique rules that go with it, as well. It would be too easy if the big bad were out from the get-go for you and your friends to take out. Instead, you need to prove yourself first and get strong by taking out various minions that spawn on the board, or fighting your rival (an AI-controlled Street Fighter character assigned to each player at the start of the game). Taking out these enemies earns you EX bars that can be used to upgrade your character's abilities, putting you in a better spot for when the Nemesis boss character appears.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bison, Balrog, Sagat, and Vega – the Nemesis characters – each have their own set of abilities that are triggered depending on what is pulled from the Nemesis deck, which also determines where new minions spawn. Once you and your team manage to deal enough damage to knock out the nemesis, you win – but if even one of your team is taken out, then it’s game over. The general flow of the game is pretty simple, and by the second or third turn through, everyone I played with had a good grasp on how the game worked, and things went pretty quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving my character around, hurling fireballs, and beating up minions was fun, which caused my friends and me to, on more than one occasion, yell out the signature moves as we performed them. The lack of enemy variety is a bit of a bummer, with only three minion factions to pick from, each with only two options. That means you will quickly run out of new enemies to fight against, made worse by the fact that each game only has you go up against one of the three factions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maps aren’t overly large, which is nice. It's never a hassle to get to the various objectives or wherever you want to go, and the additional few “Hard” Nemesis cards you can mix into the deck do increase the challenge, but I wouldn’t turn down more offerings or tweaks to increase the difficulty or complexity of the game. If you are just looking for a game to beat up thugs with your friends, Street Fighter is fine enough now and then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have played a good number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">board game adaptations of popular video games</a>, from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-the-board-game-series-buying-guide">Resident Evil</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/slay-the-spire-the-board-game-review">Slay the Spire</a>, and even ones like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/guilty-gear-strive-the-board-game-review">Guilty Gear Strive</a> that are also based on a fighting game. But Street Fighter V: Champion Edition - Legends feels the most disjointed and confused as to what it wants to be. Looking at just the gameplay, the concept of running around with your friends, taking out small minions before tackling the stage’s boss is far more in line with, say, Capcom’s Final Fight series of beat-’em-ups. A series, mind you, whose characters have made the jump into Street Fighter previously, such as the ninja Guy. But Street Fighter has always been about duking it out with your friend in a 1v1 fight, and by making this a strictly cooperative game, both of those core components of the game are missing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This disparity includes even those little easter eggs that I mentioned, like the various fight style decks and joystick resource on the cards. These little nods will be appreciated most by members of the fighting game community and glossed over by others who would appreciate this game more for what it is, rather than the package we got that honestly feels like it simply got the Street Fighter V property slapped on top of a different game and called it a day.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aebXZJ?object_uuid=e6b11ccc-d482-4874-8957-ed51a6171fe8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z62n6q?object_uuid=e6b11ccc-d482-4874-8957-ed51a6171fe8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 21, 2025 5:22 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Playing Street Fighter is a fun and fairly straightforward affair that I found worked well as a palate cleanser between the bigger games of the evening during a game night. This is a fun game to enjoy with friends when you want to work together, beating up some thugs, but as a Street Fighter game, I found it to be subpar and missing many of the fundamentals of the franchise. This is particularly disappointing considering that Street Fighter IV has a wonderful adaptation thanks to the use of the Exceed Fighting System (which is also used by the Guilty Gear Strive board game). Street Fighter V: Champion Edition - Legends is okay. It’s a game I would be fine to play, but not one I see myself actively reaching for on my shelf or suggesting for game night. If one of my friends is interested and wants to give it a try, I’ll happily teach them and play, but that’s about as far as my interest extends.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-v-champion-edition-legends-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The Chinese Room, the celebrated UK developer behind Dear Esther, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/08/12/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review/">Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/17/still-wakes-the-deep-review/">Still Wakes The Deep</a>, has regained its independence after a management buyout from Sumo Digital.</p>
<p>The studio is currently at work on concluding development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/26/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-will-now-launch-in-october-2025/">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> for Paradox Interactive, and now has two original IPs in development.</p>


<p>The management buyout has been facilitated by venture capital firm Hiro Capital, with studio director Ed Daly continuing to head the developer.</p>
<p>“This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision,” Daly said. “This is what we are doing and we want to carry on doing it, so we’re happy to carry on in this vein.”</p>
<p>The Chinese Room had been bought up by Sumo Digital in 2018, as Sumo went on a large expansion drive through the last decade, opening up or acquiring studios in Nottingham, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/02/sumo-digital-have-rescued-ccps-newcastle-studio-from-closure/">Newcastle</a>, Leamington, Warrington, Pune and Bangalore and more, growing to around 1,400 employees by 2023. In turn, Sumo was<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/19/british-developer-sumo-digital-acquired-by-tencent-1-3-billion/"> acquired by Tencent in 2022</a>.</p>

<p>However, the future of Sumo and all their subsidiaries were thrown into doubt earlier this year when the company issued a statement that it would <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/04/sumo-group-stops-making-original-ip-to-focus-on-partner-titles/">now refocus on third party work</a> as opposed to original IP and self-publishing. This led to layoffs and the sale of publishing label Secret Mode.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room was also being put up for sale, but with the likelihood of being acquired by an overseas entity again has been staved off. Hiro Capital is a London and Luxembourg VC fund that specialises in founding and angel funding gaming, sports and technology.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“The Chinese Room is a huge British success story that has rightly been recognised as a unique creative force capable of competing on the world stage,” said Spike Laurie, a partner at Hiro Capital. “From hiring British people to making games set in the UK, they’ve been one of our foremost creative studios and now they are once again in charge of their own destiny while remaining British.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“We are at risk of overlooking these creative gems and letting them be sold to overseas corporations,” Laurie continued. “That is a travesty for the $5.5 billion British gaming industry which has a world-renowned reputation. We need to nurture this talent and support it through difficult times, because it is one of our leading creative exports.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adhoc-studio-will-be-working-on-official-critical-role-videogame</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role has announced an official videogame partnership. The multimedia company has announced it will be collaborating with AdHoc Studio on several upcoming videogame projects. One of them is an official Critical Role videogame.</p>

<h2>The AdHoc Studio Critical Role Videogame Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Critical Role's CEO Travis Willingham discussed the reasoning behind their collaboration with AdHoc Studio. According to Willingham, he was auditioning for a role in the studio's upcoming narrative-driven superhero workplace drama game, <em>Dispatch.&nbsp;</em>Afterwards, more in-depth talks happened, resulting in a partnership which includes official Critical Role videogame development.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-game-dialogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=8hZ74aQ7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-game-dialogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=zeL7O1ub 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><blockquote>
<p>"Just from looking over the audition and game materials, I knew there was something special about what AdHoc was creating and I immediately reached out,” said Willingham. “The design, tone, style and storytelling of DISPATCH jumped off the page, and I knew given the pedigree of the folks at AdHoc, this was a team we wanted to collaborate with. Critical Role is always looking to build with people who are innovating around new ways to deliver story, character and worldbuilding, and AdHoc fits that perfectly.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of this partnership, Critical Role will collaborate with AdHoc on future Dispatch brand development. This will include merchandise, tabletop gaming, and more. In addition, both AdHoc and Critical Role will help co-develop the first videogame set in Critical Role's fantasy setting of Exandria, showcasing AdHoc's design strengths in deep, player choice-driven storytelling.</p>

<p>AdHoc's pedigree in videogame narrative cannot be understated. The studio was founded by several veterans of Telltale Games, the studio responsible for their critically-acclaimed videogame adaptations of <em>The Walking Dead</em> and <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> set in the <em>Fables</em> universe.</p>

<p>Considering the voice cast of Dispatch includes two other key members of Critical Role, Matt Mercer and Laura Bailey, there is clear vested interest in AdHoc from a creative and design perspective.</p>

<p>A Critical Role videogame has been something the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-confirms-video-game-is-coming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has wanted to do</a> for a while. Given breadth of the world of Exandria, told throughout <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-concludes-campaign-3-with-epic-8-hour-finale-new-godly-exu-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">three major campaigns</a> and several spin-offs spanning ten years, there is plenty of material to pull from.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/13/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown’s</a> launch last year got off to a tortured analogy about a bad start to a motor race. Did it stall as the lights went out? Did it burn out its tyres with wheelspin? Did it bog down in second gear? Perhaps all of the above? KT Racing haven’t given up on their open world lifestyle racer, though, and with the imminent launch of Season 4, they’ve now opened up about what Year 2 holds for their game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Behind the Scenes: The Future of Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K88Nrddj4fw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since last September, KT Racing has delivered two major updates, first with the Ibiza City map at the end of last year in Season 2, while Season 3 in March brought new mission types, a solo mode, more vehicles, AI difficulty selection and more. What awaits through to 2026 is more of an incremental approach to improvement, adding requested features with each season, new mission types, and continuing to engage with the community to decide the path ahead.</p>


<p>But first, Season 4 is set to arrive this month, bringing with its a bunch of new race events branded as Stock Races. There’s 20 new races and 20 redefined ones across both Hong Kong Island and Ibiza, all of which will challenge you to drive in cars locked to their stock value. Alongside that comes an overhaul of active aero for select cars that have moveable parts, with a revamp of the dynamic aero system aiming to recreate each car’s behaviour with aerobrake, DRS and deployment. In certain instances, you’ll have both automatic and manual control – your Bugatti Veyron will now have high and low drag modes, for example.</p>
<p>The UI is also getting a makeover, giving players full control over which parts of the HUD are active, adding a new quick access filter system for the world map, and catering better to groups driving together with support for up to 4 routes in the GPS and an itinerary plan for players to follow.</p>

<p>There’s also five new cars, this time arriving with the first paid Solar Pass of rewards, alongside a free rewards track. These include the Aston Martin DB11 Volante, DeLorean Alpha5 and more.</p>

<p>But perhaps most exciting for long-time TDU fans is the return of the casino. The Wintory Casino is a brand new social area which allows for up to 32 players to share the space – up from 8 or 16 players in the base game. There’s two new shops for avatar and car cosmetics here, but the big difference is that you need to buy things with casino chips, which you obviously get from gambling –&nbsp;or turning Solar Coin to casino chips at a rate of 2:1.</p>
<p>Initially there will be just the one slot machine type, but a mid-season update will bring a Golden Dragon slot machine and the ability to play poker. Get lucky enough and you could win a Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series.</p>

<p>This should hopefully tide players over to October and the start of Season 5, which brings major changes to the game with an overhaul of the KT Engine that adds new water shaders, reflections, shadowing and lighting, and aims to make better use of the CPU and GPU. There’s no details yet, but hoepfully this brings some big improvements for the game on console as well as on PC.</p>

<p>This also sees the addition of Taxi missions, where you’ll have to pick up a client and drive them to a destination following common sense road rules like adhering to speed limits and using indicators –&nbsp;this ain’t Crazy Taxi, alright? Along the way, clients might make specific requests, such as having you roll down windows or turn on the radio, and you might have to meet a dress code beforehand as well.</p>

<p>Season 6 will also add a new mission type in January, but this one will be determined by the community, with voting now active to decide between a Detective, Package Delivery, Photography and Adrenaline missions. You can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdV49jCWe1BvGaZpkgYEpdY0tTJOSYappAnQj0V06ZYg7gEuQ/viewform">head here to vote before 4th August</a>.</p>
<p>Even further away are the Official Racing Centre hub in April’s Season 7, where players can gather at an island race track and launch ranked events together, and then houses and real estate won’t appear until Season 8, letting you throw money into buying properties that you can customise, furnish and invite friends to visit to check out the cars you’re displaying in your garage or garden.</p>

<p>There’s further things being teased, such as more Asian market vehicles appearing in Season 7, the possibility for body kits and more car customisation, car selling as well, and there are still plans for bikes at some point as well. Also high on the priority list are cross-region servers – cross-platform play less so – eight player groups and selling cars.</p>
<p>There’s a long road ahead for Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, and while it didn’t get off to an ideal start, it is good to see KT Racing sticking with the project to build out their vision. The goal, of course, is to build up more momentum and bring both new and returning players into the game once more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Donkey Kong Bananza has been a stellar return for Nintendo's beloved ape, with the critical consensus from players and critics making it one of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/">2025's best games so far</a>, and as for its commercial success, it was reportedly at the top of the sales charts for physical games in the UK. That said, it didn't come close to hitting the heights of Super Mario Odyssey's launch.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/">The Game Business</a> founder and editor-in-chief, Christopher Dring, <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1946977090487923167">posted on X</a> that Donkey Kong Bananza was at the top of the UK's physical sales charts, and that its launch was "<em>3x bigger than the launch of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze."</em> However, Dring reports that it was "<em>less than half of Super Mario Odyssey's</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bonanza launches at No.1 in the UK chart (physical sales) . Its launch is 3x bigger than the launch of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze on Switch. But it is less than half of Super Mario Odyssey’s</p>— Christopher Dring (@Chris_Dring) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/1946977090487923167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza was only released days ago at the time of this writing, so Dring is only reporting on the launch week sales. It's also worth noting that it's only physical sales for one region. Physical sales are still an important moniker for Nintendo games, since the only people still buying games physically seem to be Nintendo fans, but they're not yet the whole picture of Bananza's success.</p>



<p>As we get more information about Bananza's sales in the coming weeks and months, it'll be interesting to see how the game continues to take off. The comparisons to Nintendo's main mascot and the last major 3D platformer we got from Mario are perhaps a bit unfair, but relevant considering that the team who worked on DK Bananza stemmed from the same team that made Super Mario Odyssey, and that's before getting into all the gameplay similarities between the two.</p>



<p>In his review of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, Wccftech's Nathan Birch, giving the game a 9/10 said, "<em>Donkey Kong Bananza doesn’t monkey around, as it’s inarguably the biggest, most ambitious 3D platformer Nintendo has ever produced. Taking the formula established by Super Mario Odyssey as a starting point, Nintendo goes deeper, wilder, weirder, and punchier. Donkey Kong Bananza is perhaps a bit less refined than the near-immaculate Odyssey, but if you can overlook a few minor brown spots, this banana is very much worth peeling.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Prologue: Go Wayback!</em> is an unfortunate name for a video game, though on par for what I’d expect for a developer whose previous game was called <em>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</em>. The survival game–or survival-esque game? Or survival game-like?--has an early access release planned, but there’s currently a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam demo</a> that lets you try to figure out what exactly it is for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Prologue</em> spreads itself between survival game, walking sim, and tech demo. Each run takes place on a new huge, generated map; you’re tasked with walking from a starting cabin to a weather station somewhere out in the world, using only a compass and a paper map that doesn’t update with your position. There isn’t any wildlife or monsters out there, just nature and a few points of interest, also marked on your map, that could be cabins, lean-tos, or piles of rocks. In its current form the game has some light survival elements in terms of managing your character’s hunger, thirst, and temperature. These aren’t terribly taxing, though letting them bottom out will end your run.&nbsp;</p><p>The game’s maps are created with what <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/prologue-go-wayback-brendan-greene-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a writeup on Epic Games</a> calls “a mixture of procedural generation, machine learning, and good old-fashioned handcrafted art.” This includes in-house machine learning technology to generate the heightmap and uses data drawn from, the developer <a href="https://playerunknownproductions.net/news/guided-generation-in-prologue-ml-generated-landscapes-based-on-game-designer-inpu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a>, “real-world landscape data (from public geospatial datasets).” The generation is done on the player’s machine rather than in the energy-guzzling data centers AI is known for. Developer Brendan Greene told Epic that “We try not to use generative AI for the artistic process;” while it’s not clear to me what “try” means, there’s no AI disclosure on its Steam page. The whole thing is kind of a tech test for a sort of–oh god–metaverse, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pubg-2-prologue-brendan-greene-playerunknown-metaverse-1851765648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku</a> writing that “This metaverse, a 3D version of the internet as Greene calls it, is the long-term goal, potentially 10-15 years away, guiding <em>Prologue</em>’s development like a north star.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Prologue: Go Wayback! - Official Trailer | IGN Fan Fest 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbRDB5ygQ6U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That’s a lot of the kinds of buzzwords I hate, and also not a lot of insight into what the thing you can download on Steam actually is. This might explain why I hadn’t realized a playable version of the game existed until YouTube put one of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTin6ycnDWw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorite <em>The Long Dark </em>players</a> messing with it in front of me over the weekend. I love <a href="https://aftermath.site/long-dark-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Long Dark</em></a> for all the things <em>Prologue</em> has in common with it, namely wandering around in the woods, so I downloaded the demo to check it out. In my five hours with the demo I did not make it to the weather station, though I did glimpse it once in the distance before fog set in, I made some bad choices that got me hopelessly lost, and died.</p><p>In real life, I am not great with maps; I will admit that I sometimes can’t even parse a Google map without turning myself or my phone in different directions. <em>Prologue</em>’s compass and paper map setup were a huge challenge for me. The best way to navigate the demo’s world is to find the big river that crosses every map and then follow it; this also helps with your need for water, which can’t be collected from rain or puddles despite the game’s abundance of rain, puddles, and containers that can hold water. In one run, the starting cabin I spawned in was firmly between three river tributaries and a mountain; as long as I didn’t climb a mountain, I thought, it was impossible for me <em>not</em> to hit a river eventually. But then I kept <em>not</em> hitting a river <em>or </em>a mountain, stopping to look at my map and compass, asking myself if I even actually understood cardinal directions.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath/PlayerUnknown</figcaption></figure><p>When I did find a river in a run, things were going great until curiosity got the better of me and I wandered into the woods. I kept muttering “the river is behind you, just turn around” to myself until I came upon a little lean-to that thrillingly contained a new map showing my updated position. Then, a snowstorm set in, and when it ended, I somehow <em>didn’t</em> just turn around and, even with my new map, couldn’t find the river again. With the world changing each time, there’s none of the learning landmarks of games like <em>The Long Dark </em>that help you improve over time. Given that navigation is the main activity the <em>Prologue</em> demo has going for it, how much you understand the concept of where your body is in space will likely dictate how challenging you find it.</p><p>As a demo, the game struggled a bit for me tech-wise, with frequent framerate drops and some effects I had to turn off to stop the leaves on all the trees from turning into weird little strobe lights. The controls can be equally finicky, sometimes not picking things up when they should. But I didn’t mind looking past this to enjoy just wandering in <em>Prologue</em>’s world, full of shifting biomes and weird rock formations. There is spectacular weather: in one of my runs, a powerful rainstorm started up as soon as I spawned, threatening to tear the roof off my starting cabin in a roar of water and flapping wood. There are snow storms and, captivatingly, hail. There are muddy areas that slow your walk speed and fog that obscures everything, and, less frequently, solid ground and sunny skies. With no crafting and little in the way of shelter, changes in weather can spell the end of a run.</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath/PlayerUnknown</figcaption></figure><p>You find food and items as you explore, though you have a clunky, maddeningly small inventory to contend with. You can also carry items under your arm; I mainly did this for firewood, since bigger pieces can be in short supply out in the world. The firestarting mechanic is great: using a firestriker you hopefully remembered to pick up in the starting cabin, you arrange tinder, sticks, and logs and then strike enough sparks for everything to catch. The placement of your fire items matters, as does the weather you’re trying to light a fire in, and it feels very much like starting a fire in the real world. One of my runs ended when I found myself slogging through a <em>The NeverEnding Story</em>-esque mud flat, moments from freezing to death, with the ground too wet to light a fire on.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s good that the fire mechanic is interesting, because otherwise there isn’t all that much to <em>do</em> in the demo. The landscape can become repetitive, and there’s no narrative to follow, secrets to uncover, or timer or closing circle to push you toward the weather station. I wouldn’t fault anyone who simply found it boring–its world is very beautiful, but there isn’t very much <em>in </em>it–or players with better navigational skills than me finding it too easy. Beyond mishaps with my fires, foraged mushrooms were enough to keep me fed and hydrated; my deaths didn’t feel inevitable so much as consequences of my own bad choices.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath/PlayerUnknown</figcaption></figure><p>Despite all this, <em>Prologue</em> ate up a chunk of my Saturday. In the absence of so many of the things that make video games video game-like, it has its own intriguing atmosphere that feels like it has nothing to do with metaverse cringe. It isn’t exciting, or necessarily <em>good</em>, and I can’t even say I honestly understand what it’s trying to be. But it drew me in regardless, given my love of a slow-paced wandering game and the pleasures of exploring virtual woods. <em>Prologue</em>’s eventual early access release plans to add narrative, “new ways of surviving,” and “hazards to explore,” and while it definitely feels a bit too bare bones right now, I think leaning too far into the hallmarks of standard survival games runs the risk of PlayerUnknown just making a crappy survival game. <em>PUBG</em>’s Arma mod lineage made it wonderfully, grimly clunky, and I hope <em>Prologue</em>, whatever it’s developing itself into, sticks with that feeling while improving on the parts that don’t function quite right yet.</p><p>I can’t totally say I’d recommend it if you’re not a survival game nerd like me, or even if you are. But I had a hugely particular-feeling experience in it, one that had me scooted forward in my chair with my face close to my computer screen, one that told the kinds of personal, harrowing stories only a very slow survival game can, even one as baffling as <em>Prologue</em>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tyler-the-creator-dont-tap-the-glass-hip-hop-rap-kendrick"><h3>We Should All Outgrow Our Heroes Like Tyler, The Creator</h3></a><p>Turns out all it takes to shake hip-hop’s foundations was “Don’t Tap The Glass” daring its rap listeners to put the keyboard down and dance

Not only is an open beta coming, but the <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1947310614411616383" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Battlefield account said</a> the game's beta will allow players to choose either an "open" or "closed" weapon setup.</p><p>"Why not both?" the developer said. In the open beta, players can choose playlists that have signature weapons locked to a specific class, or not. "More to come," the developer said.</p><p>Older titles, like the much-loved Battlefield 4, had class-locked weapons, but Battlefield 2042 introduced the ability for players in any class to choose whatever weapon they wanted. Some portion of the audience didn't enjoy this, while others embraced this expanded freedom. It appears DICE is trying to appease both audiences by giving them the option in Battlefield 6.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-brings-back-controversial-change-from-battlefield-2042/1100-6531734/" data-ref-id="1100-6531734">Each class in Battlefield 6 will have signature weapons</a>, and using them provides certain benefits. For example, DICE said if you choose the Recon class, a weapon from the sniper rifle category will afford increased breath-holding duration. If a player who chose the Assault class uses a sniper rifle, they don't get this benefit.</p><p>DICE said it wanted to offer players the option of customizing their loadouts irrespective of class because doing so may allow them to "meet the needs of your squad" to have success on the battlefield.</p><p>Battlefield 6 will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-when-battlefield-6-could-be-revealed-and-its-soon/1100-6533290/" data-ref-id="1100-6533290">officially unveiled on July 31, according to a report</a>, and it's also at this time that DICE may share more details about the open beta. Online speculation suggests the open beta could begin in August, but nothing is confirmed as of yet. Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on Battlefield 6, which is scheduled to launch by March 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Season_5">What to expect from Season 5</h2><p dir="ltr">As always, a new season of Call of Duty means a fresh battle pass packed with cosmetics. There will likely be more Black Ops 6 events and crossovers as well. Season 4 was cartoon-themed with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-beavis-and-butt-head-event-all-weapons-skins-and-all-rewards/2900-6729/">Beavis and Butt-Head</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-american-dad-collab-is-real-shop-bundles-coming-soon/1100-6533245/">American Dad</a> collaborations, but it's uncertain what theme could arrive with Season 5. Call of Duty has confirmed the next <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-next-operator-knows-what-you-did-last-summer/1100-6533292/">operator collab is the Fisherman</a> from I Know What You Did Last Summer, so this could be Season 5's first crossover news, but it's possible the operator bundle arrives before Season 4 ends.</p><p dir="ltr">The new weapons haven't been officially revealed, but <a href="https://x.com/Vondyispog/status/1940450354266800365" rel="nofollow ">leaks suggest</a> Season 5 could include the return of the iconic MP-40 submachine gun and the M60 light machine gun. The game files also mention melee weapons such as the chainsaw, boxing gloves, and brass knuckles. Of course, these are weapons that could be saved for another season or scrapped all together.</p><p dir="ltr">The operator Sims was also found in the recent game files, suggesting he could be the Season 5 battle pass operator.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6">Black Ops 6</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4535417-19610c617ef50-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535417" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4535417-19610c617ef50-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535417"></a><figcaption>Zombies crew in Shattered Veil cutscene</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4535417-19610c617ef50-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 multiplayer will likely feature new maps and game modes in Season 5, but we don't have those details yet. As for Zombies, the most recent Call of Duty podcast episode confirmed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-podcast-confirms-black-ops-7-is-boots-on-the-ground/1100-6532517/">final map will launch with Season 5</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This brings a conclusion to the ongoing storyline for Black Ops 6 Zombies. Following the events of Season 3's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/shattered-veil-story-easter-egg-guide-for-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/2900-6418/">Shattered Veil main quest</a>, the Zombies crew and Edward Richtofen will face off against S.A.M. in a setting that takes place in or around the Janus Towers location of Liberty Falls.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Warzone's Verdansk returned in Season 3, and the map has slowly evolved to mimic updates of the original map. This added the moving train, opened up the Train Station interior, and included several Easter eggs. While not confirmed, Stadium's rooftop is expected to open up with Season 5 and include playable areas for the interior. Data miners also found <a href="https://x.com/realityuk_/status/1940521748715471055" rel="nofollow ">references in the game files</a> to back up the speculation, with new map locations for a boardroom and computer room within Stadium. There's also mention of some type of lockdown for Stadium. It's uncertain if this is a location, event, or tied to an Easter egg.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 is officially announced, and a full reveal is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-set-for-gamescom-in-august/1100-6533147/">scheduled for Gamescom Opening Night Live next month</a>, but it's possible there could still be some sort of in-game Warzone event tied to the big announcement. Warzone events have been used in the past to create hype around new Call of Duty releases.</p><p dir="ltr">An official Season 5 trailer, more teasers, and a full roadmap will likely arrive near the start of August, and we'll update as new information releases.</p>

                <p>Switching between playing games on different Xbox devices is about to get a little easier, as Microsoft has introduced a new Play History feature that makes it simple to see what games you've played across any Xbox device.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed in an Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/21/now-available-for-xbox-insiders-your-cross-device-play-history-and-easier-access-to-your-cloud-playable-console-games-on-pc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the new feature will start rolling out today for Xbox Insiders. On the Xbox device's homescreen, a new list titled "Jump Back in" will appear with games that have been played recently on your current device. This is basically how it already works on consoles, with the tiles displaying recently used games and apps, but is new to the Xbox PC app.</p><p dir="ltr">New to both consoles and PC devices is the "Play History" button. At the end of the Jump Back in list (or on the far right side of the recently-played games and apps list on console) is an entire Play History category that will show games played across all devices. For those who bounce between console, PC, or a Windows handheld, the feature should make it faster to dive back into a game previously played on another device.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4535409-xboxplayhistoryupdateui.png" data-ref-id="1300-4535409" data-ratio="0.56410256410256" data-width="624" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4535409-xboxplayhistoryupdateui.png" data-ref-id="1300-4535409"></a><figcaption>A look at the new Jump Back in and Play History tiles added to the Xbox app.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4535409-xboxplayhistoryupdateui.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Xbox with this latest Insider update has also added the ability to filter games by "cloud playable" on the Xbox PC app, making it easier to see what games can be played straight from the cloud without the need to download them.</p><p dir="ltr">To join the Insider program and get updates and other new features early, you just need to download the Xbox Insider app on console or through the Microsoft Store on PC and opt-in to either the Xbox Update Preview or the PC Gaming preview, depending on what platform you are on.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox has made a big multi-device push in the last year, with a marketing campaign that declares <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">Xbox is more than just a console</a> and that any Windows device can be an "Xbox". Earlier this summer, Microsoft revealed an Xbox branded PC handheld, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, that is slated to arrive later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">major layoffs</a> that resulted in around 9,000 people losing their jobs earlier this month, including many who worked at Xbox studios, resulting in cancellation of games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">Perfect Dark</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild</a>.</p>

Sumo Digital acquired the developer in August 2018 for £2.2 million, and now The Chinese Room is independent once again.</p><p>This weekend, The Chinese Room completed a management buyout, with the company to be led by current studio director Ed Daly. This deal was facilitated by VC firm Hiro Capital, but <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-chinese-room-is-independent-again-heres-how-it-happened">according to&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em></a>, it also resulted in layoffs.&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, following the divestment process a number of roles were made redundant," Daly told&nbsp;Eurogamer. "The specifics are confidential but the studio is currently 55 developers. Clearly this was a very difficult process as we sought a future for the studio outside of Sumo."</p><p>The Chinese Room also announced it's actively working on two new IPs. "We had been working on new IP that needed investment and that was no longer possible with Sumo's new model," Daly told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-chinese-room-is-independent-again-heres-how-it-happened"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>.</p><p>In the immediate future, The Chinese Room is planning to release Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 this October, and&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/16/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-game-informers-next-cover-story">it's the game on the cover of&nbsp;<em>Game Informer</em>'s next issue</a>, out tomorrow.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-announces-management-buyout-gaining-independence-from-sumo-digital"><em>IGN</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-chinese-room-is-independent-again-heres-how-it-happened"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/21/bloodlines-2-still-wakes-the-deep-developer-the-chinese-room-cuts-ties-with-parent]]></content:encoded>

<p>For example, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> comes in at 75% female, with an average age of 35 years old, while the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirbys_return_to_dream_land_deluxe">Kirby</a> series fanbase is sat at 55% female amongst those surveyed, with players at an average age of 30.</p><div><figure data-videoid="HpG4hedNmz8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0b5mhxviy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpG4hedNmz8" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>A few more balanced series' come in the form of, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a>, both rocking a 60:40 ratio (in favour of male). This is all quite the turnaround when compared with the surveys' result for "Games In General", which shows a 75:25 spilt in favour of males aged 30 and over.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario</a> holds a 70:30 split, with player age average sitting at 32, while a more recent series in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> sits at a 65:35 split, with the average player range being below 30.</p>
<p>The average age for two of the big Japanese RPG titans that started life on Nintendo consoles, <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> and <strong>Dragon Quest</strong>, sits at 42, which is tied with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disney_tsum_tsum_festival">Disney Tsum Tsum</a> as having the oldest average player base among the games surveyed.</p>
<p>Other interesting tidbits include the fact that the survey found the vast majority of gamers were young mobile players, whilst Nintendo's IPs, in relation to other consoles, attract the most young players (obvious), but also the most over 30s (not as obvious!).</p>
<p>The survey makes for fascinating reading, and while many of the results are predictable, there's plenty of little factoids that you might not have guess before! Of course, this only covers Japanese players, and it's only a slice of the market, but it's a good insight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 just got another major update recently, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-3-amd-fsr-4-frame-generation/">Patch 2.3 going live this past week</a>, and among the new features added was one that caught the eye of the tech experts over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-df-weekly-cyberpunk-2077s-vrr-upgrade-sees-some-impressive-boosts-for-ps5-pro">Digital Foundry</a>. Cyberpunk 2077 now supports VRR on consoles, including PS5 Pro, and while CD Projekt RED has yet to put out an official PS5 Pro patch, the results of adding VRR support are about "<em>the closest we'll get</em>" according to DF.</p>



<p>The last time CD Projekt RED spoke on an official PS5 Pro update for Cyberpunk 2077, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-wont-be-getting-a-ps5-pro-patch-anytime-soon/">claimed that there were "<em>no plans</em>"</a> to develop one, but then again, CD Projekt RED has also stated that it was done updating Cyberpunk 2077. Only to later release a new update for Cyberpunk 2077. So take that previous statement with a grain of salt for now, since it could just be that the studio is working up to it with updates like last week's adding VRR support.</p>



<p>As for what VRR support does for PS5 Pro owners today, Digital Foundry's testing found that unlocking the framerate can get players on PS5 Pro playing the game at 80 FPS+ on the Performance graphics mode. As Digital Foundry's John Linneman put it in today's DF Direct Weekly video, "<em>It's significantly better overall..averaging around 80 to 90 FPS, you can feel that. That is a significant upgrade.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #223: Cyberpunk 2077 VRR Tested, Space Marine RT Upgraded, New SNES Doom Wows" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m05yE_-X7uY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Base-PS5 players have much less to be excited about, since DF found that playing with the new VRR modes on a base PS5 still has you hovering around 60 FPS, which is where the regular performance mode already stood. The same goes for the quality mode, which keeps players at the same previous marker of 30 FPS. PS5 Pro players get their framerate bumped up to 40 FPS when playing on the quality mode with ray tracing on.</p>



<p>Digital Foundry points out that there's still room for CD Projekt RED to improve Cyberpunk's performance on the PS5 Pro in both the performance and quality modes, such as improvements to ray-tracing, and to the framerate for other areas of Cyberpunk that, even with VRR on, still barely manage to hit 60 FPS on a PS5 Pro. </p>



<p>Still, if you shelled out the cash for a PS5 Pro, seeing a 20 FPS bump compared to the base PS5 on games like Cyberpunk 2077 is realistically the kind of improvement you paid for. It's good to see PS5 Pro players reaping the benefits of their upgrade, and hopefully, CD Projekt RED will one day release a proper, official PS5 Pro patch that improves elements of performance and graphical fidelity in the game across the board.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer.1248960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is an operating system sim in the mold of games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hypnospace-outlaw" rel="nofollow">Hypnospace Outlaw</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Simulacra</em>, and it asks a simple question: What kind of secrets could the innocuous facade of a distinctly '90s-inspired Windows 2.0-style interface be hiding?</p>

<p>Structurally, solo developer Cara Cadaver's game has you trawling through the primitive menus and basic graphics of an old PC, searching for the truth behind the disappearance of adult film actress Candy Corpse.</p>

<p>Just like the OS itself, though,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is hiding a lot from you at the outset, and things are not as simple as that setup implies. If you want to find out what might have happened to Candy, you're going to have to put your digital detective hat on, and happily, it's worth doing so, even if you'll be left wanting more at the end.</p>

<h2><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>Is a Very Convincing '90s PC Sim</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-calculator.jpg?itok=VNaMJplg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-calculator.jpg?itok=0QO1fPgO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Agh! My eyes! The numbers!</figcaption></figure><p>There's a refreshing lack of adornment to&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>. As soon as you boot it up, you'll be faced with a simple login screen that asks you to enter a 4-digit PIN. There's no fluff, no introductory cutscene explaining who the key players in this story are, and no tutorials to be found either.</p>

<p>That works to its credit; since&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>doesn't mess around, you're free to "enjoy" its unsettling, eerily quiet atmosphere right from the get-go. The silence of the operating system is almost oppressive, broken only by the sound of clicking as you navigate clunky menus and positively atavistic-looking websites.</p>

<p>I never felt like Cadaver's game jumped the shark, either. Its PC simulation remained convincing until the very end, helped along by the eldritch glow of the CRT monitor filter overlaying the "action," so to speak.</p>

<p>If you don't have any nostalgia for old-school operating systems, then&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>might not be able to weave its strange magic for you, but I thoroughly enjoyed the matter-of-fact, no-nonsense style in which this ancient PC coughed up its secrets.</p>

<h2>You'll Find a Timely Story in&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-forum.jpg?itok=mStteqII 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-forum.jpg?itok=Sh7u5tPt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s story doesn't pull its punches.</figcaption></figure><p>Those secrets are worth discovering, too. While&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is nominally the story of Candy Corpse and her disappearance, there's more to discover inside this particular computer's memory, not least to whom it belongs and why you're digging through it.</p>

<p>Unlike the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Simulacra&nbsp;</em>or its <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/simulacra-2" rel="nofollow">slightly disappointing sequel</a>,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>doesn't resort to cheap jump scares, nor does it descend into the valley of daft pseudo-supernatural horror.</p>

<p>The scares are much closer to home, and while I don't want to spoil anything, the Steam page does make clear mention of "themes of sexual content, violence, and abusive and harmful language," so you know what kind of realm we're in here.</p>

<p>Since you're free to explore the operating system in whatever order you choose,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s story will likely unfold in a non-linear fashion, and discovering what happened to Candy is just one part of filling in the wider picture.</p>

<p>Great horror is grounded in the real, and that's certainly the case with&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>. If its story ever threatens to feel silly or outré, the fact that many of its themes still disappointingly resonate in the real world only add to the threat.</p>

<h2><em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s Operating System Is Filled With Secrets</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-password.jpg?itok=3LoXQWs9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-password.jpg?itok=-iFvlUpR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Good luck working this one out.</figcaption></figure><p>Discovering the narrative feels chilling thanks to the plethora of secrets contained within&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s operating system. Some applications will give up their secrets readily, while others require passwords or authentication to access.</p>

<p>You're left to discover many of these keys by yourself, although hints are frequently available. Making discoveries therefore feels like pulling off great detective work, evoking the quiet satisfaction of getting an old, irascible computer to do what you want in the process.</p>

<p>Some of those secrets can feel a little too esoteric for their own good, however. I never managed to work out what lurked behind the innocuous-seeming perfume website, for instance, and there are a couple of other head-scratchers that defeated me as well.</p>

<p>Still, if you're the type to pore over games hunting for every scrap of information, then&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>should give you a good couple of hours of entertainment. Unfortunately, however, that's all it's going to give you.</p>

<h2>Frankly, There's Just Not Enough of&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-ffvr.jpg?itok=Jy1QxqQ9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-ffvr.jpg?itok=ybKZ1h8m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I wanted to spend more time in&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s meticulously constructed operating system.</figcaption></figure><p>If I have a core criticism of&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>, it's that there's just not enough of it. Just when things are starting to move along and adrenaline is starting to build, it's over. The ending is a pretty abrupt one, too, although it feels appropriate given what you're likely to have learned beforehand.</p>

<p>Discovering the story of Candy by digging through old websites and deducing passwords is a hugely enjoyable (if that's the right word) experience, so the fact that there's just so little of it is heartbreaking for me.</p>

<p>Cadaver has made it clear&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is designed to be played in a single sitting, and there's no save function, nor does it allow you to continue playing after the credits. I sort of understand why from a narrative perspective, but I'd have loved the chance to continue spending time with this throwback machine.</p>

<p>Still, I will always prefer a game that leaves before its time to something that massively outstays its welcome. In being so shockingly brief,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>avoids the pitfalls of puzzle games that keep going long after their best ideas are spent.</p>

<h2><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-vns.jpg?itok=K0T8_eCC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-vns.jpg?itok=VCMzvbqH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>has plenty of "delights" to offer retro puzzle connoisseurs.</figcaption></figure><p>Cara Cadaver has crafted a very neat little puzzler in&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>. On one level, it's a great simulation of a time before user-friendliness and "idiot-proof" operating system design, and on another, it's an unsettling tale of violence and abuse that may well stay with you (it certainly has with me).</p>

<p>I'd love to see what Cadaver can craft in a larger, more open-ended sandbox environment, but if you're looking for a (very) tightly-plotted experience that doesn't stick around after it's not welcome,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>will provide.</p>

        <p>"Nothing is eternal", says Yves Guillemot</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has responded to a shareholder question about the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign - and in a very newsworthy corporate question and answer session, revealed that a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-breakpoint">Ghost Recon</a> game's in the works.</p>
<p>To quickly recap, Stop Killing Games aim to stop publishers rendering online games unplayable after the cessation of official support. They were inspired to take action by Ubisoft themselves 'sunsetting' online racer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's response to their campaign comes around the time the group's petition to the EU to take action against the mass extinction of online games <a href="https://x.com/StopKilingGames/status/1947064216298406179">hits 1.4 million signatures</a>. Despite some doubts about potential signature spoofing, the petition's recently attracted support from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/european-parliament-vice-president-throws-his-support-behind-stop-killing-games-campaign">EU politicians</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-only-games-prohibitively-expensive-to-create-argue-eu-lobby-group">industry trade bodies</a>, so it's no surprise Guillemot's fielding questions about it from moneyfolk.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Regarding the petition, we operate in a market," the CEO began (via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report">Game File</a>), immediately whipping out what I assume's the corporate version of the phrase '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHhbdXCzt_A&amp;t=1s">we're living in a society</a>'. He went on to say that players are "forewarned that eventually the game may be discontinued", and framed the studio putting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> on sale for €1/$1 back in 2024 as an attempt to let players of the first game hop across to one that wasn't about to be deep-sixed.</p>
<p>"You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone and at some point the service may be discontinued," Guillemot continued, "Nothing is eternal. And we are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players and buyers, because obviously support for all games cannot last forever. But that’s an issue that we’re working on. That’s something that the industry at large is working on, to minimize impact on players."</p>
<p>The exec closed out his point by saying that the likes of software and tools made to make live-service games "become obsolete" or no longer available in time, outlining that this is why studios can opt to put out new versions.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Stop Killing Games have been clear they're not asking for all online games to be "eternal", but rather to "implement an end-of-life plan to modify or patch the game so that it can run on customer systems with no further support from the company being necessary".</p>
<p>Moving away from Stop Killing Games, in the same shareholder ask-a-thon Guillemot and Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet casually alluded to a new Ghost Recon being in development. The CEO mentioned "capitalising on upcoming launches, such as The Division and Ghost Recon", while Duguet touched on investment from Tencent being used for "future development of other major brand names", citing Ghost Recon as an example.</p>
<p>Confirming the execs' chatter about the ghost reconning their attic, an Ubisoft spokesperson has told Game File that the publishers "look forward to sharing more when the time is right". Nice. Here's hoping it doesn't come with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-launching-ghost-recon-breakpoint-nfts-later-this-week">NFT trousers</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-ceo-responds-to-stop-killing-games-and-casually-mentions-a-new-ghost-recon-games-coming]]></content:encoded>
