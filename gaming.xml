			<p>Arrowhead has finally released a new patch for <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-wont-feature-a-story-mode-reveals-arrowheads-new-ceo/">Helldivers 2</a>, which allows players to feel stronger when they should and adds more diversity to their gameplay. In this update, they did a significant overhaul of the anti-tank, armor penetration, and health and armor values. Overall, the weapons and stratagems have been balanced, and enemies have been reworked to make the game a more enjoyable experience. As a result of this, the player count tripled. The day before the patch rolled out, the player count hit a 22,000 peak. However, post-patch, it climbed to a 68,000 peak once it fully rolled out.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This is the highest player count the game has gotten since its release, as the player numbers have steadily declined since its release in February of this year. Additionally, the game has a 20% off sale on Steam, coinciding with the new update so that new players will get the proper experience rather than the strained one from the previous patch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 Patch Notes - Patch 01.001.100" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1cCIOlSQIT0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Although previous patches added new maps and more content to Helldivers 2, this patch seems to have benefited players most, as it made many changes. The patch notes are extensive, with weapons being buffed significantly to damage enemies more, making the game more enjoyable for the players.</p>
<p>This patch also added the Galactic War feature, a War map that displays the location of important assets, making it much easier for teams to decide where to go and where they should navigate in battle. Additionally, there is now an Emote Wheel feature, with players able to hold up to four Emotes, which can be equipped via the Armory.</p>
<p>While this patch predominantly focused on buffing player damage and nerfing enemy damage, it also included a ton of crash fixes and soft-lock fixes, optimizing the game even further and making it more playable. The game had many crashes when interacting with certain enemies or objects and when players hot-joined.</p>
<p>Although the patch notes are extensive and include many changes and repairs, they are aware of quite a few known issues that they still have to work on repairing and have listed everything they intend to fix in future patches. This includes units not having audio cues, friend requests not working, and social menus getting stuck.</p>
<p>In addition to the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/7147864422081646859?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> written patch notes</a>, they also released a video discussing the changes they've made. This allows you to digest the patch notes via video rather than reading the huge number of changes the developers have made to Helldivers 2.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-documentary-october</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-documentary-will-tell-a-troubled-development-story-next-month.984534/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-documentary-october<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>developer GSC Game World has announced a new documentary about the making of the game and how it's been impacted by Russia's ongoing invasion of the studio's native Ukraine.</p>
<p><em>War Game: The Making of Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>will air on October 3rd, and it's being made in conjunction with Microsoft. The movie will be directed by the creators of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/power-on-explores-history-of-xbox">Xbox documentary series&nbsp;<em>Power On</em></a>, although this one won't come in multiple parts.</p>
<p>In the trailer description, GSC Game World says that February 24th, the first day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, "changed our world and lives forever". Suddenly, a game that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/post-apocalyptic-shooter-stalker-2-delayed-until-december">already experiencing development difficulties</a> was now being made in a war-torn nation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-documentary-road.jpg?itok=61qGthFR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-documentary-road.jpg?itok=gmqPPcXA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has undergone some pretty hefty trials and tribulations over the course of its development.</figcaption></figure><p>Over the stirring sound of Metallica's classic "Nothing Else Matters", the&nbsp;<em>War Game&nbsp;</em>trailer features GSC Game World developers talking about their experience of making the game while its native country was in defense mode.</p>
<p>One developer says that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has become "an element of resistance" for the studio, while another says the team "load our weapons with one hand and make the game with the other".</p>
<p>As the trailer concludes, one GSC Game World staffer affirms the studio's commitment to "finish this game" and "make it awesome". It's all very stirring stuff, and it makes me hope against hope that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is going to turn out as great as the devs want it to.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>War Game</em>, which also shows off some of the footage you can likely expect to see in the finished documentary, right here.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the long-awaited followup to 2007's&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl&nbsp;</em>(which uses the Russian spelling of the word rather than the Ukrainian Chornobyl).</p>
<p>You'll once again take the role of one of the titular Stalkers, hunters who look for treasure in the irradiated exclusion zone of Chornobyl.</p>
<p>The game will feature a "photorealistic seamless open world" in which you'll encounter different NPCs and factions with their own agenda, battle horrifying monsters, and experience "immersive survival mechanics" like hunger, a need for sleep, and radiation.</p>
<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>launches on PC and Xbox Series X|S on November 20th (assuming it's not delayed again). You can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-preview-get-in-zone">read our preview of it here</a>.</p>

Yesterday I watched a Youtube video about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, in which sundry, gesticulating milords of the internet opine that they had "forgot what it's like to be the target audience" for games, hailing the new (and for our money, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">fairly good</a>) Warhammer 40K <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> as a throwback affair that "oozes masculinity", with no excess feelings or real-life social relevancy. I then combed through several thousand comments below said video, many of which expressed similar longing for the hypothetical Good Old Days, before those wily feminists invaded the medium, transformed every game into a LGBT+ weeping simulator, and threw all the Real Men into a big hole. I did this because I was searching for one particular comment written by somebody claiming to be Matthew Karch, CEO of Space Marine 2 developers Saber Interactive. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In it, the poster thanks youtuber Asmongold for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBUqCUZ0swE">video</a> and characterises Space Marine 2 together with the recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth: Wukong</a> as a "reversion" to an "old school" era, when "games were simply about fun and immersion". He also mentions games he allegedly encountered during his time at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-group-to-close-studios-and-cancel-games-as-part-of-restructuring">noted layoff manufacturer Embracer</a> "that made me want to cry with their overblown attempts at messaging or imposing morals on gamers". The comment has now been seized upon and widely disseminated as Saber coming out as anti-woke, "woke" being an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke">appropriated</a>, catch-all term for leftwingers and especially those who campaign against racism, transphobia and sexism. Here it is in full:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Hey man. CEO of Saber here. I love your videos. When we signed the deal to make Space Marine 2, all I wanted was a throwback game. We had the chance to work on something which by its nature was "old school". I can't even comprehend many of the current games that we play these days. They are too complex and too much of an investment. We worked on Halo back in the day, and that game could be distilled down to the simplest of shooting loops, but it was entirely addicting. That is what we wanted to recapture. I hope that games like Space Marine 2 and Wukong are the start of a reversion to a time when games were simply about fun and immersion. I spent some time as Chief Operating Officer at Embracer and I saw games there that made me want to cry with their overblown attempts at messaging or imposing morals on gamers. We just want to do some glory kills and get the heart rate up a little. For me that is what games should be about.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this <em>actually</em> Matthew Karch? Saber won't say. The user in question <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MatthewKarch">registered his account in May 2024</a>. He describes himself as a "generic male of sorts - lover of loud guitars, violent games, fast cars and all sorts of whisky", which is certainly generic. Suspiciously so. I asked a PR representative to help me confirm the account's legitimacy yesterday. Fast forward to this morning, and Saber have told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-youtube-comment">IGN</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1836116821541331088">Kotaku</a> that they won't be commenting on the subject, which would typically be PR speak for "yes, it's real". Except.</p>
<p>Except that I genuinely find it hard to believe that Karch is the author, inasmuch as the "imposing morals" gambit is such a brass-necked piece of culture war bait. There's that drive-by mention of Wukong, a Soulslike created by a company with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">a reputation for sexism</a> which, following the discovery of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukongs-record-setting-launch-popularity-soured-by-co-publisher-request-to-avoid-feminist-propaganda-in-streams">PR guidance cautioning streamers against "feminist propaganda"</a>, has become a pillow fortress for people who live in terror of anime boobs getting smaller. There's the boilerplate appeal to "gamers", as though people who play games habitually were some kind of hapless protected demographic, and the needlessly broad and perhaps deceptively childlike comment that games should simply be about "fun and immersion".</p>
<p>If I were Karch, I'd find it cringey to be associated with such a transparent jumble of thinly camouflaged reactionary talking points. It reads like it's been slapped together on 8chan to rile up the Twitterati. It reads like it's been AI-generated, using the prompt "it reads like it's been slapped together on 8chan to rile up the Twitterati". I would probably want to come out and disavow it.
</p>
<p>Space Marine 2 is proving an interesting line to walk for those who rail against the "woke". Being a Warhammer 40K game, it’s an interesting line to walk for everybody, at every point on the ideological spectrum. In some respects, it's a pretty "woke" game. The cast includes Black Space Marines and women in frontline combat roles – a source of anguish for certain members of the Warhammer playerbase who are convinced that modern-day Games Workshop has been irrevocably tainted by the heresy of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. On the other hand, its a story about bulky bros stamping on space bugs while bellowing about god-emperors. There’s been some <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2183900/discussions/0/4514380548231077905/">heated granular discussion</a> of the game's degree of wokeness on the Steam forums.</p>
<p>Of course, all this is just the latest flicker in the decades-old optical muddle that is Games Workshop’s Imperium of Man, on whose behalf those tank-footed Space Marines wage war. Conceived partly in response to Thatcherite Britain, the Imperium is a satirical and grotesque portrayal of a xenophobic, mass-murdering, patriarchal theocratic empire. You’re not supposed to seriously buy into the values depicted. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-workshop-reminds-fans-warhammer-40ks-imperium-of-man-are-the-bad-guys-after-a-player-wore-nazi-imagery-to-a-tournament">But some people do</a>, partly because after years of people telling and selling stories in such a setting, the thrust of the satire has gotten lost beneath the merchandising. I guess it's thanks to that submerging of the political relevancy that "Karch", whoever he really is, doesn't seem alive to the irony of deriding other games for "imposing morals". (Thanks to Nic for suggesting this last observation.) </p>
<p>Somebody claiming to be Space Marine 2’s creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick has also commented on the Asmongold video, though his comments are a lot more guarded. Here's his response in full.</p>
<blockquote>Creative Director of the game here. I wrote Space Marine 2 along with Craig Sherman, Randy Begel and Matthew Garcia-Dunn. Hearing everything you have to say about the story and characters resonates so strongly with our actual approach. It's great to hear you calling out the exact things that we intentionally focused on. It was four and a half years of intense work and passion and watching videos like this makes it all worth it.</blockquote>
<p>As it happens, I interviewed Hollis-Leick earlier in the week. We discussed a bunch of things, ranging from more innocent chat about the game's jump pack implementation to how you do a Space Marine power fantasy that isn’t an endorsement of bigotry and genocide. I was going to publish a write-up this week. But in the wake of this alleged Karch comment, and more broadly in light of the game’s reception, I’m going to give those pieces more thought.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The original post-apocalyptic open-world game, which featured large robo dinos, was released on PS4 and eventually PC to rave reviews from critics and fans.

That means if you just want to try out<em>Frostpunk </em>you can get it for a measly $2.99, down from its usual $29.99 price tag. Though if you really want the full experience you can get the Game of the Year Edition, which includes three expansions that flesh out the world and act as prequels or sequels to the base game, as well as access to some digital goodies for the slightly more expensive (but still cheap as hell) price of $10.65. But why should you give <em>Frostpunk </em>a try?</p><p>What makes <em>Frostpunk </em>unique in the city-building genre is its blending with survival elements. The game takes place in an alternate Victorian era Earth in which an eternal winter has taken hold of the planet. You lead one of the last few outposts of survivors in the world in a bid to survive the ever-dropping temperatures. To build up your society you need to do the typical city-building activities like collecting resources, constructing important facilities, and instructing your citizens on daily actions. These solid foundations are made even better, however, thanks to the added complexity of Frostpunk’s obsession with survival. </p><p>There will come a time in your playthrough of <em>Frostpunk </em>when you will have to choose who lives and who dies in your group. Do you sacrifice a child to save the larger group? Do you feed the hungry or heal the sick?. You might even decide that what’s best for your society’s survival is to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gateway/frostpunk-is-a-city-builder-where-you-can-eat-the-dead-1819297180&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gateway/frostpunk-is-a-city-builder-where-you-can-eat-the-dead-1819297180">eat some of your perished compatriots</a></span>. It’s a grim world that forces you to accept that the cost of building back society will be paid in blood. Yes, the fundamental city-building mechanics are still satisfying, but you can’t help but feel a bit bad when it also requires more difficult moral dilemmas. While so many other games in the genre are ostensibly about creating your perfect world, <em>Frostpunk </em>admits that in this post apocalyptic setting there isn’t really much you can do to make society a utopia. You just have to survive as best you can.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If I say “we”, I mean “the Sticky Brain team.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Things to Arrange Ahead of Time"><span>Things to Arrange Ahead of Time</span></h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="BOOTH LOCATION &amp; EQUIPMENT"><span>BOOTH LOCATION &amp; EQUIPMENT</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I don’t handle the logistics prior to arriving at the booth, but if you get a choice, I will say that the top of the T-junction, a corner edge and/or next to a large open space (like a meeting area) across the way that gets visibility are great locations. For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rooster</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, our two monitors were on tall stands (without audio, which worked well for visibility amongst a crowd) and we used a tall backdrop banner with large standing cutouts of our characters so people could see our very distinct artwork from afar.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Other tips:</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If not all the convention center lights are on normally, ensure that there is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>something </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">above your booth. Stick around for the “light test” if there is one. You’d be surprised at how dark your beautifully designed booth can look without light.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Wired one-unit controllers are best for public testing since it’s a single handheld unit and you don’t have to worry about faulty connections at two points, or batteries dying partway through. They also don’t go “missing”.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you are local to the venue, bringing a vacuum for your booth carpet is incredibly helpful, especially if the venue charges $100/day for someone else to do a three-minute once-over.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Use headphones for any audio or forgo it completely. Conventions and conferences already have an overload of sounds, so blasting sound through a speaker only annoys your neighbours (and yourselves!) who will also get tired of your soundtrack.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="BOOTH SWAG"><span>BOOTH SWAG</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Practical, lasting giveaways that people can use every day are really the greatest swag. Kudos to Unreal for handing out super comfortable t-shirts at GDC. Indie studios don’t usually have the budget for that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stickers of our </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rooster </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Zodiac animal characters are the most fun and cost-effective for Sticky Brain Studios, so that’s what we hand out. For PAX West, we handed out a different sticker for every day, and people enjoyed coming back for the rest, especially when we remembered them. We love hearing about people who put them on their phones/tablets/laptops!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Remember to put your logo/URL on your giveaways. It’s up to you whether it’s your game name and/or company name, but definitely have that branding on your booth clothing. Have other people market your game by using your giveaways!</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="BUSINESS CARDS / FLYERS"><span>BUSINESS CARDS / FLYERS</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s a good idea to have some business cards on hand to give out to people who ask for them. For general consumer-facing events, have the generic company ones on hand. For industry events, use your specific role ones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I honestly try </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to collect any flyers or business cards if I can help it. I’d rather take a photo on my phone and input relevant information (on iPhones, swipe up on the photo to edit caption) like a person’s name.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">LinkedIn is my current preferred method of keeping in touch professionally, especially with pictures and profiles being in one place. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danaramnarine/">Dana Ramnarine</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from rhum.hr taught me to put the QR code for my LinkedIn profile as my phone wallpaper, and now I have another one for wishlisting </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rooster</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. These are great to design </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ahead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>of time</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, although our talented Animation Director </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ejoanlee-illustration/">E. Joan Lee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> made my gorgeous one in 10 minutes before the second day of GDC.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A QR code linking to your Steam page is one of the best activations so people can wishlist your game on-the-spot. Physically post that QR code in multiple places so it is still accessible when your booth is crowded. For bad wifi/signal situations, memorable branded swag is really the next best thing. In my ideal world, depending on the game, I would drive post-event online and purchase traffic with a card listing a code-initiated, event-specific, one-time use only, in-game item for exclusive hype. Or for non-hype practical use, offer a discount coupon code.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If email subscriber lists are your thing, make sure to have a system where people can directly type their info to your mailing list on a connected device, and be verified so that they’re not rejected as spam.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Getting There"><span>Getting There</span></h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="BOOTH PURPOSE AND PERSONNEL"><span>BOOTH PURPOSE AND PERSONNEL</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, you’re there to publicize and have people remember your game, product, or service. Regardless of the booth size, plan to have at least two people at all main times (opening and closing are a different story, I know). Otherwise, it can be lonely without traffic, and you can’t leave your booth equipment unattended if one of you needs to use the bathroom. For various purposes, six team members seems to be ideal for Sticky Brain, rotating two co-executive producers and four leads when necessary.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of staff who are able to travel, choose personnel who can handle “the public” and be the most welcoming. You can hire local booth helpers, but it’s much better to have your staff there since they’ll know your game/product/service the best and be able to answer or refer people appropriately. If they are media-trained, this is even better.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Have one technically-inclined person who can quickly handle blips with the build (e.g. figuring out that an upside-down mouse was making the virtual cursor act weirdly). I am one of those people who are better at bringing people into the booth rather than one who can patiently walk visitors through the demo. Some of my colleagues are particularly good at that. Either way, your team will figure out a good flow and individual strengths become quickly apparent. Lean into them!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’ve found that repeating the pitch over and over is good practice for honing and mastering it. The challenge is altering it slightly depending on the audience, e.g. engaging kids versus a potential publisher.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can gauge when people want to visit if they’re stopping and perking up at the sight of your booth visuals (at which point you welcome them in enthusiastically), but I found that waving in a friendly manner to passersby worked well enough to appear approachable if they made eye contact (usually waving back), without being overwhelming. This was great for people who were perhaps shy or introverted.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="TEAM ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURES"><span>TEAM ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURES</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If budget allows, all staff booth team members should arrive the day before the conference/convention start. For accessibility accommodation purposes, Sticky Brain co-founders </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sashaboersma/">Sasha Boersma</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedbrunt/">Ted Brunt</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have offered us the option of arriving two days earlier and leaving the day after closing which helps immensely. For PAX East (I was with a different company then), I should have scheduled my flight the day before as opposed to arriving and going straight from the airport to the convention center while the booth was in full swing. It was a hassle to wait outside for my boss (who then had to leave the booth) to bring me my pass, and then going through security with my luggage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you have the ultimate budget, I’ve always wanted to do a team city sightseeing tour if it’s a city I’ve never been to, and that’s a fun activity as a team bonding experience. It’s also a baseline for everybody to see the same highlights, especially if some people get stuck in their hotel rooms doing work that can’t be put off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the very least, it’s a good idea to have a team dinner, just to catch up, get reacquainted, especially if your team is hybrid/remote, hand out or collectively grab your badges, and figure out strategy, or just disperse information for the booth. Sometimes this is also where you can hand your staff their branded clothing so everyone arrives the next day, ready to go upon entry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's up to you whether your team stays for the closing, but I’ve been there for different scenarios. I don’t recommend skedaddling from the booth to the airport, having stashed luggage somewhere behind a podium. It’s a bit stressful clearing out of a hotel in the morning while prepping for a booth day. I’ve had to leave early while the rest of the team remains (kids’ school started the next day!). I’ve also stayed long enough to see people </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>still</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> trying to play our demo even after GDC had been declared over. In all three of my experiences, our PR person handled booth teardown, which was marvelous.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="PR TEAM"><span>PR TEAM</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sticky Brain had the pleasure of working with Marshal Carper of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://carpercreative.com/">Carper Creative</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for both GDC and PAX West this year. Marshal wrangles booth design with input from our team leads for art, tech, and narrative; setup; daily management; teardown; shipping logistics; media contacts; facility liaison (essential for convention center shenanigans); personnel support; and much more. I </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>highly</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> recommend him and his team.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Being There"><span>Being There</span></h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="THINGS TO PACK"><span>THINGS TO PACK</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I got lulled into complacency expecting indoor venues to be cool and comfortable.&nbsp; It is a wise decision to also pack clothing like shorts that complement your booth attire. Clothing with pockets large enough for your phone and collecting business cards (if that’s your thing) is also helpful.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Standing all day at your booth (and if you manage to walk around other booths) is exhausting. Pack and wear your most comfortable shoes! And if it’s a new pair of running shoes, make sure you feel like you’re wearing couches on your feet. I made the mistake of thinking the new shoes would get better. They didn’t.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If noise levels are too high, consider wearing earplugs. One visitor to our PAX West booth was wearing Apple AirPods without listening to anything - it was just for the noise cancellation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cough drops/throat lozenges and immune system boosters are helpful after talking for 8-9 hours, almost nonstop. Joan also introduced me to hot water with honey and lemon, which was delightful at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.astirseattle.com/">A/Stir</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in Seattle.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="MASKS AND HAND SANITIZER"><span>MASKS AND HAND SANITIZER</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is entirely a personal choice, but I am convinced that wearing a well-fitting, comfortable mask and copious use of hand sanitizer has staved off illness for me. Especially with the sheer volume of people talking in close proximity, a mask eliminates the saliva potentially flying from one’s mouth while speaking at a raised volume, leaving bad breath memories from snacks in between booth visitors, and taking the edge off some visitors being more pungent than others.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Earlier this week, EA took its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">first steps</a> toward reveal Battlefield's next series entry - mostly in the form of teasing chatter from series boss Vince Zampella, but also by way of an enigmatic bit of concept art. But now, an internet sleuth reckon he's identified the real-world location featured in the image, potentially revealing where Battlefield is heading next.
</p>
<p>
Beyond vague talk of EA's design goals for the new Battlefield, about the only concrete bit of information Zampella shared earlier this week was that it would move away from the future setting of 2021's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">poorly received Battlefield 2042</a>, instead taking place in the "modern day". And if internet investigators are correct, we might now have an additional bit of information: that at least some of the new Battlefield's action will take place in Gibraltar.

<p>
That's according to content creator TacticalBrit (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-fans-reckon-theyve-worked-out-the-real-world-location-shown-in-the-new-concept-art">IGN</a>), who peered through the smoke and fire of EA's Battlefield concept image and successfully identify three landmarks correlating to Gibraltar's real-world geography. There's a large multi-storey carpark (that'll be the two adjacent white buildings in the foreground to the left, according to Google), a series of apartment buildings on a rocky elevation to the right, and an stretch of land protruding out into the water far in the background.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>After doing more takes at the Battlefield Concept art.</p><p>I feel almost 80% certain this is infact Gibraltar.</p><p>Makes perfect sense for any game with a theoretical conflict as Gibraltar acts as a strategic bridge between Europe and Africa. <a href="https://t.co/RodDI4zq68">pic.twitter.com/RodDI4zq68</a></p></div>— TacticalBrit (@TheTacticalBrit) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTacticalBrit/status/1836116916806783077?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

"After doing more takes at the Battlefield concept art," TacticalBrit wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/TheTacticalBrit/status/1836116916806783077">social media post</a>, "I feel almost 80 percent certain this is in fact Gibraltar. Makes perfect sense for any game with a theoretical conflict as Gibraltar acts as a strategic bridge between Europe and Africa."
</p>
<p>
Assuming TacticalBrit's deduction is correct, we've now got one new bit of Battlefield information to add to the still slender list. That list also includes Zampella's confirmation the new game will feature Classes instead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>'s unpopular Specialist system, and that it'll include more focussed maps compared to its predecessor. As for when we're likely to learn more, that remains unclear - although Zampella did say EA wants to get players in early, and that details on <em>that</em> will be shared next year. "Because that's kind of the core of what we have to do," he explained, "get the community back on our side, get that trust back."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/18/square-enix-investigate-final-fantasy-16-crashes-and-graphics-after-ps5-system-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Square Enix has acknowledged and opened an investigation into reports of game crashes and graphical issues in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/final-fantasy-16">Final Fantasy 16</a>, problems which have seemingly emerged following <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/ps5-system-update-adds-customisable-welcome-hub-personalised-3d-audio-more/">the recent PlayStation 5 system software update</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on the Final Fantasy 16 <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyxvi/status/1835956338180214969">Twitter</a> account, the company said, “Following the recent release of the PlayStation 5 system update, there have been reports of the game crashing and graphical issues.</p>


<p>“We are currently working with SIE to investigate, and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>“Please await our further updates.”</p>
<p>The latest PS5 firmware update was released last week, with Sony laying the foundations for a global rollout of a new customisable Welcome Hub, and direct party invite sharing with links. Additionally, the personalised 3D audio system that was in testing for the last few months with users has now gone live for all players.</p>

<p>However, console system updates also include a lot of behind the scenes changes that can affect game performance, providing system-level optimisations for specific games, new API hooks and more – they’re similar to installing driver updates on PC, or new versions of Windows. Sony doesn’t detail the changes made to that level of granularity, but it’s entirely possible that something they’ve done has not played well with Final Fantasy 16’s game engine – an adapted version of the engine used for Final Fantasy 14, as opposed to the Luminous Engine for FF15 and Forspoken, or Unreal Engine, which is used with the FF7 remakes.</p>
<p>The timing for this is rather unfortunate, since Square Enix posted the acknowledgement between all the promotional efforts for the Final Fantasy 16 PC release – it launched yesterday, 17th September.</p>
<p>It was also our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/29/game-of-the-year-2023-best-playstation-game-ps5-psvr2/">PlayStation Game of the Year for 2023</a>, with Nic saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/21/final-fantasy-16-review/">our review</a>, “If you’re a fan of strong narrative experiences, Final Fantasy lore, breath-taking graphics and a particularly sassy Moogle, and you don’t mind a sprinkling of The Witcher, The Handmaids Tale and the many accents of Old Blighty, then Final Fantasy XVI is the game for you. Heck, it might just be the best Final Fantasy yet!”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During EA's <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Electronic-Arts-Outlines-Long-Term-Growth-Strategy-at-Investor-Day/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Investor Day</a>, one of the big topics there was the new and upcoming Battlefield game. At the moment, the details regarding the game are relatively slim pickings. However, during the EA Investor Day, fans got to hear some details about the development process for the upcoming Battlefield game. So far, it's been specified that four development studios are working on this project in total, all taking more time for the development cycle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Electronic Arts - Investor Day 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hsvX8NMGUxI?start=2412&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Introducing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-confirms-next-battlefield-will-use-modern-setting/">Battlefield topic</a> in the Investor Day video, Laura Miele begins by saying, "No franchise captures that feeling of all-out warfare, epic scale, massive destruction, and high-intensity action like Battlefield." In the video, she acknowledges that the franchise has been successful due to leaning on those core tenets but admits that some of the games they have produced in the franchise have missed the mark, especially Battlefield 2042.</p>
<p>To ensure that this next game in the iconic shooter franchise is much better and more suited to the Battlefield audience, there have been "significant shifts in their approach" when developing the upcoming Battlefield game. They have been working with the community for the past year and getting feedback and ideas from them to help make the best experience for the players.</p>
<p>Byron Beede also commented on the development of Battlefield, discussing how each of the four studios plays a role in developing the game's universe. He first stated that DICE will lead the charge on multiplayer, with Criterion driving content experiences across singleplayer and multiplayer. Third, Motive will use its storytelling and action skills to provide a meaty campaign for players to explore. Lastly, Ripple Effect is instead working on a new Battlefield experience, which is "fueled by the unique Battlefield DNA that's been testing really well with players."</p>
<p>The Battlefield Central Tech team powers all of the development of the upcoming Battlefield game, with their focus on "enabling these developers with the technology and tools they need to unlock their capabilities." Byron Beede enthusiastically states "All of this with the full force of EA, we have the largest, strongest and most focused team in the history of Battlefield."</p>
<p>To keep the focus on the game, the developers have been playing the game nearly every day for well over a year, with a strong focus on software stability. In the future, they will test widely with players while gaining feedback on gameplay, performance, and the fun factors of the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-awoken-themed-warband-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Kumo have awoken and they seek to take back the Jwar Isles, enslaving and turning its inhabitants. In this article, we'll look at the new faction for Bushido, The Awoken, and their Joyless Smiles and Dark Eyes-Themed Warband starter set. We'll check out at what's in the box, and where to go from there.</p>
<p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p>

<p>When selecting a warband in <em>Bushido</em>, you must first choose a faction from the now 13 available to select your fighters from. Each faction also has access to theme cards, which offer special abilities, but restrict the units that can be included in the warband. The Awoken are a faction for <em>Bushido</em>, and Joyless Smiles and Dark Eyes is a theme card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-awoken-5.jpg?itok=SP6_SAGM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-awoken-5.jpg?itok=493Dz1VI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Who Are The Awoken?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Softly through the shadows, they come, The Awoken, spinning death, dread and corruption in their silken webs. Not even the empire of flesh can withstand their potent venom with just a single bite undoing all the gods have wrought. They creep ever closer, viewing the empire and Jwar through numerous eyes, choosing their prey carefully, assembling a host that thinks as one under the control of a powerful force older than time itself. Sleep not, for The Awoken are everywhere, lurking in the twilight, biding their time, ensnaring us one by one, and reshaping the world in their terrifying image.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Awoken are an entirely new faction for <em>Bushido Risen Sun, </em>and Joyless Smiles and Dark Eyes is their first theme card. This theme card allows you to distribute Ki tokens to friendly Kumo models for each enemy that is in their Webbed Ground terrain and also gives enemy models a Ki Block marker if they have a poison marker.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-awoken-1.jpg?itok=TTfHgI88 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-awoken-1.jpg?itok=7GKCsmpu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Why Play The Awoken?</h2>
<p>The Awoken are a new and terrifying faction for <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>. You would think they would fit under the also creepy Cult of Yurei, which includes the occult spirits and monsters of Asian myth, but GCT has made them their own faction, with their own unique playstyle.</p>
<p>The Kumo are human spider hybrids, some more spider than human in the various stages of transformation. As you would expect with a spider-like faction, they focus on slowing down their prey with webs and dealing damage slowly over time with poison. The Kumo also don't generate Ki, which is used to power special abilities, each turn like most <em>Bushido</em> fighters do. Instead, they gain Ki for enemies trapped in webs, and also for doing damage to them in combat.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-awoken-3.jpg?itok=y6-SZLp2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-awoken-3.jpg?itok=0J5db3kQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Where Should I Start With The Awoken?</h2>
<p>The only place to start with The Awoken currently is with the Joyless Smiles and Dark Eyes-themed box. This box contains 7 miniatures and has 1 theme card and 13 special cards, including a new Kumo Trait and Web Defence rules cards.</p>
<p>The units included in the Joyless Smiles and Dark Eyes-themed box are:</p>
<ul><li>Chinatsu, the Cold Anger - The largest of the Kumo in the box, Chinatsu has a ranged poison attack and the ability to stop any enemies performing scenario actions while within webbed ground (once per game), which can be used to entirely lock out your enemy with enough Webbed Ground markers on the board for a turn.</li>
<li>Aiumi, With No Compassion - Aiumi has the most effective ranged attack in the box, with Pierce(2) and Fire. They also have an aura ki feat that makes poisoned enemies weak, making it harder for them to damage your fighters. This combos nicely with another ki feat that lets them give a poison marker to an enemy in contact with webbed ground. And if they engage an enemy in contact with webbed ground, they gain Grapple Attack and Defence.</li>
<li>Eimi, of the Mind's World - Eimi messes with your opponent's unit's Ki, and has a ki feat that lets them steal 3 ki from an enemy within 8 inches, and another ki feat that puts a 4 inch aura around them, making poisoned enemies spend an additional ki to use ki abilities.</li>
<li>Tashi, the Eightfold Blessing - Tashi has a once-per-game ability that lets them move to any Webbed Ground terrain on the table, allowing you to set up some late-game shenanigans, leaping them across to score objectives. She also has a ki ability that stops all poisoned enemy fighters from using Special Abilities in ranged or melee attacks.</li>
<li>Kiyo, Who Sees Behind - Kiyo likes to lock down enemies, firstly by stopping them from gaining additional activations with a ki feat, and then through a ki feat pulse, giving out Immoblized markers to enemies failing a size test within 6 inches.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Hidemi - Hidemi is a human cultsit supporting the Kumo. They begin the game poisoned, which means they slowly die throughout the game. Hidemi comes armed with a melee and ranged weapon for supporting the more expensive Kumo fighters.</li>
<li>Banri - Banri, like Hidemi, is a human cultist who starts the game poisoned. While their are options for sacrificing your cultists for benefits, Banri also has an inbuilt ability to be sacrificed&nbsp;to give all Kumo in base-to-base contact 2 Ki and also heal 2 damage.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-awoken-4.jpg?itok=mtDGvRC5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-awoken-4.jpg?itok=aUis0oV- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Products Are Available For The Awoken And Where Should I Go Next?</h2>
<p>The only Awoken product released so far is the Joyless Smiles and Dark Eyes-themed warband, but two other profiles are available to see on the <em>Bushido</em> App, which hints at their future release:</p>
<ul><li>Akita, Princess of Fear and Pain - Akita is another large Kumo, but not as expensive as Chinatsu. Akita has a once-per-turn ki feat that allows them to roll dice equal to the number of Kumo in play, rerolling until you have unique dice between 2 and 6. Poisoned enemy models consider any dice they roll with the numbers shown to be 1 instead. This is a powerful ability that can shut down several of your opponent's fighters.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ren - Ren is the cheapest unit available to the Awoken and is a full Kumo and not just a cultist. Ren has a ki feat that can reduce the move of an enemy by 3, and 2 melee attack options, Mandibles with Web Defence and Grapple Attack, or Atame with Ki Block, and Sidestep defence and +1 damage.</li>
</ul><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Awoken?</h2>
<p>Following my review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-deep-themed-warband-review">The Deep</a> for <em>Bushido</em>, the Awoken are another fun combo-heavy faction. Like the Cult of Yurei, who focus on debuffing their enemies, the Awoken like to cover the board in webs, their opponents in poison markers, and then strike at their weakened state with their own fighters. They've got some very powerful abilities, but they don't feel overpowered, but they can feel a little oppressive to your opponent if they let them get on top of them. They're not an easy faction to pilot, but there is a lot of fun to be had with their initially available models, and it will be very interested to see where GCT goes with their future releases.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy The Awoken Theme Box?</h2>
<p>The Awoken are a very combo-heavy warband for Bushido, and if what I've described above sounds great to you, then you should definitely look at picking them up. They're a great time to start playing as you will be able to follow all their releases easily, as opposed to factions with a large amount of units available. Even if you're not looking at playing them, their miniatures are incredible, and will also suit many other systems (but you should absolutely be playing<em> Bushido Risen Sun</em>).</p>

Maybe it was the aesthetic of the gun, which looked like it was carved from the skin of a Hive grunt, that made me love it. Maybe it was its particularly wide spread that made it such a potent bruiser when I inevitably got too close to a powerful enemy. Maybe it’s all in the name—Swordbreaker goes pretty hard as far as weapon names go. What I do know for sure is that Swordbreaker was never a “meta” weapon that I pulled out because it’d guarantee me kills in PvE or PvP content. It was just a shotgun I was rewarded with for completing one of <em>Destiny</em>’s many adventures, and it’s the one weapon that stood out above the rest. Whether it was as a fashion piece or a display of power, Swordbreaker came to mean something to me.</p><p><em>Destiny </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/destiny-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/destiny-2">its sequel</a></span><em> </em>have always prided themselves on gear like Swordbreaker—weapons that come with a story and help you tell one. Coming some years after the promise of several billions of “unique” guns in <em>Borderlands</em>, <em>Destiny </em>offered a bit of a different relationship to its equipment than similar loot-driven games. It offered a real connection to a definitive armory of some of the coolest guns and armor, rather than a randomized set of stats and buffs applied to basic archetypes. In comparison to most of its ilk, <em>Destiny </em>probably featured one of the smallest loot pools of any loot game out there, but it was also curated and <em>specific</em>. Rather than chafe against the audience, this helped grow the reputation of its loot and allowed players to nurture relationships with those individual pieces and build a history with them.</p><p>In order to earn Swordbreaker, you had to at least participate in the Crota’s End raid, a fairly straightforward, kind of unremarkable gauntlet. An auto rifle that I currently have in <em>Destiny 2</em> is a remnant from a dungeon I did years ago when I convinced my best friends to give the game a chance. My favorite pulse rifle in the game (Piece of Mind) has followed me for more than two years now, and the Choir of One exotic that has dominated my loadout for the last few weeks comes from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-encore-overture-exotic-quest-walkthrough-1851644431&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-encore-overture-exotic-quest-walkthrough-1851644431">lengthy and difficult Encore mission</a></span> I recently undertook. The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-gjallarhorn-replica-iconic-weapon-1851629615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-gjallarhorn-replica-iconic-weapon-1851629615">Gjallarhorn</a></span>, which has been featured across both <em>Destiny </em>and <em>Destiny 2 </em>several times, is the series’ most lasting weapon, having been memorialized and reprised a dozen different ways since the first game was released in 2014. <em>Destiny </em>loves its gear, and especially enjoys spinning a story from your acquisition of it, which lays the foundation for all the adventures to follow. </p><p>Swordbreaker went on to accompany me through <em>The Taken King</em> and probably helped me clear mobs of grunts during the expansion’s raid. It helped me blast holes in enemies as I grinded for strike-specific loot from the Sunless Cell mission. It was my companion throughout the drought of content immediately after the aforementioned expansion and the “spring update” of 2016. And finally, we went on one last adventure together in the melancholic but awfully nostalgic <em>Rise of Iron </em>expansion<em>.</em> When the time came to move on to <em>Destiny 2</em>, I didn’t have the good fortune of being able to bring Swordbreaker with me, but that didn’t diminish the years it’d spent by my side.<em>&nbsp;</em><br></p><p><em>Destiny </em>wasn’t always great at cultivating that sense of history and ownership. In its earliest incarnation, exotic and legendary gear was exceptionally rare to come by. The Vex Mythoclast was a highly sought after gun from the series’ first raid, the Vault of Glass, but getting it to drop came down to sheer (and bad) luck. People would let out cries of relief rather than joy when they got one, since the game seemed to care little for the time and effort players would sink into their pursuits.<br></p><p>Years after this, once <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-layoffs-destiny-2-final-shape-marathon-sony-ps5-1851609905&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-layoffs-destiny-2-final-shape-marathon-sony-ps5-1851609905">Bungie</a></span> began more explicitly tying gear to specific activities and missions, the game was simply too full of weapons to balance, resulting in the studio “sunsetting” a large swath of them, or making them effectively obsolete. To this day, it’s one of the biggest sins the studio’s committed against the game and its community, especially after years of preaching about the relationships players could build to their armories. Prized possessions like the Hung Jury scout rifle became relics as <em>Destiny </em>tossed aside the legacy it’d built.</p><p>Nowadays, the studio has not only <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-power-bungie-difficulty-1851436397&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-power-bungie-difficulty-1851436397">repealed that controversial design choice</a></span>, but celebrates its weapons and reprises them more than ever. Dozens of exotics from the original game have found a home in <em>Destiny 2</em>. Hell, for its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-ten-year-anniversary-event-bittersweet-bungie-1851646274&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-ten-year-anniversary-event-bittersweet-bungie-1851646274">10th anniversary</a></span>, Bungie’s even bringing back yet another popular weapon, Icebreaker. Hung Jury, and indeed many of the series’ most beloved weapons, returned to <em>Destiny 2 </em>as part of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-into-the-light-brave-arsenal-changes-1851375440&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-into-the-light-brave-arsenal-changes-1851375440">BRAVE arsenal</a></span> featured in the <em>Into The Light </em>content pack earlier this year. And most importantly, Swordbreaker is back in <em>Destiny 2</em>, since the game eventually reintroduced the very same raid that dropped it in the first place from the first <em>Destiny</em>. I’ve yet to actually complete or run the raid since, but the promise of being reunited with one of my favorite weapons ever remains one of the game’s most tantalizing pursuits.</p><p>I love that there’s a narrative to these things. In many loot-driven games, you may find a cool piece of gear, but it’s likely to be supplanted by another within a few hours or days of playing. You might swap out some nondescript sword for a similarly vague ax. Maybe you trade up a submachine gun with freezing capabilities for a rifle with acidic ones. That’s fine and all, but it has also always diminished what felt like <em>the </em>point of games like that: the ability to cultivate your own character, loadout, and story. If none of it means anything beyond some infinitely growing numbers, it’s pretty unlikely to impress me. If I can never settle on something that looks and feels like the best version of myself, then what am I really doing here?</p><p>By stark comparison to most of those titles, I know what I’m doing in <em>Destiny 2</em>: I’m fully realizing my favorite version of myself. I’m paying off years of stories I’ve told myself and have long arcs with countless pieces of gear in <em>Destiny</em>, like Swordbreaker or the Stag helmet I simply refuse to take off. My character has a definite shape and a legacy. This has all helped me connect to this series in a way I never have with any other games. As I write this, I’m planning to run Crota’s End as many times as I must to find my way back to Swordbreaker. And who knows, along the way, I might even unearth some other piece of equipment that’ll follow me for another five years, or however long <em>Destiny 2</em> remains a part of my life. Such is often the case, and it’s why I expect I’ll keep coming back to this world and continue telling my story, one weapon or armor piece at a time.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-cancelled-due-to-poor-reception/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project T was cancelled</a> due to poor reception, Behaviour Interactive has seemingly shut down the studio developing the game as well. According to multiple posts online, Midwinter Entertainment has been closed by Behaviour Interactive.</p>



<p>News started to appear on LinkedIn shortly after it was announced that Project T was no more.</p>



<p>“My studio abruptly closed today,” lead game designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gregory-marques-39a711_my-studio-abruptly-closed-today-midwinter-activity-7241917376005349376-pHsG?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gregory Marques posted</a>. “Midwinter was a great place to work with some amazing people. I’ll miss it.”</p>







<p>“Sadly, after nearly 7 years my time with Midwinter Entertainment has come to an abrupt end due to the studio closure,” posted animation and art lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dansalexander_sadly-after-nearly-7-years-my-time-with-activity-7241896961732182017-D77M?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Daniel Alexander</a>.</p>



<p>Another former employee, Eli Hanson, had praise for who he worked with at Midwinter while also questioning the decision made by Behaviour Interactive to cancel Project T.</p>



<p>“One of the crazy things is that in the most recent playtest we got a 92/100 score in fun and playability—and it is being sold that the game was not liked by the players,” they said in what appears to be a deleted post that was seen by Game Developer.</p>



<p>The shutdown effects at least 35 people. As of publishing, there have been nearly <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">13,000 jobs lost across</a> more than 135 companies in the games industry in 2024.</p>



<p>In the company’s statement about Project T’s cancellation, Behaviour Interactive made no mention of the what would happen to Midwinter. Insider Gaming has reached out to Behaviour Interactive for comment. </p>



<p>Midwinter was founded in 2016, and was acquired by Behaviour Interactive in 2022.</p>

			<p>Mike Morhaine is the co-founder of Blizzard Entertainment, but today, he is the owner of a new studio called Dreamhaven, which was unveiled in 2020. The company has over 100 staff members and is soon preparing to announce its first game. However, no details have been released about that just yet. Instead, they have revealed that Dreamhaven will publish Lynked: Banner of the Spark, a game unveiled during Gamescom's Opening Night Live ceremony.</p>
<p>The news of Dreamhaven publishing <a href="https://wccftech.com/fuzzybot-unveils-new-title-lynked-banner-of-the-spark/">Lynked: Banner of the Spark</a> came from Jason Schreier from Bloomberg. Lynked: Banner of the Spark is the debut game from the game studio FuzzyBot, a studio that was designed so that they could make something colorful and vibrant rather than the dark and gory games that they were used to making in previous studios.</p>
<p>Lynked: Banner of the Spark is considered to be fast-paced action with hack-and-slash combat, inspired by roguelites. You'll be able to make yourself stronger once you have completed a run and successfully gathered tools and resources.</p>
<p>In addition to Lynked: Banner of the Spark, Dreamhaven will also be unveiling a new game next month, which is being developed by Secret Door, one of their internal studios. This studio is also headed by a Blizzard veteran named Chris Sigaty, who was known for being the Executive Producer of Starcraft II.</p>
<p>Mike Morhaine<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-18/blizzard-co-founder-s-new-company-dreamhaven-aims-to-recreate-the-old-magic?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> spoke to Bloomberg</a> about Dreamhaven and the struggles they've had with having a functioning company, especially during COVID-19, which has led to ongoing financial issues. These issues meant that Secret Door's upcoming title missed internal deadlines, hence why it's only being announced now. Eric Dodds, also known as the Director for Hearthstone, resigned for personal reasons, meaning the ideas they had at the end of 2020 were now moot.</p>
<p>Sigaty did mention that Secret Door's first game should be out next year; however, due to a small team developing the game and budgets becoming increasingly tight, it may cause delays and alterations to the timeline.</p>
<p>When asked about the future of Dreamhaven's titles, Morhaime commented: "The size of these games probably are not going to be the size of a Blizzard game. But the quality bar we're trying to hit is still there. We're trying to still put out high-quality, published games that people can love and enjoy and share with their friends."</p>
<p>In addition to helping publish games such as Lynked: Banner of the Spark and Secret Door's project, they will also be helping market games from its second internal studio, Moonshot.</p>

What that means is that he doubles as space janitor and science experiment, taking all the most dangerous jobs aboard a colony ship and allegedly contributing to humanity’s understanding of the universe every time he’s cloned, killed, and reborn in a new body. Until eventually one of those clones doesn’t die and the Mickeys seemingly rise up.</p><p>Here’s the trailer:</p><p> Alongside Pattinson is Naomi Ackie (<em>Star Wars: Episode IX</em>), Steven Yeun (<em>Nope</em>), Toni Collette (<em>Hereditary</em>), and Mark Ruffalo (<em>Avengers</em>). We’ve seen the clone idea played out a bit in Christopher Nolan’s <em>Prestige </em>and Tom Cruise’s <em>Edge of Tomorrow </em>(an adaptation of the manga <em>All You Need is Kill</em>). Here, writer and director Bong Joon-ho is taking it into a sci-fi dystopia via Ashton’s book not unlike his English language breakout<em> Snowpiercer </em>about industrial class warfare at the end of the world (which was also adapted from a novel).</p><p>Class warfare was also one of the themes of <em>Parasite</em>, Bong Joon-ho’s 2020 Oscar winner about a a poor family infiltrating the household of upper-class elites. It’s also nice to see Pattinson continuing to stretch his wings again after his brooding portrayal of Bruce Wayne in the most recent <em>Batman</em> movie. With the surreal black-and-white thriller The Lighthouse, the former Twilight actor proved he can balance on the knife’s edge of comedy and horror as well as anyone. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/no-significant-reveal-for-bungies-marathon-until-2025-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-%E2%80%9Csignificant-reveal%E2%80%9D-for-bungie%E2%80%99s-marathon-until-2025-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.984402/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-significant-reveal-for-bungies-marathon-until-2025-its-claimed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It looks like it will be a while before Bungie drops shows off what its been working on with the Marathon reboot.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/18/new-marathon-details-on-heroes-price-and-radio-silence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Paul Tassi at Forbes</a>, sources tell him that there are no plans for any “significant reveals” for Marathon until spring 2025 at the earliest. Tassi adds that there may be something small to give a few updates on the game, but nothing major will come until next year.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon | Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ckI_m8bbXfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-is-going-on-with-marathon">What Is Going On With Marathon?</h2>



<p>As of writing, Marathon still has a 2025 release window for Bungie. The game will also have the expected price point of $40 that has <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-marathon-targeting-40-launch-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently been floating around</a>.</p>



<p>“There were initial monetization concerns that came to a head when free-to-play The Finals came out and had trouble in that area,” Tassi writes. “Helldivers 2 being $40 and being a hit for Sony secured the premium cost idea. Concord’s recent failure at $40 did not change this, and it is simply too far along to pivot back to F2P restructuring anyway, so it will launch like this, barring anything seismic.”</p>



<p>There will also be a battle pass system and cosmetic shop for microtransactions.</p>



<p>As far as the game itself, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transition to a hero system</a> akin to that of Apex Legends was reiterated. The characters in the game will have unique abilities along with the ability to customize the gear and guns you find during your runs.</p>



<p>Regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-replaces-marathon-game-director-with-former-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">change at the top</a> with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-director-fired-at-bungie-over-inappropriate-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Ziegler replacing Chris Barrett</a> as Game Director, that’s when the move to individual heroes came to be. It’s also said, however, that the game’s art style has remained in tact through the switch over.</p>



<p>Lastly, it’s claimed that Marathon is in a “tough spot” with its release. Bungie has had issues with trust from Sony lately due to the struggles of Destiny 2, leading to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-details-on-the-latest-bungie-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">number of layoffs</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-confirms-new-details-on-bungie-restructuring-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restructuring within the company</a>. After the failed launch of Concord, there is heavier pressure for Marathon to be a success for Sony as a new first-party game.</p>

Internally, it has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 processor as the Meta Quest 3, 12GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage capacity. The screens have a 90Hz refresh rate, but this can be bumped up to 120Hz when connected to a PC via a DisplayPort cable. There's also MicroSD card support in case you want to load it up with games and the internal storage isn't big enough.</p><p>Another cool feature is that you can quickly swap out batteries on the Focus Vision without losing any progress, as the headset has an internal battery that supplies up to 20 minutes of juice. Each detachable battery pack can provide up to two hours of continuous playtime.</p><p>You also won't need to worry about setting tracking modules like with the Vive 2 Pro, as the Focus Vision has four integrated tracking cameras and two full-color 16MP passthrough cameras that work with an infrared system to provide accurate tracking and proximity sensing in your environment.</p><p>The streaming kit in the Amazon bundle includes a five-meter streaming cable and converter--both with DisplayPort compatibility--and this is designed to give you visually lossless graphics and low-latency data transmission.</p><p>Admittedly this is a very expensive all-in-one VR solution, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3</a> is a good blend between price and performance.

            <p>The Nintendo Switch version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged">Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</a> has been delayed by another month.</p>
<p>Revolution Software's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-gets-september-release-date">remaster of the original point-and-click adventure</a> will still be released on PC (Steam, GOG), PlayStation and Xbox on 19th September as planned.</p>
<p>The Switch version has been delayed "to ensure the quality of play remains equally high across all versions of the game".</p>

<p>No further specific details on the Switch version have been provided, and no new release date has been given beyond October.</p>
<p>The remaster not only provides enhanced graphics and sound, it adds a new Story Mode with quality of life improvements more palatable to a modern audience. For instance, the UI will include subtle hints to help players solve puzzles.</p>
<p>Further, the remaster has provided a chance to tweak inconsistencies found in the original game, and alter the odd moment of representation.</p>
<p>Players can switch between modern and original versions of the game at any time.</p>
<p>After this remaster, Revolution is set to release the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-fans-will-be-delighted-by-original-remaster-and-brand-new-sixth-game">all-new Broken Sword 6</a> - I spoke to creator Charles Cecil at last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> to find out more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
