<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-beautiful-chinese-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in September 2021. Chinese developer Leenzee Games is developing it with clear inspiration from the Soulslike genre. According to the studio, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-has-been-upgraded-to-unreal-engine-5-for-improved-quality-and-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently upgraded to Unreal Engine 5</a> to offer better visuals and performance.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from our recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDC 2025 hands-on preview</a> penned by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>The story overview that 505 Games presented for Wuchang: Fallen Feathers focuses on the player character of Wuchang, a skilled female pirate warrior. Truth be told, in the time I spent suffering against a particularly malicious pair of bosses, there wasn't a shred of story exposition save for an NPC or two off the beaten path. That's exactly the way I wanted to experience to go, with the story being told through dilapidated shrines and the pervasiveness of demonic influences slipping through the cracks rather than being given a lore dump and being told explicitly why the whole world is going to hell. While I'm sure there's going to be a solid explanation for the demonic powers affecting the titular Wuchang and whatever the hell 'feathering' is, I'll gladly wait for the full release to start piecing everything together myself.</em></p>

From a wide variety of manga to lore encyclopedias, these books make the perfect gift for the Zelda fanatic in your life. Or if you just wanted to spruce up your own bookshelf, we got you covered. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-april-2025">Amazon's April book sale</a> might be over, but many of these are still available at a discount for the foreseeable future and make for great gifts.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Legend of Zelda Manga</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Penned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Himekawa" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Akira Himekawa</a>, the Legend of Zelda manga span almost the entire history of the games, with major manga series based on many of the mainline titles like Ocarina of Time and the Minish Cap. These are great for people new to manga wanting to dip their toes in, or die-hard fans of the games looking for deeper world building. All of these stories are available individually, but if you're a collector, you can get some of them in various collected box sets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 11 volume Twilight Princess Manga has its own boxed set, which includes the complete story and a poster. Additionally, the Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past manga by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotaro_Ishinomori" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shotaro Ishinomori</a> is a great quick read that's also available. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Legend of Zelda Encyclopedias</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're in the mood for something a little more educational, the Legend of Zelda encyclopedias are the perfect place to get a deep dive into Hyrule's lore, culture, and different races. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/09/the-legend-of-zelda-hyrule-historia-review">The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia</a> originally released in 2013 and gave fans the first officially established timeline. If you're unfamiliar, for years fans have meticulously speculated about a branching timeline that began in Ocarina of Time — one branch where adult Link defeats Ganondorf and one where he doesn't. It's a pretty interesting bit of lore that explains some of the settings in later and past games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Zelda Encyclopedia and Art &amp; Artifacts offer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/02/20-fascinating-facts-from-the-legend-of-zelda-encyclopedia">even deeper looks at the universe</a>, and include detailed breakdowns of the different items, characters, and enemies, as well as exclusive interviews with developers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Creating a Champion is an over 400 page companion to the 2017 game.

        <blockquote><p><em>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers</em> is a Soulslike action RPG set in the land of Shu during the dark and tumultuous late Ming Dynasty, plagued with warring factions and a mysterious illness spawning monstrous creatures.</p><p>Become Wuchang, a skilled pirate warrior struck by amnesia, who must navigate the uncertainties of her mysterious past while afflicted by the horrific Feathering disease. Explore the depths of Shu, enhancing your arsenal and mastering new skills harvested from fallen foes. Evolve your fighting style by sacrificing elusive Red Mercury and further develop new techniques obtained throughout your action-packed journey. Augment the weapons in your repertoire with powerful enchantments, allowing for a unique approach to combat and strategy that suits your personal style.</p><p>Battle against grotesque abominations, drawing on ancient lore to challenge the creeping darkness that threatens the humanity that remains. Your quest for truth will take you through forgotten temples, overgrown ruins, and shadowed paths fraught with peril. As you piece together Wuchang’s lost memories, your choices will lead you to one of several endings—each determined by the choices made, secrets unearthed and the allies you choose to trust.</p><p>Immerse yourself in a rich storyline, dynamic combat system, and breathtaking visuals that offer an unforgettable adventure through lands veiled in chaos and death. Will you reveal the truths of Wuchang’s curse and bring peace to Shu, or will you succumb to the encroaching horrors? The fate of the land rests in your hands.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Developer Larian Studios has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-bids-final-farewell-for-real-this-time">officially bid a fond farewell to Baldur's Gate 3</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-last-ever-major-update-gets-a-long-awaited-release-date">April's massive Update 8 patch</a>, and with the team now focusing on the future, company boss Swen Vincke has shared a little more on why it ultimately decided against releasing a paid DLC expansion for the acclaimed RPG, calling it the "boring" option.
</p>
<p>
Vincke <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-director-hasnt-completely-ruled-out-dlc">first addressed the idea of Baldur's Gate 3 DLC</a> all the way back in September 2023, around a month after the game had launched to a stellar critical and commercial reception. At the time, he said building on the base game would be "very hard" for the team, but "not undoable". But just five months later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">all fan hopes for DLC were dashed</a> when Vincke confirmed the studio was "gonna move on", meaning no DLC and no <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 4. "We are not a company that's made to create DLCs, expansions," he explained. "We tried that actually, a few times. We failed every time - it's not our thing. Life is too short. Our ambitions are very large."
</p>
<p>
And now, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9ss">new interview with Game Spot</a>, Vincke has turned to the topic of DLC once more. When asked why Larian had ultimately opted against creating DLC for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> despite it being such a massive success, he replied, "It's boring, is really the honest answer. We tried to be in the DLC business, talked about that with BG3... there's just no passion... I mean happy player, happy business, but you also need a happy developer for a happy player. What we're doing now makes developers way more happy."

<p>
"We heard it's what we were supposed to do, right? You've got a huge game, a huge hit, and you've gotta make DLC this and DLC that and DLC there... and money's gonna pile up all high! And we just nodded and said, 'Yeah we'll make DLCs'. And then the moment that we had some time to think, we realised, 'What are you doing?'. Progressive insight is not a bad thing, so sometimes you go down the wrong path and then say, 'Oh fuck it', and just change course."
</p>
<p>
As for what Larian is doing now Baldur's Gate 3 is mostly all wrapped up (minus any lingering bug fixes), that remains a mystery. All Vincke would say during his Game Spot interview is that the studio is now "deep in the trenches" of its "next big thing" - a "crazy ambitious" project that's "shaping up quite well". And, of course, it's not the only thing Larian is working on, with Vincke having previously confirmed preparation for a second project is also underway. This, he admitted, is "not the easiest thing in the universe, because we make very complicated games, lots of permutations, lots of agency for players."

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-says-next-game-may-come-in-2029/">Larian Studios</a> boss Swen Vincke shared some of his thoughts on generative AI technology in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9ss">GameSpot</a>. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-fears-that-50-years-from-now-generative-ai-tech-will-replace-game-creators/">other major creators</a> are concerned the technology could eventually replace humans, Vincke doesn't necessarily share that concern.</p>
<p>It's not that Vincke is entirely against using AI and even generative AI in development for Larian Studios. He understands that it could eventually make a developer's work go faster, but he stops short of saying that it would actually make developing a game take less time.</p>
<p>"<em>I think the naive thing is to think that it will shorten them [development times]. I think that it's an age old truth, if you give a developer two years, they're going to take three. The same thing will be the case here, with what you're going to give them in terms of abilities to do stuff . If they have the ability to do things faster, they'll just do more, which is actually what you want.</em>"</p>
<p>But when it comes to the question of humans being replaced by generative AI technology just generating whole sections of games or entire games even to ship, Vincke doesn't think that'll happen. Nor does he think it's advisable to operate in that way, where generative AI is doing everything for you.</p>
<p>"<em>I don't think you would have a competitive advantage if you do, because that is what's going to be available to everybody, right,</em>" Vincke said.</p>
<p>"<em>If the baseline goes up because generation is available to everybody, fine, that's a new reality that we're in. But you're still going to want to create something special on top of that. I think that's where teams like us will make a difference, we're a very boutique team. We're actually crafting the situations and the flow of the story by hand, it's a thing that we do.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>When we talk to people about it, this is always the discussion. 'Oh my god, our jobs are going to disappear,' and, no, but you're just going to work differently, potentially. But you're still going to be making a difference</em>."</p>

These showings will encourage fans to “get loose” and sing and cheer as much as they want. The “Block Party” screenings will take place on Friday. Here’s how WB described them: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Warner Bros.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> has introduced plenty of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-and-different-in-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/">new features and improvements</a> to the game, but some things--namely, Star Wars Easter eggs--have remained untouched.</p><p dir="ltr">When Oblivion was originally launched back in 2006, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith was still fresh in many players' minds, having been released the previous May. In fact, a reference to the fiery ending of the film's infamous "high ground" scene was featured in one of Oblivion's opening quests, and 19 years after the game's initial release, the "Anakin Easter egg" is featured in Oblivion Remastered as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4483834-thelowground.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483834" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4483834-thelowground.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483834"></a><figcaption>You underestimate my power!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4483834-thelowground.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Early on in Oblivion's main quest, players will be directed to Kvatch, a city in Cyrodiil that has come under attack. This is where players will encounter their first Oblivion Gate. Shortly after stepping through the flaming portal to the Plane of Oblivion and dispatching a few enemies, players will encounter an NPC named Ilend Vonius, who comes running up from the left side of the screen. If players head in that direction, they'll pass a large pool of lava which, upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYlF9KLIL4">closer inspection</a>, has a charred corpse lying on its stomach, one arm outstretched toward the player.</p><p dir="ltr">The corpse is burnt to a crisp and missing a few limbs--an obvious reference to the state Anakin Skywalker is left in after losing a lightsaber battle against former friend Obi-Wan Kenobi on the volcanic planet of Mustafar at the end of Episode III. Though the corpse in the Plane of Oblivion clearly didn't make it, Anakin technically survives his encounter with Obi-Wan, but the duel effectively marks the death of Anakin Skywalker and the birth of Darth Vader.</p><p dir="ltr">Revenge of the Sith is <a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1916514570341859548" rel="nofollow ">celebrating its 20th anniversary this year with a theatrical re-release</a>, so it's not too surprising that Oblivion Remastered kept this iconic Easter egg in place and gave it a fresh coat of paint just in time for the infamous duel's 20th anniversary.</p><p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is currently available for Xbox Series X|S and PC.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grace-did-nothing-wrong.1175865/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/grace-sinners<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend, I did my part, joining the legion of theatergoers to see Ryan Coogler's period piece vampire film, <em>Sinners</em>, starring Michael B. Jordan. The film rips: I laughed, I went "Oh shit!" a bunch, and I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shineyezehuhh.bsky.social/post/3lnqlzo2vts2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wept when the credits rolled</a>. In the wake of seeing the film and seriously contemplating seeing it again, I finally peeked at some of the online chatter that <a href="https://x.com/tenstrife/status/1916568111714599378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I'd been avoiding</a> so that I could go into the film with as fresh eyes as an entertainment blogger who has watched its trailers could.&nbsp;</p><p>Given <em>Sinners</em>’ <a href="https://gizmodo.com/sinners-continues-to-take-a-bite-out-of-the-box-office-2000595288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive box office success</a>, it has unsurprisingly become a prime target for highfalutin discourse. Key among this is reductive interpretations, such as framing its message as "<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/invited-to-the-cookout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don't invite white people to the cookout</a>" or heralding religion as the cast's ultimate salvation, both of which fall short of encapsulating the film's essence and depth. However, one interpretation centering on a pivotal decision by an Asian character named Grace has veered into gross, toxic territory about the nature of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/02/983925014/the-history-of-solidarity-between-asian-and-black-americans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solidarity between Black and Asian Americans</a>. What began as lighthearted memes dragging Grace's choice like <a href="https://screenrant.com/avengers-infinity-war-star-lord-worst-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star-Lord's infamous moment in<em> Avengers: Infinity War</em></a> has spiraled into some assuming the role of armchair sociologists to argue her actions reflect transactional and insincere allyship between Black and Asian folks.</p><p>Frankly, the Grace discourse has gotten so out of hand that I feel compelled to tap into my inner <a href="https://youtu.be/49blWCj47AQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">F.D. Signifier</a> and weigh in on how I think these interpretations of the film's East Asian character are reductive and undermine <a href="https://gizmodo.com/in-sinners-honesty-leads-to-freedom-2000591961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the whole point of the film</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Spoilers for the movie you should watch.&nbsp;</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Sinners | Official Trailer 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7joulECTx_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Grace (Li Jun Li) and her husband, Bo Chow (Yao), are an Asian couple who not only share a deep friendship with Michael B. Jordan's Smoke and Stack but also represent the often <a href="https://nextshark.com/sinners-chinese-immigrants-mississippi-delta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under-acknowledged East Asian immigrant community in the Jim Crow-era Mississippi Delta</a>. As local apothecaries, they play a crucial role in supporting their community and are instrumental in helping bring the film's <a href="https://www.timeout.com/chicago/things-to-do/a-brief-history-of-chicago-juke-music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Juke party</a> to life. However, the merriment takes a dark turn when vampires, led by their Irish figurehead, Remmick (Jack O'Connell), surround the shed and start picking folks off one by one. In <em>Sinners</em>, vampires adhere to familiar lore, requiring an invitation to enter homes. However, a unique twist to their transformation is that they become part of a hive mind, with their spirits bound and unable to reach the afterlife unless pierced by a wooden stake. Amid the chaos, Grace asks Bo to retrieve their car so they can return home to their daughter, but tragedy strikes when he is also turned into a vampire.&nbsp;</p><p>As the story moves into the latter half of the second act, the main cast finds themselves in a drawn-out standoff with Remmick's growing vampiric horde. The horde even manipulates their collective consciousness to provoke or tempt the group into inviting them in and embracing eternal life with them. Matters reach a boiling point when Remmick, exploiting Grace's native tongue, gets gross about Grace and Bo's sex life and threatens their daughter. Understandably fed up, Grace bites Stack, whose hand muffles her mouth to keep her from screaming, and invites the vampires in, triggering the film's climactic showdown.&nbsp;</p><p>Many have taken to chirping on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bsolz_/video/7495464264832994603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://x.com/MajestyRia/status/1915496607296160223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, labeling Grace as the film's "<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Crash%20Out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crashout</a>" — yet another piece of Black slang that has increasingly become detached from its original meaning. Others have gone even further, branding Grace as bad optics for Black and Asian solidarity, calling her stupid, selfish, and the most irritating character in the movie. They argue she was never really down with the cause and abandoned her allyship the moment her proximity to whiteness threatened her family's peace, leaving Black folks in a lurch.&nbsp;</p><p>But Grace isn't a mom who acted out of selfishness; she's entirely in the right. Framing her decision as endemic to an "us vs. them" narrative between Asian and Black communities, where she and Bo were supposedly driven solely by profit margins to join the juke party and inevitably betray the group, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marmaryeesa2022/video/7495473894933941547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completely misses the point of the scene</a>. The group was already hesitating over their next move, with the alternative of holding out only leading to Remmick's horde growing stronger, taking over the rest of the town, and leaving them no safe haven. Even if they somehow enlisted the vampire-hunting <a href="https://x.com/bontmercy/status/1915226198231142887" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Choctaw Native American tribe</a> in some hypothetical <a href="https://kotaku.com/ryan-coogler-sinners-spinoff-sequel-theories-1851778090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MCU-styled expanded universe spinoffs</a> (please, no), the odds were stacked against them. <em>Sinners</em> had been building towards this moment, where the juke party inciting a last stand was the best bet to eliminate as many vampires as possible and prevent the threat from escalating further. Why get caught up in the bureaucracy of dealing with vampires when you can nip it in the bud?&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Yes, Sinners is THAT Good" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_l1_sErlPZ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Grace's decision also led to the most metal and heartbreakingly romantic scene in the film — her stabbing Bo in the chest as the two immolate together. It was a tragic end to them, but one that promised she'd reunite with her fine-as-hell husband in the afterlife. Her decision was essential, jolting everyone out of their stalemate and to squabble up; anyone saying otherwise is wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>The rhetoric framing Grace's pivotal decision as emblematic of anti-Black and Asian solidarity is not only gross but also entirely at odds with the film's overarching theme. <em>Sinner</em>s emphasizes how music connects us to our ancestry and builds bonds between folks within America's cultural melting pot. Grace's choice wasn't an act of betrayal — it was the most practical and necessary option given their dire circumstances. Twisting her decision into a narrative about false allyship drowns out the nuanced discussions this film genuinely deserves.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-xbox-microsoft-oblivion-bds"><h3>Big Sales Don’t Mean A Boycott Has Failed</h3></a><p>"You are creating the world you want to live in with very small actions, and that does build out"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ice-water-games-tenderfoot-tactics-xbox-store-removed-bds"><h3>Indie Dev Who Pulled Game From Xbox In Solidarity With Palestinian-Led BDS Hopes Others Will Do The Same</h3></a><p>"It's important to be able to use that limited amount of power to put whatever pressure we can on things"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-new-trailers-dig-into-new-weapons-and-combat/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Senior combat designer at Obsidian Rob Donovan and lead systems designer Kyle Koenig dove into the combat systems and changes to combat and gameplay in<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gets-first-gameplay-video-and-info/"> The Outer Worlds 2</a> in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPlPgane1E">IGN</a>.</p>
<p>They talked a bit about some new changes to player movement, like how you can parkour now in The Outer Worlds 2, meaning that you can grab up onto new areas, slide into cover, and you can even spec your character to be better at things like shooting while sliding.</p>
<p>What they mostly talked about was the design philosophy the team had with combat in The Outer Worlds 2. For example, while you'll have plenty more options regarding how you want to handle a combat encounter, the enemies you'll face have also been designed to try and surprise you, and be more challenging to deal with.</p>
<p>A key aspect of that is the removal of level scaling for The Outer Worlds 2. Donovan described enemies as being classed in "<em>tiers</em>" this time around. So while you'll face a few enemies meant to be a little more difficult for newbies in the game's opening areas, by the time you've explored quite a bit and leveled up, you can return to those opening areas and crush anything in your path.</p>
<p>There was also a lot of thought put into making every path viable in combat, so there's no one playstyle that players feel like they should use, even if it goes against how they want to play the game. That said, Donovan did also state later in the video that the team considers The Outer Worlds 2 to be a "<em>ranged-first</em>" game with&nbsp;"<em>melee in the mix</em>," so players wanting a more melee-focused experience might be let down.</p>
<p>Another interesting point both Donovan and Koenig made was how the team looked at games like Destiny 2 and Call of Duty to try and improve gunplay in The Outer Worlds 2, to ensure that even if you're not creating a character that is going to be the most adept gunslinger, using any gun in your arsenal still feels good.</p>

<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is currently set to arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC sometime later this year, with more information coming on <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">June 8</a>, after Xbox has its big summer showcase for the year.

Especially notable was that local couch co-op battles were limited to a single stage. There was also a fair amount of debate around the character balancing for online competitive play, something the series hasn’t traditionally been known for but which more players expect in the modern world of ranked leaderboards. </p><p>While <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is currently playable on Steam Deck, it remains to be seen how much performance it can squeeze out of the Switch 2. I have a hard time imagining it will  push beyond 30fps, but the cel-shaded art style might hold up surprisingly well in handheld mode. It would be extra neat if the Switch 2 version had special motion control options, harkening back to <em>Tenkaichi 3</em> on Wii, though I’m not holding my breath.</p><p>The game has been getting a steady stream of DLC since it released, with its first set of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut2y8gAv3aY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut2y8gAv3aY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daima characters joining the fighting roster last week</a></span>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Despite being the No. 1 overall best-selling game of the week that ended on April 19, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle did not crack the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lnv3kg5fek2k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">top 15 most-played charts for the US in the same week</a>. What's the reason for that? Circana's Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lnvatx4bgk2v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it may come down to the "modern console environment" being dominated by live-service games.</p><p>"The big live-service games are sucking the air out of the market," Piscatella said.</p><p>On PlayStation and Xbox, Call of Duty: HQ was the No. 1 most popular game of the week based on weekly active users.
