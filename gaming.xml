            <p>
It's been exactly ten years since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> thundered out into the world, and developer Obsidian Entertainment is celebrating the occasion with a new patch and the announcement it'll be adding turn-based combat to the acclaimed old-school RPG.
</p>
<p>
"Coming later this year," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134573-patch-138087535-is-live/">post on its forums</a>, "Watchers will be able to help us test a brand-new feature: turn-based combat. We're excited to explore this new way to experience encounters in Pillars of Eternity, and your feedback will help shape its future." Obsidian says more details on how to participate in the test will be shared "in the near future".
</p>
<p>
That does suggest it could be a while before Pillars of Eternity's turn-based combat mode is ready for its full release, meaning players will just have to make do with classic real-time with pause battling until then. But the wait will hopefully worth it - turn-based combat worked well enough when it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pillars-of-eternity-2-deadfire-getting-a-full-on-turn-based-mode-this-week">introduced to Pillars of Eternity 2 as part of a post-launch update back in 2019</a>, so it should be a welcome addition to the original Pillars of Eternity too.

<p>
In the more immediate term, Obsidian isn't letting today's 10-year anniversary go by without something tangible for fans. It's also released a brand-new Pillars of Eternity update - officially titled Patch 1.3.8.0.87535 - promising a "wide range of fixes and improvements across visuals, combat, quests, and more" that the studio says should make the experience "a little smoother". You'll find the full patch notes at the end of this story.
</p>
<p>
"It's an RPG with design firmly rooted in nostalgia, but one that absolutely doesn't rely on it to be enjoyable today," Eurogamer contributor Richard Cobbett <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pillars-of-eternity-review">said of Pillars of Eternity in his Recommended review</a> ten years ago. "Instead, it's both a great reminder of why those games worked so well, and a brand new adventure well worth the hours upon hours (upon hours upon hours) that it takes to pick away at its secrets and its world."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/4x-game-climate-capitalism-civilization-future<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've historically been an enjoyer of post-apocalyptic media, but as our actual times threaten to become as dystopian as our fiction, I'm finding it a bit harder than usual to stomach doom and gloom during my rare moments of free time.</p><p>Too many games--even some of the most commercially successful ones--are set in futures that are unpleasant at best and outright despairing at worst. <em>Fallout</em>, <em>The Last Of Us</em>, <em>Horizon</em>, <em>Cyberpunk</em>–they're all a huge bummer. I could go on forever listing games like this, but something that's got me especially downbeat about this preoccupation with pessimism is that it's found even in my favourite place, strategy gaming</p><p>The genre could and should do better. It's one thing for a game with a pre-baked narrative to be set in the post-apocalypse, that's a creative team's call. But strategy games are about control, and shaping things, and creating your <em>own</em> stories through decisions and actions.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's take <em>Civ </em>as an example: the 4X genre is so flexible in its actions and outcomes that it's a form of story-telling through systems. Yet even <em>Civ </em>can't escape the lure of Bad Times. Multiple games will not only have the player actively causing a climate emergency, but then be unable to stop it, their only containment measures being to try to clean up pollution as it's caused or adapt to rising sea levels. And every <em>Civ</em>, with the series built as it is on a bedrock of Western ideas of progression and technical advancement, is always pointing towards the same endgame: one where nuclear-armed states fight globally-destructive conflicts, and where ideas about politics and society, which we've been able to shape for thousands of years, end abruptly with the systems we're trapped in today.</p><p>But what if we don't <em>like </em>today? What if we, as players of a genre that can do literally anything it wants with the world, want to imagine and create something else, something <em>better</em>? Why do so many video games see the flaws in our world and follow them to their most depressing conclusions, instead of actively working to rewrite them?</p><p>Let's all watch a short video that explains what I'm talking about. Yeah, it's a yoghurt commercial, but still, I think about it a lot:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dear Alice" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-Ng5ZvrDm4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Dear Alice</em>--which featured a soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi, and is often described as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solarpunk</a>"--is a beautiful piece of animation, and deserved all the credit it received upon release in 2021, but what's made it stick with me so many years later is its outlook. It's a rare vision of the future that doesn't shrug its shoulders and say "we're all fucked", it says "we can fix this". As someone who gets overly-obsessed with climate doomerism far too often for my own good, I want to engage with more media like this.</p><p>I don't want to read too much into a one-minute yoghurt ad (<a href="https://thelinestudio.com/work/chobani" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though you can do that here and check out some art from it if you'd like</a>), but <em>Dear Alice</em> envisages a world where things have got better. There's a sense of community; there's renewable energy; there's a focus on nature and the natural and our place alongside them. Even the skyscrapers of this world are covered in greenery. Future technology still exists, from robot drones to holographic water wheels, but it's on the periphery, serving nature rather than destroying it. Did these people avert a climate disaster by living like this? Or is this how they recovered from one? I don't know! I like thinking about that, though, and it was a recent rewatch of that video that got me thinking about strategy games and the future.</p><figure><figcaption>Not every work of optimistic futurism has to look like a Studio Ghibli film. In a way <em>The Expanse</em> is a feel-good story, because it's a world that managed to react to the climate emergency, even if it came a little too late to stop the sea levels rising. Sure, it now has its own fresh problems, but that's humanity, baby.</figcaption></figure><p>A game I've badly wanted to exist ever since I first saw <em>Civ </em>dabble with climate change is a 4X that doesn't go from 2000BC to today, but one that starts today and goes 2000 years into the future. That doesn't see democracy and capitalism as endpoints, improvements on what's come before, but as the things that need to be improved, or thrown out altogether. </p><p>I want to play a game that has ideas about how money and economies can look in the future, not just about recreating those from the past; games that can picture something, <em>anything </em>else to replace our current obsession with share dividends and quarterly results.<br></p><figure><figcaption>Anno 2070 did a lot of what I'm talking about here, albeit in a pre-baked, city-building game. I'd like something <em>grander</em>, though. </figcaption></figure><p>Surely somebody out there at Firaxis or Paradox or somewhere or <em>anywhere </em>has ideas of their own, or that they can pull from--and I gain physical pain from typing this corny-ass word, but I have to--"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopepunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hopepunk</a>", about what we can replace our current world order with. And, to make it a game, maybe they can pull some different, competing ideas, and pit them against traditionalists and each other, just to make it interesting.</p><p>Like, what could we replace capitalism with? Could we replace it peacefully, or with a second, more heated Cold War? What do we call those ideas, and more importantly, what would their stats and characteristics look like for a 4X game? What effect would implementing something like Universal Basic Income have on a people's productivity and happiness, and what would we be measuring that against? What would "factions" look like: Would Ecofascists clash with AI proponents, who are also at war with a Commonwealth Of Socialist Guilds?</p><p>I have so many questions! How can we mobilise to fix this planet, would a game like this work toward uniting the world behind a single joint effort, or would every faction be left to fend for themselves, doing their part while wheeling and dealing with pacts and treaties? I want to manage the unrest of a robot revolution, I want to see if progressive social ideas married to militarism can overthrow a despotic<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_fascism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Christofascist</a> regime.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Terra Nil - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzVkzahcepY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I know some games have tried at least some of this already; <em>Civ </em>deserves credit for at least modelling an ecological collapse and giving us some tools to mitigate it, <em>Anno 2070</em> has some cool ideas, <a href="https://aftermath.site/synergy-pc-city-builder-impressions-review-moebius" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Synergy </em>is cool with the planet but it’s not <em>our </em>planet</a>, and <em>Alpha Centauri</em> got weird with its sci-fi politics, but again, it’s not Earth. As for <em>Terra Nil, </em>it's an uplifting game about restoring life to a dead planet, but I'd rather terraform the Earth <em>before </em>we're all wiped out and have to send robots from space to clean everything up.</p><p>And I know there's positive media out there, some of it better than others, but I'm not here asking for someone to tell me a story. I'm specifically asking strategy game developers to give me the tools to tell my <em>own </em>story, to explore a future that doesn't select "apocalypse" as the default, but gives us the promise and the hope to do something about our planet before things get that bad.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/social-media-tiktok-instagram-notifications"><h3>Social Media Has Me Ducking My Friends And It Sucks</h3></a><p>We were never meant to have this much always-on access to each other</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-team-members/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/CrystalDynamics/status/1904969991968956833" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on X</a>, Crystal Dynamics made the announcement that they have made the "difficult decision" to reduce the workforce by 17 team members. The studio is most well-known for the Tomb Raider, Legacy of Kain, and Gex series. Most recently, they have released the Tomb Raider remasters as well as Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered, with Perfect Dark and an untitled Tomb Raider game to be announced in the future.</p>
<p>The full statement reads as follows below:</p>
<p><em>This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members. We did not make this decision lightly. Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected.</em></p>
<p><em>We recognize how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach.</em></p>
<p><em>Crystal Dynamics remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games. This change does not alter our current project plans.</em></p>
<p>As said above, Crystal Dynamics is most recently known to be working on an untitled Tomb Raider game as well as a reboot of the Perfect Dark series, with Amazon Games and Xbox Game Studios publishing the titles, respectively.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark was first announced at The Game Awards in 2020 and is set to be released on PC and Xbox Series X|S. It was originally being developed utilizing Unreal Engine 4, but instead, the developers are now using Unreal Engine 5 to increase efficiency. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-initiative-perfect-dark-reboot-crystal-dynamics-embracer/">The Initiative</a> is also helping to develop the title, it was reported in October 2024 that Brian Horton had left the Insomniac Games studio to instead work as a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wolverine-perfect-dark-brian-horton-playstation-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creative Director on Perfect Dark</a>.</p>
<p>The last round of layoffs for Crystal Dynamics took place in 2023 when nine employees were laid off across the marketing division specifically. This took place at a time where its parent company, <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-announces-restructuring-program-crystal-dynamics-says-its-not-affected/">Embracer Group</a>, was making devastating layoffs across its many subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Any layoff, no matter the number, is devastating to hear about, but compared to some of the others that have already taken place this year, Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/5-years-after-avengers-2-years-after-its-last-layoffs-and-who-knows-how-long-before-perfect-dark-and-tomb-raider-return-crystal-dynamics-announces-another-round-of-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has only seen 27 layoffs</a> in a total of three years, while some companies have <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-reportedly-effectively-closed/">experienced closures</a>, multiple layoffs in a year, and worse.</p>
<p>Already this year, there have been an <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated 1,493 employees</a> laid off across a number of studios, ranging from well-off triple-A studios to indie studios finding their footing.</p>

			<p>NEOWIZ took everyone by surprise with Lies of P. The Soulslike game enthralled a lot of fans with its unique setting, which was very loosely inspired by Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio, and its solid Soulslike combat system. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned an 8 out of 10 score on Wccftech</a> and quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-sold-over-1-million-units-in-less-than-a-month-despite-being-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became a million seller</a>.</p>
<p>NEOWIZ is working <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-is-getting-balance-tweaks-dlcs-and-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a sequel</a>, but before that, they are launching a DLC called <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-overture-announced-releasing-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overture</a>. Ahead of the expansion's release, slated for this Summer, we caught up with Game Director Choi Ji-won at San Francisco's Game Developers Conference 2025 to learn more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lies of P: Overture - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfS9uc-CTcs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Lies of P Overture was certainly not what players were expecting after the ending tease from the base game. For those that don't know much about Overture, can you talk a little bit more about that?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, to answer your question, the delay that is shown at the very end of the base game is actually not going to be in Overture. Overture itself, for us, is the completion of the Lies of P game as a whole. It is something that we truly wanted to deliver when we released the base game. It's a sort of continuation of that.</p>
<p><strong>Would you consider releasing Lies of P Overture as a standalone game? The base game just left Game Pass, and there are many customers who are more inclined to buy expansions if they are standalone.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for bringing that up. It's a good question, but allow me to elaborate on our view. Lies of P Overture is an expansion, but it's not separate. It's an opportunity for us to really complete the Lies of P experience. What this means is that it's almost like a developer's cut. We would not be able to deliver it as a separate product because it's so intertwined with the base game. That's how we want customers to experience Lies of P.</p>
<p><strong>When, during a Lies of P playthrough, will players be able to enjoy Overture?</strong></p>
<p>To be precise, around Chapter 9 is when you'll be able to jump into the world of the expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Is that where the Golden Stargazer is?</strong></p>
<p>I don't remember exactly, but I believe so. There is actually an NPC that explains it.</p>
<p><strong>What level of equipment should players acquire before being able to experience Lies of P Overture?</strong></p>
<p>Once you have gotten to Chapter 9, you will be ready to experience the expansion. But even if you have finished the game completely, you will also have a lot of fun with it.</p>
<p><strong>In the feedback, what did fans talk about wanting to see the most in Overture?</strong></p>
<p>There was a lot of feedback. I would categorize it into three main areas: music, story, and combat. We wanted to ensure all three areas had quality and more content to be introduced, so customers will experience an extension in all three areas. That was difficult.</p>
<p><strong>There were many diverse music tracks in Lies of P. Can you give us some teases about what players can expect to hear in Overture?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much for that question. Certainly, there is a lot of interconnectivity between the soundtracks of Overture and the base game. Of course, you'll have to wait to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>Will the cat Spring be important in Lies of P Overture?</strong></p>
<p>Spring is an extremely precious element in the game, so yes.</p>
<p><strong>In the base game, much attention was paid to how the various levels were laid out. They were looping, and secrets were scattered throughout them, but players felt like there weren't many missable secrets. Will Lies of P have more secrets, or will it be similar in this regard?</strong></p>
<p>It's a very interesting question. Yes, you could certainly miss some areas, but you would still experience the game as a whole. We designed Overture so that you would have more adventures to experience.</p>
<p><strong>For players who want to experience those adventures, how is the difficulty in Lies of P Overture going to compare to the base game?</strong></p>
<p>Instead of focusing on setting certain difficulty bars, we focused on what additional fun and diversity of experiences we could add to the game. That's how we approached it philosophically instead of adjusting and setting certain difficulty bars.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Instead of focusing on setting certain difficulty bars, we focused on what additional fun and diversity of experiences we could add to the game. That's how we approached it philosophically. One example is boss fights. Instead of making a boss very, very difficult, we wanted to make boss fights that you haven't experienced before so that it would feel new.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do you have any examples to share of that diversity?</strong></p>
<p>One example is boss fights. Instead of making a boss very, very difficult, we wanted to make boss fights that you haven't experienced before so that it would feel new. I guess that, indirectly, could be related to the difficulty level because it's something new.</p>
<p><strong>Will parrying be as important in Lies of P Overture?</strong></p>
<p>All aspects of combat are very important to us. We wanted to make sure players would be in situations where they could use all these diverse aspects of combat that we have designed.</p>
<p><b>I asked because, in the base game, there is a very notorious clown boss where players have to learn how to parry; otherwise, they really could not progress further.</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that's a very good example where players have to learn certain aspects of the game and learn how to get better at them. In fact, that helped us implement fights in the expansion.</p>
<p><strong>One piece of feedback that I've heard a lot from the original game is that the time spent going from a checkpoint to running back to a boss arena was a chore. It was a lot of time spent between new boss tries. Have you addressed that in Overture?</strong></p>
<p>That's also something we definitely heard a lot and took into consideration when designing the expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the Legion Arm weapons, like the Puppet String, were very popular. Are there going to be more of those?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, certainly. That really is a prime example. We want fans to experience many different things that we provide.</p>
<p><strong>Talking about the length of the experience, can you compare it to certain chapters or maybe just provide an hour count?</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, we cannot be specific about that because we want them to experience Lies of P Overture without having a set of expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Switching topics to the technical side, Lies of P was a very beautiful game and a bit of a showcase for AMD FSR. Will you be implementing the new AMD FSR 4?</strong></p>
<p>For us, the most important things are the user experience and general optimization. We are really putting a lot of effort into these. We cannot go into much detail about the improvements that we are making, but optimization is key.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite weapon combination in Lies of P?</strong></p>
<p>I like everything. I am not lying to you: I really like every one of those combinations because they give us different combat flavors.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

Granted, it’s not like the movie is lacking in characters, and it’s probably a good thing that Marvel isn’t squeezing every single one of them into an already-bloated movie. Will something terrible happen to some of the cast to make space for other heroes to play a role in <em>Avengers: Secret Wars</em>, the sequel premiering in 2027? <em>Infinity War </em>temporarily killed off half the cast so <em>Endgame </em>could focus on a smaller group of heroes, after all, and Cumberbatch has already been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-future-sherlock-sundance-1236281025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-future-sherlock-sundance-1236281025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed to appear in <em>Secret Wars</em></a></span>, so that’s at least one missing hero accounted for. It’s hard to even speculate about what <em>Secret Wars </em>will entail; the last time the MCU did a giant crossover film, it emerged after years of setup and foreshadowing, but that’s largely absent here because the series has been pivoting away from its previous plans in the wake of Kang actor Jonathan Majors’ domestic violence case. Anyway, the big takeaway here for me is that I guess I’ll just have to emotionally prepare myself to not see Star-Lord for at least two more years. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been revealed that Firing Range is returning to Call of Duty when Season 03 launches in Black Ops 6 on April 2. The map has been remastered by Treyarch, which was revealed earlier today on social media. This is the first time the map has been seen in a main multiplayer title since Black Ops 4 in 2018.</p>



<p>Home on the range, indeed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stacked-update">Stacked Update</h2>



<p>Season 03 is set to be one of the most impressive updates in modern Call of Duty history. It will see the return of Verdansk for the first time since 2021, when it was abruptly stripped from Warzone in favour of Caldera. The reappearance of Verdansk is expected to bring back millions of players, many of whom haven’t played Warzone since the map was taken out of the game.</p>



<p>Additionally, Activision’s teams have worked to bring back to life several fan-favourite weapons, such as the Kilo 141, AMAX, and HDR sniper rifle. There will be plenty to get your teeth into on April 2nd, which is when Season 03 goes live in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Treyarch has also revealed that Firing Range will return to Call of Duty on April 2. The remastered map represents one of the most iconic battlegrounds in Call of Duty history. It was a map that first appeared in Black Ops in 2010, and way back then, it was one of the most adored maps in the rotation. </p>











<p>There is plenty in store for Season 03 and beyond, and for once, it seems like Call of Duty is well and truly on the up. Are you excited about the return of Verdansk or Firing Range? Let me know in the comments.</p>

At just $80 (was $120), this is the lowest price we've ever seen for the microSD card. If you're looking to expand your desktop storage, the Samsung 990 Pro 4TB SSD is $280 (was $465) and the Acer Predator 2TB SSD is $113 (was $133). The latter might be the better option, as it can hit similar speeds as the more expensive 990 Pro (but if you truly need 4GB, the Samsung model is an easy recommendation). Samsung is also discounting its Samsung T7 Shield 2TB Portable SSD to $150 (was $285), which gets you excellent drop, dust, and water resistance--making it a great spot to store important files.</p><p><strong>microSD</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B0DRG6MPPC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar 512GB Blue (160MB/s)</a> -- $32.29 (<del>$38</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Compatible-Nintendo-Switch-Smartphones-LMSPLAY001T-BNNNU/dp/B08T8LL7G8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar Play 1TB (160MB/s)</a> -- $63.88 (<del>$130</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Nintendo-Switch-Smartphone-LMSPLAY001T-BNSNU/dp/B0DQYCG9D6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar Play 1TB (205MB/s)</a> -- $88 (<del>$125</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-microSD-MicroSDXC-MB-MD1T0SA-AM/dp/B0CWPNS8JY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Pro Plus 1TB (180MB/s)</a> -- $80 (<del>$120</del>)</li></ul><p><strong>NVMe</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Acer-FA100-Interface-Internal-Technology/dp/B08Z33H1C3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Acer FA100 1TB SSD</a> -- $50 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Predator-GM7000-NVMe-Gaming/dp/B09F5W62N8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Acer Predator 2TB SSD</a> -- $113 (<del>$133</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-2024-P310-PCIe-Gen4/dp/B0D61SDZD2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Crucial P310 2TB SSD</a> -- $159 (<del>$265</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PNY-CS2241-500GB-Internal-Solid/dp/B0BYLG5NCZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PNY CS2241 500GB SSD</a> -- $38 (<del>$49</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Computing-Workstations-MZ-V9P4T0B-AM/dp/B0CHGT1KFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung 990 Pro 4TB SSD</a> -- $280 (<del>$465</del>)</li></ul><p><strong>External Drives</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Portable-Compatible-Tablets-LES3XXX002T-RNSAU/dp/B0DG6WRD8L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar 2TB Portable SSD</a> -- $109 (<del>$180</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SABRENT-External-Aluminum-Transfer-SB-2TB-NAV2/dp/B0BN4MQPF9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sabrent 2TB External SSD</a> -- $170 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-Photographers-MU-PE2T0R-AM/dp/B09VLJ7VBM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung T7 Shield 2TB Portable SSD</a> -- $150 (<del>$285</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SSK-Portable-External-Transmission-Smartphone/dp/B0BGL4SHY8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SSK Portable 1TB SSD</a> -- $63.74 (<del>$83</del>)</li></ul><hr><h2>CPUs</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4466064-mixcollage-26-mar-2025-11-59-am-1820.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466064" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4466064-mixcollage-26-mar-2025-11-59-am-1820.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466064"></a><figcaption>Intel and AMD processors</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4466064-mixcollage-26-mar-2025-11-59-am-1820.jpg"></figure><p>Building or upgrading your rig?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-elon-musk-twitter-ratio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are certain crystalizing moments that drown out all of life’s other tiny cacophonies to reveal essential truths. These arrive thunderously, yet the effect is akin to standing in a pin-drop silent room and watching, in slow motion, as the pin clatters to the ground. Perhaps for you it was the birth of a child, or the death of a close friend. Maybe it was something as simple as realizing you hated your job and needed to find a new one. For me, it happened yesterday: I found myself rooting for a brand account in an online dispute.</p><p>Admittedly, this online dispute happened to involve Elon Musk, the de facto shadow president of the United States – but so do most of them these days. In the other corner was Ubisoft’s official <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> Twitter account. If you’ve even <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-controversies-are-for-babies-and-racists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cursorily been following commentary</a> surrounding the latest game in the series, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, you don’t need me to tell you how dumb these next several sentences are going to be.&nbsp;</p><p>It began with disgraced <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/firefall-mark-kern-sacked-the9-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former bus owner</a> Mark “Grummz” Kern (sentence already at apex stupidity) <a href="https://x.com/Grummz/status/1904590090233667905" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accusing Ubisoft</a> of platforming terrorists by cutting a deal with pro-Palestine leftist Twitch streamer Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker to play <em>Shadows </em>on stream (oh no it got dumber somehow). Musk, who extremely evidently does not have a real job, chimed in <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1904592159862645118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exactly nine minutes later</a> to call Piker a “fraud” and then again <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1904594321199988935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eight minutes after that</a> to correct himself, adding in a new tweet that "'Sell-out' would be more accurate. Objectively, he is promoting a terrible game just for the money." I shouldn’t have to explain that nothing can be objectively terrible because “terrible” is a subjective value to a man who believes himself so intelligent that he uses it as the basis for <a href="https://www.disconnect.blog/p/why-silicon-valley-is-bringing-eugenics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his support of eugenics</a>, but here we are.</p><p>Piker and others both in and out of his orbit proceeded to mock Musk and Kern, and then a couple hours later – drawing on <a href="https://x.com/hasanthehun/status/1904597441011462421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jokes some had already made</a> – the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> account leaped off a nearby rooftop to deliver the finishing blow. "Is that what the guy playing your<em> Path of Exile 2</em> account told you?" regular human Twitter user @assassinscreed replied to Musk, referencing Musk’s self-admitted <a href="https://aftermath.site/elon-musk-treasury-protest-diablo-path-of-exile-cheating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">history of cheating at video games</a>, which he plays on <a href="https://aftermath.site/does-elon-musks-gaming-rig-suck-or-not" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a setup just as embarrassing as everything else about him</a>. The account went on to <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1904661876681699351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">further</a> <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1904669672995254571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advertise</a> <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, which has already <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/assassins-creed-shadows-hits-2-million-players-putting-it-on-track-to-be-the-series-most-successful-game-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold millions of units</a> and clearly has Ubisoft feeling confident, bordering on cocky, after <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/ubisoft-had-an-absolutely-dire-2024-and-desperately-needs-a-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an undeniably rocky period</a>.</p><p>As of now, roughly 24 hours later, Musk’s initial tweets have accrued 20k and 31k likes respectively. The official AC account’s tweet has over 615k. Countless other non-brand accounts have since joined this cathartic mass-dunking, with Kern <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ratboy.bsky.social/post/3llcg3mlb7s2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conspiracy theorizing</a> that foul play must be afoot – and not that if you’re still acting like a sad, horny teenager after nearly six decades on this Earth, people will dislike you – while various other conservative creators are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thepixelrobot.bsky.social/post/3llc36rjjh22b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clutching their pearls</a> over a company account behaving unprofessionally. In other words, more weak crybully shit from the same people who believe you should always be able to make fun of anyone and anything, unless it’s them, in which case it should be illegal.</p><p>So yeah, some of the internet’s – and by extension the world’s – worst and dullest got taken down a peg, further evincing what we already know to be true: These people, despite amassing tremendous influence via the series of broken systems that make up the modern world, which they themselves <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/09/elon-musk-doge-federal-it-national-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believe need to change</a>, are hideously unpopular even on their own platform of choice. Cool! Great! What are we doing here!&nbsp;</p><p>If you told me even a year ago that I’d be tepidly rooting for a brand account associated with a series that can be fun, but which is largely known for its formulaicness, I’d have slapped you, and then myself, in the face. I’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dragon-age-veilguard-review-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said it before</a>, and I’ll say it again: What I dislike most about the rise of right-wing grifters in gaming spaces, aside from all the fascism, is the astounding degradative effect these people have had on how we discuss games in general.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong: This shit was never particularly sophisticated to begin with, but it was better than constant culture war of the week nonsense (that sometimes leads to real-world harassment despite <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-streamer-goes-viral-after-confronting-whining-commenters-normal-people-dont-get-upset-about-this-sh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">categorically not mattering</a>).

It was better than Twitter war bloodsport between a smirking doofus who’s been <a href="https://observationalepidemiology.blogspot.com/2018/06/elon-musk-is-terrible-engineer-and-why.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laughed</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/14/23458247/elon-musk-fires-engineer-correcting-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">out</a> of every serious space he’s stepped foot in and a brand account.&nbsp;It was better than proudly proclaiming you're going to buy a product as a form of performative faux-activism because said brand account, in a shrewd act of advertising, took aim at someone you don't like.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Brand accounts are for making fun of, not siding with. They exist to sell things. Aiding them in that pursuit, whether with likes or dollars, will <a href="https://www.404media.co/you-cant-post-your-way-out-of-fascism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not help stop the rise of fascism</a>. There are <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-election-donald-trump-unions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many, many other ways</a> of doing that.<em> Assassin’s Creed</em>, like <a href="https://aftermath.site/suicide-squad-discourse-impressions-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so many other culture war battlefields before it</a>, is mid. Life is full of actual bounties – real highs and lows, not the beige simulacrum of meaning the internet offers us. Life is also short. When yours ends, today will feel like yesterday as it flashes before your eyes, or you won't remember it at all.

Then the PS5 arrived in 2020 and Sony turned its attention to live-service gaming with the hopes of capturing a piece of the growing multiplayer market. Former executive Shawn Layden, who abruptly left Sony after more than 30 years of service right before the new hardware launched, recently suggested that strategy pivot was part of the reason behind his departure. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197298" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“To be honest, you know, the company was making some strategic decisions about where they want to take the platform in the future with a heavy emphasis in games as a service, live-service gaming, subscription formulas, recurring revenue, whatnot, and that was kind of not my wheelhouse,” Layden, who was Chairman of SIE Worldwide Studios from 2014 to 2019, said in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/AutPkiVDSoQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/AutPkiVDSoQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent podcast interview</a></span> with Save State Plus. </p><p>“I just make things like<em> God of War</em> and <em>Spider-Man </em>and <em>Last of Us</em> and <em>Uncharted </em>[and]<em> Horizon</em>,” he continued, “I didn’t have the vision or the energy to try to, you know, take it to this this new area of live-service gaming so, all that considered, it seemed like a good time to step down after 32 years at Sony.”</p><p>Layden left Sony in September 2019, a little over a year before the launch of the PS5. “His visionary leadership will be greatly missed,” the PlayStation account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1178808151962816514?s=20&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1178808151962816514?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> at the time, “We wish him success in future endeavors and are deeply grateful for his years of service.

When asked about the departure in 2021 and whether it was related to internal disagreements, Layden <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-03/ex-playstation-chief-mulls-future-of-gaming-and-his-new-job?srnd=technology-vp&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-03/ex-playstation-chief-mulls-future-of-gaming-and-his-new-job?srnd=technology-vp&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told<em> Bloomberg</em></a></span> it had simply felt like the right time to “put the pin” in his legacy. “I think I took my time at the moment I saw best to take it,” he said back in 2021. “And I couldn’t be happier.”</p><p>Since then, players have seen Ryan replaced as well in a 2024 corporate reshuffle that temporarily saw PlayStation have two co-CEOs. They’ve also seen the live-service pivot go nowhere quickly. While PS5 sales continue to outpace those of the PS4 in the U.S., even without a price cut over four years into the console generation, there’s a sense that Sony’s live-service ambitions this hardware cycle have come at the expense of delivering more of the single-player hits and experiments with new franchises the publisher’s first-party portfolio has historically been known for. </p><p>And the fruits of the live-service approach have been few and far between. On one side of the ledger is a game like <em>Helldivers 2</em>, which despite its shocking success was technically a second-party game continuing an IP from the PS4 years. On the other side are flops like<em> Concord</em>, the stagnation of <em>Destiny 2</em>, and a graveyard of cancelled projects including everything from <em>The Last of Us Online </em>to a multiplayer <em>God of War </em>spin-off. </p><p>There are still upcoming multiplayer projects from Sony like heist shooter <em>FairGame$ </em>waiting in the wings, but the company has now cancelled far more of them than it previously promised to release by 2026. A spokesperson for Sony told Bloomberg earlier this year that it will continue to make both single-player and multiplayer games, though it’s unclear what the exact ratio will be moving forward. The company recently revealed new single-player projects, including one from Naughty Dog <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128">called <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/saros-release-date-trailer-gameplay-roguelike-1851762075&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/saros-release-date-trailer-gameplay-roguelike-1851762075">one from Housemarque called <em>Saros</em></a></span>, both of which look promising but could still be years away from release. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Hello Games has announced and released a brand new update for No Man’s Sky, dubbing this update with the name Relics. If you have ever wanted to be a space paleontologist then now is your chance, as the worlds of the No Man’s Sky universe are now filled with the bones of ancient creatures. You can find these remains and put them on display, or sell them to the highest bidder. Just be careful, as some of these remains are guarded and won’t be easy to take. The full patch notes are below.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Relics Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B3TWSQHaIMw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<h3><em>COLLECT AND DISPLAY SKELETONS</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Planetary fossil beds now contain a vast array of specific bone formations.</em></li>
<li><em>Each of these bones can be placed as a decorative base part, either individually or mounted on a display plinth.</em></li>
<li><em>Larger display plinths allow a collection of bones to be reassembled into a complete skeleton, allowing the design and reassembly of ancient and extinct beings.</em></li>
<li><em>Completed displays can be packaged into an easily transportable module, allowing them to be re-deployed in other locations, traded with other players, or sold on the galactic market.</em></li>
<li><em>A new planetary dig-site building has been added, serving as a hub for interested fossil collectors.</em></li>
<li><em>The icon for planetary fossils has been improved.</em></li>
<li><em>A small tutorial mission has been added to guide new palaeontologists.</em></li>
<li><em>A new palaeontology section has been added to the guide.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3><em>FOSSIL EXCHANGE</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>A fossil collector has been added to the Space Station.</em></li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/26/cristiano-ronaldo-joins-the-fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-roster/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Look, we get that fighting games will always have guest characters. That is a given but we doubt anyone, except the developers at SNK, would have ever thought that footballer Cristiano Ronaldo would be a fighting game character. Yet here we are, as SNK has announced that Cristiano Ronaldo will be a playable character in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves.</p>
<p><iframe title="FATAL FURY: CotW × CR7｜Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fbeEWm4_qeg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer first shows us Cristiano Ronaldo walking into a room and he soon gets surrounded by Fatal Fury characters. Then he is suddenly in the game, with the brief gameplay clip showing Ronaldo use some of his ball skills as attacks to win a fight. He even does the iconic Siu celebration to mark that he has won the fight. We live in a world where players will pick Cristiano Ronaldo as their main fighter in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves.</p>
<p>So, how has this come to be? Well, SNK is owned almost entirely by MISK Foundation, a Saudi non-profit foundation set up by Mohammed bin Salman, who became Saudi crown prince a few years later. Cristiano Ronaldo, meanwhile, plays his football these days at Al-Nassr FC, one of three clubs in Saudi Arabia which is 75% owned by the Saudi Public Investment Fund. It’s not a direct link from the PIF to MiSK, but they’re certainly working in similar circles.</p>

<p>A second beta test for Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves will be running from March 27th to March 31st, with nine playable characters including Tizoc, Kain R. Heinlein, Rock Howard, Terry Bogard, Hotaru Futaba,&nbsp;B. Jenet, Mai Shiranui, Preecha, and&nbsp;Vox Reaper. There will be online modes including ranked, casual, and room match. Offline modes will include a tutorial and classic versus mode, and stages in both modes will be Training, Bar “Street Stars”, Universal Arena, and Training Ground. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves will be available from April 24th on PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/halo-flashpoint-rise-of-banished-brings-alien-exiles-to-battlefield<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mantic Games' latest expansion for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/halo-flashpoint-spartan-edition-and-paint-set-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Halo Flashpoint</em></a> is now available for pre-order. <em>Halo Flashpoint Rise of the Banished</em> introduces a new enemy faction to the licensed tabletop miniatures game. The same enemy faction introduced in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/halo-wars-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Halo Wars 2</em></a>.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://haloflashpoint.manticgames.com/products/rise-of-the-banished-boxed-set/" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, <em>Halo Flashpoint Rise of the Banished</em> will introduce the titular Banished faction into the game. The set will also include Halo Wars 2 antagonist Warmaster Atriox and the army he convinced to defy the doctrines of The Covenant.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-rise-of-the-banished-miniature-artwork.jpg?itok=nYTHYOBO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-rise-of-the-banished-miniature-artwork.jpg?itok=1F1Ekaee 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With a new faction comes new miniatures, which is the major selling point of <em>Halo Flashpoint Rise of the Banished</em>. It will include eight Jiralhenae (Brute) models, four Sangheili (Elite) models, a limited edition Atriox miniature, brand new terrain pieces, tokens, game cards, sets of dice, and a deluxe playboard.</p>

<p>True to the source material, the Brute miniatures tower over the other miniatures introduced in <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> to this point. Considering the only other miniatures available in the game are Spartans, the difference in size makes a considerable statement.</p>

<p><em>Halo Flashpoint</em> was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mantic-partners-with-343-industries-to-create-halo-miniatures-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in January 2024</a> by Mantic Games. Since its release in November, the UK-based tabletop studio has provided steady support to the game based on Bungie's beloved sci-fi franchise. This support has included several fireteam expansions, a Master Chief miniature, and several map and terrain packs.</p>

<p>Mantic Games' has a respectable catalog of tabletop gaming. Alongside licensed board games based on <em>Hellboy</em>, <em>Invincible</em>, and <em>The Walking Dead</em>, they have produced fast-paced miniatures games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mantic-games-announces-arena-sports-board-game-overdrive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Overdrive</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dreadball-core-game-second-edition-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dreadball</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Halo Flashpoint Rise of the Banished</em> boxed set is available for pre-order now on Mantic Games' web store. It is being sold at an MSRP of $125, not counting shipping, and is expected to ship in July. The miniatures, including the Atriox miniature, will be available shortly after at retailers at an increased MSRP of $212.</p>

It’s unclear just how big a role the X-Men will play in the film, given Marvel still hasn’t properly integrated the mutant team into the cinematic universe yet, but even the actors that have been announced make it sound like the group itself will play a big role in whatever’s going on in the 2026 movie. Stewart and Grammer have both appeared in the MCU as multiverse variants of their characters. A version of Professor X showed up in <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em> as a founding member of the Illuminati, and Beast appeared in the post-credits scene of <em>The Marvels</em>. It’s unclear if the versions who show up in <em>Doomsday </em>will be the original characters from the <em>X-Men</em> films or if more multiverse shenanigans are afoot.</p><p>The MCU has been in a weird place after pivoting away from its planned Kang arc, so even with all these names, there’s not as much foreshadowing or connective tissue to speculate on as there was the last time the series did a big crossover event with <em>Infinity War</em>. I’m curious to see what <em>Doomsday</em> does to tie all these characters together when it hasn’t been given the same ramp-up because right now, this just seems like a recipe for cameo slop. I wonder how much money they had to pay Stewart and McKellen to come back. It’s gotta be some ungodly number, right?</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’re excited to bring <em>Scooby-Doo</em> to TV as a live-action series for the first time,” said Peter Friedlander, vice president of scripted series for Netflix. </p><p>I can’t wait for this show to randomly drop on Netflix with little marketing, get buried by the algorithm and never get a second season while a few angry fans complain about it the whole time. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Corinne Busche, the director of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and longtime BioWare employee, has joined Wizards of the Coast’s Skeleton Key Studio. The news was confirmed in by Wizards of the Coast’s Dan Ayoub.</p>



<p>In a new interview with Stephen Totilo’s <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/hasbro-preps-an-edgy-snake-eyes-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, Ayoub confirmed that Busche has joined the studio as a creative lead on a new game currently in production. It’s the studio’s first game since opening in 2022.</p>



<p>Skeleton Key had been working on two projects, but cut one of them in order to streamline its focus. Since then, Ayoub says that a “vast majority” of those who were working on the cancelled project have moved over to the unannounced game.</p>



<p>News of Busche’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-vielguards-game-director-has-reportedly-left-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">departure from BioWare</a> became public in January. The move comes after she spent 18 years at the Canadian-based studio. Busche has yet to comment publicly on her new role. At the time she said that she didn’t want people to “read too much” into her departure. </p>



<p>“I want to encourage everyone not to read too much into this,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/corinnebusche.bsky.social/post/3lfxyo5h5vk2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">she said</a>. “This was my decision so I could continue making the kind of RPGs you (we) enjoy. Thank you for the outpouring of love and support. You mean the world to me.”</p>



<p>What do you think the new game in development at Skeleton Key is, and Dragon Age’s former director Busche joining the team?

Each joins a catalog of titles available to subscribers of the cheapest PlayStation Plus tier at no additional cost and will remain available until the next batch of games rolls out come May 5. Every game in today’s list is available starting April 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation Plus users will note the April 2025 lineup has a little something for everyone. Teyon and Nacon’s brutally accurate ‘80s love letter, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/robocop-rogue-city"><u>RoboCop: Rogue City</u></a>, is likely the biggest headline for players this month. This first-person shooter puts players into the hulking metal shoes of Alex Murphy himself as he works to save a crime-riddled Detroit from another murderous threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-gets-new-game-plus"><u>its more recent and substantial updates</u></a> arrived in January of last year, granting players access to a much-asked-for New Game Plus mode. With or without a reason to revisit its story mode, we felt RoboCop: Rogue City was worth checking out at launch and gave it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-review"><u>a 7/10</u></a> in our review.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation Plus subscribers looking to scratch that bloody action itch with friends can check out Sumo Digital and Gun Media’s asymmetrical multiplayer adaptation, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre"><u>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</u></a>. Players work to survive – or kill – others in a set-up that pits survivors against the bloodthirsty Slaughter Family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an experience not for the faint of heart that aims to simulate what it might be like to hear Leatherface rev up his iconic chainsaw just feet behind you. In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review"><u>6/10 review</u></a> at launch, we said it offered “a few entertaining, technically challenged hours of fun.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">RoboCop and Leatherface will no doubt get your blood flowing, so it’s nice that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-hackers-memory"><u>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker’s Memory</u></a> is here to bring down the tempo just a bit. Bandai Namco expanded on the already massive digital world of digital monsters with this turn-based monster collector offshoot back in 2018. It’s got more than 320 Digimon to meet and collect as players look at the events of the original Cyber Sleuth story from a new perspective.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As RoboCop, Leatherface, and Agumon make their way onto PlayStation consoles next week, players should make sure to download <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/4-months-after-launch-dragon-age-the-veilguard-headlines-playstation-plus-march-2025-lineup"><u>the March 2025 titles</u></a> while they still have the chance. It was a particularly strong lineup that included Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Sonic Colors: Ultimate, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection. So, if you’re a subscriber or a non-subscriber who has been looking for a good opportunity to sign up, make sure to add all three games to your library before the offer goes away March 31.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

The Surging Sparks expansion is still new enough to feel fresh, and at $45.02, it’s a decent value compared to scalper prices that make you question your financial decisions. If you just want to dip into the latest set without going full collector mode, this is it.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-pald"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Pald">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Paldean Fates Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="0b2e6c81-0c20-41d1-8ea4-1fe90a9f909c" id="217538"><div id="217538" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Paldean Fates Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Shiny Pokémon are back, and apparently so is my addiction to them. The Paldean Fates bundle gives you six chances to pull something sparkly, and while $69.94 isn’t exactly pocket change, I think the potential dopamine hit is worth the gamble. It’s in stock, it ships fast, and I’ve made worse choices at 2 a.m. on eBay.</p></div><p id="the-world-of-dragonlance-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The World of Dragonlance Bundle">The World of Dragonlance Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="0b2e6c81-0c20-41d1-8ea4-1fe90a9f909c" id="217539"><div id="217539" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The World of Dragonlance Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>26 item bundle, pay more for donations to charity "Room to Read".</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not saying this is the nerdiest thing you can buy today, but it’s definitely on the leaderboard.

If you’re the kind of person who rearranges shelf space for something before buying it, I totally get it.</p></div><p id="iniu-portable-charger-225w-20000ma"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU Portable Charger, 22.5W 20000mA">INIU Portable Charger, 22.5W 20000mAh</h2></p><div catalogid="0b2e6c81-0c20-41d1-8ea4-1fe90a9f909c" id="217542"><div id="217542" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU Portable Charger, 22.5W 20000mAh</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This thing charges your phone like it’s got something to prove.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-returns-to-call-of-duty-warzone-here-are-all-the-biggest-changes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> is bringing back the battle royale map that started it all: Verdansk. It’s been just over three years since players last dropped into the beloved location’s iconic POIs, so we’ve taken the time to highlight its biggest changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Verdansk is nothing without each individual building that players spent hundreds of hours dodging (and taking) bullets through – and Activision knows it. That’s why veterans who played the OG Warzone map back when it launched in 2020 will find that its Ukraine-inspired streets, rivers, and structures have been brought back almost completely unaltered. It’s the map you know and love, built from the ground up to suit the updated playstyle introduced with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> and squash a few of the more notable issues players have harped on through the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This version of Verdansk has been painstakingly rebuilt from the ground up to give you the very best battle royale experience possible,” Activision explained today in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-warzone-verdansk-map-return-intel-drop" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. “That experience balances the immersion, adjusted movement mechanics, and the signature gameplay you remember from the original Call of Duty: Warzone with one overriding goal: To relive the classic and nostalgic Verdansk map we all remember.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Kitted Out</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The publisher behind Call of Duty says its return to Warzone’s roots includes a version of Verdansk that is “95%” accurate to its original launch build. It’s been more than three years since the map was retired in late 2021, so naturally, the team felt it was due for at least a few tweaks that shouldn’t interfere with that nostalgic design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One general rule of thumb, of course, is that Verdansk will benefit from improved lighting that falls more in line with the visuals seen in last year’s Black Ops 6. Upgraded visuals on a finer detail level will also be found in locations like Grazna Bridge and those common fire stations, which feature slightly more weathered paint jobs and chunkier bricks. Another example of cosmetic changes to Verdansk’s iconic locations can be found in a weed problem on Storage Town’s roofs, more reflective puddles, and added electric pipework.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your average Call of Duty fan isn’t going to notice the extra blades of grass added to a random field next to the northwest side of Stadium, but what they will notice are some surface-level design tweaks to a few individual POIs. Storage Town Building 3 is one example of a structure that’s been touched up, with Activision explaining that it’s been gifted a ladder in order to nerf its previous spot as an “unfair power position.” As more than a few similar structures have also invested in ladder additions, players will find that other locations, such as the Hangars, now feature repositioned vehicles and additional cover.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdansk Reheated</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you’ve lived one hundred lifetimes in Verdansk’s original incarnation, none of these aforementioned changes are true gamechangers. However, to accommodate things like Black Ops 6’s omnimovement and swimming mechanics, Verdansk needed to receive a few more alterations that are a bit more than skin deep.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Verdansk, a traditionally very snowy map, has had its temperature turned up ever so slightly, resulting in the melting of rivers that were previously frozen. That means you’ll be able to swim in some of the deeper bodies of water like the Kastovian Sea – and make more noise when sprinting through some of the ankle-deep rivers polluting the map. Undrivable vehicles have also been given a facelift to ensure there’s no confusion about whether or not they can be used for a quick getaway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, those steep, rocky trails and cliffsides that you and your friends have almost certainly died at once before have been tweaked to be more forgiving to players on the run. You’ll also notice that tall structures like telephone poles have been slightly shortened, making for less annoying descents into the Warzone. If you find yourself questioning tree placement come April 3, just know that, yes, the team at Activision has made a few minor adjustments to tree placement to shake things up, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, doors react much more dynamically to the action around them, as bullets and explosions can cause them to swing in either direction depending on where impact occurs. Ascenders, which were previously featured in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019 but added post-Verdansk removal, have also been retrofitted to make some of those harder-to-access rooftops easier to reach.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Heads-Up</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While these changes may seem like a lot when all spread out, Activision reiterates that the “vast majority” of Verdansk 2025 has been revived as a “one-to-one duplication.” Examples of areas that remain largely untouched are Karst River Quarry and Superstore, which look and play the same inside and out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the video game-y aspects of Call of Duty: Warzone’s nostalgia play also seek to return to the feeling players had when dropping into the battle royale mode back in 2020. This can be seen in a complete overhaul to Contracts, Public Events, Field Upgrades, vehicles, and even Killstreaks, which have all been reverted to fit the offerings found in the 2020 Verdansk build. That means everything from the OG helicopter to the hum of a nearby chest to that classic loading screen is back.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As other experiences like Fortnite deliver updated takes on classic offerings, it looks like Call of Duty is here to offer its own version of one of its most popular moments in time. So, while something like a lighting tweak may seem inconsequential at first, Activision wants players to know that these changes were made with that infamous Roze skin, for example, in mind. Should everything play out as expected, Verdansk’s reintroduction may provide the definitive way to experience that map ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Warzone brings back Verdansk April 3, 2025. It will launch one day after the introduction of Black Ops 6 Season 3 and following a one-day down period for players. When users boot up Warzone on Verdansk launch day, they’ll be able to enjoy <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-drops-back-into-verdansk-with-limited-time-mode-exclusive-rewards-and-black-ops-6-free-trial">a special, limited-time event called Return to Verdansk</a> that comes with unique cosmetics, sprays, Operators, weapons, and much, much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
