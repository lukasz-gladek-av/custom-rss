            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It was just earlier this year that Activision published<em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-pro-skater-review-is-it-good-levels-1851786124">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</a></em>, a remastered collection of two of the best games in the skateboarding series. But now, after a fun video from Hawk himself, fans are once again begging for a <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground</em> remake to join the series’ slate of recent re-releases.</p> <p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOg329HAQcP/e">Tony Hawk posted a short video on his personal Instagram page</a>. In it, the skateboarding legend re-created the intro cutscene found in the original PS2-era <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground.</em> Here’s the short video:</p> <blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOg329HAQcP/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14">  </blockquote>  <p>In the video, Hawk can be seen taking on the role of the player-created character, even wearing a similar outfit to the one sported by the default character. Using some nice editing, Hawk interacts with the game’s popular villain, <a href="https://kotaku.com/eric-sparrow-thps-3-4-thug-underground-remake-cameo-ps5-1851784341">Eric Sparrow</a>, even calling him a bully at one point. At the very end, Hawk leaves and jokes, “Whoa! I can get off my board?!”, a reference to the fact that in <em>THUG</em> players could, for the first time in franchise history, hop off their skateboards and walk around levels.</p>

 <p>But before you get too excited and assume Tony Hawk is teasing some future <em>Underground</em> remake ala <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-peeing-guy-canada-level-removed-censor-1851786232"><em>THPS 3+4,</em></a> calm down. The video is marked as “Not a <em>THUG</em> promo.” Hawk also claims that the reason he created this short bit of nostalgia bait is to have some fun and celebrate Video Games Day.</p> <p>“In hopes of bringing some joy to your timeline: Happy Video Games Day from E.S. and me,” posted Hawk on Instagram.</p> <p>And like, yeah, I get that he’s trying to make it clear this isn’t a teaser, but of course, the internet is going to internet. Many are already assuming or hoping that this Instagram post is actually the first bit of marketing for a full-on <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground</em> remake. And while I do think a <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground</em> remake is coming one day, I do believe Hawk here, and this is just him having fun with fans. <a href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-underground-thug-remake-remaster-activision-1851780287">The famous skater has said in the past that he would love a <em>THUG</em> remake</a>, but made it clear that he doesn’t get to make that call. It’s all up to Activision, and considering the five-year gap between <em>THPS 1+2</em> and<em> THPS 3+4</em>, I’d suggest fans go play <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/thug-pro"><em>THUGPro</em></a> or something else while they wait for a <em>THUG</em> remake, because it’s likely many years away.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Death to Death Runs]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/death-to-death-runs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-to-death-runs.1298499/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the release of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, the always tiresome debate over difficulty in games has risen again to fuel our never-ending need for discourse. Obviously, that has compelled me to join the fray on the side that death runs are lame and suck and they should die.</p>

<h2>Do I Need to Git Gud?</h2>

<p>I know the response, just git gud, right?</p>

<p>Before I address my ability to git gud, let’s define a death run. Simply, you respawn after you die, and it's the path you have to take to get back to where you died. Sometimes it’s close to where you failed, other times it is not. It’s the other times I have a problem with.</p>

<p>As fun as it may be to throw a classic “git gud” in someone’s face, it’s not really a criticism that works when it comes to death runs. The problem isn't a lack of skill, it's the fact that doing the same piece of content over and over is tedious and boring.</p>



<p>Some may argue that death runs are part of the complete package of something like getting back to a boss. That the obstacles put in your way, the challenges like the platforming or what have you, are all part of the experience.</p>

<p>Think of them like a little “level” of the game where you must reach the end to fight the boss -- classic game design.</p>

<p>Maybe the first time going through the obstacle course that is a death run is really cool and fun, so the whole package does make sense. It's something you really enjoy. Will you enjoy it 5 times from now? 10? In reality, quite a bit more than that?</p>

<p>If doing the same thing over and over is fun for you, more power to you. For a lot of people, myself included, it’s tedium at best.</p>



<p>Especially when the point of so many games that employ death runs, like soulslikes, is overcoming a challenge and besting something difficult – the satisfaction of finally winning.</p>

<p>So, why in the hell would I want to do the same piece of content over and over again that I have already bested?</p>

<h2>Origins of Death Runs</h2>

<p>Naturally, I found myself asking just what is the point of the death runs? Where did they come from and why have they stuck around?</p>

<p>Old-school games are well-known for their difficulty, and they were notorious for having you play the same level or part of a level over and over again. There’s a few reasons for that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some reasons were physical in that cartridges didn't have a ton of memory, so some games had to be smaller, meaning making them more difficult lengthened their playtime. The influence of arcade games can't be overlooked either, where game design was incentivized to up the difficulty so players would fail and be forced to shell out more quarters to keep going.</p>

<p>Then there are the technical limitations like a lack of saving or checkpoints, so each level had to be self-contained and completed in one successful run.</p>



<p>There are certainly more reasons why games were hard and repetitive, but the majority were not made that way with the idea of making the game more fun or enjoyable. Technical limitations and things like incentives to eat up more quarters were more at the forefront than anything else.</p>

<p>At best, old-school games and gamers were just used to the idea that trial and error, throwing yourself at something over and over, was just how you played games. Things like tutorials, saves, and other conveniences we take for granted now just weren’t around.</p>

<p>Now that we no longer have those limitations, I don’t quite see the allure of making players do the same thing over and over again.</p>

<h2>Are Death Runs Good Game Design?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Even if we accept the idea that doing a death run on the way to a boss over and over is a good one, the design goals seem to be in conflict with one another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We want players to fight the boss, right? So, do we make the death run back just as challenging as the normal part of the game? If we don't, doesn't that conflict with the general design elsewhere in the game? If we do, is it maybe unfair or too challenging knowing there's a boss fight waiting at the end?</p>

<p>Also, does it make sense to make players redo content over and over as a sort of "gate" before a boss? Why do we want to make it a chore to get back to the most exciting parts of our game?</p>



<p>Some games seem to ask those questions above during level design, while other's don't consider the run back or where you respawn much at all. That means players are sometimes running through already-played, difficult sections to get back to where they died. Early <em>Souls </em>games are notorious for that in particular.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what do the vast majority of players do with games like that? Run and dodge like hell to avoid any and all enemies on the way back to the boss, praying they don’t get swiped along the way. Thinking of it another way, they aren’t engaging with the designed elements of the game at all, and they’re really only hoping to not be penalized as they run back – no real pay off, just a downside. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Presenting those two ideas -- something easier and therefore less engaging, and something players don’t engage with at all -- can feel disingenuous, but there’s really no middle ground with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, I suppose there’s the third option that makes you do the insane obstacle course or enemy gauntlet prior to a boss every time, which, well, there you really have no option but to git gud I guess.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think a good majority fall into those first two categories, though. So it really begs the question, why do we have them at all then?</p>



<p>Other than to pad some time, what is the reason? I mean, even the kings of this sort of game FromSoftware realized death runs kind of suck when they added the Stakes of Marika in<em> Elden Ring</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At best, death runs are a flawed, incomplete experience of game design that get repetitive. At worst, they are repetitive obstacles in your way that players feel aren't worth engaging with.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Death Runs and Immersion&nbsp;</h2>

<p>A final thing I want to address is a common retort I see online that something like a death run helps immersion or contextualize where you are in a game. I can’t seriously entertain that idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why is one arbitrary point of respawn somehow more immersive than somewhere else? Why is having to run through a part of a game again, likely many times, more immersive?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silksong-bench.jpg?itok=TFqS6N2I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silksong-bench.jpg?itok=e3n-QaTf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The immersion of this bench is that it is cruel and hurtful.</figcaption></figure><p>The answer is it just isn’t. It’s an arbitrary position tied to some sort of save or checkpoint, that’s all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no context gained by seeing the part of a level that leads up to the boss again. You’ve already seen it, and it’s not like dying to a boss wipes your memories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If anything, having to start over far away breaks immersion more, taking you out of the area you just were. Is it not more immersive to remain immersed in that same area, continue the fight?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, I don’t need an arbitrary death run to serve as a “breather” to take a beat before I try a boss fight again. Believe it or not, I'm capable of just waiting and doing that all by myself.</p>

<h2>So Yeah, Death to Death Runs</h2>

<p>From all I can see, death runs are arbitrary and don’t serve much of a purpose than to pad some time. Even the well-intentioned design decisions to have them are flawed at best.</p>

<p>Here I focused on games designed around things like a unique challenge or boss fight as the exciting moment the game builds you up to. There may be some worthwhile discussion on games where they are more level-based, run-based in design.</p>

<p>But that’s a discussion for a different day.</p>

<p>So, death runs, please go away. They waste my time and keep me from engaging with the best parts of a game.</p>

The Persona 5 skins for Overwatch 2 make the game's heroes look exactly as you expect them to, so much so that it is actually a little difficult to realize what hero is underneath the costume.

Mercy, on the other hand, is one of the game's most popular characters and is often featured in crossovers, so her donning the look of Panther is a bit of a no brainer. Blizzard hasn't released the exact prices for the skins just yet, but expect them to be similar to that of previous crossovers, which usually cost around 2,800 ($28) Overwatch Coins per skin bundle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4568295-ow2_x_phantom_thieves_key_art_16x9.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568295" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4568295-ow2_x_phantom_thieves_key_art_16x9.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568295"></a><figcaption>Artwork created for the Overwatch 2 x Persona 5 collab by Atlus artist Shigenori Soejima.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4568295-ow2_x_phantom_thieves_key_art_16x9.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Outside of new skins, a few of Persona 5's visual flourishes will also make their way into Overwatch 2's menus, including a new piece of key art from Atlus character artist Shigenori Soejima.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft shut down the servers for its open-world MMO racing game, The Crew, on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/purchases-and-rewards/article/decommissioning-of-online-services-for-older-legacy-ubisoft-games-n-to-z/000105855">March 31, 2024</a>. It was unfortunate news, but not particularly surprising in today's modern age of online games having an expiration date of 'whenever the developer decides it can't/won't pay for the servers anymore.' But while the occurrence of online games being shuttered is now commonplace, The Crew's shutdown sparked something more.</p>



<p>It not only sparked a lawsuit that made players more aware than ever that they've <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-responds-to-the-crew-lawsuit-tells-prosecuting-players-they-never-owned-their-games/">always been buying a license to play a game</a>, instead of a copy of a game. It sparked enough backlash that Ubisoft committed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/">adding offline modes for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest</a>. It caused enough uproar that <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-now-warns-players-theyre-only-buying-a-license-to-a-game-at-checkout/">Valve added a warning to Steam purchases</a>, making it clear to players they're buying a license to play a game, instead of a copy of the game. And, perhaps most significantly, it was the match that lit the flame under the <a href="https://wccftech.com/publishers-argue-stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-games-prohibitively-expensive/">Stop Killing Games Initiative</a>.</p>



<p>While the Stop Killing Games and the Stop Destroying Videogames initiatives and petitions continue, and the lawsuit two Californian The Crew fans began is still underway, a group called <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/about/">The Crew Unlimited (TCU)</a> has been working hard to bring The Crew back the old-fashioned way, by creating an emulator to run the servers on.</p>



<p>Today, <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/news/?post=news-tcu-release">TCU realized its goal</a>, and players with a copy of the game can jump back into The Crew thanks to their hard work.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="IT'S BACK! Playing The Crew 1 in 2025!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqbKAMq029A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>If you own a copy of The Crew on PC, then you should be able to set TCU up for yourself to continue playing a game that's shutdown seems to have had more of an impact on the videogame industry than it did when it was still being distributed by Ubisoft.</p>

              <p>We’re all familiar with the trolley problem. We’re all so familiar with it that we’re also familiar with all the spoofs of the trolley problem that have sprung up in recent years. But I’m pleased to say I’ve found a fresh take on the entire scenario: even sillier (if smarter) spoofs of the trolley problem. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/"><em>The Trolley Solution</em></a> brings the classic black-and-white sketches to life in a series of video game vignettes, beginning with the classic question, but quickly descending into fantastically funny nonsense, including some completely splendid mini-games, one of which is a visual novel love story.</p> <p>You know how the trolley problem goes:</p> <blockquote><p>“A trolley is rapidly approaching five people tied to the tracks.</p> <p>You have the option to divert the trolley onto a different track.</p> <p>This action would save the five people, but it would kill someone else.</p> <p>What would you do?”</p></blockquote> <p>But in&nbsp;<em>The Trolley Solution</em>, the classic philosophical dilemma and many absurd riffs on it are brought to life in 3D, bringing a whole new level of reality to the hypothetical problem when the crudely animated people splatter into little blobs. What if, for instance, rerouting the trolley would knock a dog’s bone away? Can you really make the choice if it means watching the little doggy look into his empty bowl, his tail down, his head despondently hung? Other new variants it introduces on the classic dilemma are more elaborate and wonderfully original, unlike anything I’ve seen in those overly long Reddit threads where people with undue confidence misattribute philosophical doctrine. For instance,</p> <blockquote><p>“A trolley is quickly approaching your girlfriend, who is tied to the tracks.</p> <p>You have the option to divert the trolley to a different track, but on that track is your best friend, also tied up.</p> <p>However, you discover that your girlfriend has been cheating on you with your best friend.</p> <p>But your best friend didn’t know she was your girlfriend.</p> <p>To complicate things, your best friend is terminally ill and will die of cancer in a month.</p> <p>What will you do?”</p></blockquote>  <p>Honestly, I’m simple enough that I’d have been charmed just by a series of increasingly daft scenarios like these, especially since you get to see each play out, choosing whether to pull the lever or not. But&nbsp;<em>The Trolley Solution</em> is much more ambitious in its daftness. Levels constantly introduce one-off mechanics, at one point seeing the game turn into a perfect spoof of the billions of monochrome “hidden object” games that appeared in the wake of the fantastic&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/hidden-object-puzzle-game-hidden-folks-is-getting-free-1843541062"><em>Hidden Folks</em></a>, here with an entire trolley “hiding” in enormous, screens-wide illustrations packed with visual gags. I scarequote “hiding” given it’s a trolley, and even glasses and a <em>Where’s Waldo</em> hat can’t quite do it. Bless it, it’s trying. (The <em>Where’s Trolley</em> joke works much better in the UK where the books are called <em>Where’s Wally?</em>)</p>

 <p>At another point it becomes a third-person racing game, as you jump between tracks to gather coins and avoid oncoming trolleys. And yes, in one extended and completely brilliant sequence, the game becomes a lampooning visual novel, in which you play a young Japanese girl who, on her way to school, falls in love with a trolley. It has many different endings, one of which describes the situation where the girl and the trolley rush too quickly into an overly committed romance, later realizing the foundations for a lasting relationship had never been established, the two growing to loathe one another, before finally, acrimoniously, breaking up. Another, naturally, results in people getting run over by a trolley. It’s all very romantic. It contains dialogue like,</p> <blockquote><p>“Tameko tells Tomodachi all about her dream. As she talks a weird gut feeling makes her uneasy. She explains the nuances of picking between Deontology and Utilitarianism. It feels like there is something more to it, like a prophecy in the making…”</p></blockquote> <p>As much as I want to blurt out every single surprise game mode that appears, l obviously won’t, but I do have to share one more: There’s an entire Tamagotchi sim in there, in which—yes of course—you must feed, clean, and play with a young trolley until it grows into a happy and profitable adult. “Can you take care of it until it gains monetary and moral stability?” asks the game.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000625734" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625734"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625734">©DanDans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s worth saying&nbsp;<em>The Trolley Solution</em> is not taking anything seriously, and you’re going to see a lot of people get squished in front of trolleys. Because the game’s black and white, and because the human characters are like even simpler <em>Human Fall Flat</em> figures, obviously it’s nothing outlandish, but people sure do go splat when they’re run over. And you will want to note that it does include a moment with someone jumping in front of a trolley. When that happened I shouted, “GOD DAMN IT!” and laughed very hard, because it really wasn’t OK in the best way.</p> <p>I swear, for all the stuff I’ve mentioned, there are so many more surprises in here. There are whole other short games, spoofs of well-known genres I’m dying to tell you about, and while a few of these are perhaps a little over-long (something done five times can be a lot more fun than something done ten times), they’re all so well-realized and funny. There’s a total of 40 levels, each containing its own unique trolley problem situation, and precisely none of them take the conceit seriously. Thank goodness.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000625735" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625735"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625735">©DanDans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I love stumbling on a game like this. I installed it simply because I liked the cartoon art, having no idea where it was heading. It turns out it was heading all over the place, with a wicked sense of humor, and the chops to pull off half a dozen genre spoofs along the way. (And don’t worry if you see the DLC on the Steam store—as much as you can absolutely buy it (and the developer deserves it!), it’s part of a gag.)</p> <p>What a joyfully silly thing to exist. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/">You should go buy it right now, it’s only $6.50</a>.</p>

This time Samus is dispatched to Planet Viewros, where she discovers some interesting psychic abilities in addition to her standard ones. She also goes up against Sylux, another bounty hunter who isn’t happy with the Galactic Federation, or Samus. The game is now available to preorder in physical and digital editions (<a href="https://zdcs.link/z7M2K4?object_uuid=de4695ed-7c1d-4415-a72e-543884d7708e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0FQXR2NPH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>).

There’s Samus solo, aiming her blaster arm. There’s Samus on the extremely cool Vi-O-La motorcycle you get to ride in the game. And there’s the villainous Sylux. Nintendo hasn’t announced what in-game functionality scanning the amiibo will offer, but they’re sure to do something.</p><p id="switch-2-upgrade-pack"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Switch 2 upgrade pack">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Switch 2 Upgrade Pack</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/screenshot-2025-09-15-at-12-33-25-pm-1757954017832.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aXVYPR?object_uuid=de4695ed-7c1d-4415-a72e-543884d7708e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at eShop (digital)</a> - $9.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s say you buy the game for the original Switch, and then you get a Switch 2 later.

It’s had something of a troubled development cycle; after being announced at E3 2017, Nintendo announced in 2019 that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/25/metroid-prime-4-development-restarting-from-the-beginning">development was being restarted</a>. But here it is, six years later, finally coming out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This game puts you in the boots of the bounty hunter Samus and sends you to planet Viewros. There, you’re equipped with a very cool-looking motorcycle called Vi-O-La that lets you zip around large areas quickly. You can jump off ramps and fight aliens while riding, skidding into them as a form of attack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with previous Metroid Prime games, exploration plays a big role. You can scan the alien flora and fauna to find out more about them. You also gain psychic abilities. If you buy the Switch 2 version, you get improved graphics and load times. You can also use the Joy-Con 2 controller as a mouse for aiming, which may offer more precision than the sticks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can find out more in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-metroid-prime-4-beyond-first-hands-on-preview">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond hands-on preview</a>.</p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">007 First Light Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Battlefield 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-clair-obscur-expedition-33-mirror-edition-ps5-xbox-amazon-exclusive">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Mirror Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-where-to-buy">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (Switch, Xbox) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-where-to-buy">Hades 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-switch-2-where-to-buy">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorders">Kirby Air Riders Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-where-to-buy">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch">Pokemon Legends Z-A Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2-for-nintendo-switch-where-to-buy">Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-pc">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

That’s actually just the animation turning on. So if you do see pop-in, it’s probably not pop-in in the traditional sense, but just the vegetation turning on to animate. It’s a little weird looking.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, real-time cutscenes are limited to 30fps, which is a “bit bizarre” because you can abruptly crash to 30 from a higher framerate in gameplay, “which seems a little out of place in a first-person game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DF chief Rich Leadbetter pointed out that Battaglia experienced stutter “on the fastest gaming CPU that money can buy” during the team’s testing, suggesting there's a significant issue here.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, DF commented on the ongoing complaints from PC players about the performance of the game, even on powerful PCs. Battaglia warned against running Borderlands 4 on what’s called the 'Badass' graphics preset, even if your PC should be able to handle it, because what you get from Badass doesn't justify using it over 'Very High.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“On the higher levels, I definitely don’t think you should be turning this game up to Badass,” Battaglia said. “It is woefully inefficient on the Epic setting. It is not good to use. That’s really placebo level stuff, usually. There’s probably some middle ground there that’ll give you a better visual experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DF’s John Linneman added: “This one does seem to be running worse than usual for an Unreal Engine 5 game. It is below where it seems like it should be given how other games using this engine perform.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to DF, the recently released PC update — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-update-to-help-improve-stability-for-a-wide-range-of-pcs-released-but-there-are-no-patch-notes">the one with no patch notes</a> — does not appear to have improved matters. Gearbox has said it will continue to update the game, but PC players will be hoping meaningful patches arrive sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, Gearbox has posted a Borderlands 4 Nvidia Optimization guide on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802577921" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>, advising players how to optimize their graphics settings for “better performance and framerates” on PC with the Nvidia app. Gearbox has also issued a piece of advice to PC gamers that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-asks-pc-gamers-to-keep-playing-for-at-least-15-minutes-after-they-tweak-settings-to-see-how-performance-has-changed-as-negative-steam-reviews-pile-up"><u>to me reads like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game's performance as soon as they’ve changed their settings</u></a>: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>This article contains spoilers for Dying Light and its expansion, The Following. </strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, a continuation of the protagonist’s story from the original game, shambling onto console and PC in the very near future, it’s the perfect time to refresh your memory on Techland’s epic parkour zombie adventure, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light">Dying Light</a>, and its massive expansion, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light-the-following">The Following</a>. With ten years having passed since the original Dying Light, you’d be forgiven for being a bit foggy on the details. Lucky for you, IGN took impeccable notes, so here’s everything you need to know about Dying Light’s story before playing the upcoming sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and this should go without saying, but <strong>spoilers</strong> lie ahead.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/dying-light-1756911774399.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Dying Light quite literally drops you right into its fictional Middle Eastern setting: the city of Harran, which unfortunately has become ground zero to a devastating viral outbreak that transforms people into absolutely terrifying, flesh-eating creatures of darkness – also known as zombies. You play as Kyle Crane, an undercover agent for the Global Relief Effort (GRE), a humanitarian organization. You enter the city under the guise of aiding survivors, but your actual mission is to track down Kadir Suleiman, a political figure who has stolen a file critical to the GRE. If you’re already thinking that maybe the GRE is not exactly squeaky clean, you’ve got great instincts. Follow your gut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your mission quickly goes sideways when you’re attacked by goons acting on behalf of a warlord, then bitten by a zombie and infected with the virus, all within your first few moments in the city, ‘cause you’re super good at your job. With your cover immediately blown and already experiencing the seizures that precede full zombification, you join up with a survivor enclave called The Tower, led by the only person qualified to be in charge during the apocalypse: a parkour instructor – in this case a really cool one named Harris Brecken. You follow his lead, learning the ways of parkour, and undergoing treatment with an experimental drug capable of staving off the effects of the zombie virus called Antizin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You also meet Jade Aldemir, a freerunner and fighter who has a heart of gold and would do anything for Dr. Imran Zere, a scientist working on a cure to the zombie virus, and, of course, her brother, Rahim Aldemir, a reckless guy who you can tell right away isn’t going to make it to the credits.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rais Against The Machine</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/dying-light-kadir-1756912055795.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With your crew of allies established, it’s not long before you’re properly introduced to Dying Light’s villain and the man who stole that GRE file. Kadir “Rais” Suleiman is a self-styled warlord who resorts to ruthless tactics and has a tendency to screw over those who make deals with him – all qualities that frame him as the perfect baddie you just can’t wait to punch right in the face. His crew has been hoarding Antizin and controlling Harran’s black market through intimidation and violence, so you and your crew begin to sabotage his operations and rally survivors against him. Naturally, he bites back by killing Rahim (who again, was very obviously going to die) and kidnapping Doctor Zere. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You go to rescue the good doctor, but get caught and thrown into a pit where you’re forced to fight loads of infected. After surviving the battle, Rais reveals that not only does he know that you’re working for the GRE, but he’s got dirt on them that he’s ready to publish. The plot twist? The GRE was complicit in the outbreak and has plans to weaponize it against its enemies. Yeah, see? Your bosses really weren’t very nice people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You manage to escape from Rais’ clutches and chop off the guy’s hand by suddenly showing off some serious martial arts skills, but Rais manages to escape with his life and Dr. Zere is killed before you can rescue him. Luckily, the fading scientist tells you that he’s given his research to Jade and wants it delivered to a new character, Doctor Camden, in the old part of town.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">GRE-AT at Doing War Crimes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Now having seen the GRE for what it is, you realign yourself with the people of Harran and the friends you’ve made at The Tower. You learn that the defense ministry, working alongside GRE, plans to firebomb the entire city, then claim there were no survivors to begin with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You meet up with some new friendlies in old town and concoct a plan to let the world know that you’re in need of help by setting off a series of charges in a skyscraper in the shape of a burning frowny face. But a fighter jet sinks it right away to cover it all up. You then pivot to climbing to the top of a communications tower and sending out a message to let the world know you’re there. This forces the fire bombing plan to be halted, but the GRE contacts you with a new proposal: bring it the cure Dr. Zere was working on, and you’ll be extracted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, you find out that Rais has kidnapped Jade before that happens – abduction certainly seems to be this guy’s favorite move. You reach her, but find out she’s been bitten and is turning into an infected. Rais gives you a single dose of Antizin and makes you both choose who will survive. Jade insists you take the drug and you’re forced to kill her after she fully transforms into a zombie.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Payback Time</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After mourning your loss and getting even with one of Rais’ goons, you bring the cure samples to Dr. Camden, but you still need to get the rest of Zere’s data from Rais. You go after him and learn that Rais, ever the fan of making the worst deals imaginable, has struck up an arrangement with the GRE to be extracted from Harran in exchange for the data. Naturally, you confront the guy on top of a skyscraper, and make him one final offer he can’t refuse by stabbing him in the neck and letting him fall to his death.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The GRE shows up looking for the data, but you heroically turn your back on the opportunity to save yourself, instead giving the data to Camden to save the people of Harran. A cure seems to be in sight, and it’s at this pivotal juncture that the story of Dying Light draws to a close. But Kyle’s story is not over, and things take a turn for the extremely weird in the game’s expansion...</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Following</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/dying-light-the-following-1756911889310.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After staying in Harran to help the city’s people, you hear a rumor from a crazed survivor that there are people out in the countryside who are immune to infection. The cure Dr. Camden is working on hasn’t made any progress yet, and Antizin is running low, so naturally, you head out to investigate. You quickly discover that the entire region beyond Harran has become enthralled to a cult called The Children of the Sun, who worship a mysterious figure known as The Mother. They perform bizarre rituals and seem way too comfortable getting up close and personal with zombies, but also seem to live without fear of the undead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You start working alongside this cult hoping to learn more, and eventually gain the trust of its super creepy masked officers called The Faceless, agreeing to do their bidding in hopes of bringing their cure back to Harran with you. You eventually learn that good ol’ Rais’ band of thugs are operating in the area, trying to get their hands on the cure themselves. You track them to a dam where The Mother is hiding, but by the time you arrive all of Rais’ men are already dead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s where things get really weird: you finally meet The Mother, and when she takes off her creepy cult mask, you see that she is fully infected – having been transformed into the most dangerous of infected: a Volatile. But bizarrely, she’s not feral like normal zombies, possessing sentience and the ability to speak despite looking like a horrifying corpse monster. She reveals to you that her cure isn’t so much a proper remedy as it is a compromise: she’s able to keep her zombie urges at bay during the day, but at night goes on killing sprees. In other words, she’s a zombie werewolf, more or less. Yikes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Bitter Ends</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/dying-light-the-mother-1756911986516.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mother proposes how you could end the infection once and for all: summon the Sun God. Spoiler alert – she’s talking about a nuclear bomb, which, to be fair, is definitely, technically a cure of sorts. This is where you’re given a choice: agree to help this absolutely insane lich with her plan to kill everyone, or, y’know, not do that. Pretty tough call.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you decide to side with The Mother, you’ll use her nuclear codes to launch a missile into Harran to purge it clean of survivors and infected alike (dope), but in doing so bring about a proper end to the outbreak. This is certainly the more metal of the two options, but given that The Beast will feature Kyle as its protagonist, I’m gonna go ahead and say that maybe this option isn’t exactly canon. Who knows, though. Knock yourself out, king.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alternatively, you can tell the monster to take a hike, but she forces you to drink the elixir, turning you into a sentient zombie. You fight and kill her, collect the vials, and escape the dam. After suffering blackouts, you find yourself outside the confines of Harran and come upon a family playing in a park. It’s at this point you realize you’ve been fully transformed into a volatile and let out a scream, hinting at an impending global apocalypse. Whoops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s where Kyle’s story ends, at least until Dying Light: The Beast arrives. Now, you might be thinking, “how in the heck could they possibly make a sequel to this?” and it’s a fair question. This sequel picks up years after The Following, and you once again play as Kyle Crane, who was apparently captured after the events of The Following by a sociopath called The Baron who experimented on him for 13 years. Now having escaped, he seeks revenge on his former captor and, as the title suggests, has some non-human DNA in him that seems likely to play a substantial role in the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not quite sure what Techland will do to address the branching decision in The Following, or how the heck the studio plans to fill in the 13-year gap, but I can’t wait to see the undoubtedly weird direction it all takes when Dying Light: The Beast arrives on September 19.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-the-story-so-far]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"I know a lot of you are dead set on playing at 4k with ultra max settings and using two or three year old hardware," he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966952362293273013" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote</a>. "You do you, but BL4 and UE5 are doing a lot and for me that trade off for frames isn't worth it. I play at 1440p with settings super high and am super happy with that trade off--the game looks amazing at 1440p. If you're not 4k stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution. If you've got a beast of a video card, you're probably fine at 4k. But if you're in the middle or close to min spec, I would definitely recommend making that trade."</p><p>Pitchford also wrote about how he believes players to have unrealistic hopes for performance from older PC hardware; he characterized many complaints as originating from people who are attempting to run the game on several-year-old PC builds. In response to a comment from a person suggesting Gearbox "build [Borderlands 4] for the most common hardware in the first place," for instance, Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966958001216253985" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote that</a> "Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers."</p><p>"Unlike on PlayStation and Xbox, we cannot prevent a PC player with sub-optimal hardware for the game try to play it," he stated. "So some try and get mad. And some have actual issues we need to fix. And some need to learn how their PCs work at the high end for this specific game in 2025 and use the tools available to them to find the right balance between frame rate, resolution, and graphics features... If you're trying to drive a monster truck with a leaf blower's motor, you're going to be disappointed."</p><p>Alongside expressions of irritation and resistance to the complaints, Pitchford also shared recommendations for "optimizing" performance on PC, including suggestions for using DLSS and tweaking certain settings. Gearbox itself <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/2/596285654384682506/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a PC trouble-shooting guide on Steam to help players navigate potential issues or bugs.</p><p>Anecdotally, it appears that performance issues may occur inconsistently, vary across even minor changes in hardware, or generally be difficult to nail down. PC Gamer and Digital Foundry, for instance, have <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/ive-tested-borderlands-4-on-a-minimum-spec-pc-and-a-monster-rtx-5090-rig-and-it-runs-just-as-borderlands-at-launch-as-youd-expect/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported</a> sluggish frame rates on native resolutions even on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v1ST5qMoaY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top-of-the-line graphics cards</a>. Benchmarks have, not surprisingly, shown <a href="https://pcbench.net/benchmarks/borderlands-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wide variance across hardware and software combinations</a>.</p><p>If you're just diving into Borderlands 4, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-shift-codes-all-active-keys-and-how-to-redeem-them/1100-6533833/" data-ref-id="1100-6533833">ongoing list of Shift codes</a> that you can redeem to grab some cosmetics and items for your character.

                <p dir="ltr">EA has revealed a suite of quality-of-life fixes for The Sims 4, which will release over the next eight weeks. As part of this wave of updates, Sims players can vote on which quality-of-life features and bug fixes they would like to see first.</p><p dir="ltr">First of all, a base game update is set to arrive on September 18 on PC. The update will release five days later on console. This is an earlier release date than was originally planned, which is intended to help the team correct for errors and problems across the multitude of Sims players' set-ups and configs. Additionally, modders and content creators can use the extra time to update their offerings ahead of the upcoming expansion <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-the-sims-4-expansion-brings-vacation-getaways-and-imaginary-friends/1100-6534497/">Adventure Awaits</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In October, the team will continue to monitor the community and provide hotfixes for Adventure Awaits. Finally, another base game update will arrive in November. The update will include fixes, but will also offer new content for all Sims 4 players. EA has not released any information about what this update will feature, but has promised further information will come closer to November.</p><p dir="ltr">If you are a Sims 4 player and want to provide your input on which fixes the team should prioritize, you can log into the <a dir="ltr" href="https://forums.ea.com/category/the-sims-4-en/ideas/the-sims-4-bug-reports-en?ideas.widget.ideamessageswidget-tab-main-wlhmjz-1=mostKudoed&amp;amp;ideas.widget.ideamessageswidget-status-main-wlhmjz-1=in_review" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">official Sims forums</a> and upvote any threads which represent an issue you are experiencing.</p><p dir="ltr">EA recently reaffirmed its commitment to continual updates for The Sims 4, saying that <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-its-sold-too-much-sims-4-dlc-to-make-the-sims-5/1100-6533647/">a Sims 5 is not in the works</a>.

                <p>Rich Lambert, the boss at The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios, has said he hopes to make additional games beyond the popular MMO. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-elder-scrolls-online-heads-on-the-aftermath-of-microsofts-cuts-and-the-future-of-the-long-running-mmo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>, Lambert said he wants The Elder Scrolls Online to succeed and thrive, but diversification is important, too.</p><p>ZeniMax Online Studios was reportedly making a new game called Project Blackbird that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-elder-scrolls-online-teams-reportedly-canceled-mmo/1100-6533760/" data-ref-id="1100-6533760">sounded like a cross between Cyberpunk 2077 and Destiny</a> before it was canceled amid wider cuts at Microsoft.</p><p>"I want to make more games," Lambert said. "I'm not done yet, and the team continues to want to make more games as well. I have lots of ideas. Hopefully we'll be able to share those at some point."</p><p>He added: "I don't think you can ride one thing into forever. I mean, obviously we want ESO to be successful, we want it to be that 30-year MMO, and commit to it. But if you put all your eggs in one basket, there's issues."</p><p>Also in the interview, Lambert shared an ambitious-sounding goal for ZeniMax Online Studios, and that is to be the "most successful studio" across all of ZeniMax. "That's a big thing to say because we've got Bethesda Game Studios, we've got MachineGames, and id--the list goes on. But I want us to be that group that everybody looks at, like we do with [Bethesda Game Studios]," he said.</p><p>Lambert said the track record of Bethesda Game Studios is enviable and has a "massive legacy." Lambert said, "That's what I want us to do."</p><p>The Elder Scrolls Online launched in 2014 for PC before expanding to PS4 and Xbox One in 2015 and then Xbox Series X|S and PS5 in 2021. It debuted as a subscription-based game before shifting to a free-to-play model, and it has <a href="https://x.com/klobrille/status/1849086170770153940" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reached more than 25 million players.</a></p><p>It's been running for more than 10 years, but it's not the longest-running MMO. Blizzard's genre-defining World of Warcraft has been online since 2004, and it's been subscription-based the whole time. The Lord of the Rings Online, meanwhile, has been up and running since 2007. EverQuest, then, has been running for longer than both World of Warcraft and The Lord of the Rings Online.</p><p>In addition to ongoing support for The Elder Scrolls Online, Bethesda is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, but there is no word yet on when it could be released.</p>

Today, Blizzard announced the five heroes who will be suiting up as the vigilante high schoolers, and while I’m excited that one of my mains is getting a collab skin, I’m also glad to see that Kiriko, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s teacher’s pet</span></a><span>, is nowhere to be seen this time around.</span></p> <p><span>Blizzard showed off Wuyang, Genji, Lifeweaver, Mercy, and D.Va sporting costumes based on the Phantom Thieves. These will all be available tomorrow, September 16, and they look, well, pretty much exactly like the characters they’re referencing. There are some interesting details, though, such as the rose petals falling from Mercy’s wings, which are evocative of Ann’s Persona Carmen; Lifeweaver’s flower-petal back piece, meanwhile, has some of Yusuke’s iconography attached to it, and D.Va’s mech has been made to look like Makoto’s motorcycle Persona, Johanna. The full rundown:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Wuyang as Joker (Ren)</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Mercy as Panther (Ann)</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Lifeweaver as Fox (Yusuke)</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>D.Va as Queen (Makoto)</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Genji as Skull (Ryuji)</span></li> </ul> <figure id="attachment_2000625741" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625741"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625741">© Blizzard Entertainment / Atlus</figcaption></figure> <p><span>These skins will likely come with other cosmetics, but Blizzard hasn’t revealed those yet. When the collaboration was first teased, we saw what appeared to be a highlight intro based on </span><i><span>Persona 5</span></i><span>’s All-Out Attack animations, so we’ll see if all five characters get that, or just Wuyang. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/in-defence-of-persona-5-s-ryuji-1797700262"><span>Ryuji</span></a><span> is my favorite </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>character, so I wish I played Genji, but I do play Lifeweaver, so I will be donning the Fox mask for a few matches later this week.</span></p>

			<p>SEGA's latest trailer for the next Sonic game calls out Nintendo, and no, we've not time-travelled back to the 80s/90s. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is due out next week at the time of this writing on September 25, 2025, and ahead of that launch, and the release of a demo this coming Wednesday, September 17, SEGA put out a new trailer showcasing CrossWorlds that included a coy call out to Nintendo's Mario Kart franchise.</p>



<p>The trailer is titled, "<em>Come Race on Our Level</em>," and begins with a blurred image of Mario Kart on one screen with a narrator saying, "<em>We all know that kart racing game. It's great. We don't need to show it to you.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>But what if you can blast through and race on a whole other level?</em>,<em>"</em> the narrator continues, before diving into a showcase of gameplay from Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The trailer goes on to list a few gameplay features in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, and before it ends, takes one more shot at Mario Kart, though the second seems more specifically targeted at <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, by listing a slew of features in CrossWorlds and then saying, "<em>Or, what if you want to roam around on the open road?</em>"</p>



<p>It's all just a bit of fun, of course, but there's a certain tinge of nostalgia the comes from seeing SEGA pull stunts like this.</p>



<p>In any case, players will be able to make up their own minds if Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be worth picking up for their Nintendo Switch 2 consoles or other devices, as a demo will be available on all platforms tomorrow.</p>

			<p>Developer GFA Games has announced today that its upcoming MMOFPS game Pioner will host an Open Beta test at some point in October. The game is still scheduled to launch later this year on PC, with consoles to follow at a later time.</p>



<p>Pioner was actually already available <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-demo-confirmed-for-steam-next-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for a limited time as part of June's Steam Next Fest</a>. Following that test, GFA Games shared some adjustments planned for Pioner's PvP mode:</p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>Current Capture Point Method:</strong> We’re working on making the “Capture the Flag” mode feel more classic. Players will no longer be forced to spend excessive time capturing a flag.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Point Names: </strong>We'll assign point names — A, B, and C — to make it easier for players to navigate the map and communicate with each other.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Enemy visualization in TDM:</strong> We're addressing visibility issues by adding a special type of visualization for enemies (NPCs and players) that makes them stand out against the environment. We're also adjusting lighting components that interfere with visibility.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Player movement:</strong> We’ll work on fixing player movement desynchronization, which can cause noticeable "jitter" in the movement of enemies and allies.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Hit registration:</strong> The netcode is still being fine-tuned. It’s not fully polished yet, which may cause hits not to register or kills/deaths to happen much faster than intended.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Hit collision:</strong> We’ll improve hitbox accuracy on certain environmental objects. We tried to identify as many of these issues as possible before the test, but some may still remain in certain areas of the map.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Balance: </strong>We’ve gathered all the current feedback on PvP weapon balance and will make additional adjustments in the near future.</em></li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>Honestly, though, the game generally felt rough during the Steam Next Fest demo. As someone who has been looking forward to Pioner for a while (you might have guessed it from the two <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviews</a> I previously conducted with GFA Games), I think it could use some additional time in the oven to improve its polish. Still, maybe there was a big improvement in the last four months, so let's check this new build first. Meanwhile, check out the new gameplay trailer embedded above.</p>

            <p>This news story about Fata Deum is written in homage of a random early access Steam reviewer who remarks that if you've never played a god sim before, they're kind of like idle sims. My word, the casually ferocious and embittered atheist poetry of that. Consider my fedora tipped, milords and ladies. I'm off to read the Screwtape Letters again.</p>
<p>Fata Deum isn't just any born-again idle sim. It pays overt homage to Lionhead's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-white">Black &amp; White</a>, with higgledy-piggledy 3D island maps and a familiar hand cursor, used to carry believers to safety or lob them into the sea. There are some significant differences, however. </p><!--more-->

<p>For one thing, you don't get a Creature avatar to first mold in your holy image and then end up squabbling with when you decide to do an Old-New Testament of sorts, flipping from Benign to Vengeful or vice versa midway through a campaign.</p><p>Ah, I remember how my Lion Creature kept extinguishing the houses I smote with thunderbolts, exactly as I'd taught him when he was a cub, and I was a smiling beard in the sky rather than a cosmic arsonist. I'm sorry to see less of that in Fata Deum, but the upside of not having a Creature is that you'll spend less of this god sim cleaning up godbeast turds.</p>
<p>Another difference is that Fata Deum operates around a day-night split encompassing two genres of godliness. By day, you're more of an indirect presence, influencing villagers through visions and blessings. By night, you can intervene directly to make them build stuff and, if you like, raid the dominions of rival gods. </p>
<p>There's a familiar spectrum of Nice and Nasty divine behaviour. You can sacrifice villagers to raise demons or turn the corpses into zombies. Or you can pat them on the head and have them throw wild parties. Or you can mix it up - a little from column Altruism, a little from column Bastard.</p>
<p>There are other gods to worry about. They include deities of Violence, Deceit, Fertility and Pleasure. Each god's behaviour is reflected in the appearance of the terrain. I don't see one for Idleness in the trailers or on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1330360/Fata_Deum__The_God_Sim/">the Steam page</a> - I guess I'll have to thrash that one out myself, by leaving the PC running for 10,000 years.

</p><p>Developers 42 Bits Entertainment plan to keep this humming along in early access till late 2026. "We firmly believe that reviving the god game genre is a rather difficult task that can only be successfully accomplished through intensive dialogue with the community," they note. Do you consider the god sim in need of reviving? I thought last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reus-2">Reus 2</a> did a pretty fine job of it myself. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> was one of the most surprising announcements to come out of last week’s Nintendo Direct. It’s yet another remake for the often overlooked PS1-era Japanese RPG, and it’ll arrive amid a recent influx of other<em> Dragon Quest</em> remasters. This one has my full attention, though, and not just because the original game is a sprawling adventure I’ve always wanted to go back to and properly finish. It’s also the art style, which moves past the recent obsession with HD-2D pixel art glow-ups and offers a blueprint for how to revive tons of other beloved JRPG classics.</p> <p>The new “hand-crafted” aesthetic is more akin to the toys-and-dioramas-style visuals of<em> Yoshi’s Woolly World</em> or the<em>&nbsp;Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em> remake than what we’re used to getting from Square Enix. <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> <em>Reimagined</em> sits somewhere between the HD-2D retro sensibility of last year’s excellent <em>Dragon Quest III</em> remake and the hyper-realistic, Unreal Engine visuals of the <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>remake trilogy, with detailed graphics that exaggerate the storybook whimsy of Akira Toriyama’s original designs rather than running away from them.</p> <p>The big secret to this new look? Scanning actual dolls. Hi-res captures of IRL toys for characters like Hero, Kiefer, and Maribel helped ground the new art style while retaining all of the whimsy. “For this game, we scanned figurines, like this one here, to create the in-game models,” the remake’s producer said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTTfUC4MUZs">a short overview</a> with series creator Yuji Horii. “They’re very well done. Using a graphical aesthetic we call the ‘diorama style,’ we’ve depicted the stories and the characters’ emotions in an entirely new way.”</p>

 <p>The game isn’t far away either. It comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 1, and Switch 2 on February 5, 2026 (one small bummer is that the Switch 2 physical version is a game key card only and progress <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1nfv3i9/dragon_quest_vii_reimagined_the_switch_2_version/">doesn’t transfer</a> between the two console generations).</p>  <p>Alongside exploring dungeons, engaging in familiar turn-based battles, and tinkering with a meaty job system, <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> revolves around an island-hopping adventure that sees its heroes time-traveling between the past and present as they confront the Demon Lord Orgodemir. It’s a very, very long game, clocking in at up to 100 hours just for the main story. Despite the heft, it was mostly overlooked when it first came to PlayStation due in part to its dated-looking graphics. It didn’t get localized in the West until 2001 after the PS2 was already out and just a month before the arrival of <em>Final Fantasy X</em>.</p>

 <p><em>Dragon Quest VII</em> got a second look when it was remade for the 3DS in 2013 as <i>Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten</i> <em>Past</em>. It completely overhauled the graphics into 3D polygons and abridged much of the story to shave dozens of hours off the average runtime. <em>Reimagined</em> will make further improvements, including an even more streamlined story and new quality-of-life features like a redesigned UI to make the game easier to navigate. But the most pivotal change will probably be the new “Moonlighting” mechanic that lets characters use abilities from two different jobs simultaneously.</p> <p>We’ve seen Square Enix take all sorts of different approaches to reviving its back catalog in recent years. While <em>FFVII</em> got the full remake treatment, other PS1 games like <em>Chrono Cross</em> and <em>Legend of Mana</em> have simply received HD resolution boosts and additional features that would be considered barebones even by the standards of a third-party emulator. Then there’s stuff in the middle like <em>Dragon Quest III</em> and <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> which are ground-up overhauls that still try to remain as faithful the originals as possible.</p> <p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em><em>&nbsp;</em>offers a fourth alternative that would be perfect for other games like the original <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, which Toriyama also designed the characters for. It even looks perfect for seemingly impossible-to-remake RPGs from other publishers like <em>Earthbound</em>. Players have been sharing fan art of that SNES classic in the style of <em>Reimagined</em> for decades now. We even recently <a href="https://noisypixel.net/earthbound-clay-figure-set-hobonichi/">got new clay models</a> of the main cast that are perfect for scanning. I hope the <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined </em>model proves to be viable for projects beyond Square Enix, though I could certainly see it working for something like the long-rumored <em>Final Fantasy IX </em>remake as well.</p>

                <p>Sony has spoken once again about exactly how it is utilizing AI in video game development, which it says allows it to accelerate and streaming the process. The company has already utilized some AI use with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">Spider-Man 2</a> and even tested some models <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-uses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate-new-ai-tech-and-its-about-as-impressive-as-youd-expect/1100-6530023/" data-ref-id="1100-6530023">using Horizon Zero Dawn's Aloy</a>. However, Sony believes AI should support creativity, not replace it, according to its own mission statement about its own AI tool called Enterprise LLM, which helps employees across the company use AI safely.</p><p>According to its <a href="https://sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2025_E.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2025 corporate report</a>, since 2023, over 50,000 people in 210 different teams have started using this system. Employees are using it not just for chat or writing help, but also by connecting it directly to their daily work tools. So far, Sony has tested more than 300 AI projects, with over 50 now part of regular work routines.</p><p>To make sure AI is used safely, Sony is also working closely with teams that focus on legal issues, privacy, and ethics. In the process, clearer rules are being created for how AI should be used, especially to avoid problems like copying music or other content without permission. The company is also using AI to help protect creators' work by building systems that can detect if something has been stolen or used without approval. At the same time, Sony is using AI to make older movies sound better and to improve picture quality on the PS5 with new upscaling tech.</p><p>Some in the gaming industry agree that changes like these are needed. Masahiro Sakurai, the famous game developer known for Kirby and Super Smash Bros., said big games take too much time and effort to make and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">that the current way of doing things can't last</a>. He believes AI could help teams work faster and smarter, especially in large game studios. Sakurai said only the studios that adapt to AI will be able to keep up in the future.</p><p>AI in gaming is still a hot topic. Some companies, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-uses-generative-ai-for-some-content-activision-admits/1100-6529691/" data-ref-id="1100-6529691">Activision, are already using AI tools during game development</a>, but say they don't use AI to replace creative work <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-embraces-ai-but-not-to-replace-humans/1100-6534113/" data-ref-id="1100-6534113">as everything is still "human-created and touched."</a></p><p>Others are more cautious and have genuine concerns. Last year, a deal between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sag-aftra-approves-ai-voice-acting-for-video-games/1100-6520224/" data-ref-id="1100-6520224">SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, and an AI voice company called Replica Studios caused controversy</a>. This past May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-companies-make-key-ai-concession-in-latest-offer-to-end-actors-strike/1100-6531513/" data-ref-id="1100-6531513">a group of video game companies made important changes to their offer in an effort to end the actors' strike led by SAG-AFTRA</a>. Since the beginning of the strike, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-actor-strike-ends-today/1100-6532363/" data-ref-id="1100-6532363">which finally ended in June</a>, SAG-AFTRA had pushed for stronger protections around how these digital replicas are used and how actors are paid for them.</p><p>Samantha Beart, who played Karlach in Baldur's Gate 3, has criticized the use of AI in the entertainment industry for short-term profit, warning that it could lead to long-term damage. Beart emphasized <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-actor-says-ai-could-destroy-the-reputation-of-game-companies/1100-6530278/" data-ref-id="1100-6530278">that actors won't back down in the fight against AI</a>, as accepting it could mean giving up their careers. She added that while the industry is filled with passionate, creative people, it's being influenced by investors who don't play games and are only focused on quick returns.</p><p>Even Microsoft, which had reaffirmed its $80 billion investment in artificial intelligence for 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">openly acknowledged that AI advancements will lead to job losses</a>--a long-anticipated consequence in certain sectors.</p>
