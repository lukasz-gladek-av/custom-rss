Still, this Halloween feels different, more terrifying—it’s not the witches and ghouls roaming the streets.

<p>Ubisoft has held a company call to update shareholders on the first-half performance of FY 2024. This call was pitted with negativity, with the firm’s leadership expressing a downturn in the portfolio that has led to drops as significant as -28.9% year-on-year. </p>



<p>While playtime and MAU counts are <strong>up</strong>, spending is down, and the recent poor performance of Star Wars: Outlaws has caused further internal issues at a time when things are already critical. However, the company’s CEO, Yves Guillemot, has reassured everyone that despite XDefiant’s woes, games-as-a-service remains a core strategy moving forward.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-much-to-say">Not Much to Say</h2>



<p>In one question lobbied at Ubisoft’s CEO during the recent financial call, the radio silence around XDefiant was noted. One analyst questioned why Ubisoft wasn’t talking about XDefiant and asked if it was an example of games-as-a-service not panning out for the firm.</p>



<p>To that, Yves Guillemot said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>XDefiant is behind our expectations but the games-as-a-service strategy remains core.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>XDefiant was released in May 2024 as a live-service first-person shooter, and it’s due to kick off its third season of content in the coming months. Unfortunately for Ubisoft, the shooter has been plagued with issues since it dropped, and despite it being free and readily available, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the player count has dwindled</a> and gamers have lost interest.</p>



<p>And now, games like Black Ops 6 have stripped XDefiant’s audience to the bare bones.</p>



<p>In the recent earnings call, Ubisoft confirmed that sales were down 19.6% year-on-year, and back-cat net bookings were down by as much as 28.9%. Despite the drop in sales, playtime is up 9% and MAUs across Ubisoft’s suite of games sit at around 37 million, which marks a 3% increase YoY.</p>



<p>Yves Guillemot continued to reassure shareholders:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Despite recent setbacks, we are continuing to deeply transform Ubisoft in order to restore the level of creativity and innovation that built Ubisoft’s success while delivering stronger execution and predictability.</p>



<p>To succeed, we must redouble our focus on execution and reinforce a player-centric mindset in everything we do. For example, we are improving the quality of Star Wars Outlaws, including actively addressing player feedback through title updates as we get ready for the Steam launch, the first story pack, and the upcoming holiday season. </p>



<p>We are also taking the additional time to ensure that the upcoming very ambitious opus in our flagship franchise, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, is a highly polished, exceptional experience on day one and that it resonates strongly with players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ubisoft has been in several tricky spots over the last few months, dealing with strikes, concerns of historical inaccuracies in the upcoming Assassin’s Creed Shadows (which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may have contributed to delays</a>), and suffering with the weight of layoffs and tightening purse strings.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr.1023453/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's only a little over a week before the first (and possibly last, given Microsoft's apparent lack of plans to do another Xbox One X-type launch) console refresh of this generation, the PS5 Pro, launches globally.</p>
<p>As we approach the release date, more developers are talking about their experience with the hardware. Earlier today, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-key-feature-could-be-pssr-says-dying-light-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> an excerpt from an interview in which Dying Light Franchise Director Tymon Smektala mentioned how PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution could be more important than the other hardware advancements.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we can now reinforce that opinion with similar impressions from our PS5 Pro Q&amp;A with Nexon's Engine Programmer Junhwan Kim, who worked on the enhancements coming to the free-to-play looter shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-celebrates-10m-players-in-first-week-responds-to-allegations-of-copying-destiny-2-icons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The First Descendant</a>. Kim also believes that PSSR is the console's most impressive feature and even went as far as saying its image quality stands up to any other upscalers on the market, including NVIDIA DLSS. Interestingly, they decided to mix PSSR upscaling with AMD FSR frame generation.</p>
<p>Read the full Q&amp;A below. As a reminder, the PS5 Pro is out on November 7 for $699/£699/€799. The First Descendant, on the other hand, has recently received the second update of its first season of live service.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Descendant│Season 1 Invasion│Second Update Preview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yfw3KggPuzc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the PS5 Pro's hardware? What's the single feature you were most impressed with?</strong></p>
<p>Considering that the PS5 Pro is a performance-enhanced model rather than a full-fledged successor, it has achieved significant performance improvements in many areas. As you already know, it is based on three main features: enhanced GPU performance, improved ray-tracing architecture with a new command set, and AI-driven upscaling. The most impressive aspect during the PS5 Pro adaptation process was the AI-driven upscaling technology known as PSSR. On the existing PS5 base model, the FSR Image Upscaling feature is typically used, which has some drawbacks, such as pixel ghosting and pixel jittering during the pixel reconstruction process. The PS5 Pro's Image Upscaling based on PSSR minimizes these weaknesses and delivers highly impressive results.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro-PS5 difference is similar or reduced (e.g., the advancement is less pronounced)?</strong></p>
<p>The difference between the PS4 and PS4 Pro was mainly in the enhanced CPU and GPU performance, as well as some optimization methods that enabled near-4K image output using techniques like Checkerboard rendering. I believe this created a noticeable distinction between the two. The difference between the PS5 and PS5 Pro shares a similar goal with the previous generation, but the approach this time was distinctly different and much more interesting, resulting in significantly improved outcomes. I think this is a suitable way to advance at the current generation.</p>
<p><strong>How much of an improvement is there between the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions of the game?</strong></p>
<p>For The First Descendant, we aimed to provide higher resolution and more ray-tracing features on the PS5 Pro. In terms of ray tracing, we achieved enhancements with expanded features such as ray-traced ambient occlusion, ray-traced Lumen diffuse, ray-traced opaque, and translucency surface reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Also, how does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game? Will the PS5 Pro version support the same ray tracing effects as the PC version with the same quality?</strong></p>
<p>Providing the same quality as a high-end PC is a very challenging task. The team did their best to add as many features as possible to deliver the best possible image quality and performance.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be different modes for the PS5 Pro version of The First Descendant?</strong></p>
<p>The original PS5 base model offered FSR upscaling and FSR frame generation features. On the PS5 Pro, we provide an option that combines PSSR with FSR frame generation, allowing for a higher-resolution, high-frame-rate experience compared to before.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using PSSR? What do you think about it compared to other upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS?</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, we actively adopted PSSR. Each upscaling technology has its own advantages and disadvantages. PSSR delivers image quality that stands up to comparison with any other upscaling technology.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/team17s-sintopia-lets-you-manage-your-own-bureaucratic-hell.1023450/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sintopia-team17-hell-manager<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Piraknights and publisher Team17 have announced&nbsp;<em>Sintopia</em>, a management sim in which you must oversee a nightmarishly bureaucratic vision of Hell.</p>

<p>In a press release, Team17 and Piraknights describe&nbsp;<em>Sintopia&nbsp;</em>as a "God simulation game", although "Satan simulation game" might be a more appropriate description. Rather uniquely, it promises an asymmetrical dual-world style of gameplay.</p>

<p>Your time will be split between the Overworld and Hell. In the Overworld, you'll watch as future Hell recruits "damn themselves by committing a host of sins", and then in Hell, you'll punish those souls and use them to fuel your empire.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/team17-sintopia-management.jpg?itok=I9WAzAVA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/team17-sintopia-management.jpg?itok=AC-ibKxF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sintopia&nbsp;</em>asks the question: what if Hell was a bureaucracy, and you were in charge?</figcaption></figure><p>The premise reminds me quite strongly of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/red-tape-brings-bureaucratic-horror-on-valentines-day"><em>Red Tape</em></a>, but rather than zooming in on a particular damned soul's journey through Hell, this is what it looks like when the camera is pulled back and the whole sordid business (literally) is on display.</p>

<p>This being a management sim, you will, of course, be able to shape and mold Hell to your darkest desires, building facilities and placing them wherever you want. After all, who's going to stop you?</p>

<p>You'll also have to watch out for your souls building up the sins they accumulate throughout their lives. Too much sin could result in what Piraknights calls a "demonic invasion", and that doesn't sound like something you'd want to deal with.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Sintopia</em>, which shows off the game's devilishly humorous take on the world below, right here.</p>




<p>It's also likely that&nbsp;<em>Sintopia&nbsp;</em>is inspired by the likes of 2003's&nbsp;<em>Heaven and Hell</em>, and it's got overtones of&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Keeper&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Evil Genius&nbsp;</em>about it as well.</p>

<p><em>Sintopia&nbsp;</em>is due to land on PC via Steam Early Access sometime next year. We don't have a more concrete release window for the game yet, unfortunately. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>One of my favourite satires is the Screwtape Letters, an epistolary novel by Narnia scribe C.S. Lewis. It consists of messages from an oily elder demon to his nephew about how to correctly groom the soul of an unsuspecting human being. It's a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up. Sintopia is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/two-point-campus">Two Point</a> incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other. Say your prayers and watch the trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>French developers Piraknights describe themselves as "part pirates, part knights", but I think they're lying. In all my years of doing this, I've never heard of pirates and knights joining forces to make a video game. No, I refuse to accept that it's a joke. Similarly, I refuse to believe that there are only 17 people working for Team 17, who are publishing the game. This is all some kind of diabolical deception - a classic Screwtape ruse. The only thing we can trust here is the announcement press release, which contains some blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sintopia is a mix of builder and God game, with an asymmetrical loop. On the OVERWORLD, influence a silly civilization of chickpea people make their mark on the world and unfortunately for them, damn themselves by committing a host of sins. Punish the dead souls, keep your receipts for accounts and generate profit to help you build and sustain your Hellish empire.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's hard to get a precise sense of the game flow but this seems like a jolly take on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management sim</a> fundamentals. One additional wrinkle is that you don't want the aforesaid chickpea people to get <em>too</em> sinful, because this will give Hell explosive indigestion (I am partial to chickpeas and can attest that this is a risk). "Make sure your souls go through an effective "re-education" to avoid a build-up of their Sins across many lives," the press release cautions. "No one wants to face the demonic invasion that will inevitably result from having too much corruption in the world."</p>
<p>There doesn't appear to be a store page for Sintopia yet, but you can read a bit more on <a href="https://www.piraknights.com/games">the game's official site</a>. It's coming to early access in 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The adaptation (which was first revealed by <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3837643/the-studio-behind-saw-brings-iconic-horror-game-outlast-to-the-big-screen-exclusive/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloody Disgusting</a>) is being led by horror producer Roy Lee (It, Barbarian, Late Night with the Devil).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">JT Perry, who served as the primary writer on the Outlast games, is working on the screenplay. In a statement, Perry called the adaptation "an incredible opportunity to dive deeper into the characters and killers we love.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/30/outlast-1730307482226.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Outlast is the latest horror video game to get a film adaptation.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lionsgate hasn't revealed too much else about how closely it'll follow the plot of the games, but it does promise to capture the horror elements Outlast become known for — "immersive atmosphere, chilling sound design, and relentless suspense" — in its announcement. Further information, including a release window, is still pending, but it's still very early days. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When Outlast launched in 2012, it changed the landscape of horror gaming, setting a new standard for immersion in the genre,” Lee said in a statement. “Its deep, emergent lore has provided a perfect foundation for creating a film that delves into the psychological and physical horrors at the core of the franchise. I’m excited to bring this unique world to life for both new viewers and the series’ dedicated fans.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As die-hard fans of horror across every medium, at Red Barrels we are great admirers of Roy Lee’s and Lionsgate’s work," added David Chateauneuf, co-founder and creative director at Red Barrels. "Horror movies old and new have had an undeniable impact on our franchise over the years, and to now have the opportunity to work on an Outlast film with true horror legends is a dream, or should I say, nightmare, come true."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Outlast released in 2013, and the first-person psychological survival game quickly gained traction for that aforementioned immersive horror atmosphere. Outlast followed journalist Miles Upshur as he investigated a remote psychiatric hospital, but its 2017 standalone sequel picked up on another cast of characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most recently, Red Barrels released multiplayer game The Outlast Trials last year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outlast-trials-review">IGN gave it a 7/10</a>, calling it "a bloody cooperative horror game that burns brightly, but fizzles after a few enjoyable hours."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's only the latest horror video game to head to the big screen, with Five Nights at Freddy's 2 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-2-gets-2025-release-date-m3gan-20-moves-back-one-month">coming next December</a> and an Until Dawn film <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-film-adaptation-gets-2025-release-date">releasing next April</a>.

                <p>Anyone with the extremely specific requirement of wanting to play a turn-based strategy game on console that has "Songs Of" in its title can look forward to <em>two </em>games arriving next month. In a bizarre coincidence, both Songs of Silence and Songs of Conquest announced on the same day that they'd be headed to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, and in an even weirder twist of fate, they'll arrive a day apart from one another. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/songs-of-conquest/" data-ref-id="5000-497698">Songs of Conquest</a> will be out first for consoles on November 12, and it'll be followed by Songs of Silence on November 13.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Toadsanime/status/1851282509897605616" rel="nofollow ">Lost in Cult marketing director Ryan T.

Another prime example here would be The Outer Worlds and The Outer Wilds, as people often mixed the names of these two games up as they were released in the same year.</p><p>It's worth noting that while there are some similarities between these two games, they also put their own distinct stamps on the turn-based strategy genre. Songs of Silence is a good-looking 4X strategy game that aims to make battles feel more fast-paced, while Songs of Conquest is inspired by '90s games and will appeal to anyone who enjoys micromanaging their kingdoms and resources.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within's next content update has been detailed, and in addition to introducing a whole new zone to explore (something usually reserved for major raid tier patches), it will add a mount first teased over a decade ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Update 11.0.7 will bring players to the Siren Isle, where an expedition is underway to investigate a mysterious signal and discover what happened to the Kul Tiran forces that once occupied the island. The update will introduce two new questlines that will continue The War Within's story, one dealing with the aftermath of the destruction of Dalaran and the mages of the Kirin Tor, and another that will serve as a prologue to the game's 11.1 update, with Blizzard teasing the return of a "familiar face."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbXcFW7g-o0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vbXcFW7g-o0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Siren Isle in many ways looks to mimic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-return-to-the-forbidden-reach-update-lands-on-march-21/1100-6512141/" data-ref-id="1100-6512141">Dragonflight's 10.0.7 update</a>, which similarly introduced a new endgame zone (in that case, a repurposed version of the Dracthyr starting zone). Just like the Forbidden Reach, players will be able to snag a powerful ring as part of the Siren Isle questline that can be outfitted with special gems granting unique powers.

Thrayir, Eyes of the Siren, as the Stormcrow mount is now officially named, will also be joined by other earnable mounts and transmog appearances Blizzard said were unused from previous years. In a preview video detailing the update, Blizzard said it was excited to get the old, unused content "into the players' hands" and that "they've seen them in the files long enough."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4392467-stormcrowmount.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392467" data-ratio="0.56238805970149" data-width="1675" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4392467-stormcrowmount.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392467"></a><figcaption>Thrayir, Eyes of the Siren, as seen in the 11.0.7 update video.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4392467-stormcrowmount.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Other additions coming in patch 11.0.7 include new Arathi elf-ear customization options for human and Kul Tiran characters, and even the return of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-plunderstorm-blizzards-take-on-battle-royale-makes-traditional-mmo-gameplay-walk-the-plank/1100-6521859/" data-ref-id="1100-6521859">Plunderstorm, WoW's take on a battle royale</a> that first debuted earlier this year.

As Mara Forest, an improbably young federal agent, you’re exploring an abandoned park in search of its reclusive owner when you’re attacked by strange mutants. From there, it’s a struggle to stay alive, save the handful of other people in the park, and still accomplish your stated goal.</p><p>Most of <em>Crow Country </em>is creepy without being scary, with a deliberate appeal towards nostalgia.

It’s a fast-moving six-hour campfire story that really comes alive in its second half. The real value to picking it up is if you’ve got a teenager or precocious kid who’s interested in playing some creepy games for Halloween.

As of October 29, it’s just released a new update that’s added several locations, tweaked its balance, and thrown in a few more puzzles. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a393a361711150be920733a2d563c083" data-recommend-id="image://a393a361711150be920733a2d563c083" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Swansea talks to a character stuck in yellow foam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Swansea talks to a character stuck in yellow foam." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wrong Organ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a393a361711150be920733a2d563c083" data-recommend-id="image://a393a361711150be920733a2d563c083" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Swansea talks to a character stuck in yellow foam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It almost takes longer to explain<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.headwaregames.com/hollowbody&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.headwaregames.com/hollowbody" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <em>Mouthwashing</em></a></span><em> </em>than it does to play. It’s a psychological thriller about space truckers who crash their ship, then go insane while waiting for a rescue that probably isn’t coming. The title of the game comes from their cargo, which turns out to be nothing more valuable than gallons upon gallons of 15 percent ABV mouthwash.</p><p>The word I keep coming back to is “bleak.” <em>Mouthwashing </em>starts off as a narrative-led adventure game, then occasionally turns into stealth/action as its characters degenerate. It’s also more willing to play with its basic presentation than any game has been since maybe <em>Eternal Darkness</em>, as it often abruptly transitions between scenes with effects that look like a hard crash.</p><p>It’s short, at around four hours, but if you take the trip, you’ll be thinking about this one for a while.

All of these can be true at once. <em>Signalis </em>is a dream. Old rules no longer apply.</p><p>It’s by turns oppressive, frightening, and surreal, with a visual style that’s uniquely its own.

Whether you’re a seasoned veteran of developer BioWare’s fantasy RPGs or a newcomer looking to see what all the fuss is about, it’s worth noting that <em>The Veilguard </em>represents a pretty drastic shift from the tactical, open-zone RPG gameplay of its predecessor, <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. So no matter what your previous experience, there are a few things worth noting before you dive into this long-awaited return to Thedas. I’ve put over 60 hours into the game, so here are a few things I’ve learned for you to keep in mind as you get started.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

My most honest recommendation is to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-inquisition-origins-what-to-play-1851538846&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-inquisition-origins-what-to-play-1851538846">play through all of the <em>Dragon Age</em> games and a few pieces of DLC</a></span>, but if you just don’t have the time and patience for all that, at least read or watch a summary of the events of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>and its <em>Trespasser </em>DLC. <em>The Veilguard </em>will give you a brief and kind of vague recounting of a few details when you boot it up, but it’s woefully insufficient in giving you a full sense of what led to the game’s opening moments.</p><h2 id="h195451"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t pick your faction based on fashion</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> shows off several casual outfits and “aspirational” armors tied to your hero’s faction in the character creator. The faction you choose for Rook (the protagonist) gives the character a backstory that ties them to different places and cultures within the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe. But if you’re anything like me, you’re trying to serve at any given moment in an RPG, and I was conflicted about my faction choice because I wanted one of the sluttier outfits. However, this is your PSA that every casual outfit and aspirational armor you see in the character creator is available later in the game, so make the choice based on the story you want to tell, rather than the clothes you want to wear. You’ll find these outfits and armors in stores tied to their respective faction when you reach them in your playthrough.</p><h2 id="h195452"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t accidentally skip the Inquisitor customization screen</strong></h2><p><em>The Veilguard </em>lets you create two characters at the beginning of the game. One is Rook, the hero you’ll be playing as, and the other is the Inquisitor, the protagonist from 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. However, while the screen to customize the latter isn’t buried, it’s not as visually apparent as it probably should be. On the last two pages of Rook’s customization, you’ll see an option on the right-hand side to go to a different screen to create the Inquisitor and make three choices from the last game that will carry over. Unfortunately, it’s entirely possible to miss this screen, and the game doesn’t do much to direct your attention to it. You won’t have another chance to make the Inquisitor or these choices, and if you don’t, you’ll get hit with a default that might look and think nothing like your old hero.</p><h2 id="h195453"><a id=""></a><strong>You can only sell valuables at certain stores</strong></h2><p>Speaking of in-game shops, you’ll pick up a lot of valuables throughout your adventure that only exist to be sold to merchants you meet in Thedas. However, you might notice that not every shopkeeper is looking to buy your garbage. Each region has a specific merchant that is tied to the local faction, such as the Shadow Dragons in Minrathous or the Antivan Crows in Treviso. These will have a specific menu option to let you sell valuables, as well as upgrade their shops with other materials you find on your quests. Selling valuables to these shops will also increase the faction’s power, which is another way to improve relationships with groups beyond doing their quest lines.</p><figure id="" data-id="762f6348a9201b4b80094245e887c8c0" data-recommend-id="image://762f6348a9201b4b80094245e887c8c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Harding looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Harding looks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="762f6348a9201b4b80094245e887c8c0" data-recommend-id="image://762f6348a9201b4b80094245e887c8c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Harding looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h195454"><a id=""></a><strong>Keep an eye out for gifts for your teammates</strong></h2><p>Like in previous <em>Dragon Age</em> games, you can give gifts to your companions for an approval boost. (However, you unfortunately don’t get a new conversation out of it.) You can typically find these in the various shops around Thedas, with the gift often corresponding to the companion whose faction is based in that region.</p><h2 id="h195455"><a id=""></a><strong>Dodge-roll into potion pots</strong></h2><p>Throughout <em>The Veilguard</em>, you’ll see green pots that have a healing potion inside them. While the most obvious route to breaking these open would be to hit them with your sword/axe/dagger/orb, one strategy I used during frantic boss fights was to just dodge-roll into them. This will still break the pot and have you grab the potion as you pass through it, and won’t lock you into a static animation that leaves you vulnerable to an attack. “Do a barrel roll, Rook!” - Varric, probably</p><h2 id="h195456"><a id=""></a><strong>Look for conversations around the Lighthouse, not just in companion rooms</strong></h2><p>For most of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s companion conversations, you can rely on lit-up lanterns outside each character’s quarters to know when your party members want to talk to you. However, a lot of banter and side conversations are happening around the Lighthouse throughout the game, and you’ll have to seek these exchanges out. You can see if some characters aren’t in their rooms through the map, so check it every time you come to the Lighthouse because folks are rarely in the same place twice. You can stumble upon party members talking to each other, or they might have an observation to share with you, so be sure to make your rounds every time you head back to home base.</p><h2 id="h195457"><a id=""></a><strong>Never sacrifice power for fashion or vice versa</strong></h2><p>We touched on how your fashion doesn’t have to be determined by your faction, but it also doesn’t have to be determined by stats. <em>The Veilguard </em>has a pretty straightforward transmog system that lets you equip your most powerful armor and weapons while also placing a custom appearance on top of it. My mage Rook sports a slick Shadow Dragon leather armor set while also getting the stats of ill-fitting metal armor meant for the tankiest of warriors. Best of both worlds, baby. You can edit your appearance in Rook’s room in their wardrobe.</p><h2 id="h195458"><a id=""></a><strong>You can change your appearance throughout the game</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s character creator is extensive, and odds are you’ll spend a lot of time making your Rook look exactly how you want them to. But if you start playing the game and find you don’t like how something looks, you can tweak your appearance at any point by examining the mirror in the infirmary. So don’t get so caught up in the finer details that you feel like you can’t actually start playing the game until your Rook looks “perfect.”</p><h2 id="h195459"><a id=""></a><strong>You can respec at any time</strong></h2><p>If you’re not feeling the abilities or specialization you’ve picked a few hours in, <em>The Veilguard </em>lets you respec from the Skills menu at any time. This is a good way to encourage experimentation and let you feel out every build option in the game. I was pretty happy with the dagger-based Spellblade specialization, but if I wanted to, I could reset all my Rook’s points and try out a drastically different play style without any drawbacks. So try things out without worrying that you’re committing to any one build.</p><figure id="" data-id="a441954010decbde0605c0bbe8c2ef6b" data-recommend-id="image://a441954010decbde0605c0bbe8c2ef6b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Davrin and Rook kiss as Assan walks toward them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Davrin and Rook kiss as Assan walks toward them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a441954010decbde0605c0bbe8c2ef6b" data-recommend-id="image://a441954010decbde0605c0bbe8c2ef6b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Davrin and Rook kiss as Assan walks toward them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h195460"><a id=""></a><strong>Romance has no restrictions</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> is known for its diverse romances that are also restricted based on gender and race. However, <em>The Veilguard </em>has no such restrictions. The sequel thankfully manages to avoid the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394">“playersexual” trope</a></span> by establishing that each of its characters are pansexual rather than letting that just feel like something that’s defined by the player’s presence, but if you were concerned that you needed to play a certain gender or race to wife up your favorite companion, worry not.</p><h2 id="h195461"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t neglect the memory quests</strong></h2><p>There’s a series of quests in <em>The Veilguard </em>that I can’t believe is optional, but it is. Spread across The Crossroads, a hub that connects all the other regions you can explore in the game, these quests involve flashbacks to antagonist Solas’ past, and each one contains a debrief with the team that has some major <em>Dragon Age </em>lore drops. You’ll have to seek them out, so be on the lookout for translucent, glowing barriers throughout The Crossroads, as walking through these will give you a glimpse into the elven god’s past.</p><h2 id="h195462"><a id=""></a><strong>Read the missives</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>has an equivalent to <em>Mass Effect</em>’s email system called Missives. You’ll get pop-up notifications that you received a new one when you return to the Lighthouse after most quests. These letters will come from companions and people you met around Thedas, and give you some notable insight into things going on outside your field of view in the <em>Dragon Age</em> world. Unfortunately, they’re buried in the pause menu next to the codex, rather than somewhere like the email terminals in <em>Mass Effect</em>, so it can be easy to forget about them if you don’t make a point to seek them out.</p><figure id="" data-id="4fcbf9850acd216c620fc204b9b130fb" data-recommend-id="image://4fcbf9850acd216c620fc204b9b130fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook slices through a foe with a magic knife." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook slices through a foe with a magic knife." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fcbf9850acd216c620fc204b9b130fb" data-recommend-id="image://4fcbf9850acd216c620fc204b9b130fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook slices through a foe with a magic knife." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h195463"><a id=""></a><strong>Revives are attached to equipment</strong></h2><p>If you die in <em>The Veilguard</em>, you’ll notice there’s a “Revive” option next to the one that lets you reload a previous save. By default, you won’t be able to actually use the Revive function to stand right back up where you were in the fight, even as the game taunts you with the possibility on the game over screen. Revives are tied to rare pieces of equipment you’ll find for your companions. Having those revive charges will let your party members resuscitate you when you fall in battle, but that option will come at the expense of other utilities and upgrades. It’s a meaningful trade-off, but there was never a point where I wasn’t glad to have a revive on hand.</p><h2 id="h195464"><a id=""></a><strong>You can make your Rook trans, but you need to pick the option when you see it</strong></h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607">We wrote about this already</a></span>, but if you missed it, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>has an option to explicitly make your Rook trans early in the game. When you set up your hero’s quarters, you’ll place a handheld mirror down and have a moment for self-reflection. Here you’re able to pick dialogue options that confirm your Rook is trans, which unlocks new dialogue options to discuss this with other characters. However, as far as I can tell, this is the only chance the game gives you to make this decision. If that’s the route you want to go with your Rook, don’t miss it.</p><h2 id="h195465"><a id=""></a><strong>You can import your Rook when you start a new playthrough, but there’s no New Game+</strong></h2><p>For some reason, <em>Dragon Age</em> games never have New Game+ and <em>The Veilguard </em>is no exception. However, BioWare did do one thing right on this front, as it still allows you to import your Rook’s appearance into new playthroughs. So if you’re like me and get attached to the characters you make and want to run them again in your second playthrough, you can do that, unlike in previous <em>Dragon Age </em>games that made you recreate them every time. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Amid a raft of announcement for new Apple hardware this week, developer CD Projekt has announced its bringing open-world sci-fi RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> to Macs "early next year".
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077 originally released in December 2020 to, it would be fair to say, a decidedly mixed reception. Since then, however, CD Projekt has finessed its launch day offering, fixing bugs and expanding on some of the game's more heavily criticised elements (albeit jettisoning a promised multiplayer mode in the process), with the general sentiment being that Cyberpunk 2077 was in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saving-cyberpunk-2077-how-cd-projekt-red-recovered-from-one-of-video-games-most-disastrous-launches">pretty great place</a> by the time last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion arrived.
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say that Mac users should have a good time when Cyberpunk 2077 launches for the platform next year. It'll be available for all Apple Silicon devices via the Mac App Store and Steam, with CD Projekt <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/50947/just-announced-cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-coming-to-mac">promising</a> "advanced features like path tracing, frame generation, and built-in Spatial Audio for even more immersive gameplay and stunning visuals."

<p>
Cyberpunk 2077 arrives on Mac in the form of an Ultimate Edition, bundling together the base game and CD Projekt's acclaimed Phantom Liberty expansion - which Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-liberty-is-a-remarkable-expansion-and-a-bittersweet-end-for-cyberpunk-2077">called</a> an "instant recommendation if you enjoy the universe". Additionally, owners of Cyberpunk 2077 for PC on Steam will gain access to the Mac version when it launches.
</p><p>
Cyberpunk 2077's Mac release follows a bit of a push from Apple to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-is-mac-on-the-verge-of-a-gaming-revolution-cyberpunk-hogwarts-and-dead-space-tested-w-game-porting-toolkit">tempt more triple-A titles to its hardware</a> in recent times, with the likes of Resident Evil 7, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> all having comes to the company's computers and iOS devices in recent times. The results have been mixed from a technical perspective, as Digital Foundry has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-death-strandings-ios-and-macos-ports-are-a-mixed-bag">been reporting</a>, and the iOS market has seemingly been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">reluctant to buy into full-price AAA games</a>. Still, with Capcom returning to release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-2-remake-heading-to-iphone-and-mac-in-december">Resident Evil 2 Remake on Mac and iOS this December</a>, and CD Projekt having a go next year, publishers clearly see some potential.
</p>
<p>
Away from Cyberpunk 2077, CD Projekt is currently deep in development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> (officially referred to as "the first instalment in the new Witcher saga"), with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-the-witcher-4-will-enter-full-production-soon">update in August</a> confirming pre-production was almost over and full production was due to start "soon".

While the main goal is to dig at the barrow, the town’s web of residents and happenings sucks you in. Whether you are digging out on the moors, relaxing at the local tavern, or exploring the small town at night, the one constant is an overwhelming sense of smallness and dread in the isolated village.</p><p>Much like being on a ship at night and not seeing anything around for miles, the moors Thomasina finds herself in make Bewlay feel like the last bastion of humanity in any direction. The moors themselves are particularly threatening in their sprawling emptiness, which has led to folktales about them spreading amongst the villagers.

But none of that exists in <em>The Excavation of Hob’s Barrow</em>. Instead, there is an ever-prescient sense that you do not belong on the moors and that you cannot fathom the horrible things that lurk within them. The atmosphere of the game unnerves you at every turn but makes going down the rabbit hole enticing thanks to a well-written central mystery. For anybody looking for something more unique to play for Halloween, this is the game for you.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In contrast, the spirit entity known as Hyoki, exists solely to eliminate every Slitterhead. As the fight unfolds, secrets about this world will be revealed, intertwining the fates of both humans and creatures in a narrative that gradually unveils the complexities of humanity itself. </p><p>Slitterheads are mysterious creatures lurking in Kowlong, posing a threat to civilization. After consuming a human brain, they mimic the head and animate the corpse to disguise themselves as humans.</p><p>When preying on humans, they take on a “Pupal Form,” with the human head replaced by a grotesque visage, extending tentacles to target their prey’s brain. Slitterheads acquire memory and genetic information from the human brain, allowing them to imitate personalities. Each Slitterhead’s behavior varies, ranging from aimlessly wandering the streets to manipulating humans at the core of large organizations.</p><p><em>—Pupal Form</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_055.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_056.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_057.jpg"></a></figure><p>When the human body they inhabit suffers damage, they switch to a new victim’s body. However, they cannot operate independently or for long periods away from a host.</p><p>When they sense danger, they absorb the host’s bodily fluids to grow into a “Complete Form,” exposing their true nature and significantly increasing their power. They have integrated genes from various mimetic organisms, including insects, fish, and mollusks, resulting in a diverse range of appearances. While they primarily adopt a mantis-like posture, they can alter their form based on the situation, standing upright on two legs or climbing through gaps like a spider.</p><p><em>—Common Octopus Slitterhead</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_058.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_059.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Warty Frogfish Slitterhead</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_060.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_061.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Orchid Mantis Slitterhead</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_062.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_063.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Himomushi</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_064.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_065.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Dokumushi</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_066.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_067.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Tamamushi</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_068.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_069.jpg"></a></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Sony is keeping the spooky season going with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games for November 2024, with three titles that all subscribers will get a hold of from next week that include remade horror, an anime spin-off and some toy car racing – this last one’s not horror…</p>
<h2>What are the PS Plus November 2024 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 5th November.</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/21/ghostwire-tokyo-review-ps5/"><strong>Ghostwire: Tokyo</strong></a> (PS5)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/17/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-review/"><strong>Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 – Turbocharged</strong></a> (PS5|PS4)</li>
<li><strong>Death Note Killer Within</strong> (PS5|PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ghostwire: Tokyo is in intriguing spooky time in Tokyo, with plenty of Japanese mythology fed into a first person action game.&nbsp;We scored in the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/21/ghostwire-tokyo-review-ps5/">8/10 in our review</a>, with Nick saying “Ghostwire: Tokyo was not the game I was expecting from Tango Gameworks, but I definitely enjoyed it. Blending magic-filled FPS action with Japanese mythology and an open world Tokyo that reminds me of the Yakuza series, it stands out from the crowd even if it’s not truly groundbreaking. Ghostwire has a lot of potential as a new franchise and I’m looking forward to seeing what Tango Gameworks does with it next.”</p>

<p>Ghostwire: Tokyo was one of the last Bethesda games signed to PlayStation exclusivity before Microsoft snapped up the publisher. Not only that, but it’s ended up being the penultimate game from Tango Gameworks before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/09/xbox-exec-tells-staff-they-want-more-smaller-games-just-like-hi-fi-rush-one-day-after-closing-its-studio/">Microsoft decided to close the company</a> – though it’s now been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/12/tango-gameworks-is-back-as-krafton-revives-hi-fi-rush-studio/">saved by Krafton</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside that is the high-octane arcade racing of Hot Wheels Unleashed 2, a souped up sequel that delighted Ade in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/17/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-review/">our review</a>. he said, “Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 Turbocharged is like Hot Wheels Unleashed, but better in every single conceivable way. Frenetically fluid and stonkingly fast, this is a quality arcade racer that will slap smiles on the faces of both young and old alike. Just don’t mention the single-player campaign.”</p>

<p>And the month is rounded out by Death Note Killer Within, a social deduction game based on the popular murder book anime series. With up to 10 players, you’ll be split into two teams with different objectives, either to eliminate L or seize the Death Note, while also trying to figure out everyone’s identities from varying roles and characteristics. That certainly sounds a lot like the high stakes intrigue of the source material!</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the October 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab October’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 5th November October, so make sure to grab them while you can! They are:</p>

<p>The 2025 season for Valorant Challengers is just around the corner, and in a recent press release, Riot Games unveiled some new changes and updates to the format and schedule for the APAC region. Here is everything we know as of now. </p>



<h2 id="h-academy-teams-to-join-valorant-challengers-in-2025">Academy Teams to Join Valorant Challengers in 2025</h2>



<p>In its official press release, Riot Games expressed the desire to “deepen its development pipeline” and will implement Academy Teams into the Challengers Leagues across the APAC region (Asia-Pacific).</p>



<p>The goal is for this change to allow teams to scout for new talent beforehand, allowing them to test and develop their rosters. However, Riot Games made it exceptionally clear that they still want to give opportunities to new teams trying to join the VCT Pacific. </p>



<p>Academy Teams will be able to participate in Challengers, but they will not be able to qualify for Ascension Pacific.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-participating-teams">Participating Teams</h2>



<p>The following teams have opted to have Academy Teams in their regional leagues:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Challengers Korea – DRX, Gen.G, T1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Challengers Japan – Zeta Division, DFM</strong></li>



<li><strong>Challengers Southeast Asia – RRQ, Talon, Team Secret</strong></li>



<li><strong>Challengers South Asia – Global Esports</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The partnered teams who opt-in will be given a direct slot in their Challengers League for 2025.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-riot-releases-2025-apac-schedule">Riot Releases 2025 APAC Schedule</h2>



<p>Riot Games has also revealed the 2025 APAC Calendar which includes three splits that will lead into Ascension.</p>



<p>Academy Teams will have the chance to play alongside their respective teams during these tournaments but will not be able to participate in Ascension.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>More information about the upcoming 2025 schedule will be unveiled later on as we round the corner of the year. Will you be watching the 2025 VCT season?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-day-before-developers-fntastic-want-you-to-design-levels-wont-pay-you/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The developers behind the failed extraction shooter The Day Before are asking people to design levels for its next game. Fntastic took to its Discord server (h/t <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-day-before-asking-community-to-work-on-their-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>) to announce a “contest” for people to design a map for its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fntastics-latest-game-attempt-fails-so-they-announce-another-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest attempt at a game</a>, ITEMS.</p>



<p>The catch is, the winner of the contest won’t be paid for their work.</p>



<p>“This contest is a chance for you to unleash your creativity by designing a map that, if it wins, will be added to the game in future updates,” the announcement read.</p>



<p>Rules for participating in the “contest” were then laid out, which includes stating that submissions can be 2D drawings, 3D models, or “any other style”. In addition to the map design, submissions need to also include images and artwork, a full description, the map’s theme, layoff, and “balance considerations”.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The kicker, as mentioned earlier, is that the person who creates the winning submission won’t receive any payment for the time put into designing the map. Instead, they’ll simply get a copy of the game — if it ever releases –, the map built for use in the game, and their name displayed “somewhere” on the map.</p>



<p>As of publishing, Insider Gaming has found that six maps have been submitted.</p>



<h2 id="h-fntastic-s-history-with-fan-submissions">Fntastic’s History With Fan Submissions</h2>



<p>Fntastic looking for fan submissions for its map designs isn’t something new for the studio. During the development of The Day Before, the studio regularly used unpaid volunteers for the development of its game. Those volunteers were located in various countries, including Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Finland, and more.</p>



<p>At one point, the studio claimed to be using over 100 full time volunteers.</p>



<p>What do you think of Fntastic holding a contest for maps for its new game? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forum.</p>
