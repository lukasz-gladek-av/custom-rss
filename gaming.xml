                <p>The Mobile World Conference: Barcelona event kicked off this week, and amidst several new tech reveals from dozens of companies, one of Samsung's divisions had an interesting concept for the potential future of portable game consoles. Essentially, Samsung envisions a scenario where bulky game consoles can be made more portable, using foldable-screen technology to fold them up and make them easier to carry around.</p><p>Samsung Display--a branch of the company that develops screen technology that other firms can purchase for their devices--showed off a Switch-like device at MWC: Barcelona (via <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-shows-off-quirky-pincer-phone-folding-console-and-flexi-briefcase-concepts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNET</a>), demonstrating how a console could be made smaller by simply folding it in half. There are of course potential issues to watch out for that are common to foldable devices, as screens can only be folded so many times before they develop a signature crease, but the idea behind this concept design makes for a fascinating glimpse at what could be.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/sondesix/status/1896670398324031921" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Samsung Display shows off some crazy new concepts at MWC 2025.<br>✅ Flexible Briefcase: this cabinbag unfolds into an 18.1" tablet<br>✅ Flex Gaming: a 7.2" gaming console with a foldable screen<br>✅ Next-gen OCF OLED panel that allows for a 5,000 nits peak brightness in a 10% window,… <a href="https://t.co/XBUHE5pbJ1" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/XBUHE5pbJ1</a></p>  — Alvin (@sondesix) <a href="https://twitter.com/sondesix/status/1896670398324031921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>While current devices like the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> don't have a foldable screen, these companies could adopt this technology for future hardware. For now, it looks like the best way to carry around a portable games console will be to invest in a carrying case for it. The other alternative is to go retro, as older devices like the Game Boy, Nintendo DS, or the PlayDate are more pocket-friendly in design.</p><p>Modern smartphones are also capable gaming devices--Asus even sells one designed specifically for mobile gaming--and with a cradle device like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-controller-up-for-preorder-half-the-price-of-backbone/1100-6527392/" data-ref-id="1100-6527392">Backbone</a>, it's easy to make a session on one feel similar to a console experience.</p>

                <p>Konami has announced a brand-new entry in the fabled RPG series, Suikoden. It's called Suikoden Star Leap and it'll be on iOS and Android. Star Leap free-to-play with microtransactions, and it is the first Suikoden game since 2012's Suikoden: The Woven Web of a Century, which was on PSP but never released outside of Japan.</p><p>The game follows a silent protagonist who's the son of the village chief, Hou. One night, the village is attacked. The hero, along with his friends Hisui, Shirin, and Shapur, embark on a new journey to restore peace to the village once again. Like every Suikoden game, Star Leap has 108 recruitable characters and the rest will be revealed at a later date.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKOZqkjPcWk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WKOZqkjPcWk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Star Leap also sees the return of pixel-art graphics, like the first two Suikoden games had, an breaking from the 3D models of the previous three games. </p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202503/34239" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a>, producer Shinya Fujimoto said that Star Leap takes place between the events of Suikoden V and Suikoden I. Additionally, the first chapter of Star Leap will heavily feature Odessa Silverberg, the original leader of the Liberation Army in Suikoden I that the protagonist eventually becomes in charge of.</p><p>While no release date has been revealed for Suikoden Star Leap, a remaster of the first two Suikoden games is releasing soon. The bundle is called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster-preorders-are-25-off-on-pc/1100-6526150/" data-ref-id="1100-6526150">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars</a> and launches on March 6 for PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. It features brand-new quality-of-life features such as adjustable battle speeds and auto-saves.</p>

            <p>Inzoi - the upcoming and rather realistic looking Sims-like - is set to launch in early access later this month, and ahead of that people want to know one very important thing: what's the sex situation?</p>
<p>Sex is, of course, a pretty common feature in Maxis and EA's The Sims series, where it is known as WooHoo. And Inzoi players want to have a deeper understanding of what will be the WooHoo equivalent in Krafton's own life-sim.</p>

<p>The Inzoi team recently hosted a Q&amp;A session <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1162040845181124618/1162040845181124621/1345026317103534131">via the game's Discord</a>, where it was asked: "In Inzoi will you be able to have interactions for the purpose of creating babies?" (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/theres-sort-of-sex-in-inzoi-its-developers-explain-as-terminally-horny-life-sim-players-ask-about-getting-freaky-and-watching-their-zois-shower/">PC Gamer</a>). So, essentially, let's talk about sex, baby, but without actually using that word.</p>
<p>Here's what assistant director Joel Lee had to say about sex in Izoi: "There is a feature in the game that you obviously know what's happening, the male Zoi and the female Zoi are together, likely in bed, with the intention of creating babies. How visually apparent is that? That's where you have to go to your imagination. </p>
<p>"What you're seeing is not what you're seeing; you have to assume that's what's happening. Is that clear enough for everyone? It's there. Sort of. Maybe not to the level that everyone would have been expecting."
</p>
<p>Reading this, I assume this means Inzoi won't feature the same over-the-top interactions such as shaking bushes, love hearts popping out of rocket ships and a bombastic firework finale like we see in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>. That is perhaps understandable, given Inzoi is going for a more realistic tone (even if the characters do wear towels in the shower).</p>
<p>I am still not sure exactly what sex in Inzoi will look like, though. Also, given the game will feature same-sex relationships, I presume sex won't only be limited to - in Lee's words - the intention of creating babies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gorgeous-sims-like-inzoi-delayed-into-next-year-to-give-it-a-stronger-foundation">Izoi is set to release in early access on 28th March</a>, via Steam. Our Ian along with Outside Xbox's Jane went hands on with Inzoi last year. You can check out their thoughts on the game - including its toilet animations - below.</p>

<p>In the meantime, and if you want to have some life-sim-WooHoo-related-fun, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-turning-up-the-heat-with-its-super-sexy-lovestruck-expansion-pack">EA released the Lovestruck Expansion Pack for The Sims 4</a>. This pack added new romantic interactions, which include a new kiss, a sultry dance and three new WooHoo spots.</p>
<p>It also added a sexy aubergine costume, because of course.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Trusted leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun">billbil-kun</a> has released details of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 which is set ot be officially announced later today.</p>
<p>He has revealed the game will be released on 11th July 2025, and if you pre-order the game you will get a ‘Wireframe Tony Shader’ along with the ‘Foundry demo’ when it is released, so presumably a demo of the game will be announced at some point.</p>


<p>The game has a Collector’s Edition which costs a whopping $129.99, a Deluxe Edition for $69.99 which includes Doom Slayer &amp; Revenant Skaters, the Unmaykr Hoverboard and ‘In-Game Music’, and the bog standard edition, which will cost you $49.99. The Deluxe and Collector’s Editions will get three days of early access. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 will&nbsp;be released on Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and PS5, but no mention of a PS4 version.</p>
<p>This all comes off the back of long-running reports and rumours surrounding a follow-up to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/03/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-thps-ps4-xbox-pc/">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2</a> remake. Following that game’s 2020 release, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/06/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-plans-shelved-after-blizzard-entertainment-absorbed-vicarious-visions-says-tony-hawk">Tony Hawk said</a> that a follow-up was planned, but shelved after Vicarious Visions was absorbed into Blizzard Entertainment, rebranded as Blizzard Albany and set to work on the Diablo series.</p>
<p>Rumours about the project were revived recently when skater Tyshawn Jones<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3umK3xG7Ly4&amp;t=1314"> said in a radio interview</a> that he is set to be in an upcoming <em>Tony Hawk</em> game remaster.</p>
<p>Right now, it’s not clear who is working on Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4. There’s nothing stopping Blizzard Albany from working on this as they still exist within the overarching Activision Blizzard structure, and depending on workloads since the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/08/diablo-iv-review/">Diablo IV</a> in 2023, and surrounding the Vessels of Hatred DLC last year.</p>

<p>Looking back at THPS 1+2, we awarded the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/03/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-thps-ps4-xbox-pc/">a stellar 10/10</a>, saying “Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+ 2 is a labour of love and an ode to the series’ glory days. Every inch of the game has been perfectly restored and updated for modern consoles and it’s an absolute delight to play from start to finish. This is a must-buy for skateboarders, gamers and everyone else in between.”</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is all about crafting the best gear to perfect your build and allow you to take on some of the game's strongest monsters and in your quest for power, there will come a time when you will need more than just monster parts to craft the strongest gear. Among these items are the Hunter Symbols, which are awarded to the best hunters after completing certain quests.</p>
<p>The Hunter Symbols in Monster Hunter Wilds come in three different number variants and are awarded after completing quests involving <strong>Tempered Monsters</strong>. These monster variants, which are considerably more powerful than the base ones, will start roaming maps after you defeat them in post-game story quests, starting with the <strong>Main Mission 4.3: Wyvern Spark and Rose Thorns</strong> quest. To get <strong>Hunter Symbol I</strong>, you will have to complete quests involving 5-Star Tempered monsters, while to get <strong>Hunter Symbol II</strong>, you will have to complete quests involving 6-Star Tempered monsters.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250304123727_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>To get <strong>Hunter Symbol III</strong> in Monster Hunter Wilds, you will have to <strong>complete quests involving 7 and 8-Star Tempered monsters</strong>, which are Rey Dau, Jin Dahaad, Uth Duna, Nu Udra,&nbsp; and Gore Magala for 7-Star rank, and Arkveld for 8-Star rank. Before you can actually encounter the Tempered variants of the Apex predators above, however, you will first have to complete the final story mission, <strong>Mission 6-1</strong>, and reach <strong>Hunter Rank 41</strong>. Be sure to gear up before you attempt to fight these Tempered monsters, as they are the current strongest monsters in the game!</p>

Studio Fizbin has been struck by ongoing cuts at their parent company Thunderful, they say, and despite pitching follow-up projects to work on after Reignbreaker's release, none of those will go ahead. Which means they'll be winding down at the exact moment you'd hope they'd be celebrating a payoff from years of work. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Our parent company Thunderful made the decision to drastically reduce internal development in November 2024, which, as Thunderful’s CEO Martin communicated in the latest quarterly report, also affected Studio Fizbin," said founder Alexander Pieper in a statement <a href="https://www.studio-fizbin.com/fizbins-last-magic-trick">on the studio's website</a>, as noticed by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/studio-fizbin-shutting-down-after-reignbreaker-s-mid-march-release">Gamedeveloper</a>. "Since then, we’ve been exploring various opportunities to work on after finishing Reignbreaker. Unfortunately, none of these projects will move forward, leading us to make this difficult decision.</p>
<p>"This means that Reignbreaker will be Studio Fizbin’s final game."</p>
<p>Publishers Thunderful recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steamworld-makers-announce-100-layoffs-cancel-projects-and-say-theyll-publish-more-games-by-other-studios-but-fewer-of-their-own">slashed 80-100 jobs across their studios</a>, and said they'll now focus on publishing games by outside studios, rather than developing their own. It looks like the full effects of that decision are now being felt. </p>
<p>If you haven't seen it yet, Reignbreaker is a very purple and black action roguelike about bringing down a tyrannical queen with plenty of spear chuckin' and upgrade choosin'. When James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reignbreaker-is-an-anti-establishment-roguelike-thats-clearly-pro-hades">played its monarch-toppling chaingunnery</a> he noted "flashy isometric fights" and "pausing for a chat with some charismatic, lovingly hand-drawn, likely flirty side character." Sound familiar? James thought so too. "It’s so very, very Hades," he said. </p>
<p>As for the theme, it's a response to the "rise in right-wing authoritarianism all around the world, the growing class divide and exploitation", according to community manager Ian Stewart. If any of that sounds intriguing, you can play the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129810/Reignbreaker/">demo on Steam</a> yourself. The game is due to release on March 18th.</p>
<p>Before this Studio Fizbin made a bunch of games that have been well-liked by RPS staff, such as point and click adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-inner-world">The Inner World</a>, hand-drawn puzzle platformer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minute-of-islands">Minute Of Islands</a>, and the comedy anti-capitalist refuse 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/say-no-more">Say No! More</a> which Alice B (RPS in peace) called "short but immensely satisfying". Here's a snippet of her thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>It casts universal capitulation as a global, systemic problem, and, at the same time, being realistic and setting boundaries as a path to everyone being healthy and happy. But not in a preachy way. In an absurd way.</blockquote>
<p>Fizbin will spend their remaining time as a studio working to ship the game, says Pieper, as well as providing some post-launch support to Reignbreaker, and supporting workers in finding new work. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>All eyes are locked on Assassin’s Creed Shadows and its forthcoming review embargo date. This is one of the most important Assassin’s Creed releases ever, and the critical reception could have a huge bearing on the game’s success.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> releases in the middle of a crowded March 2025. It needs to fight off the popularity of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-hazelight-studios-next-game-it-takes-two-sequel-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios</a> and its new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> release, and combat the physical forces of 2K’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>. Ubisoft has enough without worrying about other new titles.</p>



<p>Shadows is reportedly not getting delayed again and will release in March. An abundance of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-releases-statement-on-assassins-creed-shadows-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadows leaks</a> has already shown many people the game and what it has in store. But for everyone else, the Assassin’s Creed Shadows review embargo is crucial.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-assassin-s-creed-shadows-review-embargo-date">Do we Know The Assassin’s Creed Shadows Review Embargo Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The date is crawling up to us. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows Review Embargo Date is reportedly set for March 18—two days before the game’s official release date.</strong></p>



<p>In an exclusive Insider Gaming report, we revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft is confident about Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ March 20, 2025, release date</a>. Our sources have also indicated “<strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows reviews will be live on March 18, 2025.</strong>“</p>



<p>It’s fairly standard for review embargos to go live between two and five days before launch. It’s more concerning when a review embargo date is the day of the game or after launch. This is usually an indicator the developer and/or publisher isn’t happy with the product and therefore leaves the embargo until after players have bought the game.</p>



<p>Ubisoft looks to be assured, and we should be getting <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> 48 hours before launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-review-embargo">What is a Review Embargo?</h2>



<p><strong>A review embargo is the earliest point where a publication can release its final review.</strong></p>



<p>In this case, the Assassin’s Creed Shadows review embargo is set by Ubisoft. Reviews can’t be posted before this embargo, and any that are likely need to be taken down and can cause complications between parties.</p>



<p>Review embargos have become a focal point of game launches in modern times. Players are eager to see, hear, and read reviews before they invest in a game. With Ubisoft’s mixed history with game launches—particularly Assassin’s Creed (look at AC Unity)—the early reception to Shadows could be make or break.</p>



<hr>



<p>If our information turns out to be incorrect, we will be sure to update this article. For now, you can start counting down the days until the Assassin’s Creed Shadows review embargo lifts. What scores will the RPG get? What average score will be enough for you to commit to a purchase? </p>

            <p>
Nintendo has trumpeted its latest legal success in the company's ongoing fight against pirated games as "significant" not only for itself, "but for the entire games industry".
</p>
<p>
The Mario maker today confirmed it had won a final victory over French file-sharing company Dstorage, which operates the website 1fichier.com, following years of legal wrangling and repeated appeals.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's victory means European file-sharing companies must now remove illegal copies of games when asked to do so, or be held accountable and cough up potentially sizable fines as punishment.
</p>
<p>
In 2021, the Judicial Court of Paris ordered Dstorage pay Nintendo €935k (£773k) in damages after it was found to be hosting pirate games. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-wins-case-against-french-filesharing-service-hosting-pirated-games">Dstorage launched an appeal, which then failed in 2023, and was ordered to pay Nintendo further costs</a>. But the case didn't end there. 
</p>
<p>
Dstorage finally took the matter to the highest French judiciary court, where it argued that a specific court order was required before it needed to remove content from its hosting services. This bid has also now failed, ending the long-running matter for good.
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo is pleased with the court's finding of liability against Dstorage," reads a statement from the Mario maker shared with Eurogamer this morning. 
</p>
<p>
"Together with its recent decision of 15th January 2025, confirming that a major French Bank had rightfully terminated a payment processing agreement with 1fichier.com due to lacking anti-piracy measures, the French Supreme Court leaves no doubt that sharehosting providers like 1fichier.com are not a safe haven for storing and sharing illegal content.
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo promotes and fosters development and creativity, and strongly supports developers who legitimately create new and innovative software. Nintendo's message to consumers is not to download pirate copies of Nintendo games as this increases the risk that this will interfere with the functionality and experience that playing legitimate Nintendo games on authentic Nintendo hardware provides."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's campaign against game piracy has regularly hit the headlines over the past year, perhaps most notably with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">the shutdown of Switch emulator Yuzu - whose creator agreed to pay Nintendo $2.4m</a> (£1.89m). 
</p>
<p>
Last summer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-war-against-switch-piracy-ramps-up-with-two-fresh-cases">Nintendo tracked down the moderator behind the infamous SwitchPirates reddit</a> and claimed the individual ran "several pirate shops" that sold "massive libraries of pirated Nintendo Switch games". Nintendo is seeking damages in the millions of dollars.
</p>
<p>
In November 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-streamer-who-said-he-could-broadcast-its-pirated-games-all-day">Nintendo filed a lawsuit against a streamer who regularly played pirated copies of Nintendo games ahead of release</a>, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>. The streamer had previously boasted he "could do all this all day" as he had "1000 burner accounts".

			<p>The Suikoden series revival will not stop with the HD remasters of the first two entries in the series launching this week, as revealed during a livestream that aired a few hours ago.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://youtu.be/TIjGwGAJJ4s?si=sIKc_fHQknKkO5CO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live broadcast</a>, Konami confirmed that the series will continue with a new mobile game called Suikoden STAR LEAP. Set between the fifth and first entry in the series, the game will feature a story that is part of the canon of the series, beautiful 2D graphics inspired by the first two entries in the series, returning characters like Viktor, Flik, and Odessa, many of the gameplay features that define the series, such as the ability to recruit 108 characters and more. While it will be a gacha game, it has been confirmed that the 108 Stars of Destiny can all be obtained without pulls, and only legacy characters will be obtainable with the typical gacha mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Suikoden STAR LEAP | Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WKOZqkjPcWk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Suikoden STAR LEAP will offer fans of the series the chance to experience a new story set in the series' universe, the aforementioned animated show, on the other hand, is clearly meant to expand the series' reach beyond its existing fanbase. In the works by Konami's animation studio and NBC Universal Entertainment Japan, the animated show will introduce new fans to the deep lore of Suikoden II. Hopefully, it will not shy away from showing some of the original game's most chilling sequences, which all involve one of the game's main villains, the iconic Luca Blight.</p>
<p>The Suikoden Live livestream also featured new information on merchandise, which will mostly be released only in Japan, orchestral performances of the series' iconic music, and more. You can check the full livestream below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Suikoden Live Broadcast | KONAMI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIjGwGAJJ4s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This week is going to be a great one for fans of the series, as the Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remasters: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars finally launch on PCs and consoles worldwide on <a href="https://wccftech.com/suidkoen-i-ii-remaster-release-date/">March 6th</a>. The collection includes the first two entries in the series, complete with plenty of enhancements, including visual improvements and new quality-of-life features.</p>

Capcom has released details of today's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> patch, which fixes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-progress-breaking-npc-bug">the game's progression-blocking bug in the main mission Chapter 5-2 "A World Turned Upside Down"</a>.
</p>
<p>
The update, numbered as version 1.000.04.00, is available to download now on all platforms. You must download the patch to continue playing online, and restart the game to make sure it is applied.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a list of fixes, Capcom also warns of several other issues it is currently aware of, but is yet to resolve. This includes an issue where a network error occurs after someone fires an SOS flare right after a quest begins - so, for now, don't do that.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/04/pokemon-tcg-pocket-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>We’ve all heard of Pokémon cards. The Pokémon TCG, as it’s officially called, is a longstanding and much-loved trading card game that dates back to my childhood. I spent many hours battling and trading with my school friends, despite teachers quickly deciding they were contraband and enlisting the dinner ladies who patrolled the playground, cruelly trying to part me from my foil Gyarados.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve dabbled with the TCG, trying the different digital offerings that the company puts out. The latest such release is Pokémon TCG Pocket — a stripped-down version of the game available on Apple and Android phones. The question is, is it any good, or is it just another way to part you from your money?</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon TCG Pocket: Triumphant Light | Coming February 28!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/urmBeWH0bxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The basic idea of Pocket TCG is that you can open two packs of five Pokémon cards per day for free — or more if you spend money. You slowly build a pool of cards from which you can build decks to battle real or digital opponents, getting XP and completing collection missions along the way.</p>
<p>The battle rules have been simplified, too. You have a 20-card deck instead of 60, while Energy is now automatically generated once per turn, helping keep your deck as slim and streamlined as possible. Finally, you only need to defeat up to three rival Pokémon to secure victory, instead of the usual six.</p>

<p>So far, so good —&nbsp;it’s a Pokémon card gatcha machine that you can play for free, or dump money into if you want to quickly pad out your collection. But is it worth trying to play free-to-play?</p>

<p>I’ve been playing the game since launch, well aware that games like this ultimately come in two flavours: one all flash with no depth. It tastes amazing and the additives get their hooks in you. But what burns hottest burns quickest, and you can’t have too much of it without getting bored.</p>
<p>The second flavour is the tried and tested favourite that you will keep coming back to. There’s less intensity, but a depth and complexity that is actually compelling. It’s the kind of thing you’ll keep coming back to, enjoying it just as much every time you do.</p>
<p>I’m happy to report, after a few months with the game, that playing Pokémon TCG Pocket is like eating a premium scoop of mint choc chip ice cream. Whenever it feels that it’s getting samey, you get a nice chunk of something new and exciting to keep you going.</p>
<p>As with all card games, batches are released in sets and expansions. The first set in the game, Genetic Apex, was split between three different packs for Charizard, Pikachu and Mewtwo respectively, while Space-Time Smackdown added Dialga and Palkia in January. Each has a unique card pool, which means you need to swap back and forth to collect ‘em all.</p>

<p>Every 12 hours, you can open one pack of cards for free. While you may not always get the card you want, you might open a signature card that unlocks a ‘rental’ deck that you can play for free 10 times. Collect three linked Pokémon, say the three Legendary Birds or the same Gardevoir five times, and you’ll win Emblems, Avatars, Shop Tickets and Wonder Hourglasses — the latter of which can net you free cards by Wonder Picking from someone else’s pack.</p>
<p>With enough cards (or a rental deck), you can battle the game’s AI or other real players, winning Pack Hourglasses that will reduce the time needed to open the next new pack of five cards.</p>

<p>The problem is that there are some obvious best decks in the meta — as per all TCGs. However, there’s no guarantee that you will open that Gardevoir for your Mewtwo EX deck, or get the Moltres EX for your Charizard EX deck. This means opening more packs, either relying on dumb luck or saving up Pack Points earned with each opening to try to ‘buy’ the single you need. At 5 points per pack, and 2500 points for the fanciest stuff, you’re going to be opening a lot of packs if you genuinely want to collect ‘em all.</p>
<p>And then there’s the ill-fated trading mechanic — it was so bad that fans at launch demanded the game takes the ‘T’ out of its name.</p>
<p>So, as you can imagine, you could burn money on this game. However, this isn’t at all necessary, and the game is fun to dip in and out of a couple of times per day, even without owning all the most powerful cards.</p>

<p>After downloading the game on a whim, curious to see what the latest offering from the Pokémon TCG looks like, I am pleasantly surprised and still engaged with this game. After an initial flash of excitement with Genetic Apex, this has settled to a slow burn. I still enjoy opening the app a couple of times per day and seeing what I open. If I have 10 minutes to spare, a quick battle against the AI is still fun.</p>
<p>The game clearly wants your money, but it doesn’t hound you for it, and it’s perfectly playable without spending a penny. It won’t keep your attention for hours on end, and that’s fine. As far as slow games go, Pocket TCG is very good. I’m just thankful this doesn’t exist for Magic the Gathering, as I’d be far more ready to part with my money…</p>

            <p>There comes a time in every cat owner's life where they must ask themselves: how large would this creature need to be before it attempted to bat me around like a catnip mouse? I suspect the answer is "only as large as it needed to be", so it's fortunate that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' Palicoes are apparently bred for helpfulness. Is installing a mod to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> that makes them tall as humans a form of gene splicing? Don't worry, hunter. Gene splicing is how nature heals itself.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/35">The mod is called 'Kitty Big'. </a>There isn't much to say about it beyond that. You don't need to continue reading now, so here's a little story for anyone left.</p>
<p>Once, a peaceful and prosperous hamlet was terrorised by a beast that demanded regular sacrifices, lest it drag its lumpen form down from its mountain dwelling and drain the lifeblood from the villagers.</p>
<p>Not just any sacrifice would appease its capricious tastes, however. Some days, it demanded the flesh of storied warriors. Others, humble farm hands. Occasionally, it wanted those little cocktail sticks with pineapple and cheese on, which was bollocks because where do you even find pineapples in this climate?</p>
<p>One day, the people of the hamlet decided they'd had enough of catering to the beast's whims, especially since the one thing the creature was useful for - dispersing snippets of wisdom in response to specific queries and occasionally reverse image searching a nice shirt you didn't know where to buy - had recently been borked by a colony of parasites taken up residence in the monster's brain stem. So they refused to make any more sacrifices. And they all got eaten.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is that sometimes you just have to give Google what it wants. Today, that's the words '<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' followed by whatever mildly interesting nugget of disposable information I can dig up between my first and second morning coffee. Nice mod, though. I'll probably use it once I buy the game, which won't be until <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">they've sorted out the performance</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Split Fiction is an intertwining narrative from the creative mind of Josef Fares. It requires you to guide two unique characters from start to finish, but we’re here to see if you can only play the game in co-op or if solo play is permitted.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a> is firmly behind us now. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-hazelight-studios-next-game-it-takes-two-sequel-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios has a new game called Split Fiction</a>. We’ve been treated to periodic trailers and footage since its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal at The Game Awards 2024</a>. Anyone familiar with It Takes Two or A Way Out should instantly feel at home with Split Fiction.</p>



<p>It has tons of mini-games and tandem gameplay sections, and requires teamwork to succeed. Many co-op games allow you to play with an AI partner, so let’s see if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> is the same.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-split-fiction-be-played-solo">Can Split Fiction be Played Solo?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A co-op boom is happening. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><strong>Split Fiction cannot be played solo and is a co-op title requiring a human companion.</strong></strong></p>



<p>This is how Josef Fares wants his games to be experienced. It Takes Two was such an emotional gut punch as you felt every story twist alongside a real player. A Way Out was the same, and Split Fiction continues this thematic direction by requiring two real-life players—not AI.</p>



<p>If you don’t believe me, check out the official <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/ea-originals-discussion-en/announcement--faq-split-fiction%E2%84%A2---launching-march-6-2025---pre-order-now/5037251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction FAQ</a>. Under the “Is it possible to play with an AI?” question, the answer states: “<strong>No, this is a co-op-only game uniquely tailored for two friends to play together.</strong>“</p>



<h2 id="h-will-split-fiction-add-solo-play-to-split-fiction">Will Split Fiction Add Solo Play to Split Fiction?</h2>



<p><strong>I think the chances of Split Fiction adding a solo option through a patch are slim-to-none.</strong></p>



<p>Again, Hazelight Studios’ previous work—A Way Out and It Takes Two—didn’t add this option. Given the official stance on solo play, it feels unlikely to be added in Split Fiction either. If you’re a fan of Fares and Hazelight games and want a solo-driven journey, all is not lost.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/02/13/josef-fares-split-fiction-interview-we-will-not-co-op-22554563/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>, Fares said: “We will not only do co-op, we will definitely do other stuff with a Haze-like twist. We want to do something different like a twist… like what we did with the co-op. But co-op is great and, I mean, you can tell great stories and there’s so much to be explored there.”</p>



<p>Who knows where the studio goes once Split Fiction is wrapped up and in the history books.</p>



<hr>



<p>It Takes Two was a bona fide Game of the Year winner. It’s going to take a lot for Split Fiction to replicate its success, but it’s not impossible. Are you picking up Split Fiction as quick as a flash?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-season-delayed-verdansk-return-now-expected-next-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Activision has delayed the rollout of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone Season 3, including the anticipated return of the latter's classic Verdansk map. 
</p>
<p>
Season 3 was previously due to arrive around 20th March. Now, it'll hit two weeks later on 3rd April.
</p>
<p>
"Season 3 is a big moment for Call of Duty: Warzone and Black Ops 6, and we're taking the time to deliver a great experience starting on 3rd April," Activision wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1896636715143704641">post on social media</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"More to come following Call of Duty: Warzone's fifth anniversary next week..."
</p>
<p>
Verdansk was Call of Duty: Warzone's original map, available when the battle royale's first iteration arrived back in 2020. Now, it's widely-expected to return in time for the game's fifth anniversary.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty is the latest battle royale to lean on nostalgia and bring back a classic map in the hopes of boosting player numbers, following the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.
</p>
<p>
The move to return to a fan-favourite map follows a patchy start to this year's Call of Duty content, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-bans-another-136000-cheaters">Activision having to focus time to address player concerns over rampant in-game cheating</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-block-ops-6-players-accuse-activision-of-using-ai-slop">admitting to the use of in-game AI imagery</a>, and selling a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-players-lament-battle-passes-in-between-battle-passes-with-squid-game-event">separate expensive Squid Game battle pass</a>
</p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>

"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk," our Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/new-game-in-classic-jrpg-series-suikoden-announced-by-konami<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new role-playing adventure set in the world of Suikoden is on the way, but there is a catch.</p>
<p>It has been many years since we last got a Suikoden. In fact, the last mainline entry was released in February, 2006. So, nearly 20 years ago (seriously, where is time going?!). This makes last night's announcement from Konami rather exciting - a new title in the Suikoden series is on the way, and it looks lovely, with pixel art reminiscent of the original games.</p>
<p>It's known as Suikoden Star Leap, and will take place "a few years before the events of Suikoden 1, but a couple years after Suikoden 5". The upcoming game promises "vibrant" locales to explore and new characters along with familiar faces. But, like I said, there is a catch. You see, this is the "first title to be tailored for mobile", and the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ljj4ymsvzs2m">developer has confirmed it will have gacha elements</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out a trailer for Suikoden Star Leap below (Japanese audio).</p>

<p>We don't have a release date yet for Suikoden Star Leap, with Konami simply stating it will be coming "soon". The team will share more details as part of a future announcement, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>While for now the game is only slated for release on iOS and Android, we know that other gacha games have done well on the likes of PlayStation (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/honkai-star-rail-review-more-than-genshin-impact-in-space">hello there Honkai Star Rail</a>), so perhaps Suikoden Star Leap will one day make its way to consoles.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on Suikoden Star Leap?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Capcom has put the high sales down to the game's broad global appeal, its inclusion in global events (like PlayStation's State of Play and The Game Awards), and holding multiple online beta tests.</p>
<p>"Capcom remains firmly committed to satisfying the expectations of all users by leveraging its industry leading game development capabilities in order to create highly entertaining gameplay experiences," the company said, perhaps alluding to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">poor technical performance of the game</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-warns-incoming-monster-hunter-wilds-update-will-discontinue-your-online-session">patch for the game was released earlier this morning</a>, designed to fix a progress-blocking bug and more.</p>
<p>Capcom lists its top-selling games, what it calls <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html">Platinum Titles</a>, with Monster Hunter Worlds at the top with 21.3m units sold (as of December last year). It's followed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> with 16.7m and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> remake with 15m.</p>

			<p>CAPCOM <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> this morning that Monster Hunter Wilds has already set new record sales. In the first three days since launch, the game sold over eight million units, becoming the fastest game to do so in the Japanese publisher's 45-year history.</p>
<p>This record-breaking milestone is not at all unexpected, given the immense hype surrounding the game after the highly successful entries Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise. Moreover, this past weekend, Monster Hunter Wilds <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-reaches-steams-top-5-all-time-peak-but-user-reviews-are-only-at-54/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> a user concurrency peak of 1.38 million on Steam, stepping into the platform's all-time top five for this chart.</p>
<p>Of course, user reviews are still quite low at 58%, mostly due to the game's performance on PC. For now, CAPCOM hasn't said if they will improve the game's technical side, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are a few mods that might help</a>. Overall, though, this is a great game if you're into this type of experience, as outlined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> penned by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds is the natural evolution of the formula introduced in Monster Hunter World, and one of the best entries in the series. While veterans may find the lower challenge level noticeable, and performance could definitely be better on PC, the improved onboarding and accessibility, a surprisingly engaging main campaign, excellent map and monster design, and refined combat make this entry a must-play for both newcomers and seasoned Hunters alike.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, CAPCOM has also promoted franchise producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, likely as a result of the series' excellent sales results. Starting on April 1, he'll replace Yoichi Egawa as the publisher's executive corporate officer and chief product officer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-warzone-being-shut-down-answered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty: Warzone surfaced in 2020 as a free-to-play battle royale of epic proportions. Within just a few days, it had secured tens of millions of players worldwide, and it became known as one of the best games in the genre. Unfortunately, the game didn’t stand up well to the test of time, and after a couple of years, too many bad decisions were made, and players started rapidly abandoning the title.</p>



<p>Given that times have changed and players are still moving on, is Warzone being shut down? Activision won’t support a ‘dying game’ forever, but is Warzone going to be discontinued?</p>



<p>Join me as we find out the answer to that question.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-warzone-dying">Is Warzone Dying?</h2>



<p>In 2025, a prominent Call of Duty leaker revealed that the revival of Verdansk – due to take place in April 2025 – is the last-ditch effort for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/">Activision to bring players back to Warzone</a>.</p>



<p>It was mentioned that if Verdansk isn’t a success and players aren’t retained, then <strong>Warzone will be shut down before Call of Duty 2026 arrives</strong>.</p>



<p>This comes as Warzone struggles under the weight of network issues, a plague of cheaters, and lacklustre updates that haven’t given the community a sense of hope for the future of the iconic battle royale.</p>



<p>The esports scene for Warzone is wavering; streamers are abandoning the game for other battle royales, and players worldwide are losing faith in the platform at large.</p>



<p>When you ask if Warzone is dying, you can just look at the streaming figures for the game:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit: TwitchTracker.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Warzone’s performance on streaming platforms like Twitch is at an all-time low. The peaks we’re seeing now are lower than ever before, which is a telling indicator that the game is dying.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-warzone-being-discontinued">Is Warzone Being Discontinued?</h2>



<p>Presently, Warzone isn’t being discontinued, but there’s a very real possibility that it will be within the next year or so.</p>



<p>If the leaks are to be believed, Verdansk is the last shot developers have at making Call of Duty: Warzone an ongoing success. It’s an attempt to revive the player base and bring millions of users back onto the platform. If it fails, Warzone could be shut down by the end of 2026.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been said if Warzone Mobile will be shut down, though. This speculation is in reference to the ‘main’ version of Warzone on console and PC.</p>



<p>What will you do if Warzone is shut down? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hideki-kamiya-scalebound-develop-xbox/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideki-kamiya-still-wants-to-develop-scalebound-with-xbox.1124466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hideki-kamiya-scalebound-develop-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent post on social media, Hideki Kamiya, who founded CLOVERS Inc. after leaving PlatinumGames in 2023, revealed that he’d still love to make Scalebound. The ill-fated RPG was cancelled in 2017 after years of discussions and rumours, but it seems that the Japanese gaming legend hasn’t forgotten about it – to the point that he still wants to make it.</p>



<p>Scalebound was in development at PlatinumGames for around four years before it was ultimately cancelled, and Kamiya was the game’s director. This isn’t the first time that the industry icon has pleaded for Xbox to pick the project up again, though.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shot-down">Shot Down</h2>



<p>PlatinumGames is famous for the creation of titles like Niear and Bayonetta, but Scalebound would have been a more ambitious game on a different level entirely. In Scalebound, players would have explored a world populated by dragons – and dragonriders. It was announced in 2014 with a trailer dropping at E3 (which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/e3-is-officially-over/">has since died a death</a>), and prospective fans were excited.</p>



<p>The year before Scalebound was revealed, Microsoft penned a deal with Platinum, assuming control of Scalebound in exchange for pumping cash into the coffers to build it. It was shaped around a third-person action-RPG model, and it looked good enough on the surface, but it was ultimately cancelled by Microsoft in 2017.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SCALEBOUND Gameplay Trailer (E3 2016)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dgxcs_5cztw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It was cited that the game’s stoppage was caused by issues with the Unreal Engine, ‘an inability to live up to player expectations’, and a lack of experience at the studio creating some of the game’s core elements.</p>



<p>But along came Hideki Kamiya, almost a decade after that cancellation, saying he still wants to make Scalebound:</p>











<p>His cry of ‘Let’s do it, Phil!’ came following a post from CLOVERS Inc. on Twitter. This post revealed that the team at CLOVERS was banded around Kamiya’s desk, reminiscing about Scalebound while watching videos of the game on YouTube. In the snippet, he said, ‘I’d love to make it again someday.’</p>



<p>In 2023, it was suggested in a discussion on a podcast that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/scalebound-revival/">a revival of Scalebound</a> <strong>could </strong>be on the way, but we’ve heard nothing since.</p>



<p>Based on everything we know about Scalebound, would you like to see it made and finally released? Let us know in the comments what you think.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-map-location/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is set to be released in the summer, opening up another chapter in the decade-old open-world zombie game. As one of the most prolific games in the genre, Dying Light has enjoyed ten years in the spotlight, and that streak of success is set to persist with the arrival of the standalone game, The Beast.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Dying Light’s franchise director, Tymon Smektała, revealed that there’s a secret tucked away in the first trailer for Dying Light: The Beast, and he believes nobody has found it yet.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-easter-eggs">Easter Eggs</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://thethumbwars.com/dying-light-the-beasts-interview-exclusive-director-talks-missed-trailer-details-banned-games-and-lore-answers-10-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with The Thumb Wars</a>, Tymon Smektała suggested that the ‘general location’ of Castor Woods, the in-game map, is hidden somewhere in an easter egg in the game’s first trailer. He said it’s a ‘barely visible’ piece of text that’s written in a dialect that would ‘hint’ at where Castor Woods is located.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer, in case you want to go egg hunting:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c50gFkG91jc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Where is Castor Woods set?</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve been through the trailer frame-by-frame, and I can’t see any unique dialect that would indicate where Castor Woods is set.</p>



<p>There are plenty of English language signs and storefronts, and everything from warning notices on generators to the emergency number on the back of police vehicles suggests we’re looking at another European adventure. The architecture is hard to pin down, though.</p>



<p>Harran, which was the centrepoint for the first game, was a fictional Middle Eastern city based on Istanbul, Mumbai, and Wroclaw. In Dying Light 2, players explore Villedor, another fictional location that’s an ‘amalgam’ of multiple European cities, including Germany, Belgium, and Poland.</p>



<p>I’m inclined to believe that Dying Light: The Beast is also set in Europe, but I can’t scale it down.</p>



<p>Perhaps you can do better – let me know in the comments if you’ve solved the easter egg.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/valkyrae-cinna-emiru-attacked-amouranth-robbed-twitch-kick<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last night, a total of four female Twitch streamers were assaulted, three while together broadcasting in public and one at home in an entirely different state.</p><p>In the first case, longtime YouTube (and recent Twitch) star Rachell “Valkyrae” Hoffstetter was out at the Santa Monica Pier with fellow streamers Brittany "Cinna" Watts and Emily “Emiru” Schunk as part of Hoffstetter’s then-ongoing Sis-A-Thon marathon broadcast, when they encountered a crouching man who’d <a href="https://x.com/changgangart/status/1896431771040047196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemingly been following them</a>. </p><p>The man lured the group in by asking if they’d listen to him sing a song and then immediately tried to get Schunk’s number, causing the streamers to hastily walk away. Undeterred, the man proceeded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOxr32JJiQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">follow them to a nearby snack vendor</a>. After a couple of minutes, he began verbally threatening them, saying things like “Let’s fucking fight right now.” When Hoffstetter called for security, the man tried to rush the group while shouting, “I’ll kill you right now.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Stalker Threatens/attack Emiru, Valkyrae, Cinna, Emily &amp; Rosii at Santa Monica Pier" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PJOxr32JJiQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The streamers ended the broadcast not long after. Nobody was hurt, but Hoffstetter understandably decided to conclude her marathon.</p><p>“We are all OK and have been with police,” she <a href="https://x.com/Valkyrae/status/1896449449100247336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter last night</a>. “We decided we are done with the marathon and need time to process! … Please send love to Emiru, Cinna, [camera person] Rosii, and Emily! Everybody is in shock but I’m so glad [we’re] together.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxaQlqmo_Zs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a follow up broadcast today</a>, Hoffstetter and Watts, still visibly shaken up, told viewers more about what happened before and after the stream clip that went viral, noting that they had to “hide in a shed for 15 minutes until cops came” after receiving what they felt was insufficient aid from workers at Santa Monica Pier (though Watts added that she didn’t think it was workers’ fault). The two also asked viewers to provide any additional details they might have to help identify the man. They went on to defend themselves against online suggestions that the situation wasn’t particularly serious because the man didn’t seem to have a weapon, which is a totally fucked thing to even need to do when there is clear video footage of <em>somebody trying to assault you</em>.</p><p>“He put his stuff on the ground to fistfight Emily,” said Hoffstetter during today’s stream.&nbsp;</p><p>“I am in hindsight very thankful that we were in the area that we were and that we were able to go into the store, because I think if we had been anywhere else on the pier, it would have been a very different situation,” said Watts. “Please take this stuff very seriously. It can happen to anybody if you’re male or female, but if you ask any girl streamer, they all have stories.”</p><p>To wit, nearly every female content creator featured in my book and many more I’ve spoken to over the years have all shared stories of stalkers and assailants, and as of last night, one, Kaitlyn “Amouranth” Siragusa – who in the past has dealt with <a href="https://gamerant.com/amouranth-stalker-update-jail-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stalkers</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/amouranth-is-twitchs-smartest-troll-but-shes-on-thin-i-1847324266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swatters</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23410828/amouranth-abuse-twitch-streamer-safe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abuse</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/08/18/twitch-amouranth-house-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even a suspected arsonist</a> – was robbed at gunpoint in her home. She tweeted about the incident <a href="https://x.com/Amouranth/status/1896432533442904528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as it was unfolding</a>, saying three gunmen had pistol whipped her to the point of bleeding in an attempt to get their hands on her crypto login info. Today she <a href="https://x.com/Amouranth/status/1896600968797561248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted security camera footage</a> of gunmen following her into a portion of her home and then fleeing after one seemingly sustained a bullet wound.&nbsp;</p><p>“They pistol-whipped me but I got one,” Siragusa <a href="https://x.com/Amouranth/status/1896433946919084342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted last night</a>. “Was at gun point they gave me phone and said log in with gun to my head, and I tweeted because calling would be a death sentence.”</p><p><a href="https://esportsadvocate.net/2025/03/popular-social-media-influencer-amouranth-pistol-whipped-in-home-invasion-robbery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Esports Advocate</a> received more details from a Houston Police Department spokesperson, saying that "during the time [the home invasion] was happening, Siragusa’s 36-year-old husband heard the commotion, armed himself, and entered the room. As the suspects attempted to flee, Siragusa’s husband was able to fire off an unknown number of shots, possibly injuring one of the suspects."</p><p>Speaking to Aftermath, both Jakob Avery, managing director of Siragusa’s company, and Nick Lee, evidently still with Siragusa even after the aforementioned <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23410828/amouranth-abuse-twitch-streamer-safe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2022 abuse incident</a>, took unspecified issue with the HPD’s account of events, but said they’d been advised against sharing more during an ongoing police investigation. Lee said that he believes he shot one of the intruders, all of whom had been in the process of drawing weapons, “aiming towards me, and shouting orders” before he opened fire.</p><p>Following the harrowing experiences of Siragusa, Hoffstetter, Watts, and Schunk – as well as those around them – many in the livestreaming community have suggested that bystanders and police will never make for sufficient protection, given their historically <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/08/15/keffals-adin-ross-ishowspeed-swatting-twitch-youtube/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inconsistent responses</a> to these issues. Content creators, they say, <a href="https://x.com/qtcinderella/status/1896465056625480016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">need to hire security</a>. That’s far from an option for most streamers, which <a href="https://x.com/LewSpears/status/1896496737604509800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">serves as a silent deterrent for women in the space</a>. Others have pointed out that this is a multifaceted problem, and security only treats symptoms, not the sickness.</p><p>"It's not a one-off situation. It's not some random crazy guy," a streamer who goes by the handle <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/blau" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blau</a> <a href="https://x.com/JojoPoehls/status/1896663929956536524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> of Hofstetter's situation during a recent broadcast. "This is the result of festering dialogue and conversation around women – around women creators especially. So before we start calling for 'Oh, we need security' [and] 'Oh, we should be more careful with IRL streams,' we need to start holding these fucking toxic clickbait engaging accounts, creators that are farming incel takes – we need to hold all of that accountable."</p><p>But in the meantime, streamers making millions, like Siragusa, can afford security. Avery told Aftermath that in Siragusa's case, that’s the plan.</p><p>“The team is currently looking to increase security on [Siragusa’s] property,” Avery said, “including more cameras, fortified perimeter, and hired security guards.”&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-warner-bros-monolith-wonder-woman"><h3>Major Publishers Can’t Keep Making Fewer, Bigger Games</h3></a><p>"Destined to fail.
