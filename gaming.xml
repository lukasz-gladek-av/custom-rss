            <p>Sony has scrubbed an interview with Naughty Dog head Neil Druckmann from its website after finding "several significant errors and inaccuracies".</p>
<p>Last week Druckmann took part in an interview with Sony as part of the company's corporate strategy meeting, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dogs-next-project-could-redefine-mainstream-perceptions-of-gaming-neil-druckmann-says">at the time</a>, Druckmann was reported to have said that Naughty Dog's next title could "redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming", and that "AI is really going to revolutionise how content is being created".</p>
<p>Soon after it was published, however, Druckmann took to social media to state that his words had been lost in translation, and as such his "words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost".</p>

</figure>
<p>Now, Sony has removed its interview with Druckmann completely. When following the <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html">original link</a> today, the page has been replaced by a message that reads:</p>
<p>"In re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects).</p>
<p>"We apologise to Neil for misrepresenting his words and for any negative impact this interview might have caused him and his team. In coordination with Naughty Dog and [Sony Interactive Entertainment], we have removed the interview."</p>
<p>In short, don't fuck with Druck.</p>

<p>Druckmann and Naughty Dog are currently working on an unannounced game, which the studio exec is both writing and directing. Some have speculated that this upcoming title will be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-think-naughty-dog-left-a-clue-about-its-next-project-in-the-last-of-us-part-1">fantasy-themed release</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Druckmann is working on the second season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation, which is currently being filmed in Canada. Last week, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-casts-jeffrey-wright-reprising-his-role-as-isaac">Jeffrey Wright had joined the show's cast as Isaac</a>.</p>
<p>The Last of Us season two is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-now-confirmed-for-2025-release">currently expected to release next year</a>.</p>

Moana is back, and so is Maui, but beyond that... the first couple of teaser trailers have given absolutely no plot information beyond the fact Moana will be sailing on the ocean. <em>This time, with some more characters! </em></p>
<p id="WpMQVQ">What the new Moana teaser <em>does</em> give fans of the 2024 original, however, is some glimpses of new creatures. And there is one creature that stands out: THIS HUGE WHALE SHARK FRIEND! </p>

<p id="gNSrQQ">Maybe it’s not a friend? I don’t care. I see a whale shark and the only thought in my mind is <em>can I pet it?</em> Hopefully the directors of <em>Moana 2</em> took notes from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23511178/avatar-the-way-of-water-tulkun-space-whale-tattoos"><em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em>’s tulkun </a>and Moana can speak to the big watery friend via a psychic link.</p>
<p id="iLPP4D">Anyway BIG WHALE SHARK FRIEND (!!!!!!) aside, there’s not much plot info beyond some other cool new creatures, a few more characters in the background, and some quips from Maui.</p>
<p id="Usgrij">Maybe the official synopsis will help?</p>
<blockquote><p id="B6YxYb">Moana 2 reunites Moana and Maui three years later for an expansive new voyage alongside a crew of unlikely seafarers. After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she’s ever faced.</p></blockquote>
<p id="aoXm9X">... or not! Mysterious! The gist with this Moana sequel is that it was originally supposed to be a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/disney-plus/2020/12/10/22168776/disney-princess-shows-disney-plus-tiana-moana-baymax-zootopia">Disney Plus series</a>. But in the grand tradition of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2019/3/28/18261900/best-disney-sequels-movies-animation">DTV era of the early 2000s</a>, the TV show was retooled into a movie. Hopefully it’s more seamless than <em>Atlantis: Milo’s Return</em> (the bar is low, and yet). </p>
<p id="MEmydN">Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Auliʻi Cravalho will reprise their roles as Maui and Moana. Unlike the first movie, which featured music from Lin-Manuel Miranda (<em>Hamilton</em>,<em> Encanto</em>), the sequel’s music will be composed by Grammy winners Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear (<em>The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical</em>), composer and Grammy nominee Opetaia Foa’i, and three-time Grammy-winning film composer Mark Mancina. <em>Moana 2</em> will be directed by David Derrick Jr., who previously worked as a storyboard artist on <em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em> and <em>Encanto</em>. This sequel is <em>not</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23668412/moana-disney-live-action-movie-dwayne-johnson">the live-action Moana</a>, which is still in development.</p>
<p id="pflTFY"><em>Moana 2 </em>sails into theaters on Nov. 27. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony has taken down</a> its interview with Naughty Dog studio head Neil Druckmann after finding with it claims were “significant errors and inaccuracies” in the interview. It comes just days after Druckmann, himself, took to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/neil-druckmann-sony-quote-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter to clarify statements</a> that were attributed to him.</p>



<p>“In re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don’t represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects),” Sony said. </p>



<p>“We apologize to Neil for misrepresenting his words and for any negative impact this interview might have caused him and his team. In coordination with Naughty Dog and SIE, we have removed the interview.”</p>



<p>One of the biggest concerns from the, now removed, interview was an apparent quote from Druckmann saying that his new game could “redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming”. Ultimately, however, it was shown that Druckmann never said the quote attributed to him by Sony. He was also attributed to saying that AI would “revolutionize” how games were made in general.</p>



<p>Other examples of the “significant errors” were mentioned by Druckmann or Sony, but it seems as though the interview not only paraphrased, but created new statements from Druckmann entirely. Whether this was intentional by the writer or another tool was used is unknown.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony for more clarification on what the other inaccuracies found in the interview were. Should we receive a response, this article will be updated.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1795805484336734606">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, Ed Boon announced that Homelander is officially coming to Mortal Kombat 1 on June 4, 2024, with early access.</p>



<p>This announcement was joined by a new gameplay trailer. This also revealed that fans can purchase the Premium Edition or Kombat Pack to gain early access to Homelander. </p>



<p>In addition to Homelander, purchasing the Kombat Pack will include Quan Chi, Ermac, Omni-Man, Peacemaker, and Takeda.</p>



<p>Boon added that a Ferra Kameo is also coming “later in June.” However, there is currently no concrete release date for the Ferra Kameo. </p>

<iframe title="Mortal Kombat 1 – Official Homelander Gameplay Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cesDfTQWFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The most recent addition to Mortal Kombat 1 was Ermac, who the devs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-ermac-gameplay-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed last April</a>. Ermac was available with early access on April 16, while the full release didn’t launch until April 23. </p>



<p>So, fans can likely expect the same kind of pacing for the Homelander release. This may also extend to the Ferra Kameo, compared to the Mavado Kameo released soon after Ermac.</p>



<p>Today’s trailer showcases a variety of Homelander’s key moves, as well as a particularly brutal fatality and delightful voice lines. Homelander has remained a fan favorite character from The Boys, and one of the most anticipated additions to the Mortal Kombat 1 roster.</p>



<p>Mortal Kombat also added a crucial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-krossplay-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“krossplay” update</a> in late February, an overdue feature that fans widely praised.</p>

Web-swinging is faster than ever, the story puts a new twist on infamous Spidey villain Venom, and several other antagonists pop up to menace New York's resident webheads, including the deadliest incarnation of Kraven the Hunter, to date. The game also allows you to instantly swap between Spider-Men when you're out on patrol, as you can play as either the original arachnid-themed hero Peter Parker or his protege, Miles Morales.</p><p>"Marvel's Spider-Man 2 may largely give us more of what we've played in Insomniac's previous Spider-Man games, but that winning formula is still so damn fun that it really doesn't matter," Jordan Ramee wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-2-review-web-warriors/1900-6418134/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review</a>. "The story's exploration of loneliness is fantastic, creating gripping new narratives for the two heroes, Peter and Miles, as well as the two main villains, Kraven and Venom. Spider-Man 2 unites all four characters in a riveting narrative throughline you'll want to see all the way through and has the gameplay hooks to keep you engaged the whole ride."</p><p>There have also been a few updates since Marvel's Spider-Man 2 launched, as recent patches have added new costumes to the web warriors wardrobe. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-days-of-play-2024-ps5-deals/1100-6523751/" data-ref-id="1100-6523751">For more Days of Play specials</a>, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 consoles have been discounted by $50</a></strong> and you can <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-VR2-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1QJ6VHY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">save $100 on a PlayStation VR 2 kit</a></strong>.

    </div><div>



            <p>Google has started rolling out its Playables feature on YouTube.</p>
<p>The in-app arcade is available to play on desktop, iOS, and Android, featuring over 75 games including Angry Birds Showdown, Words of Wonders, and Cut the Rope.</p>
<p>Playables is still unavailable to some users, with Google saying in <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-playables/">a blog post</a> that it's "widening availability over the coming months."</p>
<p>YouTube began <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/google-now-testing-playables-gaming-feature-on-youtube">testing its Playables feature last September</a> to a limited number of people.</p>
<p>It was then made available to YouTube Premium subscribers in November, as reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/27/23978515/youtube-playables-games-premium-subscribers">The Verge</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="199" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">When on the hunt for the best cyberpunk anime of all time, you need to keep some things in mind. First, robots are cool. Second, lasers are cool. Third, number one is likely to be <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>.</p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">This list is going to be appallingly biased because we are talking about art here, people. If you don’t understand the concept of subjectivity when it comes to such things, I can’t help you. So, will there be robots? Will there be lasers? Will the adventures of Major Kusanagi and his friends be number one? Read on to find out.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">The best Cyberpunk anime of all time</h2> <h3 id="h-14-blame" data-injectable="false">14 – Blame!</h3> <figure data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Blame! | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hwy806RC2-Q?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">While <em>Blame!</em> tends to fall into a more science-fiction category than cyberpunk; I have always considered both its environment and themes as the almost inevitable end destination of what a lot of cyberpunk explores. After becoming massively reliant on a self-sustaining and automated structure to live, mankind finds itself reduced to the grit between the cogs. </p> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true">The arrival of a mysterious stranger gives a small tribe a chance to make big changes before their own inevitable destruction. This also contains one of the most ridiculous pistols in anime history. It’s just awesome in general, so it is on the list. My article, my rules.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">13 – No Guns Life</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="No Guns Life | Official Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQyWoG43kRI?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true"><em>No Guns Life</em> is a noir-detective story about a man with a giant gun for a head. That should be enough to hook you on its own, frankly. Juzo Inui is a cyborg known as an Extended, built to fight an absolutely brutal war. Now that the war is over, he has taken on the role of a Resolver. He looks to help normal people when they run into problems with other Extended. </p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">Everything is fine as long as he keeps his head down and stays off the radar of the various powerful factions who might have an interest in him. This all falls apart when a young boy needs his help and Juzo isn’t the type of guy to walk away when challenged. Before long, he finds himself face to face with a past he tried to leave behind. This is a fun time, and not enough people have seen it.</p>
 <h3 id="h-12-cyberpunk-edgerunners" data-injectable="false">12 – Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Cyberpunk: Edgerunners | Official NSFW Trailer | Netflix" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JtqIas3bYhg?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="582" data-current-count="882" data-injectable="true">Trigger Studio hit a home run with <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em>. The series set very specifically in the CD Projekt Red version of Mike Pondsmith’s <em>Cyberpunk </em>universe, brought a great cast of characters that lured the audience in, made you emotionally invest, and then delivered an incredible personal finale for each and every one of them. The hook of the series is the focus given to the things that people will do to succeed within the ruleset of their environment, no matter how detrimental the resultant victories might be. Does all the damage really matter if you are winning?</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">11 – Ergo Proxy</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Ergo Proxy Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9y79dwkgZhE?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="648" data-current-count="948" data-injectable="true">You know the story, bad thing happens, the human race is now on the verge of extinction, and we all live in weird little dome cities. It is a tale as old as time. In <em>Ergo Proxy</em>, humans and androids do what they can to survive a dystopian nightmare until a virus results in some of the androids committing murder. Unknown to most, a third element exists in this complex equation: the titular Proxies, almost god-like in nature and perhaps capable of turning the fate of humanity around. This series has become required viewing for animation students over the years, with layers of life-like subtlety that sometimes feel left behind in the industry. </p>
 <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false">This one can be quite dense and will leave a lot up to the viewer. They are not afraid to explore philosophy just for the sake of doing so, so settle down and catch what you can. <em>Ergo Proxy</em> is ultimately an exploration of the question that lies at the very heart of cyberpunk: what does it mean to be human?</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">10 – Psycho-Pass</h3> <figure data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Psycho-Pass Season One - Official Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YzuJnyebc40?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">I have seen <em>Psycho-Pass</em> unfairly referred to as being worth the first season only. While there is certainly an argument that Season 1 had the stronger cast of characters, this doesn’t mean that the later seasons have nothing to offer. </p> <p data-characters="478" data-current-count="719" data-injectable="true"><em>Psycho-Pass</em> is ultimately a show about relationships and how we choose to define them. Everything is viewed through the lens of expectation, as all members of society are scanned; those likely to commit crimes are called “latent criminals,” and it becomes necessary to maintain a clean hue to your Psycho-Pass to avoid a run-in with the law. At the heart of the system is Sibyl, an AI that determines everyone’s fate via advanced tech called cymatic scanning. </p>
 <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">While it is easy to focus on the societal, cultural, and psychological themes of <em>Psycho-Pass</em>, the heart of the series is about the ebb and flow of relationships and how we establish or demolish boundaries in our behavior based on available knowledge about individuals and institutions. The conclusion of <em>Pyscho-Pass</em> is that, ultimately, people cannot exist in the domain of each other’s influence and remain static, no matter how cruel the incentive to do so.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">9 – Paprika</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="PAPRIKA [2007] - Official Trailer (HD)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PIUqozzyW2k?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">In <em>Paprika</em>, a new form of technology that allows people to view each other’s dreams is co-opted by the main character in a bid to help people outside of the psychiatric center where she works. Things start to go wrong when the machines are stolen, and it is up to our heroine to help solve the mystery of who stole them.</p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false"><em>Paprika </em>leans heavily into surrealism to confuse and disturb the viewer, with some scenes playing out in the almost quick-switch nature of dreams. As characters are forced to question what is real and what isn’t, so is the viewer, with things becoming even more confounding as the movie explores the impact that both the real and the unreal can have on each other. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">8 – Bubblegum Crisis</h3> <figure data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Bubblegum Crisis Trailer (OVA Films)" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LGDREScJ5Wg?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">It’s hard to imagine a release schedule like that one <em>Bubblegum Crisis</em> got happening today, but this saw eight episodes released between 1987 and 1991, covering a single season. The story explores Tokyo, which has been split in two by a massive earthquake, with both halves warring so brutally that the country of Japan was to be annexed. </p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="693" data-injectable="true">The main focus lies on the Knight Sabers, an all-female group of hardsuit-wearing warriors who take on rogue robots known as Boomers. Just an all-around fun time, and a sterling example of anime of the era. It would spawn an assortment of other <em>Bubblegum </em>related things, and some other adjacent series like the <em>A.D Police</em> series and <em>Parasite Dolls</em>.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">7 – The Animatrix</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="The Animatrix - Official Trailer [HD]" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qjtnWqq1-7A?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true"><em>The Animatrix</em> was a big deal when it came out in 2003. Produced by the Wachowskis themselves and pulling in some of the best directors and animators that Japan had to offer, this very much felt like the two directors paying back their inspiration by giving them time to shine with an IP that was, at that point, utterly enormous.</p>
 <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">A range of short stories explore themes, occurrences, and historical meaning within the universe of <em>The Matrix</em>, and it is likely that this was the first anime movie for a lot of folks out there who were coming of age and had yet to experience classics that are yet to arrive on this list. The contrasting styles and apparent fun that everyone seemed to have with the subject matter make this an engrossing watch. Also, the soundtrack from Don Davis and Junkie XL just slaps.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">6 – Battle Angel</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Battle Angel Alita Trailer HD (1993 Anime OVA)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFXpRV9zQWc?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="822" data-injectable="true">At barely over 50 minutes runtime, <em>Battle Angel</em> tries to get a lot of the <em>Battle Angel Alita</em> manga covered in too short a time, but that is the only knock on it. It’s a fun romp through a weird world where young Alita finds herself taking on some denizens of the Scrapyard. I will say that the brisk pacing doesn’t allow for tremendous character development, as you move between story beats quite quickly. Still, the animation is wonderful, the action is cutting, and the voice acting is incredibly endearing. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">5 – Serial Experiments Lain</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Serial Experiments Lain Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5y4nQ5Y1V8?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true"><em>Serial Experiments Lain</em> is an interesting fish when it comes to how you wish to define cyberpunk as a genre. In much the same way that cyberpunk will often explore what it means to be human, <em>Serial Experiments Lain</em> does an interesting job of exploring what it means to be real. If a human being is little more than a reaction to a stimulus with no way to confirm shared perception, then which is reality, the reaction or the stimulus?</p>
 <p data-characters="528" data-current-count="528" data-injectable="true">After receiving messages from a supposed dead girl at her school, Lain sets off on a journey to explore just such questions, embracing mystery and confusion on the hunt for what is true. The series runs through challenging themes like loneliness, the difficulty of connection even when that loneliness is conquered, mental health, and the aforementioned conflict of the human condition. Being a product of the 90s, there is a deep obsession with existentialism and surrealism that has somewhat fallen by the wayside ever since. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">4 – Appleseed</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Appleseed Alpha OFFICIAL Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4DtWCjogd1M?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="674" data-injectable="true">The <em>Appleseed </em>manga has resulted in a bunch of different anime adaptations, and frankly, all of them are a good time. The 1988 original will always be one of my favorites, as it was the second anime that I ever saw. Another adaptation arrived in 2004 and had a sequel called <em>Appleseed Ex Machina</em> just three years later. We’ve had a series and another movie since then.</p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">For the most part, <em>Appleseed </em>really leans into the whole “the world is awful, but this giant awesome city will keep you safe, except for all the murder” trope. Dual protagonists are badass Deunan, a normal human woman, and Briareos, a former human man. Briareos gets dumpstered in various ways depending on the adaptation and is now in an experimental cyborg body. </p> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="711" data-injectable="true">Most of the movies deal with large-scale threats that are likely to kill everyone because some character has gone off the rails one way or the other while also exploring how the change to Briareos impacts his relationship and friendship with Deunan. I honestly cannot think of any of these adaptations that I wouldn’t recommend.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">3 – Ghost in the Shell</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Ghost in the Shell (1995 Movie) Official IMAX Trailer - Mamoru Oshii, Masamune Shirow" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8RF09G8Ymqg?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="803" data-injectable="true"><em>Ghost in the Shell</em> is another property where you have a lot to choose from. There has been a huge amount of output around this franchise with five animated moves, a live-action take (kinda weak, frankly), four different series, and then a bunch of straight-to-video stuff that ties into it all. The top recommendations would be the first animated movie, the sequel <em>Innocence</em>, and the <em>Stand Alone Complex</em> series. Frankly, bad <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> is still better than a lot of other anime on its best day. </p>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">The original is a masterclass in animation, tone, world-building, and character development and has one of the greatest soundtracks in anime history. It truly is a fabulous exploration of how much of our humanity we can lose before we are no longer human and how the power of othering people is often a tool used by the most monstrous members of society. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">2 – Cowboy Bebop</h3> <figure data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Cowboy Bebop (Original Series) - Official Funimation Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OhNwckCLzis?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="680" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">An absolute classic; its scope and scale are a bit bigger than most cyberpunk, but we can sneak it onto the list because of its noir-infused detective vibes, dystopian setting, and wondrous explorations of philosophical issues like loneliness, separation, and existentialism. Director Shinichirō Watanabe hit this one out of the park and then proceeded to direct <em>Samurai Champloo</em> as proof that lighting does, in fact, strike twice. Often left unsung in the conversation is Keiko Nobumaoto. She was in the writer’s room on <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> as head writer and would also write on Watanabe’s other revered works, such as the aforementioned <em>Samurai Champloo</em> and <em>Space Dandy</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">Cowboy Bebop followed an episodic format, with most episodes having some form of self-contained tale to tell and an overarching narrative being spun out across all 26 installments. <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> is often used as a way to get people who have a formative interest in anime to experience exactly how fun, energetic, emotional, and provocative it can be, and is rightly considered one of the finest examples of the medium.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">1- Akira</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Akira (1988) Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nA8KmHC2Z-g?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"><em>Akira </em>is, for many people of my generation at least, one of the Big Three when it comes to the first anime that they ever saw and the thing that got them into anime in the first place. In college, everyone knew someone who had <em>Akira</em>, <em>Fist of the North Star</em>, or <em>Ninja Scroll</em> on VHS.</p>
 <p data-characters="618" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="false"><em>Akira </em>has done so much for anime that an assortment of lies and embellishments have swirled for years in an attempt to explain why it has been so impactful. The reality is that this is just good art. Potentially, it is anime done flawlessly, from the story and characters, the tension building, the trust in the audience, the absolutely one-of-a-kind soundtrack, and incredible visuals that helped push the entire medium forward. It managed to penetrate deep into the mainstream long before anime had become just another form of entertainment that we all had easy access to on the internet, which was a feat in itself.</p>

            <p>
Sony has certified a PlayStation VR2 PC adapter in South Korea, as the company readies its plans to make its latest VR headset compatible with computers. 
</p>
<p>
The gadget was <a href="https://www.rra.go.kr/ko/license/A_b_popup.do?app_no=202417210000102053&amp;ref=uploadvr.com">approved</a> by South Korea at the end of March for use in the country. As yet, however, Sony is yet to announce it publicly.
</p>
<p>
A report on the device by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-certified-regulator/">UploadVR</a> speculates that the gizmo will allow the headset to simply plug into your PC via the adapter device.

<p>
The news that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-testing-ps-vr2-compatibility-with-pc">PlayStation is planning to roll out PSVR2 support on PCs comes as no surprise</a>, as Sony quietly confirmed it was "currently testing" the idea back in February. 
</p>
<p>
Details remain thin on the ground, however - without a firm confirmation of when the support will come or how exactly it will work. But the date of the adapter's South Korean filing suggests we will now hear something soon. 
</p>
<p>
For its part, Sony has said it was working on PC support for PSVR2 so owners gain "access to additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5".
</p>
<p>
Launched in February 2022, Sony has not given an update on PSVR2's sales figures for over a year - though said the device had, initially at least, sold more than PSVR1.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg reports last year claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-halves-playstation-vr2-shipments-due-to-disappointing-pre-orders">Sony had slashed its planned shipments of the headset</a> following disappointing pre-order numbers (something Sony later refuted) and had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-vr2-sales-off-to-slow-start-report-suggests">sold less than 300k PSVR2 headsets in its first six weeks</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps-vr2s-launch-sales-surpass-original-headset-sony-says">Sony also refuted this, and said it had shifted 600k</a>). In March this year, Bloomberg reported again that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-vr2-production-paused-as-stock-piles-up-report">PSVR2 production had been "paused"</a> as stock mounted up.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1795802277787119958" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, Sean Murray teased the new Adrift expedition for No Man’s Sky, including various details and a gameplay trailer. </p>



<p>Murray elaborated in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/29/adrift-no-mans-sky-expedition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post via Xbox</a>, which confirms that Adrift will be “free to existing players,” across all platforms. </p>



<p>Adrift features a uniquely abandoned galaxy, an alternative universe where players will feel alone. The traditional “space stations, trading posts and alien traders” will be absent.</p>



<p>Exclusive rewards coming to Adrift will include a “gnawing scuttler companion, a supply of starship stealth paint, a ghostly frigate, and the unique Iron Vulture starship.”</p>

<p>The new trailer and Murray’s posts do not confirm an exact release date and time. However, it will be available “later this week,” leaving either May 30 or May 31, 2024. Further, the Xbox post does reveal that Adrift “will run for approximately seven weeks.”</p>



<p>The most recent No Man’s Sky additions include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-launches-major-orbital-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Orbital update</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-launches-massive-omega-update-with-free-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enormous Omega update</a>. Omega even gave players a free trial, welcoming new players and adding a tremendous amount of new content. Adrift cleverly subtracts the familiar while continuing to give players something truly fresh.</p>



<p>Last February, Murray also posted a cryptic tease that implied No Man’s Sky could get at least <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-possibly-getting-four-more-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four more updates</a>. </p>



<p>This leads up to the developer’s next project, Light No Fire. Hello Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hello-games-light-no-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Light No Fire</a> at The Game Awards 2023, and quickly became one of the most anticipated reveals from the event.</p>

In a world where “Supes” are made, he’s the strongest of them all. Homelander presents himself as the ultimate patriot and protector, but don’t let his movie star good looks or high approval rating fool you. He is a murderous, narcissistic sociopath with an insatiable need for validation, love, and power. Homelander’s destruction of enemies and lust for power does not end with his world. Challengers from other realms will also face his wrath. As seen in the new video, Homelander asserts dominance over opponents through his super strength, aerial attacks, and capacity to laser enemies with his eyes.  </p><p>The trailer also provides a first look at gameplay for Ferra, a new DLC Kameo Fighter who can assist during matches with a range of support moves.

                <p>CD Projekt Red first announced that it was adapting Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk in 2012, and the game had a lengthy development cycle that culminated in Cyberpunk 2077 getting delayed to 2020. Because the game launched with numerous bugs, Sony delisted Cyberpunk 2077 from the PlayStation Store for over six months while CD Projekt Red addressed the issues. But now, for the first time in a decade, no one at CD Projekt Red is working on Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p>The announcement came as part of CD Projekt's latest earnings briefing, as CFO Piotr Nielubowicz released the company's updated financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Cyberpunk 2077's expansion, Phantom Liberty, was released last fall. Since then, one last major update for the game was released in December 2023.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTU0WgwBrvY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CTU0WgwBrvY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>On X, CD Projekt Red released a breakdown of its development team and its current projects. While Cyberpunk 2077 still had 17 developers at the end of February, it currently has none.</p><p>There are now four different gaming projects in the works at CD Projekt Red, each of them in various stages of development. The Witcher 4, which the company has codenamed Polaris, has 407 developers currently working on the title. That game is expected to begin full production some time later this year. There are an additional 39 developers working on a Witcher spin-off, which is known internally as Sirius.</p><p>Additionally, there is a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel in development internally called Orion, which has 56 developers as of the end of April 2024. The fourth game CD Projekt Red is working on is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-dev-debunks-a-rumor-about-its-new-ip/1100-6523633/" data-ref-id="1100-6523633">Hadar</a>, a standalone IP that only has 20 developers so far.</p>

            <p>
Amazon Games is publishing a new narrative-led, open-world racing game from former Forza Horizon developers.
</p>
<p>
Developer Maverick Games is based in the UK and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-5-creative-director-and-several-team-members-break-away-from-playground-games">founded in 2022 by key members of the Forza Horizon development team at Playground Games</a>.
</p>
<p>
Its first AAA game is set for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, with lead writing from Skins co-creator Jamie Brittain (yes, that E4 teen drama show).

<p>
"We founded Maverick Games with a clear vision: to build a developer-first studio that would 
foster an environment of creativity and risk-taking," said studio head and creative director Mike Brown. "This approach empowers our team to produce the most exceptional work of their careers. And ultimately, that means we are creating a game that our players are going to fall in love with."
</p>
<p>
Giving further hints at the new game, Brown added: "Lots of great driving games have amazing gameplay, amazing content. But to really cross that bridge, to become a game that people genuinely love, then there needs to be that human connection where you're actually rooting for these characters, falling in love with these characters. That, I think, is a place where our game will be able to really differentiate itself from the other titles in the genre. There's nothing about this genre that prevents it from having amazing characters and amazing stories - it's just not really been explored yet."
</p>
<p>
The unannounced game will join other Amazon-published games like MMOs New World and Lost Ark, as well as the forthcoming Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider game and a Lord of the Rings MMO.
</p>
<p>
Amazon also opened a new development studio in Bucharest earlier this month to support with projects.
</p>
<p>
As for Playground Games itself, it's working on the next instalment of the Fable series instead of Forza Horizon. The Forza Motorsport games are developed by Turn 10 Studios.
</p>
<p>
It's unknown if we'll receive more news about Fable at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">forthcoming Xbox Games Showcase</a>, though last summer the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fables-narrative-lead-leaves-playground-games">narrative lead left Playground Games</a>.

            <p>
Exploratory space sim No Man's Sky increasing tilt into the wonderfully bizarre continues today with the launch of a brand-new update, titled Adrift, which this time lets players explore an abandoned universe where civilisation has come to an end.
</p>
<p>
Adrift is, at least in part, a nod to No Man's Sky's earliest days - where lifeforms were scarce and exploration was an entirely solo, wonderfully lonely endeavour against a seemingly endless backdrop of stars. "There's so much we love about the game now," Hello Games says, "but there was something unique at release in how alone you felt in the universe."
</p>
<p>
To that end, Adrift gives players the option to explore an alternative universe of broken, rusted buildings and lost Travellers graves, that's free of other lifeforms, shops, trading, shortcuts, or help - all creating what Hello Games calls a "very different survival experience".

The new universe isn't completely devoid of activity, however; for reasons almost certainly related to the weird, Eldritch pockets of No Man's Sky lore I never quite fully wrapped my head round, sandworms roam this dead expanse, and fiend eggs have spread across planets. Plus, the <a href="https://youtu.be/UVy8Wj0CdlA">trailer</a> suggests spectral entities and other abominations have made it through to the end of all things too.
</p>
<p>
Hello Games - which is also working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">procedural fantasy adventure Light No Fire</a> - says that while Adrift is a new limited-time Expedition (essentially a several-hour-long campaign built around a series of progression-based milestone challenges), it's also an update that's ballooned to be "filled with improvements, new unique gameplay content, and rewards." It introduces the Iron Vulture - a bulky new Hauler starship and "safe haven" players can acquire as part of the update - as well as ghostly frigates to recruit in space. New ship customisation options can also be found - but, based on what's been shared at the time of writing, it's unclear if the alternative universe will remain accessible once the Expedition is over.
</p>
<p>
Adrift - which follows No Man's Sky's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-is-free-to-play-this-weekend-as-new-omega-update-lands">Omega</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-orbital-update-overhauls-space-stations-today">Orbital</a> updates earlier this year - launches today for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC. Full patch notes can be found <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/05/expedition-thirteen-adrift/">on the No Man's Sky website</a>, and the studio notes there's "a lot [more] planned and still to announce".

            <p>Star Citizen has raised over $700m in crowdfunding, even though it still lacks a full release date.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/star-citizen-crowdfunding-passes-700-million/">Neowin</a>, the <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals">funding tracker</a> for Cloud Imperium Games' space sim has seen an uptick in donations recently. On 25th May alone, almost $3m was raised.</p>
<p>This has coincided with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-when-you-can-play-star-citizen-for-free">Star Citizen's free play period which kicked off earlier this month</a>, and allowed non-backers to give the game a whirl for themselves. At the time of writing, Star Citizen has raised a whopping $702,634,839. And - again - it isn't even fully out yet, and is still in an early access build.</p>

<p>Star Citizen is notorious for its long development - having been in the works now for over a decade, and its 'whale' status in the video game world. For example, back in January, the team released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizens-latest-dlc-pack-costs-over-45000">DLC pack costing almost £46,000</a>.</p>
<p>Alas, all of this funding hasn't avoided job cuts at Cloud Imperium Games. In February, it was reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-developer-hit-with-layoffs-amid-claims-of-a-highly-toxic-company">Star Citizen developer had suffered layoffs</a> amid unrest due to relocation and accusations of a "highly toxic company".</p>

<p>As for when Star Citizen may get its full release, this remains unconfirmed. The studio's <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/roadmap/release-view">progress tracker</a> says Star Citizen's Alpha 4.0 update is scheduled for Q3 of this year, but this is still listed as "tentative". However, in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-is-finally-pushing-towards-the-finish-line">Cloud Imperium Games' CEO Chris Roberts said Star Citizen is pushing towards the "finish line".</a>.</p>
<p>In a letter shared with the game's community, Roberts said "2023 marked the beginning of a transformative chapter for Cloud Imperium", and "all of this points towards 2024 being our biggest and best year yet in the universe of Star Citizen".</p>

Developer Hello Games just released the sci-fi adventure’s latest update — it’s called “Adrift,” and it introduces an alternative universe that’s completely devoid of other characters.

			<p>Hello Games is back today with yet another unexpected and interesting No Man's Sky update. Called Adrift, it will provide an entirely different way to experience the massive sci-fi universe where the player is all alone.</p>
<p>The developers said there was something unique about being alone in the universe when No Man's Sky first launched. Looking at pre-release builds, they remembered a time when there weren't even any NPCs (non-player characters) or shops.</p>
<p>That's what Adrift is all about. The removal of any other lifeforms means no shops, no trade, no shortcuts, and no help whatsoever, making for a very different survival experience.</p>
<p>This alternate universe is also more dangerous, with sandworms roaming free and fiend eggs spreading across planets. Buildings are crumbling and rusting, and the few remaining landmarks are the graves of lost travelers. A new ghostly frigate beckons in space, allowing players to recruit a piece of this lonely universe. Moreover, a new hulking hauler starship, the Iron Vulture, provides a safe haven.</p>

<p>Following the addition of ship customization in the previous update (<a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-orbital-update-ship-editor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ORBITAL</a>), Hello Games is introducing lots of new customization options to the game in Adrift. This was meant to be the next No Man's Sky expedition, which it is, but it's grown into an update filled with improvements, new unique gameplay content, and rewards. For the full patch notes, <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/05/expedition-thirteen-adrift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head to the game's official website.</a></p>

<p>This is the third major free No Man's Sky update released in 2024, and yet Hello Games has promised there is a lot more to come. Given their track record with updates, it's fair to expect at least two to three updates before the year is over.</p>

  <p id="H8PI5c">In 2013, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/science/space/nasas-new-class-of-astronauts-gives-parity-to-men-and-women.html">NASA had its first class of potential astronauts</a> made up of 50% female candidates, and when director Liz W. Garcia (<em>Purple Hearts</em>) read that fact she had a lot of thoughts. </p>
<p id="miZMLM">“I was surprised that it had taken so long, but also pleased that we’d finally gotten there, and I was moved to look into what it takes to become an astronaut candidate,” she told Polygon over email. “Once I learned how astonishingly competitive it is to even get to the point that you’re being considered, I knew I wanted to set a movie in that world, because it’s so extreme.”</p>
<p id="1FSSvv"><em>Space Cadet</em>, out July 4 on Prime Video, follows a Florida party girl named Rex (Emma Roberts, <em>Madame Web</em>) who dreams of going to space. She doesn’t have the proper credentials, but with the help of her best friend (Poppy Liu, <em>American Born Chinese</em>) she embellishes her resume a little and somehow lands a spot in NASA’s astronaut training program. </p>
<p id="13UV6v">She’s so determined to see the stars that she’s able to impress the program directors (played by Gabrielle Union, <em>Bring It On</em>, and Tom Hooper, <em>The Umbrella Academy</em>). But how long will she be able to keep up her less-than-factual resume and experience? </p>
<p id="klKrV0">“Like in<em> Legally Blonde</em> or <em>Private Benjamin</em>, I was excited to show a heroine who was underestimated and who had none of the cut-throat, pedigreed qualities we typically associate with elite success, but whose very down-to-earth, inclusive, feminine (!) approach would ultimately be what made her so good at the task at hand,” Garcia said. “It’s a feel-good movie about the world as I’d like it to be, where doors are open to everyone and women are celebrated.” </p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Amazon will be publishing Maverick Games' debut title.</p>
<p>The unannounced driving game will be open world and narrative-led, and release across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Co-creator of TV show Skins, Jamie Brittain, is on board as the game's lead writer.</p>
<p>Maverick was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playground-games-leaders-form-new-aaa-studio-maverick-games">founded by Playground Games' veterans in January 2023</a>, including studio head and creative director Mike Brown, and is run by COO Harinder Sangha. It currently employs around 60 people and is based in Warwick, UK.</p>
<p>Amazon Games' VP Christoph Hartmann commented: "In our ongoing global search for talented development teams who are building compelling titles that players will love, Maverick Games stood out as a studio that can deliver on all fronts.</p>
<p>"Mike and his team are the total package – proven game developers who are masters at their craft and aren't content with the status quo. Their vision for this game is fresh and innovative, and we're looking forward to working alongside them to bring it to players around the world."</p>

The developer’s first project will be a story-focused, open-world driving game.</p>

<p>Maverick Games is based in Warwick, UK, and was founded by six former leaders from Playground Games. Its roster includes studio head and creative director Mike Brown, former creative director of the Forza Horizon series, executive producer Tom Butcher, chief technical officer Matt Craven, and content director Gareth Harwood. It also includes former Playground audio director and art director Fraser Stachan and Ben Penrose, respectively.</p>

<p>Maverick Games staff</p>

</article><p>The studio announced in January 2023 that its first title would be a “premium open-world game for consoles and PC.” A press release includes an interview with Mike Brown, who provides hints of what Maverick’s game has in store, which appears to emphasize storytelling and character development more than you'd expect for a driving game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Lots of great driving games have amazing gameplay, amazing content,” said Brown. “But to really cross that bridge, to become a game that people genuinely love, then there needs to be that human connection where you’re actually rooting for these characters, falling in love with these characters. That, I think, is a place where our game will be able to really differentiate itself from the other titles in the genre. There’s nothing about this genre that prevents it from having amazing characters and amazing stories – it’s just not really been explored yet.”</p>

<p>The press release also announces the hiring of Jamie Brittain, co-creator of the award-winning British TV drama <em>Skins</em>, as the game’s lead writer. Brown explains his belief in the power of good characters and cites <em>Skins</em> as an example of showcasing interesting, flawed characters to garner its cult-like following.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maverick Games’ project joins Amazon’s growing portfolio of games, which includes Crystal Dynamics’ <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/12/15/amazon-games-will-publish-crystal-dynamics-next-tomb-raider-game">upcoming Tomb Raider title</a>, an <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/lord-of-the-rings-mmo">MMO based on The Lord of the Rings</a> by New World developer Amazon Games Orange County, along with its existing titles Lost Ark and New Word.&nbsp;</p>

Former U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush, as well as ex-UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Iraq leader Saddam Hussein, combine to utter words from the shadows that allude to some grand conspiracy the player will presumably unravel over the course of Black Ops 6’s campaign.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>To accompany the release of the trailer, Activision released a single piece of key art for Black Ops 6. On the face of it, this image, below, rekindles memories of Black Ops 1’s iconic box art, with a soldier in a familiar pose while holding handguns. But fans have spotted various clues and Easter eggs in the image that have certainly set the cat among the pigeons within the community.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/black-ops-6-key-art-1716980700525.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Activision.</figcaption></figure></output><p>First off, at the 35-second mark the trailer shows a set of numbers that are the real-life coordinates to  Saddam Hussein’s palace. This makes sense in the context of the trailer itself, which features Hussein, but fans are also wondering if Black Ops 6 features a mission that takes players inside the palace itself, or perhaps there's a multiplayer map set within it.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blackops6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#blackops6</a> Co-Ordinates found in the new teaser trailer are co-ordinates to Saddam Husseins Palace.

The <a href="https://youtu.be/hTOPHflxhSs?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> summarizing his findings less than 24 hours after the publication of the reveal trailer is a quite incredible journey to what ends up being a well-argued suggestion that Tranzit from Black Ops 2 has inspired the first Zombies map for Black Ops 6.</p><p>MrRoflWaffles demonstrates some remarkable detective skills as he analyzes the various clues in the trailer, including hard-to-read lines of text, seemingly innocuous images, as well as etchings on weapons, then cross-references them with real-world places and events to work ouit potential locations in which Black Ops 6 takes place. There are power plant accidents, old Black Ops lore, images of churches and bridges, and it all leads to a theory that a Tranzit-inspired map called Liberty Falls is the first Black Ops 6 Zombies map.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Live Action Reveal Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>MrRoflWaffles is in full Pepe Silvia meme mode here as he either veers off in a completely wrong direction or solves a Zombies Easter egg months before Black Ops 6 comes out. “Am I crazy, or am I cooking?” MrRoflWaffles asks viewers. Either way, if you have even a vague interest in Call of Duty, the video is worth a watch.</p><p>More glaringly obvious is Activision’s clear tease relating to ‘Sally.’ Activision has released handgun variants into Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone with ‘Sally VI’ etched into one of them. At the 39-second mark in the teaser trailer, we see a one-frame visual for ‘Sally VIII.’ Sally VIII is etched into one of the handguns on the Black Ops 1 key art. And, completing the set, the Black Ops 6 key art includes the text: ‘Codename Sally VII.’ Whatever it means, Sally looks set to play a key role in Black Ops 6.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/cod-unredacted-005-1716980901334.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Activision.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Activision has expertly laid these breadcrumbs for fans to follow, and they’re having a lot of fun doing just that. Expect a Black Ops 6 gameplay reveal, and plenty more breadcrumbs to follow, during the Xbox showcase and subsequent Call of Duty Direct in June.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p data-characters="183" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>XDefiant</em> may only have been out for a week, but Ubisoft’s <em>Call of Duty</em> competitor has already broken some major milestones, reportedly hitting over seven million unique players.</p> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-8-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, Ubisoft expected to cross the eight million mark by the end of May 28, and has already set company records for players. According to the article, the publisher’s internal goal was to reach five million unique players within a month of release, a milestone that has been smashed within seven days. </p> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true">Unique players are categorized as players who downloaded the game and opened it at least once. Of course, the 7.6 million will be made up of players who didn’t return after the first play, but it still shows that interest and early reviews for the game were strong enough to entice people in. </p>

On top of that, the success of <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> left many wondering if Ubisoft had missed their chance, and would be unable to compete with <em>CoD</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">Despite those concerns, <em>XDefiant</em> has clearly gotten off to a good start, but now we need to wait and see if they can hold on to these players.

                <p>Modern gamers who have fully embraced digital gaming may believe that the titles they've purchased will belong to them in perpetuity. But if anyone is hoping to pass on their Steam backlog to their next of kin, it turns out that Valve doesn't allow the rights to be transferred. In other words, your Steam library dies with you.</p><p>Via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/after-you-die-your-steam-games-will-be-stuck-in-legal-limbo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ars Technica</a>, a user on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/to-anyone-who-is-curious-no-you-cannot-transfer-your-steam-account-via-a-will-you-can-only-take-your-games-to-your-graves.875634/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a> posted a reply that they received from Steam support regarding their question about passing on their Steam library through a will. "Unfortunately, Steam accounts and games are non-transferable," replied a representative from Valve. "Steam Support can't provide someone else with access to the account or merge its contents with another account. I regret to inform you that your Steam account cannot be transferred via a will."</p><p>Some users have put a considerable amount of money into their Steam libraries, and it may be disheartening to hear that those games could simply be gone following the death of the Steam account owner. However, the easiest workaround may be to simply pass on the username and login info to potential heirs without informing Steam. The thorny issue of who really owns the digital games would remain, but at least the titles would still be playable.</p><p>An additional way to preserve Steam games is to pass down any computers that already have the titles downloaded. However, without access to the original Steam account, those games wouldn't be available for installation on a different device or even accessible for reinstallation on the computer they're currently on in the event of a hard-drive crash or other system failure. For that reason alone, this may not be an optimal solution. But until Valve offers users a better way to pass on their games, there aren't many other options available.</p>

        <p>Publisher was awarded $14.4 million in damages</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Activision has won a lawsuit against cheats manufacturer EngineOwning.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/activision-wins-14-4m-judgment-against-call-of-duty-cheat-vendor/">VentureBeat</a>, the publisher was awarded $14.4 million in damages and $292,912 in legal fees granted by the United States District Court of the Central District of California.</p>
<p>The court also issued an injunction to the Germany-based website, and ruled that the domain name must be transferred to Activision.</p>
<p>EngineOwning provides and sells cheats for Call of Duty, in addition to other titles including Counter-Strike, Battlefield, and Titanfall.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-files-lawsuit-against-cheat-provider">initially filed in January 2022</a>, in which Activision argued that cheats provided by the website caused "massive and irreparable damage to its goodwill and reputation and to lose substantial revenue."</p>

        <p>Latest entry in Activision's flagship franchise will be available via subscription service at launch</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>  <div>



            <p>Microsoft has confirmed this year's Call of Duty will launch on Xbox Game Pass alongside its retail and digital versions.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/28/play-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-game-pass/">Xbox Wire post</a> added that players will be able to pre-install Black Ops 6 when it launches later this year. The game will be officially revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9, which runs during Summer Game Fest.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-microsoft-to-add-next-call-of-duty-title-to-game-pass">Reports earlier this month</a> suggested the new Call of Duty would be added day-and-date to Game Pass, with <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1795385251306324292">The Verge's Tom Warren</a> reporting yesterday that the subscription service's app let slip the confirmation ahead of the official announcement.</p>
<p>Microsoft is gradually bringing Activision titles to Game Pass following the completion of its acquisition last year, banking on the publisher's portfolio to boost the subscription service.</p>
<p>The first such launch was Diablo 4 in March, with the platform holder's latest financials revealing it was played for ten million hours within the first ten days, making it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-and-diablo-boost-microsofts-gaming-revenues-but-xbox-sales-continue-to-fall#:~:text=played%20for%20ten%20million%20hours%20within%20the%20first%20ten%20days%20of%20being%20on%20the%20service%2C%20making%20it%20one%20of%20the%20biggest%20first%2Dparty%20launches%20since%20the%20subscription%20service%20began">one of the biggest first-party launches for Game Pass</a> since the service launched in 2017.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be the first Activison Blizzard title to launch day-and-date on Game Pass, a practice Microsoft has implemented with all of its internally developed titles since the subscription began.</p>
<p>Opinion is divided on the impact the inclusion of Call of Duty in Game Pass will have on developers. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/so-microsoft-now-owns-activision-blizzard-how-will-this-affect-the-rest-of-the-industry#:~:text=%22If%20you%20can%20get%20the%20new%20COD%20for%20%27free%27%2C%20why%20should%20you%20try%20out%20the%20next%20indie%20gem%3F%22">Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz</a> shortly after the Activision acquisition, The Last Worker director Jörg Tittel argued that having access to the shooter would dissuade subscribers from trying out indie games, while No More Robots founder Mike Rose suggested it may boost the exposure of indie games included in the service.</p>
<p>While the acquisition was being <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard-whats-going-on-and-what-happens-next">scrutinised by regulators</a>, there were concerns that Microsoft would not only launch Call of Duty simultaneously on Game Pass but also withhold it from other platforms in order to grow the subscription service.</p>
<p>However, Microsoft has made a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-nintendo-sign-ten-year-call-of-duty-deal-more-xbox-games-to-follow">binding agreement with Sony to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation</a> for the next ten years, with a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-nintendo-sign-ten-year-call-of-duty-deal-more-xbox-games-to-follow">similar agreement in place for Nintendo</a>.</p>

            <p>
MultiVersus welcomed over 100,000 Steam brawlers on its relaunch, but new character restrictions have left a bad taste in the mouth of players.
</p>
<p>
The multi-franchise Warner Bros. fighter re-released last night across PC, Xbox and PlayStation, following the end of its open beta last year. On <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/">Steam</a>, it recorded a concurrent player peak of 114,515 in the last 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
However, despite some fairly impressive numbers, the free-to-play brawler has come under fire from the community for a number of reasons, with the main issue being new character restrictions.

<p>
MultiVersus players have found themselves blocked from using the full roster when playing locally, as well when accessing the training mode. While on the MultiVersus <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/faq">website</a>, developer Player First Games states "All characters can eventually be earned through gameplay", these restrictions are <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1818750/discussions/0/4331979056057264963/">different from how it worked during the beta</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"It used to be the case that you could play any character for local play, and I've been having a blast playing with my siblings all year, but now that the game is out, the characters you can select are only the ones you've officially unlocked," reads one thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersusTheGame/comments/1d2lxzt/character_restrictions_for_local_play_is_a_major/">reddit</a>. "I mean, I know why they did it (money), but I'm really disappointed by this new edition and my hype has been officially killed."
</p>
<p>
"This is going to actually lose them money in the long run because now people won't invite their friends over to play local matches," another user replied. "Fighting game tournaments will be far less likely to host this game. It's only day one and they're already bottlenecking the amount of people that will see the game."

Currently, players can unlock new MultiVersus characters by purchasing them with Gleamium (the in-game premium currency) or with Fighter Currency. Both Gleamium and Fighter Currency can be earned through events and grinding, but Gleamium can also be acquired with real-world money. Some characters are unlocked by completing challenges, and there are a handful of characters available to play without purchasing them.
</p>
<p>
A number of players have subsequently reasoned MultiVersus is a free-to-play game, and needs to generate revenue somehow, and therefore they don't see a problem with the new restrictions. However, others feel locking characters even in training mode is an especially low blow. Many argued this is when players could take a 'try before you buy' approach to fighters.

Other <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersusTheGame/comments/1d2tccz/everything_that_changed_for_the_worse_from_the/">quibbles</a> on MultiVersus' relaunch have included reports the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818750/MultiVersus/#app_reviews_hash">now feels "slow and clunky to play"</a>, the camera zooms in far too often, lag, and "no more battle pass XP after every match".
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has reached out to Warner Bros. for further comment on the aforementioned change.

            <p>A producer on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> has confirmed that those working on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space flight sim</a> are being laid off en masse. We already knew that the developers at Intercept Games would be losing their jobs thanks to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kerbal-space-program-2-feared-cancelled-as-70-layoffs-reported-at-take-twos-seattle-offices">closure announcement from Washington State</a>. Until remarks from Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, muddied the waters. Zelnick refused to acknowledge that the studio was being closed when asked by a reporter, even going so far as to claim the opposite. "We didn't shutter those studios," he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">told IGN</a>. But it seems clear from one producer's testimony that Zelnick's remarks are inaccurate. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The team at Intercept Games will be laid off as of June 28th so a great group will be out and about looking for their new roles. As will I," said senior design manager Quinn Duffy in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/quinn-duffy_well-here-we-go-again-the-team-at-intercept-activity-7201280703215394816-uyzd/">a post on LinkedIn</a>. Duffy has been working at the studio in its final months.</p>
<p>"I got to know the designers pretty well in my all-too-brief time there," he said. "These are some fantastically smart and talented people and I'm happy to vouch for their qualities."</p>
<p>Intercept Games was not the only studio to be affected by Take-Two's decision to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-take-two-cancel-games-and-lay-off-hundreds-to-rationalize-their-pipeline">"rationalize"</a> hundreds of people out of their livelihoods. Roll7, the creators of OlliOlli World and Rollerdrome, are also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skateboarding-studio-roll7-is-reportedly-being-closed-down-by-parent-company-take-two">reportedly being completely closed</a>. We've asked folks at Roll7 and Intercept Games for comment to clarify Zelnick's remarks, but so far no word. </p>
<p>To those affected the reality appears obvious. The studios are being closed. So why doesn't the CEO admit as much? Jason Schreier of the Washington Post points out that Take-Two <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1791221924636270950">behaved in a similar way with 2K Marin</a>, a studio they shut down in 2013. Although that studio has not been operating for 11 years, executives have never admitted to closing the studio in plain language. </p>
<p>It's hard to know what Zelnick (or his PR people) are thinking when they commit to inscrutable language that seems to defy reality. It is possible that, since the process of closure is ongoing, there are legal reasons (or tax reasons (or both)) behind the reluctance to state clear facts. </p>
<p>To close a limited company in the UK in the most simple (and cheapest) way is known as "striking off", and costs as little as £10. However, one condition is that the company needs to have assets less than £25,000. Otherwise you need to go through a "liquidation" process, which can cost a lot more. Since it takes time to offload assets and get affairs in order, it's possible Zelnick has been advised not to confirm any closures explicitly yet, even though notice has been served to staff. It is also possible that company names like Intercept or Roll7 are being treated as resources in themselves. In other words, the corporation may not want to close the studios in the legal sense, but instead leave them dormant on paper. Like that bit in Indiana Jones were the US government stacks the Ark of the Covenant away into a vast stockpile of looted perils. </p>
<p>But I don't know. This is all thoughts-out-loud. I'm not an accountant or a corporate lawyer. Nor do I have any inside knowledge about Take Two's practices when it comes to auto-cannibalising and absorbing the life force of its child companies. Nevertheless, we've reached out to them for comment too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-silicon/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has been reportedly ready for release since last year, but the console's launch may have been delayed to coincide with big game releases.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of the Broken Silicon podcast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> briefly commented on the upcoming mid-generation hardware refresh from Sony, saying that, at some point, the console was unlikely to be released. Work continued, however, and the system's final silicon was completed and ready for release last year.</p>
<p>As for why the PlayStation 5 Pro, Moore's Law is Dead believes Sony wants its launch to coincide with the release of big games that could better showcase the system's power, such as Grand Theft Auto 6. This definitely makes a lot of sense, considering the latest entry in the series by Rockstar Games is only releasing on current generation consoles, and it is likely going to be a huge system seller, and Sony is not launching any big game this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="US Gov't Buying AMD, RDNA 4 w/ FSR 4, Nvidia RTX 5080 Export | Defense Engineer | Broken Silicon 259" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fqUn_Jdo1mg?start=2389&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Very little is currently known about the PlayStation 5 Pro, and everything we do know comes from reports and rumors that have yet to be officially confirmed. From what we know about its specs, we should expect <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-cpu-boost-performance-40-fps/">more stable 40 FPS modes</a> thanks to the modest CPU upgrade may lead to more stable 40 FPS modes and better-looking games using dynamic resolution scaling thanks to the 45% faster GPU.&nbsp;The system will also support the PlayStation Super Spectral Resolution upscaler, which will eventually support up to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/">8K resolutions </a>and considerably better ray tracing performance over the base model.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially announced. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>Valve is still actively working on Steam clip recording, according to SteamDB creator and dataminer Pavel Djundik.</p>
<p>That's what Djundik <a href="https://x.com/thexpaw/status/1795720970742993331?t=I7f9ujVS1G9IMdUpQarxbw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X some hours ago. Apparently, the Steam feature will allow users to share clips via the Steam community in a similar fashion as screenshots. Steam users can already take in-game screenshots by pressing the F12 key in games that run the Steam Overlay. Players can then share these screenshots with a player's Steam community. In addition, players can share the shots on social media. This feature was made available back in 2011 after a short beta period. Currently, Steam users have 1GB of cloud space per user account. This space is used for the aforementioned screenshots, game settings, save games, profile stats, and more.</p>
<p>Clip recording is said to offer support for background recording. In addition, the clip recording feature is said to offer timeline markers in supported titles for various in-game events. A comparable feature is already available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox, where the console automatically records a clip whenever achievements unlock. On X, Djundik<a href="https://x.com/thexpaw/status/1795720973809033332" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> also shared</a> some additional screenshots of this feature, which we've included below.</p>
<figure>
<div>

<p>At the moment, Steam users need to make use of Microsoft's Game Bar record feature, third-party tools, or NVIDIA's and AMD's video capture tools in the GPU drivers. No additional details about the feature have been shared just yet. We'll update you as soon as we learn more.</p>

Activision is awarded $14,465,600 in statutory damages and $292,912 in attorneys’ fees, and the court issued a permanent injunction to enjoin EngineOwning’s “unlawful conduct” and to transfer its domain name, www.EngineOwning.to, to Activision.</p><p>Activision successfully argued that EngineOwning continued to circumvent its security systems and sell the cheating software in violation of the The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). It called for the minimum statutory damages of $200 under the DMCA multiplied by the general approximation of the number of downloads of the cheating software in the United States (72,328), for a total of $14,465,600. The Court found the request “reasonable” under the circumstances.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Live Action Reveal Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>In February 2023, a judge ruled that EngineOwning must pay Activision $3 million in damages after a lawsuit in which Activision claimed high-profile streamers used Warzone cheats. But EngineOwning continued its operation, selling cheats for 2023’s Call of Duty game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023">Modern Warfare 3</a> as well as Warzone. Activision then continued its long-running battle with the cheat maker, resulting in this ruling.</p><p>There are now questions about whether Activision will see any of the money it is owed by EngineOwning, or its ability to claim ownership of the website. At the time of this article’s publication, cheats and HWID spoofers remain available to buy from EngineOwning, which seemingly operates outside the U.S.</p><p>Of course, competitive multiplayer video games have endured a cheating problem for decades, and Call of Duty in particular is seen as having a cheating and hacking problem, most prominently on the free-to-download battle royale Warzone on PC. Activision and other video game publishers face an uphill battle in the war against cheat makers, but the Call of Duty company will be hoping rulings such as these act as a meaningful deterrent as it prepares to release <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> later this year.</p><p>Overnight, Activision <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1795554591020642673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say that all accounts found to have participated in any form of boosting behavior in Multiplayer or Warzone Ranked Play would have their SR reset and be removed from the Leaderboard ahead of the Season 4 launch. Activision continued: "Additionally, as previously announced, accounts that boosted their progression in Ranked Play will be permanently restricted from accessing Ranked Play modes in Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone."</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>A new earnings report from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/witcher-3-tips">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> makers CD Projekt Red has revealed that the follow-up to the sorceress-courting, Nekker-thwacking, horse-reassuring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG </a>is currently being worked on by around 400 people, and plans to move into the production phase by the “second half of the year.” Elsewhere, the report shows that the studio’s previous RPG, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-walkthrough-hub-all-of-our-guides-in-one-handy-place">Cyberpunk 2077</a> officially ended all development at the end of April, at which time the remaining 17 staff still tweaking that game’s ray-traced chewing gum foil moved on to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">Witcher 4</a> , or ‘Polaris’, as they keep insisting it's called.</p>

<p>Here’s a little graphy-graph below. I’m sorry I just wrote that. I was trying to make the graph sound fun. It’s on the page now. There’s nothing I can do about it.</p>

<p> An investors call was also made recently, in which joint CEO Piotr Karwowski spoke about the company’s market strategy going forward. "I would actually not look at Cyberpunk as the guidebook of how it's going to be with The Witcher specifically," Karwowski said. He added that CD Projekt won’t go full steam ahead on marketing until something “actionable,” is available, such as preorders, via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-is-the-largest-game-in-development-at-cd-projekt-by-the-size-of-the-team-but-also-by-the-progress-of-ongoing-work/">PC Gamer</a>. You can come back to this article and call me a big doofus in a few years time if I’m wrong, but I have to assume CD Projekt won’t make the same mistake twice, especially when it comes to golden greyboy Geralt.</p>
<p>If you fancy reading some of the best words on both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty </a>expansion this side of those nifty gaps in Keanu Reeves’ beard I promise I’ve never tried to replicate while shaving, our Graham has you covered. He reviewed both the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-review">original release </a>and its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">chunky expac</a>, and also wrote about that expac’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-new-ending-is-its-most-heartbreaking-and-worth-returning-for">heartbreaking ending</a> - a genuinely moving bit of storytelling that contained the sort of subtlety and reserve you may not have previously assumed the game was capable of, say I.</p>
<p>My own contribution to the conversation that I’m sure everyone else has noticed by now but I’ve never read anywhere else is this: Did anyone else notice how the Grimes performance at Phantom Liberty’s party scene perfectly mirrors Songbird’s story arc? It does! It’s all there, told in expressive dance and lasers. Go watch it on YouTube if you missed it, assuming you still care enough about Cyberpunk easter eggs and/or Nic Reuben conjecture.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi's latest game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fantasian-the-new-jrpg-made-by-final-fantasy-creator-is-out-now-on-apple-arcade/">Fantasian</a>, could be making its way on other platforms very soon, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Earlier today, well-known leaker Midori <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1795720873913278921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that a former Apple Arcade exclusive will soon be announced for multiple platforms without hinting at which game will make the jump. X/Twitter user Genki mentioned Hironobu Sakaguchi's Fantasian, and Midori's reply seems to suggest the unique JRPG by Mistwalker will be the one making the jump.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy series creator's latest JRPG release on other platforms would be very welcome, but it wouldn't really be surprising.<a href="https://wccftech.com/hironobu-sakaguchi-is-open-to-bring-fantasian-to-pc/"> Last year</a>, Hironobu Sakaguchi mentioned during the MAGIC 2023 anime and game festival that he is aware of the demand for a PC version of the game and a sequel and that he is open to both. Hopefully, the time has come for more players to experience one of Mistwalker's most visually unique games.</p>
<p>Before releasing Fantasian, the development team headed by the creator of the Final Fantasy series released plenty of other JRPGs, including Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon, both launched on Xbox 360 years ago. With rumors of next week's Xbox Showcase being interesting for fans of<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-showcase-360-era-jrpg/"> Xbox 360-era JRPGs</a> and Fantasian launching on other platforms, it seems like Mistwalker may be coming back into the JRPG spotlight very soon.</p>
<p>Fantasian is now available as part of the Apple Arcade service. We will let you know if the game is indeed releasing on other platforms as soon as an announcement is made, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p data-characters="233" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you fancy an automatic rifle that can deal good damage at long distances, then <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>‘s MTZ-762 loadout might be right up your alley. That’s why I’ve put together the best loadout possible to help you. </p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">Truth be told, the MTZ-762 isn’t super popular right now, with just a 0.79% pick rate according to WZStats.com. When it comes to automatic rifles, the MCW, MTZ-556, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-bp50-jak-revenger-kit-loadout-in-mw3/">BP50</a> are the most picked options—but don’t let that fool you. The MTZ-762 is still a viable gun in the <em>MW3</em> meta if you have the right loadout. </p> <figure data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>This Battle Rifle can pack a punch.

 <h2 id="h-mtz-762-mw3-loadout-attachments" data-injectable="false">MTZ-762 <em>MW3 </em>Loadout: Attachments</h2> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Shadowstrike Suppressor</li> <li><strong>Optic: </strong>Mk. 3 Reflector</li> <li><strong>Stock: </strong>EXF Close Quarters Assault Stock</li> <li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>SL Skeletal Vertical Grip</li> <li><strong>Magazine: </strong>30 Round Mag</li> </ul> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">This loadout is all about recoil control, which is where the <strong>EXF Close Quarters Assault Stock</strong> and <strong>SL Skeletal Vertical Grip</strong> come into play, as both make it easier to control your weapon. The <strong>30 Round Mag</strong> helps you with ammo consumption, giving you more bullets to fire before you reload, while the <strong>Mk. 3 Reflector</strong> <strong>Optic</strong> will help you hit your shots. </p>
 <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="134" data-injectable="false">Finally, the <strong>Shadowstrike Suppressor</strong> will keep you off enemy radar, which is useful if you’re trying to set up and hold a lane. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best&nbsp;<em>MW3</em>&nbsp;MTZ-762 Perks and Equipment</h2> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Vest:&nbsp;</strong>Infantry Vest</li> <li><strong>Gloves:&nbsp;</strong>Commando Gloves</li> <li><strong>Boots:&nbsp;</strong>Covert Sneakers</li> <li><strong>Gear:&nbsp;</strong>Ghost T/V Camo</li> <li><strong>Lethal Grenade:&nbsp;</strong>Frag</li> <li><strong>Tactical Grenade:&nbsp;</strong>Flash Grenade</li> </ul> <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true">I’ll be honest here, I hardly ever change my perks in <em>MW3</em>, because this setup is just so strong. The <strong>Infantry Vest</strong> increases your Tactical Sprint time while reducing its refresh, while <strong>Commando Gloves</strong> mean you can reload while sprinting. </p>
 <p data-characters="169" data-current-count="169" data-injectable="false"><strong>Covert Sneakers </strong>are a must-have so you don’t make noise while you walk around, while <strong>Ghost T/V Camo</strong> keeps you off enemy UAVs and Heartbeat Sensors while you move. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-is-certifying-an-adapter-to-bring-the-psvr2-to-pc.883599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/psvr-2-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A new certification license has been found that could make the PSVR 2 headset compatible with PC sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>First found by Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1795734108058042709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@SadlyItsBradley</a>, the new <a href="https://www.rra.go.kr/ko/license/A_b_popup.do?app_no=202417210000102053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">certification license</a>, which happened on March 27, 2024, suggests that Sony could be thinking about changing its PSVR 2 strategy.</p>



<p>The new adapter could mean that players who own the headset or intend to buy one soon have access to a huge library of games on the PC. In early 2024, PlayStation announced that it is planning to add <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-planning-pc-support-for-psvr2-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC support for the PSVR2</a> system sometime in 2024.</p>



<p>The announcement read, “Also, we’re pleased to share that we are currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5.”</p>



<p>In March 2023 and despite rumours suggesting that the headset was selling poorly, PlayStation announced that the headset sold around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/psvr-2-is-outselling-the-psvr-sony-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">600,000 units in its first six weeks</a>. However, the headset has since seen a lack of post-launch support with new games since its release, with recent rumors suggesting that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-pauses-psvr2-production-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company has paused production of the headset</a> due to poor sales.</p>



<p>One could speculate that the move to PC facilitates the lack of games on the company’s hardware and if the rumors of production being paused are true, perhaps we could see a relaunch alongside the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Pro</a>, which is scheduled to release later this year. </p>



<p>What do you think of the PSVR 2 coming to PC? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
