			<p>The <strong>State of Gaming 2026</strong> report from global data firm <strong><a href="https://sensortower.com/">Sensor Tower</a></strong> is here, looking back on 2025 across several metrics, including which games sit atop the global sales charts - not just regional charts like <strong>Circana's</strong> US-specific reports. We knew that <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-best-selling-game-in-us-2025/">best-selling game in the US last year</a>, but now Sensor Tower's data confirms it to be the best-selling game on a global scale, and it's not the only <strong>EA</strong> game at or near the top of the charts.</p>



<p><strong>EA Sports FC 25</strong> and <strong>EA Sports FC 26</strong> took the number two and number three spots, respectively, for second and third place among best-selling AAA games. If you combine their sales, they pass Battlefield 6 to take the top spot. EA essentially had the top end of the market locked up from other major players like <strong>Take-Two</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong>. An unsurprising result, considering Sensor Tower's report also puts EA at the top of the publisher list by <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-spent-most-on-ads-2025-ea-biggest-publisher-game-downloads-pc-console-ps5-xbox-steam/">game downloads across PC and console platforms</a>, despite Microsoft spending the most on ads.</p>

<p>When you open it up to more than just AAA games for the top three best-selling games of 2025, the number two and number three spots go to last year's breakout indie hits, <strong>R.E.P.O.</strong> and <strong>PEAK</strong>, in that order. EA Sports FC 25 and<strong> Grand Theft Auto V</strong> round out the rest of the top five.</p>



<p>Even when you move away from premium games and move to <strong>free-to-play</strong>, EA still came out on top in 2025, with <strong>Skate</strong> coming in as the most downloaded free-to-play title. Not that those downloads translated to engagement compared to other big free-to-play titles, since it ranked <strong>17th</strong> among the top PC and console games by monthly active users (MAUs).</p>



<p>While EA dominated the new AAA space, the other thing worth noting is the fact that the AA, remastered, and older AAA games that are priced anywhere between <strong>$30</strong> and <strong>$60</strong> made up the majority of Sensor Tower's entries in its dot graph of the best-selling games. Among those are notable 2025 releases like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hazelight-studio-josef-fares-next-game-better-than-split-fiction/">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-tops-the-29th-annual-dice-awards-taking-home-game-of-the-year-yet-again/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Rematch</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>.</strong></p>

			<p>Global data firm <strong><a href="https://sensortower.com/">Sensor Tower</a></strong> has released its <strong>State of Gaming 2026</strong> report, which looks back at the video game industry in 2025 across a wide range of metrics, including where publishers are spending their marketing money and which publishers have the most downloaded portfolios. Last year, <strong>Microsoft</strong> was the publisher that spent the most on marketing for its PC and console games, but it came <strong>second</strong> in terms of cross-platform game downloads for its portfolio of titles, behind <strong>Electronic Arts (EA)</strong> in first, while <strong>Take-Two</strong> came in third.</p>



<p>At least that's how it shakes up when you're not including the mobile industry. The number of downloads across PC and console markets, data which Sensor Tower pulls from <strong>Steam, PlayStation,</strong> and <strong>Xbox</strong>, is, as you might expect, far smaller than the scale of what's happening in mobile. If you include the mobile downloads, it's <strong>Tencent</strong> that stands above the rest. </p>



<p>The only reason the graph below shows <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/denis-dyack-defends-ue5-decries-state-of-the-industry/">Embracer Group</a></strong> at the top is that the data used for the graph does not include data from <strong>Supercell</strong> or <strong>Miniclip.com</strong>. Without those numbers, Tencent sits in fifth place with its PC, console, and mobile downloads combined.</p>



<p>EA was the number one publisher in terms of PC and console game downloads with <strong>206M</strong>, followed by Microsoft in second place with <strong>148M</strong> and Take-Two in third with <strong>92.8M</strong>. The rest of the PC/Console top five is rounded out by <strong>Ubisoft</strong> at <strong>80.1M</strong> and <strong>Sony Interactive Entertainment</strong> at <strong>73.9M</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-450.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Sensor Tower</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As for where the rest of the top five PC and console publishers stand in their ad spend, Take-Two sits behind Microsoft in second, EA is in third, <strong>Epic Games</strong> is in fourth, and Tencent is in fifth. Ubisoft, <strong>Nintendo</strong>, and Sony take the next three spots, respectively, with the top ten getting rounded out by <strong>Roblox</strong> and <strong>Wargaming.net</strong>, in that order.</p>



<p>Even with Epic Games coming in fourth for overall ad spend, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/fortnite-everything-we-know-hub/">Fortnite</a></strong> takes the top spot for the most money spent on ads for a single game. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a></strong>, the only game on the list from EA's portfolio, and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/top-3-best-selling-aaa-pc-console-games-all-ea-games-battlefield-6-ea-fc-25-ea-fc-26/">best-selling game of 2025</a></strong>, had the fourth biggest marketing spend to take top spot on the sales charts.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/page-55.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Sensor Tower</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Microsoft, meanwhile, was spending most of its ad budget on <strong>Minecraft</strong>, though it also spent a fair chunk of change on <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</strong>. Interestingly, <strong>1047 Games</strong> spent enough money trying to market <a href="https://wccftech.com/1047-games-makes-one-final-bid-splitgate-arena-reloaded-battle-royale-arena-royale/"><strong>Splitgate</strong> </a>that it made the top ten list for PC and console games with the most ad spend in <strong>ninth place</strong>. The peak concurrent player count on Steam for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-dev-responds-to-low-player-counts-steam-charts-dont-measure-fun/">Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</a></strong>, the game that started out as Splitgate 2 and gained its 'Arena Reloaded' subtitle <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/"><strong>following a relaunch</strong></a>, remains at just under <strong>26K</strong>.</p>



<p>A clear example of how you can't just throw marketing money at a game to get it back on its feet, with its numbers more regularly sitting around and under <strong>1K</strong>. Not that Steam is the whole picture, of course.</p>



<p>With all of these portfolio downloads and marketing spend, the games that actually kept players engaged in terms of monthly active users (MAUs), the top five of that list is about what you would expect, especially considering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/">top five most-played games on PS and Xbox in the US alone for 2025 (and 2024)</a>. <strong>Counter-Strike</strong> is the only wrinkle, bumping Roblox out of the top five.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/page-53.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Sensor Tower</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>EA is also the only publisher to have more than three games in its portfolio on this list, between Battlefield 6, <strong>EA Sports FC 25</strong>, <strong>Apex Legends</strong>, and <strong>Skate</strong>. The next publishers up are Microsoft with Minecraft, Call of Duty, and <strong>Forza Horizon 5</strong> and Take-Two with <strong>Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K25,</strong> and <strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong>. Epic Games and <strong>Valve</strong> have two each, while every other game is that publisher's sole inclusion.</p>

The game is being directed by former <em>Forza Horizon </em>lead Mike Brown.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson told Dring that the company has "decided to release Maverick Games from [its] publishing agreement with Amazon Game Studios" as a result of a "strategic evolution to focus on projects that leverage Amazon's unique strengths and scale".</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Maverick Games has been "released" from its publishing agreement with Amazon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Amazon goes on to say that it has "tremendous respect" for Maverick and its "narrative-led driving experience", and that it hopes Maverick can find a "publishing partner whose strategic priorities are better aligned with bringing [its] game to market".</p><p>For Maverick's part, Sangha and Brown say that they're "grateful" to Amazon for its "partnership and collaboration" and that the studio is currently in "active dialogue with partners who share [its] long-term ambition for the IP". More will apparently be shared later in the year.</p><p>This is the latest in a string of retreats from the gaming industry at large for Amazon. In January, the publisher announced its MMO <em>New World </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazons-ill-fated-mmo-new-world-to-shut-down-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fa9fca01-ebe1-4d7d-9d03-0b8eab5c442a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">will shut down in 2027</a>, and just this week, Glowmade announced that its multiplayer dungeon-crawling platformer <em>King of Meat </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/king-of-meat-shutting-down-in-april" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="702a0256-360f-4752-b32a-fd72f175e8c8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">is closing its doors in April</a>.</p><p>Amazon also reiterates to Dring and The Game Business that it will continue to focus on streaming service Luna, which got a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-rework-later-this-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4199f9c-3f78-478b-b2f3-b566d7133e1b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">major overhaul late last year</a> and which is now geared more towards casual audiences than "core" players.</p><figure role="group">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The latest Steam re-release of Square Enix’s original 1997 classic </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII </span></i><span>dropped last night on February 24, and it’s </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3837340/FINAL_FANTASY_VII/"><span>already sitting at</span></a><span> an “Overwhelmingly Negative” score, with only 36 percent of the 308 reviews being positive. For comparison, the previous Steam version of the game, now titled the “2013 Edition,” has a 92 percent “Overwhelmingly Positive” score. That could be this debacle’s one saving grace, but, unfortunately, Square Enix </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/39140/view/514107648813039662"><span>decided to delist</span></a><span> the 2013 Edition of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span> when the new version dropped last night.</span></p> <p><span>It’s somewhat difficult to sum up all of the many issues that users have reported in their Steam reviews due to the sheer number of them, but the main problems reviewers are taking issue with are stuttering sound effects, a forced launcher (that somehow registers inputs even when the game is fullscreened), buggy resolution settings (that don’t actually alter the resolution when selected), and a lack of optional filters. The lack of filters is especially ridiculous, as reviewers are reporting “blurry” visuals, and because the delisted 2013 Edition featured options for linear filtering and an “Original Graphics” mode.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, the silliest issue has, thankfully, already been patched out. Although “patched in” might be the better wording here, as several people on </span><a href="https://x.com/Zizoplays1/status/2026409178873336235?s=20"><span>X</span></a><span> reported that the original Steam depot for </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII </span></i><span>was 0 kilobytes. That’s not an exaggeration or a joke: someone at Square Enix seemingly forgot to upload the actual contents of the game to Steam.</span></p> <p>“You guys had what… 13 years? <b>13 YEARS</b> and all the money in the world, just to add 4 features, controller support, bilinear filtering and steam cloud save files,” reads one review on Steam. “This version is a disaster avoid it all all costs,” warns another.</p>

 <p><span>On the plus side, some of the reported issues I chose to omit have been fixed. For instance, the FPS of the original release of</span><i><span> Final Fantasy VII </span></i><span>has been doubled in the new version on Steam, from 15 FPS to 30 FPS. That sounds great in theory, except that the FPS increase also resulted in animations and cutscenes playing at </span><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991388946/recommended/3837340/"><span>double their normal speed</span></a><span>. I can see why Square Enix chose to fix that particular issue first. Hopefully, the speed at which they rectified the issue implies that another patch is on its way soon.</span></p>

<p>Matt Booty, the new Xbox Chief Content Officer, says there is no AI directive coming from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/microsoft/" id="189">Microsoft </a>and clarifies Xbox’s stance on the technology.</p>



<p>On Friday, February 20, 2026, a major shake-up occurred at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/microsoft-games/" id="1707">Microsoft Gaming</a>. Phil Spencer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-sarah-bond-resigns/" id="178338">retired</a>, and Sarah Bond, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sarah-bond-shares-memo-to-her-team-following-departure-at-xbox/" id="178381">previously the president of Xbox</a>, resigned. In their place, Asha Sharma was named the new CEO of Microsoft Gaming, and Matt Booty was named the new CCO. Both share the title of EVP.</p>



<h2 id="h-matt-booty-says-no-ai-directive-from-microsoft">Matt Booty Says No AI Directive from Microsoft</h2>



<p>Asha Sharma previously headed Microsoft’s CoreAI division. As a result, there have been many questions about the future of AI implementation in Xbox games. Now, Matt Booty is speaking out to clarify that there is no directive from Microsoft’s higher-ups to send her development in AI.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with Windows Central’s Jez Corden</a>, Booty said there was no plan to enforce some kind of AI mandate. Still, he noted that developers are free to use whatever tools they want. Also, he clarified the vision for AI within Xbox: to be additive and supportive of developers.</p>



<p>“We’ve got no pressure from Microsoft; there are no directives on AI coming down. Our teams are free to use any technologies that might be beneficial, whether it’s helping write code or check for bugs — things more in the production pipeline. At the end of the day, as Asha said, we’re committed to art made by people,” he said, while also reaffirming Sharma’s feelings that Xbox won’t flood their ecosystem with “slop.”</p>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/25/greedfall-2-publisher-nacon-files-for-insolvency-weeks-before-the-rpg-sequels-launch</link>
            <guid>1445857</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nacon, the publisher behind the upcoming <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/greedfall-the-dying-world">GreedFall: The Dying World</a> and other games like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/hell-is-us/brains-over-brawn">Hell Is Us</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/robocop-rogue-city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>, has filed for insolvency. In other words, Nacon is out of money; as such, the publisher has requested the initiation of judicial reorganization proceedings.&nbsp;</p><p>Insolvency, in this instance, means Nacon is unable to pay the debts it owes to a debtor. Insolvency typically involves companies that have assets with value – publishing rights, IP, and the like, in this case – but lack the hard cash needed to make payments it owes. &nbsp;And because the debtor is seeking payment, non-cash assets that might otherwise be up for sale have little leverage if they don't add up to the funds owed, which is likely the situation Nacon is in.</p><p>"In a video game sector marked by long investment cycles and significant transformations, on [February 20, 2026], Nacon announced that the situation of is majority shareholder, Bigben Interactive, which, following an unexpected and late refusal by its banking pool, was unable to make the partial repayment of its bond loan to its bondholders, was significantly affecting its own operations," the <a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nacon-CP-25.02.2026-English-Diffusion.pdf">filing</a> reads.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZFbgFsAzz9Y"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZFbgFsAzz9Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"The Company indicated on this occasion that its liquidity situation required the rapid implementation of a financial restructuring with its creditors in order to ensure the continuity of its operations, and that it was considering procedures intended to facilitate the restructuring of its debt under the supervision of the Court," the filing continues. "To date, the Company reports that its available assets do not allow it to meet its due liabilities. In this context, the Company will, as of today, file for [insolvency]."</p><p>As for what this means for upcoming games like GreedFall: The Dying World, which launches into 1.0 on March 12 after years of Early Access, it probably means nothing – GreedFall: The Dying World, which is a sequel to Spiders Studios' 2019 <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/greedfall">GreedFall</a>, will likely launch as planned next month. In the longer term, Nacon's filing says the aim of insolvency is to "assess all possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of the Company's activity under the best possible conditions, protect employees, and preserve jobs, while renegotiating with its creditors in a calm and constructive framework. This procedure will enable the Company to continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan."&nbsp;</p><p>Another wrinkle to this insolvency filing is that Nacon is set to hold its Nintendo Direct-style showcase – Nacon Connect – next week on March 4. That's likely to still happen, though, similar to GreedFall: The Dying World's launch the following week. Nacon also just launched <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a>, the third game in the stealth series that started in 2014 with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/styx-master-of-shadows">Styx: Master of Shadows</a>, last week on February 19.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2rp4yWv49c"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2rp4yWv49c" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><em>Game Informer </em>will update this story if it learns more about Nacon's ongoing insolvency efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/robocop-rogue-city/serving-the-public-trust"><em>Game Informer's </em>RoboCop: Rogue City review</a>, and then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/greedfall/greedfall-review-empowering-choice">check out our thoughts on the first GreedFall</a>.

            <p>Lara Croft's newest actress Alix Wilton Regan has promised she will honour every Lara that has come before with her portrayal of the legendary tomb raider.</p>
<p>At The Game Awards last year, Wilton Regan was announced to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-actress-camilla-luddington-bids-farewell-to-tomb-raider-as-alix-wilton-regan-teases-were-just-getting-started">taking over the role of Lara Croft for Tomb Raider: Catalyst and Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis from Camilla Luddington</a>, who appeared in the recent Survivor trilogy.</p>

<p>While Luddington's Lara started the series as an inexperienced and somewhat naive adventurer, she soon grew into a gritty and more than capable killer. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-2026-lara-croft-seems-to-be-returning-to-what-made-90s-tomb-raider-great-and-as-a-lifelong-fan-i-couldnt-be-more-excited">Lara from the original Tomb Raider games was for sure a force to be reckoned with</a>, but she also had a sassy confident attitude which immediately endeared fans. So, where will Wilton Regan's Lara land? Will she be familiar to long-term Tomb Raider fans, or will her Lara be something totally different? Well, she will be a mixture of both.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying that to be convoluted," Wilton Regan told the Press X to Continue podcast about her take on Lara Croft, stating she had to go through several rounds of auditions before landing the role. "I think it is genuinely a bit of both."</p><p>The Tomb Raider: Catalyst actress said the phrase she is working with for her portrayal is "no Laras left behind", which I personally love. "I like the idea of 'no Lara is left behind'," Wilton Regan continued. "I've looked at all of the performances. Obviously, I've got all the scripts, so I know where it's going, and, you know, I think all of the Lara's that have previously come before will also be informing as we move into a new era of Tomb Raider, I would say.</p>
<p>"I genuinely, I <em>genuinely</em> think that fans are going to love it… I want to insert a swear word. It's brilliant. I know what we are making, it's brilliant. Wherever you fall, whether it's the original, the remasters, the classics, the Survivor trilogy, wherever on that spectrum… you are going to love it."</p>

Not to rub it in the faces of PlayStation and Xbox owners (except that’s exactly what I'm doing), but it’s also better than ever, offering up a total of eight playable games with the addition of two SNES titles exclusively for Nintendo’s platforms.</p>
<p>The end result is a glorious throwback to the early ‘90s (or very late ‘80s if you bought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ducktales">DuckTales</a> at launch in North America) that wisely refrains from messing too much with the games’ presentation. For folks who grew up with these titles, playing them will be the equivalent of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsEPqUmHDTo">Anton Ego reminiscing about his childhood</a> in <strong>Ratatouille</strong>, while newcomers may be surprised at just how satisfying they remain after all these years. Difficult, yes, but satisfying.</p>
<p>The full lineup includes the aforementioned DuckTales, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/chip_n_dale_rescue_rangers">Chip ‘n Dale Rescue Rangers</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/talespin">TaleSpin</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/darkwing_duck">Darkwing Duck</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ducktales_2">DuckTales 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/chip_n_dale_rescue_rangers_2">Chip ‘n Dale Rescue Rangers 2</a>, all for the NES. Representing the SNES for this release, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/goof_troop">Goof Troop</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/bonkers">Bonkers</a>. The former is a particularly interesting slice of history, since it’s one of the first games designed by Shinji Mikami, famed creator of the <strong>Resident Evil</strong> series.</p>
<figure><a title="The Disney Afternoon Collection Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161964/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Goof Troop is actually the outlier in that it’s really the only one that’s not a side-scrolling action game of sorts. Instead, you navigate a top-down environment with each screen presenting a small selection of light puzzles. You’ll spend your time kicking blocks to reveal secrets, chucking items at enemies, and using a hookshot to get out of tricky situations. It’s a lovely little game, though one that’s clearly designed for two players.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are no gameplay changes to account for whether you play solo or with a friend, so given that it’s very much intended for the latter, you might find it lacking if you’re going it alone. Still, it’s a worthy addition for the Switch 1 and 2 edition, and one that boasts some absolutely banging music.</p>
<p>The other SNES game, Bonkers, is a delight. Published by Capcom, but developed by Sun L, it’s a pretty basic platforming experience in which you navigate a series of simple levels with a few boss battles thrown in. The key mechanic here is that you’re able to dash, using the added velocity to destroy items and defeat enemies.</p>
<figure><a title="The Disney Afternoon Collection Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161959/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Visually, Bonkers looks, well… <em>bonkers</em> for 1994. The character sprites are wonderfully detailed, and the backdrops make great use of colour gradients to depict sunsets. It really is a beautiful game, and though it feels a little sluggish at first compared to the NES games included, the more approachable difficulty makes for a nice change of pace.</p>
<p>Speaking of NES, the remaining six games are mostly great. Honestly, the only one I’d say you could get away with skipping entirely is TaleSpin, and <em>maybe</em> Darkwing Duck at a stretch.</p>
<p>TaleSpin, which is a side-scrolling shooter, isn’t even that bad. My main issue is that it’s just overly difficult thanks to the excruciatingly slow rate of fire and brutal precision of your enemies’ shots. Even the collection’s rewind feature — triggered at any point by holding ‘ZL’ — isn’t enough to alleviate the frequent frustrations.</p>
<p>Darkwing Duck, meanwhile, is a perfectly fine spin on <strong>Mega Man</strong>, though I’d argue the level design just isn’t anywhere near the ingenuity showcased in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/mega_man_2">Mega Man 2</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/mega_man_3">3</a>. That said, there are some flashes of inspiration, including the ability to temporarily light up a pitch black sewer by hanging from light switches. Like Mega Man, it’s also really challenging at times, and will require lightning-fast reflexes to vanquish some of the more devious foes.</p>
<figure><a title="The Disney Afternoon Collection Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161960/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>DuckTales and Rescue Rangers, plus their respective sequels, are the stars of the show here. Both offer up compelling mechanics (the pogo jump in DuckTales and the box throw in Rescue Rangers) that, while certainly not new or unique by today’s standards, nevertheless contribute greatly to the games’ overall appeal. Add in some surprisingly appealing visuals for the NES and a smattering of catchy music, and these four games really stand the test of time, representing Capcom at the top of its game in the early ‘90s.</p>
<p>Originally launched in 2017, The Disney Afternoon Collection was one of Digital Eclipse’s first projects under its current form. As such, the way in which it presents its bonus material doesn't quite reach the heights of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration">Atari 50</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tetris_forever">Tetris Forever</a>, but there’s still a lot here to appreciate.</p>
<p>Concept art, packaging material, and original advertisements can be found in the Gallery feature, with some useful contextual annotations provided for each piece. A music player is also available immediately, letting you replay your favourite tracks at any point (and yes, I have the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8OIjKc3mK8"><strong>To The South</strong></a> tune from Goof Troop playing right now).</p>
<p>You've also got the usual visual options available for each game, including TV and monitor filters alongside the ability to view each game in its original resolution, enlarged to touch the top and bottom of the screen, or stretched to fill the entire view (don't go for this last option, though, for goodness' sake). You also have optional custom borders, though I'd argue that it's best to play these kinds of games without any border.</p>

<p>Finally, all of the NES titles also include Time Attack and Boss Rush modes to increase their otherwise short length. These are nice additions and I imagine a small chunk of the retro community will relish chipping away at their times and climbing the leaderboards. The SNES games don’t include these, which is a shame.</p>
<p>It’s worth just considering that even with eight games to enjoy, The Disney Afternoon Collection is still a fairly brief experience. Its longevity will ultimately rest on your willingness to replay each game and improve your completion efficiency.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Disney Afternoon Collection is a delightful throwback to the '90s, offering up eight mostly great games across the NES and SNES. While you could potentially skip one or two, the lineup represents a particularly prolific period for Capcom, one in which licensed games were — contrary to much of the competition — actually worth your time and money.</p>
<p>With a handy rewind feature and the sort of supplemental material you've come to expect from Digital Eclipse, this is a great compilation that deserves a second chance on Switch 1 and 2.</p></section>

              <p>It’s beginning to feel like people have forgotten the true meaning of Next Fest. Steam’s week-long bonanza of demos once felt like a cool club to be in, indies sharing their progress on games in development and gathering wishlist clicks for forthcoming releases. This year, I’ve been bombarded with PR emails about games coming to the event since early January, and with over 3,500 demos, people are finding themselves <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-feb-2026-gen-ai-art-demos-2000673280">disappointed by the amount of AI slop</a> that is clogging up the pipes. But fear not, because I—your bravest hero—have trawled through the hundreds and hundreds of pages to bring you ten fantastic games you’ve likely never heard of before, and that are all totally worth your time.</p> <p>This is as eclectic a mix as I could manage, with FPSes, word puzzles, demonic farming sims, traditional platformers and text-based survival sims. There’s even a ridiculous game about mining for anachronistic guns. Check them out, and most of all, click that Wishlist button to help the developers gain attention in the utter madness that is Steam’s store.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2647900/Seth/">Seth</a></h2>  <p>I cannot remember the last time I played an FPS that feels&nbsp;<em>this</em> good.&nbsp;<em>Seth</em> is a stage-based shooter in which you take on an arena of enemies in order to gain new abilities, more health, or points to spend between rounds, and it is a complete thrill. There are two weapons to choose from in the demo, the Fang of Anubis and the Bow of Neith, and can I please implore you to pick the latter? It’s a crossbow that briefly slows time when you aim, allowing you to pick off perfect headshots in busy crowds of furious demonic enemies, then follow up with an almighty punch to polish them off. There’s also a dash, sprinting, and sizeable jump, all at super-speed, to give that <em>Quake 3</em>-like fluidity, but in a single-player game. Love it.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778050/Mythmatch/">MythMatch</a></h2>  <p>What an extraordinary thing it can be to play multiple demos for the same game, years apart. When I first played <em>Mythmatch</em> it was a colorful, imaginative merger game based in Greek mythology, and honestly that seemed enough. But playing this enormous demo today, it has grown into so much more! This is now an amazing mix of RPG, merger puzzling and mini-challenges, with a host of mortal and godly characters to talk to and complete quests for, and it’s all just completely joyful. Even better, it’s out in just three weeks, so make sure to wishlist this one and grab it March 13.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2190700/Altered_Alma/">Altered Alma</a></h2>  <p>Sometimes what I want is a good, solid platform action game. No intricate puzzling complexity, no bizarre twist on the format: just proper, chunky running and chopping and bouncing off walls. And that’s what the demo for <em>Altered Alma</em> offers, and how. The pixel art is lovely, the action is weighty just where I want it, and sometimes it’s good for things to be uncomplicated.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3670630/Besmirch/">Besmirch</a></h2>  <p>In an era when every other game is a farming sim, it takes an awful lot to stand out. But wow, <em>Besmirch</em> does so, with its extraordinary combination of creepypasta weirdness and wonderful aesthetics. This is a game about staving off the hunger of a twisted, broken town—one where no one seems to be entirely right and demons come out in the dark. So water the crops, till the land, and remember to keep a crucifix on your table at night. Or get outside with a shotgun.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4044990/DEG/">DEG</a></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000673340" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000673340"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000673340">© Doseo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s always a good sign when I realize that I’ve been playing one demo for far too long, firstly because it means I’m having a great time, and secondly because that’s one generous demo! That was my experience with <em>DEG</em>, a logic puzzle game that’s a cross between picross, Slitherlink and Pic-a-Pic. Which, if those words mean nothing to you, is a very good thing. It’s brilliantly put together, asking you to figure out its rules by trial and error, getting more interesting and involved the more you play. I cannot wait for this to be finished. (There’s no YouTube trailer, but <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Pzx6zuEUJ/?spm_id_from=333.1387.homepage.video_card.click">you can watch it on BiliBili</a>.)</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3756940/The_Ratline/">The Ratline</a></h2>  <p>The latest game from Owlskip, the small indie team that invented the genre&nbsp;<em>Roottrees&nbsp;</em>got rich from, is&nbsp;<em>The Ratline</em>. You play as a detective in 1971, expert at identifying hiding suspects, and recruited by a mysterious figure to help catch escaped Nazis who have never faced justice! These war criminals are living under assumed identities around the world, and you need to piece together evidence and clues to figure out their new names and locations. You can start catching Nazis in the demo, and the full game comes out March 17.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4239730/Spellsy_Demo/">Spellsy</a></h2>  <p>I’m currently running a 77-day streak on the completely splendid&nbsp;<a href="https://squaredle.app/"><em>Squaredle</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>Spellsy</em> takes that same concept of finding words by dragging a line through a grid of letters, but adds an extra dimension of complexity: each letter tile needs to be used a certain number of times to be destroyed, and you have to clear the grid with the fewest three-letter words possible. It requires a remarkable amount of planning and skill, and this demo has a&nbsp;<em>very</em> generous number of puzzles to play.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3934080/Dig_For_Riches/">Dig for Riches</a></h2>  <p>If you were lucky enough to be part of last year’s idiotic phenomenon that was&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/"><em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em></a>, then do I have the game for you.&nbsp;<em>Dig for Riches</em> is a blatant rip-off/evolution of the idea, in which instead of digging up a back yard, you’re mining in the Old West. Except, um, you’re mining for guns? Anachronistic guns that shouldn’t be invented yet. But that’s a small concern after you unlock the cell phone. It’s all extremely silly, with a pleasingly fast loop, plenty to unlock and upgrade, and the sheer stupidity of putting soil-covered guns in a wheelbarrow for profit.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3823370/Beyond_Words/">Beyond Words</a></h2>  <p>It’s a bold move to promote your game as “from the legendary developers” of something, but in this case it’s well-earned as it refers to Rare’s David Doak and Steve Ellis, leads on <em>TimeSplitters</em><em>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>GoldenEye</em>. So what manner of first-person action game are they bringing us? Oh, it’s single-player Scrabble.</p> <p>But it’s&nbsp;<em>good</em> single-player Scrabble! It’s actually a lot more complex than that, and while it’s very much based on the traditional tiles of the board game, this is much more about stringing together ridiculously high scores boosted by bonus cards bought between rounds, on elaborate boards covered in all sorts of special markers.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3435110/Dont_Freeze_A_Winter_Card_Survival/">Don’t Freeze</a></h2>  <p>This is such a neat idea, so impressively delivered. It’s a survival game, kinda like&nbsp;<em>The Long Dark</em>, except it’s played almost entirely in text. Rather than a first-person world to explore, instead you’re moving cards between locations and your backpack, managing your food, drink, warmth and sanity through meters, and crafting from the loot you discover when “exploring” in different locations.</p> <p>After spending ages with the demo, now as I write I’m recalling the game’s world as if it had had fancy graphics.

<p>Unlike other extraction shooters on the block, Marathon offers a unique class system in the form of Runner Shells. These biosynthetic shells are designed to help you survive the harsh environments of Tau Ceti, and there’s a ton of variety already on offer.</p>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> will launch with six unique Runner Shells, each with its own Primary and Tactical abilities, as well as a handful of Traits to make each one feel distinct. Whether you prefer to hang back and survey the battlefield or storm right in and lead the charge, there’s most certainly a Runner Shell for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-destroyer-shell-abilities-in-marathon">All Destroyer Shell Abilities In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Absolute unit. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Destroyer Shell is the most tank-like of the classes, offering a balance between manoeuvrability and dealing/soaking damage.</strong></p>



<p>The abilities for the Destroyer Shell are: </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Type</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Name</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Primary</td><td data-align="center">Search &amp; Destroy</td><td data-align="center">Activates shoulder-mounted missile pod that fires heat-seeking missiles.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Tactical</td><td data-align="center">Riot Barricade</td><td data-align="center">Activates a front-facing energy shield that blocks damage</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Thruster</td><td data-align="center">Allows for quick lateral dashes for quick evasive manoeuvres</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Tactical Sprint</td><td data-align="center">Additional sprint type that’s faster than usual, though it generates more heat</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>A Destroyer wants to get into combat as quickly as possible with its Thrusters and Tactical Sprint, and stay there with help from the Riot Barricade. Once you’ve got your enemies pinned, hit them with the Search &amp; Destroy missiles to finish them off. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-assassin-shell-abilities-in-marathon">All Assassin Shell Abilities In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Strike in the shadows—or smoke. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As the name might suggest, the Assassin Shell is a stealthy Runner class that utilises invisibility and smoke effectively to both evade detection and dominate combat.</strong></p>



<p>The abilities for the Assassin Shell are:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Type</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Name</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Primary</td><td data-align="center">Smoke Screen</td><td data-align="center">Throw a disc that emits smoke clouds ahead of it, impairing the vision for those inside it</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Tactical</td><td data-align="center">Active Camo</td><td data-align="center">Allows you to become temporarily invisible. Moving faster makes you the more visible, with certain actions like firing your gun or taking damage briefly making you visible</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Shadow Dive</td><td data-align="center">Negates fall damage from any height, whilst also deploying a smokescreen on impact</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Shroud</td><td data-align="center">Every time you enter a smoke cloud, you’ll become invisible, with it persisting for a few additional seconds</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Think of the Assassin Shell as the perfect backline disrupter. Utilise your Active Camo and stalk your enemies until you see the perfect time to strike. It looks like it’ll be the perfect flanking Shell, especially in a coordinated team.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-recon-shell-abilities-in-marathon">All Recon Shell Abilities In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Intel is key. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Recon Shell is perfect for those who prefer to assess things from afar, with abilities largely focusing on information gathering and hunting down enemies.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-outlines-plans-to-counter-cheaters-in-marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-outlines-plans-to-counter-cheaters-in-marathon/">Bungie Outlines Plans To Counter Cheaters In Marathon</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The abilities for the Recon Shell are:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Type</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Name</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Primary</td><td data-align="center">Echo Pulse</td><td data-align="center">Sonar Pulse that reveals nearby enemy locations, including invisible ones</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Tactical</td><td data-align="center">Tracker Drone</td><td data-align="center">A spider-like drone that chases enemies and explodes, dealing small amounts of fire damage whilst overheating their Shells, resulting in massively limited movement</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Awareness</td><td data-align="center">You’ll be alerted once an enemy player pings you, and finishing an enemy player will ping their teammates</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Stalker Protocol</td><td data-align="center">Once an enemy’s shield has been broken, a trail of footprints will be left behind them for you to stalk</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Nothing is getting by a Recon Shell, and they seem to be the perfect foil to the Assassin. If you’re looking to set up an ambush, use the Echo Pulse to find enemies and send out your Tracker Drone to blow them up and lock them in place. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-vandal-shell-abilities-in-marathon">All Vandal Shell Abilities In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Quick on your feet. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>By far the most dextrous of the line-up, the Vandal shell has abilities that revolve around improved mobility.</strong></p>



<p>The abilities for the Vandal Shell are:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Type</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Name</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Primary</td><td data-align="center">Amplify</td><td data-align="center">Temporarily gain increased movement speed, improved weapon handling, and reduced heat generation from abilities</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Tactical</td><td data-align="center">Disruptor</td><td data-align="center">Energy projectile that deals damage and knocks back enemies. Charge it up to increase the radius and damage</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Microjets</td><td data-align="center">Double jump that generates extra heat</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Power Slide</td><td data-align="center">Extended slide that generates extra heat</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>If you like to be quick on your toes, then Vandal is the shell for you. Although you’ll have to manage your heat build-up, the chaos you can cause with the rapid movements and Disruptor blast is hard to ignore.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-thief-shell-abilities-in-marathon">All Thief Shell Abilities In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fill your pockets. Image by Bungie. </figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Self-described as the ‘loot goblin’ by Bungie, the Thief Shell excels at finding the best gear that Marathon has to offer.</strong></p>



<p>The abilities for the Thief Shell are: </p>







<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Type</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Name</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Primary</td><td data-align="center">Pickpocket Drone</td><td data-align="center">Manually controlled flying drone that uses a whip to steal loot from enemy players, as well as the surroundings</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Tactical</td><td data-align="center">Grapple</td><td data-align="center">Dart that reels you towards it, wherever you fire it</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">X-Ray Visor</td><td data-align="center">See loot containers through walls, as well as enemies within line-of-sight</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center"><strong><em>Unknown</em></strong></td><td data-align="center">The name for the ability currently remains unknown, but the Thief will gain benefits based on how full their backpack is</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The Thief is easily the best looter in Marathon, though it can also double slightly as a Recon player if the Drone is used correctly. Scout out your surroundings, find where the best gear is, and buff yourself once it’s all safe in your backpack.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-triage-shell-abilities-in-marathon">All Triage Shell Abilities In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Medic! Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Every team needs a medic, and the Triage Shell is just that, offering multiple ways to support your team whilst holding down the front line.</strong></p>



<p>The abilities for the Triage Shell are:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Type</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Name</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Primary</td><td data-align="center">Capacitive Gauntlets</td><td data-align="center">Shocking tendrils that zap enemies and revive teammates from afar</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Tactical</td><td data-align="center">Med-Drone</td><td data-align="center">Airborne drone that hovers near allies to provide health and shields</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Battery Overcharge</td><td data-align="center">Temporarily gain improved weapon performance whilst battery weapons are able to EMP enemies when their shields are broken</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Shareware</td><td data-align="center">Teammates with Med-Drones healing them also gain the benefits from your consumables</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>You’d be remiss to go on a run without a Triage in your team, as the numerous buffs and support they offer are second to none. Not only can they share their consumables with you, thanks to the Med-Drone, but on the off chance you go down, they can get you back into the fight quicker than anybody.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rook-frame-abilities-in-marathon">All Rook Frame Abilities In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>On your lonesome. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Rook is a unique class in Marathon, as it doesn’t offer a range of abilities like the Shells do; instead, it’s more focused on scavenging ongoing matches. </strong></p>



<p>The Rook Frame puts some limitations on the matchmaking when it’s selected. Firstly, you can’t play as part of a team when choosing Rook, and secondly, you’ll be placed into ongoing matches, though other players won’t be notified of your arrival.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marathon-on-xbox-game-pass/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marathon-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Marathon On Xbox Game Pass?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>As if that wasn’t bleak enough, it seems that you’ll only have access to one ability, which masks your presence from the UESC enemies. You will have access to a starting kit, at least, so you’ll be able to defend yourself, but if you’re choosing Rook, your priority will be to scavenge some gear and extract quickly.</p>

			<p><strong>Amazon</strong>'s divestment from gaming investments continues today with the news that the company has canceled its publishing deal with <strong>Maverick Games</strong>. This decision follows the shutdown of Amazon's MMO divisions that were working on <strong>New World</strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong> game</a>, as well as <a href="https://wccftech.com/king-of-meat-shut-down-april-2026-amazon-glowmade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this week's shutdown of <strong>King of Meat</strong></a> (and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-boss-christoph-hartmann-departs-amidst-mass-16000-layoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent departure of division chief <strong>Christoph Hartmann</strong></a>). Essentially, Amazon's current gaming investments are just the upcoming <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> games from <strong>Crystal Dynamics</strong> and the cloud-based platform <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-luna-re-launch-later-this-year-prime-subs-library-cloud-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luna</a></strong>.</p>



<p>A spokesperson <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/amazon-abandons-its-open-world-driving" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told The Game Business</a>:</p>



<p><em>As part of our strategic evolution to focus on projects that leverage Amazon’s unique strengths and scale, including the recent re-launch of Luna and our Tomb Raider franchise partnership with Crystal Dynamics, we have decided to release Maverick Games from their publishing agreement with Amazon Game Studios.</em></p>



<p><em>We have tremendous respect for the Maverick Games team and the compelling narrative-led driving experience they’re creating. This decision allows Maverick Games the flexibility to find a publishing partner whose strategic priorities are better aligned with bringing their game to market. We’re proud of what we accomplished together during our partnership and wish them every success in the future.</em></p>



<p>Maverick Games <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-former-developers-announce-new-aaa-studio-maverick-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was founded in early 2023 by former Forza Horizon developers</a></strong>. The studio is still working on an open world driving game targeting a release on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series S and X. Today, they released a statement to thank Amazon for the opportunity and to <strong>reassure fans that they're committed to the project and are currently in talks with other partners to replace Amazon in the publishing role</strong>.</p>

            <p>I'd be lying if I said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a> doesn't look (and sound) like one the coolest triple-A games coming out this year. With its post-delay <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/merry-christmas-james-bond-game-007-first-light-has-been-delayed">27th May release date</a> not far away now, marketing and developer chatter are ramping up, and now we've learned about the explicit influences that were added to all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman">Hitman</a> DNA we've able to discern in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s latest.</p>
<p>On 23th February, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-aims-to-channel-batman-arkham-freeflow-combat-with-uncharted-spectacle/1100-6538356/">GameSpot</a> shared juicy bits from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/007firstlight">Game Informer</a>'s recent interview with gameplay director Andreas Krogh, who admits the team looked at triple-A games "on the same scale" for inspiration. After all, even with a reboot, there's set of expectations around what a James Bond game should be, and IO's own style shouldn't get in the way of that if you ask me.</p>
<p>We already know many stealth and immersive sim elements from the recent Hitman trilogy, as well as spectacular and layered level design, have made their way into 007: First Light, but it's good to know IO looked at modern action-adventure classics for the more explosive sequences: "I think you see the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Arkham games</a>, you see those games in it. You also see some modern takes on destructibility in the environment that are not necessarily from the Arkham games, but newer takes like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/uncharted">Uncharted</a>. We have a deeper system than that because we want to do more of it, and from shooting, you see references that are also from modern games," Krogh explained.</p>
<p>In any case, while some gameplay scenes will railroad players into big set pieces that would make renowned Hollywood action directors smile, the studio hasn't sacrificed the freedom of "choice" it's known for in most scenarios: "We want to set the player up to choose for himself. What kind of player are you? What kind of playstyle do you prefer? Play that way."</p><p>It won't be long before we check for ourselves if everything has come together beautifully, but with a mix of old and new, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-trailer-unveils-lenny-kravitzs-villainous-side">Lenny Kravitz on board as the villain</a>, it seems like IO's take on the property won't be retreading much old ground.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><span>This morning, French publisher&nbsp;<strong>NACON</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nacon-CP-25.02.2026-English-Diffusion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed for insolvency</a>, following a major issue with its majority shareholder, </span><strong><span>Bigben Interac</span>tive</strong>. On November 24, 2025, Bigben announced <strong>it had secured a refinancing agreement with a banking pool of leading French banks for €43 million</strong>, repayable over 6 years. This would have partially refinanced prior outstanding bonds, leaving a non-refinanced residual balance of approximately €16.1 million to be repaid separately on the maturity date. </p>



<p>However, on February 13, 2026, just four business days before the maturity date, t<strong>he banking pool informed Bigben that it was refusing to honor the drawdown notice sent in connection with the refinancing</strong>, claiming it could invoke a breach by Bigben for an obligation to provide information stipulated in the credit contract. <strong>Bigben strongly disputed this legal analysis and reserved all its rights</strong>. The refusal was described as both unexpected and late, leaving Bigben (and, therefore, Nacon) with almost no time to find an alternative.</p>



<p>Unable to proceed with the partial repayment of the aforementioned €43 million, last week Bigben announced <strong>the temporary suspension of trading</strong> in its shares on Euronext Paris and its bonds on Euronext Access Paris. NACON, as a subsidiary, had its own shares suspended simultaneously.</p>



<p>Today, the two companies filed different court procedures reflecting their different situations. Bigben filed for an amicable conciliation procedure, stressing it would have no impact on operations, employees, or customers. Bigben also noted that its principal asset is its majority stake in NACON, <strong>in which it holds 56.72% of the share capital and 65.79% of the voting rights</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>NACON's situation appears to be more severe</strong>, though. Unable to meet its own liabilities as a direct consequence of the parent company's crisis, it filed for full judicial reorganisation proceedings. This freezes existing liabilities for an observation period of up to 18 months while the company attempts to develop a continuation plan. Essentially, NACON has formally acknowledged that it cannot meet its current liabilities. The procedure gives it court protection while it attempts to restructure, but the outcome is, at this point, genuinely uncertain. If no viable continuation plan emerges within the observation period, <strong>liquidation becomes a very real possibility</strong>.</p>



<p>It's all a bit surreal for fans of NACON's games, even more so because the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/nacon-connect-returns-next-week-edge-of-memories-the-mound-cthulhu-cosmic-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has just announced</a> this Monday that <strong>a new NACON Connect Showcase will go live on March 4, 2026</strong>, providing updated news and footage on upcoming titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/edge-of-memories-gamescom-hands-on-preview-not-visions-of-mana-but-in-a-good-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Edge of Memories</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mound-omen-of-cthulhu-gameplay-nacon-ace-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-february-2026-edition-jumping-into-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</a></strong>.</p>



<p>As a reminder, NACON currently owns the following 16 AA development studios that altogether employ more than a thousand developers:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nacon Studio Milan</li>



<li>Big Ant Studios</li>

<h2>Something from Nothing</h2><p><em>Nested Lands</em> is a survival colony sim akin to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/medieval-dynasty" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6beadf03-42e1-4d12-b5d9-3dc7b07cf7d5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Medieval Dynasty</em></a>. The game is essentially split into two parts: exploring the land and fighting bandits, and working to build a village of wandering survivors from nothing.</p><p>You won't have much of anything in the opening hours of the game; at best, you can manage to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-crafting-guide-how-to-make-items" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3e542191-86b3-41a2-9d3c-93c58871227b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">craft</a> a stone axe and a stone pickaxe. These two tools will allow you to gather additional wood and stone, both of which can be used to place your first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-building-guide-village-structures" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="67d03475-9a7a-44ab-8425-d35a404fd97f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">buildings</a> in the village.</p><blockquote><p>There's no easy way to farm, and hunting opportunities are very limited.</p></blockquote><p>As a survival game, you'll need to make sure you get enough food, water, and sleep to keep going; all of the genre staples are here. Water is easy enough to get — your village has a pond nearby — but food is another story. There's no easy way to farm in the early game, and hunting opportunities are very limited.</p><p>It doesn't take long before you realize you'll run out of supplies. That leaves you with only one option remaining: explore the island and hope that you can find something useful.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Battling Bandits</h2><p>There are nearly two dozen marked points of interest on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-map-guide-quest-item-locations" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6a535f2e-b1b1-4b8f-950d-1256eed05c80" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the first island map</a> (and quite a few more unmarked locations). Virtually all of these are occupied by at least two or three bandits. (For a plague-covered hellscape, there sure are a lot of people running around.)</p><p>In the early game, your only option is melee combat. You might get lucky by finding a weapon in a container, but odds are you'll only have a makeshift stone knife to fend off enemies. Fortunately, you can almost always grab better (albeit broken) weapons off the corpse of any bandit you kill.</p><p>Most of the static points of interest do not respawn loot; once you've cleared them out, all of those supplies are gone for good. However, random events pop up as you move around the map, and these give you new opportunities to collect more <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-crafting-materials-guide-resource-locations" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="aa76f2fe-9b22-424e-8e09-5c8288868a90" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">crafting materials</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-food-guide-farming-and-hunting" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f93e66ec-fec5-46b7-8f83-3bf6dcf75376" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">food</a>.</p><p>These same random events have a good chance of spawning a caged <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-villager-guide-guards-and-workers" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fdda7fea-49da-4435-a2fa-41c34de01cdf" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">villager</a>. Kill the bandits holding them, and you can invite them to your settlement as long as you have an unoccupied house available. Repeat this process a few more times, and you'll have a bustling community before you know it.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2>Collecting Resources and Building a Village</h2><p>The survival half of the gameplay in <em>Nested Lands</em> is serviceable enough, but the village management portion of gameplay is pretty unforgiving. In fact, I'd say that the village management system has some serious problems that must be corrected sooner rather than later.</p><p>I've played many survival colony sim games. Typically, the premise of this genre is to manage the logistical challenges of meeting your villagers' needs for food, water, shelter, and so on. This is balanced by the villagers doing work and acting as a force multiplier for your own abilities to gather and craft items.</p><p>Unfortunately, the villagers in <em>Nested Lands</em> aren't very competent. You can have a maximum of 15 villagers; at one point, I had 3 Farmers, 3 Trappers, and a Cook. Despite this, their combined efforts were never enough to produce an adequate food supply for the village.</p><blockquote><p>I've occasionally encountered scenarios in similar games where I'd grow too fast and have some production problems, but Nested Lands was the first one where I could not find a way to make running a village profitable.</p></blockquote><p>Guards are similarly useless. I had 3 Guards at one point, and all of them died during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-raid-defense-guide-protect-village" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ffb29130-7789-483e-a8d7-a87f09347e25" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a raid</a> despite being equipped with some midrange armor and weaponry. This happened multiple times, forcing me to go out and find more captured people to replace them.</p><p>Eventually, I concluded that there's no way for my village to feed itself or defend itself unless I took the time to gather food every couple of days and kill enemies during every raid. Trees and rocks do not respawn on the first island, so I had to go further and further afield for crafting materials as I went on.</p><p>I also had a serious problem with equipping my villagers with clothes and armor. There's no way to grow Cotton, so I had to spend hours looting every point of interest I could to get enough supplies to equip everyone. It was far too much work to get a 10% happiness boost and avoid a -10% penalty.</p><p>My solution was to reduce my village population to the lowest practical number. I've occasionally encountered scenarios in similar games where I'd grow too fast and have some production problems, but <em>Nested Lands</em> was the first one where I could not find a way to make running a village profitable.</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Nested Lands</em> Early Access Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>I spent around 86 hours playing <em>Nested Lands</em>. I reached the end of the Early Access build's story, fully upgrading my village and spending the better part of a day trying (and failing) to build a thriving community. I'm all for challenging games, but it got increasingly frustrating as time went on.</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/aska" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dab330ac-4284-4049-a45e-f654eba2a7d9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Aska</em></a> is a similar game that I had to restart several times after my village failed to thrive; while it was difficult, it felt like I could crack the code and figure out how to survive. I don't feel the same about <em>Nested Lands' </em>Early Access launch version; it appears impossible to run a self-sustaining village.</p><p><em>Nested Lands</em> doesn't feel completely unsalvageable; the game design has good bones, and the setting and story are both intriguing. I think it can develop into a solid entry in the survival colony sim genre once some of the rougher edges have been polished off.</p><p>As it stands today, though, <em>Nested Lands</em> feels far too grindy and frustrating. Instead of feeling challenging, it's more like a grindy mess with some serious flaws in its game design. A village simulator where the village can't ever seem to provide for itself is akin to the world's worst babysitting job.</p><p><em>Nested Lands</em> is worth checking out if you're interested in experimenting with a quirky, deceptively difficult survival colony sim. If you're not a hardcore fan of this genre, though, it's better to wait for some balance updates and some major fixes to the fundamental flaws of this game's design.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Nested Lands</strong></em> was previewed over approximately 86 hours of gameplay on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2553040/Nested_Lands/" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> with a key provided by the publisher. All screenshots were taken during the preview process.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p><span>I’ve been an avid anime watcher for longer than I’d care to publicly admit. And yet, even with those dozen-plus years of seasonal anime consumption under my belt, I don’t think I’ve seen a stronger seasonal line-up than the current winter 2026 cour. You’ve got your obvious bangers, such as</span><i><span> Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Jujutsu Kaisen</span></i><span>, but there are at least twenty weekly releases currently airing that are worth watching. </span><i><span>Hell’s Paradise</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Fate/Strange Fake</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Oshi no Ko</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Sentenced to Be a Hero</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>My Hero Academia: Vigilantes</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Trigun Stargaze</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Golden Kamuy</span></i><span>– I could go on, and that’s without including the stuff that just finished airing, such as </span><i><span>Spy x Family</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>To Your Eternity</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Now, I’m not complaining, but the dedicated anime fans among you may have noticed an issue with the majority of the shows I just spent the better part of a paragraph listing: they’re almost exclusively returning series. That’s par for the course as far as the industry is concerned, as the manga series they’re adapted from have a tendency to go on for hundreds if not thousands of chapters. My worry here is that the overabundance of returning series this season might be overwhelming for folks who have other hobbies or social lives, which doesn’t exactly leave much room for trying out something new. That’s why this impassioned plea disguised as an article exists, because I don’t want any of you to miss out on </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span> (and, more importantly, because I need it to be renewed for a second season).</span></p>

  <p><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span>, known as </span><i><span>Journal with Witch</span></i><span> in English, is referred to as a “josei” manga in Japan. That quite literally translates to “women’s comic” or “lady comic,” but, in much the same way that the “shōnen” manga tag (meaning “boy comic”) can come across as a little reductive sometimes, I can’t help but feel like it’s doing </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span> a disservice. At a glance, maybe the genre tag does fit, considering it features two female protagonists and one of its primary themes is the exploration of motherhood. However, as far as I’m concerned, that would be akin to referring to </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> as just a “sports” show, because </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span> should appeal to everyone. Perhaps this mislabelling stems from the topics explored beyond its introductory episode, although, saying that, I’m getting slightly ahead of myself here.</span></p> <p><span>Ironically, in giving you the narrative setup, I’ll have to be reductive myself for a moment, so as not to spoil things for you. </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki </span></i><span>opens with the death of Makio Kōdai’s sister and brother-in-law. Makio’s apathetic reaction to the news is immediately contradicted by her vehement, borderline forceful request to take in her orphaned fifteen-year-old niece, Asa. While this might seem like the framework of a story that primarily focuses on grief, which it still partially is, it’s actually an excuse to tell a story about something more obscure: conflicting personalities.</span></p>

 <p><span>Makio is reserved, to put it lightly. She’s a borderline shut-in who forces herself to interact with people only when necessary. Asa is sociable, bright, inquisitive, and very, very talkative. That last trait promptly becomes a point of contention between the two, as Makio refuses to tell Asa why she detests her deceased sister. Without spoiling too much, even though I believe this should be apparent from the very first episode, it’s immediately clear that Makio is on the spectrum. The fanbase believes she’s autistic, but, to me, she specifically presents as AuDHD; the informally named combination of someone with both ADHD and autism.</span></p>

 <p><span>American media has a terrible history of portraying those with autism or ADHD incorrectly at best, or offensively at worst. </span><i><span>The Big Bang Theory</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Rain Man</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>The Good Doctor</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Music</span></i><span>: all of these portray neurodivergent people as savants, unfeeling robots, or over-exaggerated stereotypes. Makio is none of these things. She’s a refreshing, honestly portrayed mess. She can hold a conversation and does her best </span><a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/behaviour/masking"><span>to mask</span></a><span>, but she just prefers being alone. She can look after herself and even Asa, but sometimes gets hyper-focused on tasks for too long. She’s a brilliant, well-regarded writer, but it’s not a superpower; it’s a skill she’s learned and cultivated, and still a craft she struggles to perfect. Makio is easily one of the best examples of a neurodivergent character I’ve ever seen, and part of why this portrayal succeeds is the narrative excuse </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span> uses to explore her character: Asa.</span></p> <p><span>In the same way that Makio feels like a true portrayal of someone on the spectrum, Asa is written as a faithful, honest representation of a neurotypical high school student. She’s not some honor student or an underachiever, and she’s not the most popular kid in school or a friendless delinquent either. Asa is an ordinary young girl with interests and desires, whose life has been upended by an unprecedented loss. She feels real. She feels authentic in a way that no other teenager in modern media has in recent memory, reminding me of my nieces and my friends’ kids. Asa’s efforts to understand Makio, and vice versa, wouldn’t work if these characters weren’t written with care and in such great detail. It also definitely helps that Miyuki Sawashiro and Fuko Mori, Makio and Asa’s respective voice actors, are giving the best performances this side of the winter 2026 anime schedule (a statement I don’t make lightly, considering the talent they’re up against).</span></p>

 <p><span>And all of this is simply what I can tell you without spoiling things. I could go into great detail about </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki’s</span></i><span> incredible portrayal of men’s mental health, its deft deconstruction of motherhood, its gentle, honest depiction of asexuality, and just how goddamn cool Shingo Kasamachi is. Honestly, calling this a josei anime feels extra ridiculous whenever the story chooses to focus on Shingo, because that is the man I’m visualizing becoming when I look at myself in the mirror.</span></p> <p><span>Trust me when I say I get it; I get why </span><i><span>Frieren </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> Jujutsu Kaisen</span></i><span> are at the top of the anime charts every week. They’re brilliant, and I’m just as excited as everyone else when Thursday and Friday roll around. I’m just always slightly more excited for Sunday at the moment, which is why I hope I’ve done a decent job of convincing you to fit </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span> day into your already packed anime schedule, because I will never forgive you all if the best anime of winter 2026 ends on an unrenewed cliffhanger.</span></p>

<p>ARC Raiders players have started spotting UFOs in the sky after the latest Shrouded Sky update. </p>



<p>The latest Shrouded Sky update for ARC Raiders went live yesterday, introducing a new map condition, ARC enemies, buffs &amp; nerfs, and much more. However, some items were not mentioned in the latest patch notes, and fans of extraterrestrial entities would love the new addition. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-players-spot-ufos-flying-in-the-sky">ARC Raiders Players Spot UFOs Flying in the Sky</h2>



<p>A new post on the r/ArcRaiders <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdgkdw/what_in_tarnation_is_that/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> discusses the appearance of UFOs in the game. The post shows a video of a player maneuvering through a building while the Hurricane map condition is on. There’s suddenly a loud noise of something flying in the sky, and when they look up, there are two clusters of blue lights that are floating past him, with what looks like a massive ship that is hidden by the cloud cover. </p>



<p>There is ongoing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rea7g9/new_giant_ufo_arc_boss_but_more_zoomed_and_slowmo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">speculation</a> that Embark Studios might be hinting at a new giant enemy for ARC Raiders, possibly a boss, through the appearance of UFOs. Some players have attempted to reach the highest points on the map to get a better view of this flying object, but they haven’t had any success. Meanwhile, others continue to speculate about what all this could mean.</p>



<p>In other news, Embark Studios has made a major change to ARC Raiders Feats, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-embark-studios-pvp-feats-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removing PvP-focused feats</a> and pushing closer to a PvE vibe. Additionally, here’s a comprehensive guide on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-weather-monitor-system-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weather Monitor System Project</a>, explaining the requirements and rewards. </p>

            <p>Xbox's new leadership double-act Asha Sharma (CEO Microsoft Gaming) and Matt Booty (chief content officer Xbox) have stressed the importance of new Xbox gaming hardware to their vision going forward.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty">Windows Central</a>, Sharma said: "I am committed to 'returning to Xbox', and that starts with console, that starts with hardware. You will hear more about that soon - we'll have some announcements coming up. You will see us collectively investing here.</p>
<p>"We also know that there are a lot of players who aren't on console or our hardware, and I want to deliver great games to them too. I need to learn more about what that can look like, what decisions were made, what we need to do going forward, and I want a little bit of time and space to do that."</p>
<p>Matt Booty added: "Our studio system is fully built around being first-party. We're not built to just be a publisher. It is core to our partnership with the Microsoft platform, being involved in early hardware decisions - all the work we've done to get games like Gears of War running great on new devices like the Xbox Ally, and so on. It is embedded within our structure, we're not backing away from that. We're committed to being a first-party games publisher in partnership with our first-party platform team."</p><p>Their comments come after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/future-of-xbox-vague-contradictory-phil-spencer-sarah-bond-asha-sharma-matt-booty">a wave of change unsettled the Xbox business and brand at the weekend</a>, with long-time Xbox figurehead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> retiring from Microsoft after nearly 40 years, and Sarah Bond, the former president of Xbox - presumed to be Spencer's replacement-in-waiting - suddenly departing as well.</p>
<blockquote><em>"This team has brought it back before, and I'm here to help us do it again" - Asha Sharma</em></blockquote>
<p>Into the leadership void stepped Asha Sharma, a relative unknown to the gaming community, brought over from Microsoft's CoreAI division, and someone who boasts no gaming experience or apparent gaming passion of her own. Matt Booty is a much more known quantity, having led <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> since 2018, and Microsoft's first-party gaming output since 2023.</p>
<p>The suspicion surrounding Sharma's appointment is Microsoft is sunsetting Xbox and reorganising the company around AI - something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-likening-new-xbox-heads-job-to-a-palliative-care-doctor-original-co-creator-doesnt-actually-think-xbox-is-dead">Seamus Blackley, the original co-creator of Xbox, was very vocal about</a>. But there are contrasting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-insider-report-paints-different-picture-of-spencer-retirement-and-bond-departure">reports that claim Microsoft genuinely wants to reset the Xbox business</a> and turn it around. This "return of Xbox" is something Sharma talked about in her opening memo to staff, and it's something she elaborated on in the Windows Central interview.</p><p>Sharma said: "For me, the spirit of 'return to Xbox' is about returning to the spirit that the team was founded on. It's that spirit of surprise, it's the spirit of building something nobody else was willing to try - I've heard 'renegade', 'rebellion', and 'fun' used. That's what I was thinking about when I wrote that."</p>
<p>Reports have suggested that Sarah Bond was ousted because of the 'Xbox Anywhere' initiative, largely attributed to her, which hasn't really worked out. Regardless, it's an initiative Sharma will inherit, alongside things such as Game Pass and publishing on PlayStation that have become increasingly central to the Xbox division's core. What will Sharma do with them?</p>
<p>"Right now, I need to learn, candidly, about the 'why' of these decisions, what we were optimising for and what the data says about the Xbox strategy today. That's the honest answer," she said. "I'm looking at lifetime value, not just what happened in a previous moment, or in short term efficiencies and things like that. The plan's the plan until it's not the plan."</p>
<p>Sharma also underlined <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-new-head-of-gaming-has-no-tolerance-for-bad-ai-following-concerns-about-the-proliferation-of-ai-slop-and-sharmas-tech-background">her previously stated gen-AI stance</a> by restating that there are opportunities there but she won't allow this to devolve into okaying "slop". "I will not flood our ecosystem with slop," she said. "We won't have careless output, we won't have derivative work. I deeply believe in the words that I shared previously there."</p><p>Matt Booty had an additional remark to make on this, stating: "We've got no pressure from Microsoft, there are no directives on AI coming down. Our teams are free to use any technologies that might be beneficial, whether it's helping write code or check for bugs - things more in the production pipeline. At the end of the day as Asha said, we're committed to art made by people. Technology is only in support of that."</p>
<p>In closing, Sharma said she would try to "honour and uphold" the culture that Xbox Phil Spencer instilled - "a remarkable human and a remarkable leader" - when he took over Xbox in 2014. "We know that the business has gone through some challenges," she said. "I'm going to use my expertise and the leaders that have the deep gaming depth around the table to help us grow the business, and make sure that we have an incredible next 25 years.</p>
<p>"I will listen, I will learn, I will communicate what we're seeing, and what we're doing. I think from here, the work is proof over promise. Matt and I are in it, every hour of every day of every night; I am fully in this thing. This team has brought it back before, and I'm here to help us do it again."</p>

            <p>Amazon have released UK studio Maverick Games from a deal to publish the story-led open-world driving game the latter have been working on for a number of years. The split leaves Maverick, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forza-horizon-veterans-found-new-studio-focused-on-open-world-premium-games">founded in 2022</a> by ex-Playground Games devs including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> creative director Mike Brown, looking for a new partner. Though, they say they're already in "active dialogue" with such folks.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The nixing of Amazon and Maverick's deal was first reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/amazon-abandons-its-open-world-driving">The Game Business</a>, who cite an Amazon spokesperson as having confirmed this decision's been made as the company narrow their focus to Tomb Raider and their Luna streaming service. Said narrowing has already seen Amazon's games arm <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-world-wont-be-getting-any-more-new-additions-following-mass-layoffs-at-amazon">lay off a bunch of staff</a> while moving to close down the likes of MMO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-world">New World</a> and platformer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-cancels-failed-battle-royale-attempt-king-of-meat-less-than-6-months-after-launch">King of Meat</a>.</p>
<p>"We have tremendous respect for the Maverick Games team and the compelling narrative-led driving experience they’re creating," the Amazon spokesperson told The Game Business. "This decision allows Maverick Games the flexibility to find a publishing partner whose strategic priorities are better aligned with bringing their game to market. We’re proud of what we accomplished together during our partnership and wish them every success in the future."</p>
<p>Maverick co-founder Brown and studio head Harinder Sangha told TGB that work on the game "continues to progress as strongly as planned" and that they're "in active dialogue with partners who share our long-term ambition" for it. They also indicated they're hoping to share more info later this year.</p><p>From that, it at least seems like Maverick are on their way to finding the new publisher they need, rather than having been left scrambling by an unexpectly sudden pulling of support. Their as of writing unnamed debut driving game sounds like it could be cool, with Brown having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-forza-horizon-devs-and-skins-co-creator-want-you-to-fall-in-love-with-the-characters-in-their-story-led-open-world-driving-game">spoken in 2024</a> about how its story-driven nature is an effort to help it stand out from the crowd in a genre packed with wheely good wheelers. Maverick have drafted in Jamie Brittain, co-creator of British teen drama Skins, as lead writer. The goal's to create characters who're "flawed and actually a little bit weird - just like the rest of us" to drive a natural "human connection" of the sort you don't tend to get with the sorts of one-dimensional pedal-pushers you get in many racing games.</p>
<p>It remains a very intriguing idea in my eyes, even if story-heavy racing games have historically been a famously mixed bag - for every Need For Speed: Most Wanted or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/driver-san-francisco">Driver: San Francisco</a>, there's a nothingy narrative like Need For Speed: The Run or a cliche-filled cringe-fest like last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jdm-japanese-drift-master-review">JDM: Japanese Drift Master</a>.</p>
