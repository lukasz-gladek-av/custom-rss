            <p>
Forthcoming life sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inzoi">InZoi</a> - the plucky (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inzois-system-specs-make-me-want-to-see-this-handsome-sims-killer-running-on-a-pocket-calculator">genAI-ridden</a>) David to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s Goliath - will cost $40 at its early access launch, the developers have announced. What's more, "all updates and DLCs will be provided for free" until the game hits 1.0, according to translated commentary from game director Hyungjun Kim. 
</p>
<p>
This is being styled as a gift unto the gamers, and another way of tempting them from the clutches of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>, whose DLC packs commonly sell for full-game prices. The other way of looking at it is that of course early access "updates and DLC" should be free. The point of early access is that you're paying for an unfinished game with the expectation that it'll eventually be worth the money. Also, what's the difference between an update and a DLC? My my, Inzoi, what a can of worms you have opened.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The news arrives care of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/QkXfP9rwrm8">a global showcase</a> last night, which also breaks down the new life sim's early access development - it's launching on 28th March. We can expect four major updates this year, together with new outfits and furniture every three months. Here's an approximate rundown. 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Update 1, May</strong>
</p>
<p>
Mod kit (Maya, Blender)
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Update 2, August</strong>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Swimming &amp; pools
</p>
<p>
More resources for edit city
</p>
<p>

<p>
<strong>Update 4, December</strong>
</p>
<p>
Memory system
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Create a Zoi improvements
</p>
<p>
Mod updates
</p>
<p>
New outfits
</p>
<p>
Indoor temperature
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In terms of competing with The Sims, the key addition is probably that mod kit in May. InZoi will need a healthy community of tinkerers if it's to usurp the EA colossus (or perhaps just prosper alongside it - why do I insist on pitting them against each other? Why am I like this?)</p>
<p>I'm also quite interested in the ability to play a ghost - there are 16 ways a character can die in Inzoi, and if you have bad karma when you pop your clogs you'll linger on as a spectre, thwarting the birth of new Zois by, as far as I can tell, contributing to the neighbourhood population cap.
</p>
<p>
Returning to the point about the unfairness of charging for early access DLC - obviously, game development isn't that cut and dried. Perhaps a developer runs into unexpected costs that require them to slap a price tag on an early access update. Perhaps they decide they want to add a player-requested feature they haven't scoped for. Perhaps they really needed to charge more for the base early access game but didn't feel they could get away with it.</p>
<p>Still, I don't like the dilution of the early access concept here. In general, it feels increasingly like developers and publishers view early access as simply a variant of the live service game, with more purchaseables being added over time.

<p>Krafton is publishing Inzoi and feels strongly about the game’s attempt at the life-sim genre. This isn’t a case of art imitating life as Inzoi almost looks like life itself, and its system requirements on PC might make your eyes water.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-simulator-inzoi-early-access-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a> looks to follow in the steps of other life-sim hits such as The Sims, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, and Animal Crossing. It allows you to escape the rigors of everyday life to create the ultimate, perfect society in virtual form. Inzoi looks to incorporate all aspects of life and roll them into one streamlined experience.</p>



<p>Developer Inzoi Studio’s creation was birthed several years ago, and it’s nearly time to be born.</p>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-minimum-requirements-on-pc">Inzoi Minimum Requirements on PC</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Say “Inzoi”. Credit to Inzoi Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Inzoi minimum requirements let us play Inzoi—and that’s good enough for many. It sucks to miss out on a game for technical reasons, so at the very least we want to hit the minimum requirements.</p>



<p>Check out the complete list of minimum PC specs below, which is provided on the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2456740/view/518581441632667234?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Inzoi Minimum PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Inzoi Minimum Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 / 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 5 3600 / Intel i5 10400</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT (6G VRAM) / NVIDIA RTX 2060 (6G VRAM)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">12 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">Need 40 GB of Available Space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-medium-requirements-on-pc">Inzoi Medium Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>In between the minimum and recommended requirements are Medium settings. This is for those with better hardware than the bare minimum, but still falling short of optimal performance.</p>



<p>Here’s every Medium requirement for Inzoi. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Inzoi Medium PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Inzoi Medium Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 / 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D / Intel i7 11700</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Radeon RX 6600 (8G VRAM) / NVIDIA RTX 3060 (8G VRAM)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">Need 50 GB of Available Space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-recommended-requirements-on-pc-0">Inzoi Recommended Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>We’re moving up to the upper tiers of requirements now. The recommended PC specs are quite powerful compared to most, but if you can meet most (if not all) of these requirements, Inzoi will look very fine.</p>



<p>Check each of these values carefully.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Inzoi Recommended PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Inzoi Recommended Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 / 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D / Intel i7 12700K</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT (16G VRAM) / NVIDIA RTX 3070 (8G VRAM)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">Need 60 GB of Available Space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-high-requirements-on-pc">Inzoi High Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>The High requirements—otherwise known as the best specs—are reserved for mighty rigs and heavyweight computers comprised of thousands of dollars worth of parts. A lot of top-end gear is required to meet the High requirements.</p>



<p>However, this is how to enjoy peak Inzoi performance and bring the game to life.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Inzoi High PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Inzoi High Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 / 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D / Intel i7 14700K</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX (24G VRAM) / NVIDIA RTX 4080 (16G VRAM)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">32 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">Need 75 GB of Available Space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

Marvel video games, however, do not exist in the same universe, telling stories entirely separate and unrelated to each other. Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man games, for example, have nothing to do with Eidos-Montreal’s Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. Similarly, upcoming Marvel games such as Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, Marvel's Wolverine, and Marvel’s Blade, have no connective tissue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there was once an idea at Disney to create a Marvel Gaming Universe that would do for Marvel video games what the MCU went on to do for Marvel movies and TV shows. So what happened?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/_W6fCpdYs4Y?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Fourth Curtain podcast</a>, host Alexander Seropian and guest Alex Irvine recalled this MGU idea, which both worked on, and revealed why it fell by the wayside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seropian, perhaps best known as one of the founders of Halo and Destiny developer Bungie, went on to run Disney’s video game business before leaving in 2012. Irvine was the long-running writer of Marvel games, most recently working on the world-building, dialogue, and character backstories for smash hit Marvel Rivals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing his prior work on Marvel games, Irvine discussed the scrapped MGU.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When I first started working on Marvel games, there was this idea that they were going to create a Marvel gaming universe that was going to exist in the same way that the MCU did,” Irvine said. “It never really happened.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seropian then explained that the MGU was his “initiative,” but it never got funded by the higher-ups at Disney.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When I was at Disney, that was my initiative, ‘Hey, let’s tie these games together.’ It was pre-MCU,” Seropian said. “But it didn’t get funded.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Irvine, who had worked on the iconic Halo alternate reality game (ARG) I Love Bees while at Bungie, went into some detail on how this MGU would have worked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That was so frustrating because we came up with all these great ideas about how to do it,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I was coming out of ARGs at that point and thinking, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool if we had some ARG aspects?’ There would be a place where players could go that all the games touched, and we could move them back and forth from game to game. We could link in comics, we could loop in anything, we could do original stuff. And then, as Alex said, it didn’t get funded. So we made a bunch of games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But why did the MGU fail to get the internal buy-in to move forward? Irvine suggested the idea became so complex it ended up putting some people at Disney off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Even back then, we were trying to figure out, ‘If there’s going to be this MGU, how is it different from the comics? How is it different from the movies? How are we going to decide if it stays consistent?’ And I think some of those questions got complex enough that there were people at Disney who didn’t really want to deal with them,” Irvine explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fun to imagine what might have been had the MGU idea got the funding it needed to become a reality. Perhaps if it had, Insomniac’s Spider-Man games would have existed in the same universe as Square Enix’s ill-fated Marvel's Avengers and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, with characters from each game making cameo appearances across the titles or the stories all building towards some epic Endgame-style event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking ahead, there are questions over Insomniac's Marvel's Wolverine game. Will it be set within the same universe as Marvel's Spider-Man? Could Spider-Man or any other character from those games end up making a cameo in Wolverine in some way?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, the MGU goes down as yet another scrapped video game idea. Although, perhaps in another universe somewhere, it is a reality…</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>What's the pettiest reason you began to distance yourself from an old friend? I once casually suggested to a mate that I found toast more filling than bread, which prompted them to bang on for far too long about how I was actually wrong, since the act of toasting necessarily diminishes the structure of bread or somesuch. I'm not sure whether that's true and I don't care. I was speaking my truth about toast and you undermined it. Jog on, toast denier.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s new Ghoul Within update is 18.9 GB, which may well conclusively prove that searing ghoulification actually ends up with the victim weighing more than they did previously. I wish I'd known this at the time of my yeasty bust-up, because I'd have probably tried to make the same argument about toast. We might have stayed mates then. Maybe we could have played Fallout 76 together? Why, that's the subject of this very <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151340/Fallout_76/">Steam blog</a>! Incredible.</p>

<p>Your journey to "Ghoulification" begins with a new questline named "Leap Of Faith" in the Savage Divide. Do that, and you'll be able to transform into a Ghoul, complete with 30 new perks and two new abilities. Glow increases your maximum health depending on how radiated you are, and Feral confers combat buffs and penalties depending on how many drugs you've eaten.</p>
<p>Being a Ghoul will negatively affect your interactions with factions like the Brotherhood Of Steel and lock you out of certain questlines. If you're starting to feel isolated, you can either don a disguise or reverse your ghoul-hood altogether. This is permanent, though. If you want to become a ghoul once again, you'll need to cough up 1000 atoms - about £8/$10.</p>
<p>Alongside a new Level 50 Character Boost and a new event starting April 29th - "The Big Bloom" - the patch notes also detail a host of balancing tweaks. I'm particularly fond of the helpful mundanity in "adjusted some Perk names for better alphabetical sorting". The game's also 75% off on Steam right now, in case you aren't saving for the rumoured imminent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">Oblivion remake</a>. It's… actually only slightly more expensive than that ghoul reversal charge. Love to be a fan of videogames in 2025. Probably just play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-still-on-track-for-a-2025-release">Skyblivion</a>, innit. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fallout 76’s Ghoul Within update is live and allows players to transform into a ghoul.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-transform-into-a-ghoul-in-fallout-76">How to Transform into a Ghoul in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>After being updated to version 1.7.18.22, players can turn into a Ghoul, but they will have to go through a quest to do so. The quest in question is called “Leap of Faith”, which takes players into a new section of the Savage Divide. Here, players will find new characters who will help them transform. Completing the questline will allow players to fully transform into a ghoul and use abilities like Glow and Feral. They will also have access to 30 new Ghoul-exclusive <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/24uIqswESsK1aunG5a2oyS/fallout-76-ghoul-within-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">perks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players need to be at level 50 to undergo this transformation, and after becoming a Ghoul in Fallout 76, they need to watch out for some things. Factions like Brotherhood of Steel and others will be hostile towards Ghouls, so players will have to disguise themselves with new costumes that they receive from Jaye, a new NPC. This disguise will allow players to interact with blocked content they may find when playing a Ghoul.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, your transformation into a Ghoul in Fallout 76 is not final, and players can become Human again. To do so, you must return to the character selection screen. However, once you become a human, you cannot transform into a Ghoul again, as the questline for the Leap of Faith cannot be replayed. If you still wish to return to the Ghoul life, you can purchase a Ghoul Retransformation from the character screen for 1,000 Atoms.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Today, Palworld developer Pocketpair&nbsp;<span><a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1902195801461514742" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> update 0.5, which adds</span>&nbsp;major features like cross-play between all platforms, a Photo Mode, and increased storage.</p>
<p><em>▼New Content</em><br>
<em>・Crossplay!</em><br>
<em>⤷ Cross-play is now available across all platforms.</em></p>
<p><em>・Global Palbox</em><br>
<em>⤷ Store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds!</em></p>
<p><em>・Dimensional Pal Storage</em><br>
<em>⤷ A new storage system with 10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox! Guild members can access it, and it can also be used as a personal storage with private settings.</em></p>

<p><em>・Photo Mode</em><br>
<em>⤷ Accessible from the Pal Command Wheel. Hide the UI and move the camera around to take stunning screenshots.</em></p>
<p><em>・Drafting Table</em><br>
<em>⤷ Combine low-rarity blueprints to create higher-rarity ones!</em></p>
<p>There's also the addition of dedicated servers for the Mac version of Palworld, as well as plenty of balance adjustments and tweaks, bug fixes, and UI improvements. However, the team also said that dedicated servers for the PlayStation 5 version aren't currently available, though they are working on adding support in the future.</p>
<p>After last year's explosive launch of the game, its success has slowed down, although it still reached the incredible number of 32 million players earlier this year. However, Pocketpair's plans got a big wrench stuck in them when Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a lawsuit for patent infringement. Pocketpair communications director and publishing manager John Buckley talked at GDC 2025 (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-came-as-a-shock-to-pocketpair-because-patent-infringement-was-something-that-no-one-even-considered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Gamesradar</a>) about how shocking it was for the studio to find this out:</p>
<p><em>This obviously came as a shock to us. I think it came as a shock to a lot of people because it's alleged patent infringement, which is something that no one even considered, and it's something that we're still hashing out basically. It didn't feel good, obviously. We were pretty vocal before Palworld released that we did legal checks before the game released, and they were all cleared - in Japan. So obviously, when the lawsuit was announced, we were all like, 'What?'</em></p>
<p><em>And we went back to the lawyers, and the lawyers contacted the courts, and they said, 'what's going on,' and that's when we discovered it was patents that they were going for. Pretty much everyone at Pocketpair is a huge fan, so a pretty depressing day, a lot of people kind of head-down walking home in the rain. It changed a lot of things for us. We were just about to release the PlayStation version. We were just about to go to Tokyo Game Show. Obviously, we had to kind of scale back a little bit and hire security guards and stuff like that. But yeah, the short answer is it did not feel good.</em></p>

<p>Palworld’s highly anticipated cross-play update is now live, adding additional features, adjustments and other changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After today’s update, Palworld players can play with friends across any platform, thanks to the new cross-play feature. The Global Palbox has also been added, allowing the storage of Pal data and the transfer of Pals between worlds. A new storage system called Dimensional Pal Storage provides players with 10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox. Guild members can access this box, which can also be used as personal storage.</p>



<p>Apart from cross-play and world transfer for Pals, Palworld has some cosmetic and photo mode changes for the game in the new update. The new cosmetic armour system is essentially a transmog system, allowing players to equip armour cosmetically at the Antique Dresser without affecting any stats. Moreover, the photo mode is now accessible through the Pal Command Wheel, and players can combine low-rarity blueprints to make high-rarity ones. Lastly, Mac has dedicated servers now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, Palworld has made specific adjustments, like connecting pieces of a roof or foundation, which will automatically align, and players can now sit on chairs and cushions. There are some balance adjustments, like summoned raid bosses cannot damage other bases and adjustments to the NPC rewards. Players interested in these adjustments, the new UI changes, and bug fixes can check out the full <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1902195801461514742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">patch notes here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pocketpair also confirmed that dedicated servers for the PS5 version of Palworld are currently unavailable. The devs are working towards adding support and releasing this feature in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo’s lawsuit against Palworld <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-devs-were-shocked-by-nintendos-patent-infringement-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘came as a shock’</a> to the devs. Also, Pocketpair publishing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-publishing-warn-not-more-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has warned players</a> not to expect more Palworld.

            <p>Hasbro has "a lot of people very interested in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>", as developer Larian moves away from the series.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> released towards the end of 2023, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-mammoth-success-drives-larian-to-bumper-207m-pre-tax-profit-for-2023">became a smashing success for Dungeons and Dragons owner Hasbro as well as Larian</a>. The game won scores of praise (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-the-game-awards">and awards</a>) across the world, and last year Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-has-more-players-this-year-than-its-actual-launch-year">game's average daily peak concurrents were up by a not-to-be-sniffed-at three percent in 2024 over 2023</a>.</p>
<p>However, despite this heady success, Larian is moving on from Baldur's Gate, and has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>. So, where does that leave the future of Baldur's Gate? Well, there are plenty of others who are "very interested" in Baldur's Gate, SVP of digital games at Hasbro Dan Ayoub has said.</p>

<p>"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that," Ayoub told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says">IGN</a> during this week's GDC event in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Now, while the wording of "in pretty short order" certainly sounds promising, this doesn't mean we are about to suddenly get Baldur's Gate 4. In fact, Hasbro isn't "in a hurry" for that particular game.</p>
<p>"That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things," Ayoub explained, with the publication adding the exec said he eventually <em>wants</em> a Baldur's Gate 4, but it will take some time.</p>
<p>As for other Hasbro Dungeons and Dragons games, Ayoub said he is "never one to shy down from a challenge". After all, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-dungeons-and-dragons-game-on-the-way-from-disney-dreamlight-valley-team">there are several other</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">D&amp;D-based games in the works</a>, and in November Hasbro announced following the success of Baldur's Gate 3, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-20/hasbro-s-gamer-ceo-refocuses-on-play-after-selling-film-business">yet another Dungeons &amp; Dragons game was in production</a>.</p>
<p>"I think anything that forces us to raise our creative bar, and developers love to have a high bar to go after, and I think we've actually seen the team push some really interesting ideas that they're like, 'Okay, we need to raise our bar. We need to go bigger on this.' And things like that. So, I think that's our hope, right? We would keep raising the bar and everyone just tries to go a little higher," Ayoub closed.</p>

			<p>Earlier this week, 4A Games <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/3/16/metro-15th-anniversary-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a new blog post</a> on its official website to celebrate the Metro franchise's 15th anniversary. Following up on an <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sdk-released-next-metro-influenced-by-russian-invasion-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier statement from a couple of years back</a>, the development team openly said that the next installment will be much darker because of the Ukraine-Russia War:</p>
<p><em>In 2022, a full-scale Russian invasion changed how we wanted to tell the story of the next Metro game. As art became life for many of our developers in Ukraine, we drew from that lived experience to create an even darker story, those themes already present in Metro becoming ever-more apparent and important. As conflict, the struggle for power, the horrors of tyranny, and the price of freedom have become part of our lives over the past 3+ years, we are still living and working during this wartime, and that inevitably shapes the games we make.</em></p>
<p><em>Metro has always had a hard-hitting, political, anti-war, and often emotional story - and you can be sure these themes will continue thanks to our ongoing collaboration with franchise creator, author, and activist Dmitry Glukhovsky. Dmitry has always <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-writer-is-on-russias-wanted-list-for-his-anti-war-stance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoken out against the war in Ukraine from the start</a> – a courageous decision for any russian, that has seen him <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-series-author-dmitry-glukhovsky-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sentenced to jail (in absentia)</a> - and we are proud to have him as a friend and co-creator as we tell this next, and never more relevant chapter of Metro together. Rest assured, you are in for quite the ride.</em></p>
<p>The development team also shared an update on their current status. 4A Games is now composed of over 200 members, 150 of whom are still in Kyiv, while the rest are located in the studio's headquarters in Sliema, Malta. Besides Metro, 4A Games is also working on an unannounced intellectual property.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian developers are inevitably still impacted by the war, and as such, they asked fans to manage expectations when it comes to the reveal of the next Metro: it will be ready when it's ready. Indeed, it's already been over six years since the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metro-exodus-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metro Exodus</a>, and it sounds like we'll have to wait a while yet before we hear anything concrete.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fans can look forward to <a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Quimera</a>, a sci-fi first-person shooter game in development at Reburn, formerly 4A Games Ukraine and now completely independent of 4A Games.</p>

Pocketpair have taken a break from their packed schedule of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">saloon brawls with Mario's lawyers</a> to update their monster-catching <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game with a new Crossplay mode, together with new storage options, a Photo Mode, a cosmetic armour system, and a new Drafting Table feature. That and a multitude of smaller tweaks and fixes.

<p>
Witness the crossplaying in the below trailer, in which a base-vandalising Astegon gets its bell rung by a group of visitors presumably running foreign hardware. That'll learn 'em to step on my Lamballs.

</p>
<p>
・Cosmetic Armour System!</p> <p>You can now equip armour cosmetically in the Antique Dresser. Change your character's appearance without affecting armour stats!

Legal fisticuffs with Nintendo and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> updates aside, Pocketpair have recently gotten into games publishing. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">Their first collaboration is an untitled horror game from Surgent Studios</a>, the people behind Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU. The move into publishing doubles as a spiritual dividend for Palworld players who now look with horror upon their sprawling empires of Pokélike slaves. Rest easy, ye fretful caPaltalists - your blood money is being used to fund a new generation of indie games.

    <blockquote><cite>Good Ol' Auto says:</cite> This is a bit silly of a question, but are there random events as you explore? How interactable is the settlement you're given? And most importantly, how is the fashion game? Is transmog as good as it was in Odyssey, or is it more like Valhalla's restrictive take on it? And do we get similar customization to the latter in the game letting us change Naoe's and Yasuke's hairstyles?</blockquote>
<p>Good questions all! Yes, there are often random events by the side of the road - people with small stories to share, problems to quickly solve, or bandits lying in wait. You're rewarded for interacting with these by gaining intel on a nearby activity/merchant/treasure you're yet to find, or with an extra scout to send out that season. Useful!</p>
<p>The settlement is fairly interactive. Every time I go back, several people want to say hello - and this definitely helps flesh out your companion characters, who otherwise only get a couple of missions of screentime. I'd encourage going back as often as you can of your own accord - the game does not force you back there after every story arc like Valhalla.</p>
<p>Transmog is the Odyssey system. It's a lot of fun, and lets you junk your old gear fast. There's some great armour options, but no hairstyles/beard styles... yet.</p></div>

    <blockquote><cite>Raziel says:</cite> How level-gated is the main game? Did you find yourself having to do side-quests (or grind even) to reach that level or does it pace well with the story?</blockquote>
<p>Several folk asked about this yesterday too - thanks for your questions <strong>November02</strong>, <strong>eze2g</strong> and <strong>MrZappa</strong>. </p>
<p>After the game's prologue, the map opens out and you can travel anywhere. Enemies have a base difficulty in each region which then syncs with yours as you level up, so you're never going anywhere that's a cakewalk. You can generally tackle areas and equip gear about five levels higher than yours.</p>
<p>There's definitely a structure to the game - you'll discover/be encouraged to go after some of the main targets before others. But there's not a strict order within that, and I never found myself having to grind in order to move on, or because I was unable to do anything else before being a higher level. </p></div>

<p>I'm guessing you mean snakes! (Could be slow worms.) I can confirm Shadows' total snake count is: zero.</p>
<p>For my fellow vegetarians, one small thing I liked about Shadows is it never forces you to hunt/kill animals. The game's world is teeming with life - but it's there to be observed and painted!</p>

- How long did it take you to finish the game? and did you do much of the side quests?
- Did you find side quests and exploration worthwhile?</blockquote>
<p>New Eurogamer feature/old Assassin's Creed fan - hello :)</p>
<p>It took me 55 hours to hit the credits, completing the main story, all companion sidequests and the epilogue quests for both Naoe and Yasuke. That's the real meat of it all, though of course completionists have more to do. (Hello again.)</p>
<p>Exploration is a big part of the fun of the game. I found it far more rewarding, not least because Shadows' world is so visually stunning. Anything to do with Naoe/Yasuke's personal stories are great and very worth doing. Companion characters are a mixed bag, and not essential.</p></div>

    <blockquote><cite>StingingVelvet says:</cite> I'm only really interested in stealth. Just how often will I be forced to go all out action with the samurai guy?</blockquote>
<p>As a long-term Assassin's Creed fan, stealth is my go-to as well. As a percentage of the game's full run-time, it's not often Shadows forces you to play as one character over another - and as Yasuke much less than Naoe, who gets the game's lengthy prologue pretty much to herself. </p>

            <p>A year and a bit on from its monumental debut which saw the internet dubbed 'Pokémon with guns' game surpassing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">2m concurrent players on Steam</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> now has crossplay.</p>
<p>The update went live today across platforms, with developer Pocketpair proclaiming "the wait is over". Crossplay was included in a roadmap laid out by the developer back in January, where the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-adding-ending-scenario-this-year-as-game-celebrates-first-anniversary-while-under-legal-threat-from-nintendo">Palworld team outlined its plans for the game's second year</a>. At this time, however, no release date was mentioned.</p>
<p>Other new bells and whistles added with today's update include a new storage system, dedicated servers for those playing on Mac, and a photo mode.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, earlier this week Pocketpair discussed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-had-to-scale-back-a-little-bit-and-hire-security-guards-palworld-developer-reveals-nintendo-lawsuit-reaction">moment it discovered Nintendo had launched legal action against its Pokémon-style game</a>, calling it "a very depressing day".</p></div>

            <title><![CDATA[ARK DLC Trailer Slammed For Being Made Entirely Through Gen AI]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ark-dlc-trailer-entirely-gen-ai/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ark-dlc-trailer-slammed-for-being-made-entirely-through-gen-ai.1138584/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ark-dlc-trailer-entirely-gen-ai/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, Snail Games USA revealed a new trailer for ARK: Aquatica, an all-new expansion coming to ARK: Survival Ascended. The chief developer behind the series, Studio Wildcard, distanced itself from the project on social media by directing fans to Snail Games, and it’s clear why.</p>



<p>The published trailer was little more than a gen-AI showcase, except for a few seconds of gameplay at the start of the video. It’s glaringly obvious and it has drawn blowback from fans online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-naturally">Naturally</h2>



<p>The one-minute trailer that announces ARK: Aquatica is studded with blatant gen-AI footage, and even the most uneducated eye can look at it and know something is wrong:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ARK: Aquatica Official Trailer GDC 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2eCWWaCzwQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The entire contents of the trailer reveal <strong>nothing </strong>about the expansion. It’s just a visual reel that shows janky AI characters exploring some kind of water-themed underworld. In one sequence, a character fires a harpoon gun, and it’s so bizarre it’s a wonder this thing managed to pass muster at Snail Games.</p>



<p>What’s worse is it isn’t even <strong>good </strong>gen-AI content. I’ve seen better and more accurate renditions in Snapchat filters. From a cursory glance beneath the video, I failed to find a single positive comment about the trailer. When I checked, more than 1,000 comments were ripping the AI-generated content to shreds.</p>



<p>Per the description of the DLC, ARK: Aquatica will have players taking their ‘survival to the deep blue with new creatures, mechanics, and dangers lurking below.’</p>



<p>Recently, the team at Wildcard Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ark-next-major-expansion-set-scene-ark-2/">revealed ARK: Lost Colony</a>, the first major expansion for ARK: Survival Ascended that will help bridge the gap between ARK and ARK 2, which still doesn’t have a release date.</p>



<p>Are you miffed by the use of gen-AI in the trailer for ARK: Aquatica? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/x-men-dice-throne-is-a-board-game-that-makes-good-use-of-its-license<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel is everywhere these days, so it’s not surprising to see the deluge of heroes and villains represented throughout various media like the X-Men ‘97 show and Marvel Rivals video game. Even on the tabletop front, Marvel has seen its fair share of interesting crossovers with the likes of the team-based word game Codenames, and the long lasting trading card game Magic: The Gathering. Coming this Spring, there is yet another Marvel collab featuring the X-Men and the dice-rolling fighting game, Dice Throne. From what I’ve played so far, it’s very similar to past versions, but the new characters and unique abilities give this new X-Men run an interesting take for fans looking for a different kind of superhero tabletop experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new X-Men iteration of Dice Throne was initially on Kickstarter. So the Kickstarter version and the Battle Chest version that can be ordered on their website will have different contents than the retail versions that I was able to play with. These differences are mainly in the quality of the tokens and game pieces, in addition to better organizational improvements like storage trays for each hero. For the retail versions, there are two boxes to choose from showcasing four different X-Men each. One includes Cyclops, Gambit, Rogue, and Jean Grey while the other has Iceman, Psylocke, Storm, and Wolverine. So when deciding on which box to get into, you get a good blend of some fan favorites no matter what. Each character has a difficulty rank from one to six, which can be seen on the back of the box as well. The box with Wolverine and Storm is best for new players, since neither of the heroes have a difficulty over four. The Gambit and Jean Grey box, on the other hand, has both of these heroes in particular at difficulty six, so it’s best to consider your playgroup before choosing one or the other. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/dt-x-men-battle-chest-1742339226226.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Since this is ultimately Dice Throne, the gameplay is much the same, with each player rolling dice to determine what abilities their character will use on themself or their opponents or allies. Of the eight abilities on a character board, one of them is usually a defensive ability and another is a passive – alongside the other offensive abilities. On the center is the ultimate ability, which is of course very difficult to pull off being a game of chance. WIth each character board comes dice, a deck of cards specific to the character, dials for tracking resources, and associated character sheets with added information. It can take some time to understand a character’s abilities and the synergy between each one, but it all comes down to what you roll to decide what your turn will play out as. The deck of cards can assist you in manipulating your roll, but you can also alter your opponent’s roll if you decide to make an attack weaker or fizzle altogether. You’ll be taking turns rolling dice and bashing your opponents until they’re life hits zero. It’s pretty a straightforward goal, but how you get there is where the strategy comes in. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The more Wolverine is attacked, the stronger his attacks will be.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the basic gameplay is quite simple, the replayability really comes from the different characters you can pick from. Wolverine, for instance, has a fairly easy playstyle where he gains rage when taking damage. So the more Wolverine is attacked, the stronger his attacks will be. Then you have characters like Storm that can supercharge her abilities to have extra effects. She even has an ability to borrow dice from other players, so she has a better chance of rolling straights, like in poker, which are the cost of some offensive abilities. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel X-Men Dice Throne </h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking at the very difficult side of the character spectrum, there’s Jean Grey, who swaps back and forth between the Dark Phoenix, altering her passive abilities each turn. This means she’s drawing many cards and gaining resources one turn as Jean Grey, then skipping an entire phase but having higher offensive capabilities the next turn as Dark Phoenix. It can be difficult to balance depending on how your opponents affect your plays. Then there’s Gambit, another difficult character who kinetically charges cards with abilities to set up added effects on future turns. So keeping track of said charged cards and when to use them is another layer of strategy. Each character has their own flavor that matches their comic lore, so it’s just a matter of understanding their playstyle to make gameplay go smoothly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dice Throne can be played 1v1, but there are other options that the game suggests, like a free-for-all King of the Hill when there are an odd number of players, or even team matches. Since players take turns one at a time, games can last long if players aren’t quite comfortable enough yet, so playing 1v1 is a good way to get your feet wet before moving on to bigger parties. If you have experience with trading card games like Magic: The Gathering, Dice Throne will actually be pretty easy to pick up. Other than the dice rolls determining which abilities to use, the cards are used very similarly to other TCGs. For instance, there is a specific turn order like upkeep phase, income phase, main phase, and dice roll phases as well as the different timings for when cards can be used during either phase. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve seen Dice Throne before, but I’ve never really thought much of it whenever I find myself at the board game section of a store. Sure, dice-rolling games can be fun and interesting, but people will be drawn to whatever genres or game types they prefer. Being a fan of the Marvel universe and superheroes in general, this iteration of Dice Throne really brought me around to checking it out. If you enjoy Marvel characters and want a fun new board game to add to the library, X-Men Dice Throne really scratches that itch for board game nights – especially when your friends enjoy the characters and world as well. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Road to the Show is one of the most popular game modes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mlb-the-show-25/" data-ref-id="5000-660215">MLB The Show 25</a>. The mode allows you to create your own player and ascend the ranks of Major League Baseball to eventually reach the big leagues and make a true name for yourself. There are plenty of different factors that go into making it to the Show, and your player's batting stance can be one of them.</p><p>While it might not sound like a major factor, some players die on the hill that your batting stance can make a huge difference at the plate. Whether it's due to timing, the look of the swing, or the starting position of the bat, a particular batting stance can be considered "better" than others.</p><p>To help you narrow down your choices from the hundreds of batting stances in MLB The Show 25, we've listed our top seven stances and why you should use them. <strong>The list is in no particular order</strong>.</p><h2>Yordan Alvarez (current player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461472-img_6467.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461472" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461472-img_6467.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461472"></a><figcaption>Yordan Alvarez</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461472-img_6467.jpg"></figure><p>We're starting with one of the more famous batting stances from the past few years in MLB The Show. Yordan Alvarez of the Houston Astros has become one of the best hitters in baseball and many Road to the Show players have stood by his batting stance since he started to mash balls all over the league. Alvarez's stance puts the bat on your left shoulder and keeps your elbows fairly even. However, if you want to take the stance to the next level, you can customize the "Forward Foot Offset" to the following:</p><ul><li>Offset Z: 0</li><li>Offset X: 0</li></ul><p>These settings make your right foot extend way out away from your body, placing more weight on your back foot. While the stance might look a little funky, it delivers a huge leg kick and some true power behind each swing.</p><h2>Shawn Green (former player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461473-img_6466.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461473" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461473-img_6466.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461473"></a><figcaption>Shawn Green</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461473-img_6466.jpg"></figure><p>We can't take credit for this entry, as the stance and its settings <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MLBTheShow/comments/1e0eyhd/comment/lco7jhc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">come from a Redditor</a> on the MLB The Show subreddit. However, we felt it had to be included due to how many players have sung its praises over the years. The stance is for Shawn Green, foundational speaking, but it customizes a variety of settings to make it one-of-a-kind in Road to the Show.</p><p>Here are the custom stance settings you should use for Shawn Green:</p><ul><li>Hand Offset:  <ul><li>Offset X: 48</li><li>Offset Y: 70</li><li>Offset Z: 61</li></ul></li><li>Hand Rotation: 60</li><li>Hand Waggle Rotation: 80</li><li>Back Elbow Offset: 50</li><li>Front Elbow Offset: 50</li><li>Hips Offset:  <ul><li>Offset X: 77</li><li>Offset Y: 65</li><li>Offset Z: 48</li></ul></li><li>Front Foot Offset:  <ul><li>Offset Z: 48</li><li>Offset X: 33</li></ul></li></ul><p>Using these custom settings, you create a balanced stance that many Road to the Show players simply call "the one."</p><h2>Mark McGwire (former player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461474-img_6465.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461474" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461474-img_6465.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461474"></a><figcaption>Mark McGwire</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461474-img_6465.jpg"></figure><p>Mark McGwire, with or without the steroids, is one of the best hitters the MLB has ever seen. McGwire utilized a couple of abnormal batting stances during his career, but the first one he utilized is one of the best available in Road to the Show. You can also use a second McGwire stance (1987) that features hands tighter to the batter's face.</p><p>The base McGwire stance is simple, doesn't have a lot of movement, and has feet that are fairly far apart from one another. It delivers great timing and has a fluid swing that works for both lefties and righties.</p><h2>Chipper Jones 2008 (former player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461475-img_6464.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461475" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461475-img_6464.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461475"></a><figcaption>Chipper Jones</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461475-img_6464.jpg"></figure><p>Chipper Jones is the most successful switch hitter of all time in the MLB, and his 2008 batting stance is highly recommended for any Road to the Show player who takes up the switch-hitting mantle. Chipper's swing also looks better on taller players, as it's relaxed and makes you stand almost fully upright. The bat is close to resting on your shoulder with little movement, the elbows are even with each other around the chest area, and both feet are pretty close together.</p><p>If you're a switch hitter or want a fully relaxed batting stance, take a look at Chipper Jones' stance.</p><h2>Yoan Moncada (current player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461476-img_6463.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461476" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461476-img_6463.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461476"></a><figcaption>Yoan Moncada</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461476-img_6463.jpg"></figure><p>Yoan Moncada's MLB career hasn't worked out like many thought it would, but his stance is great for power hitters. It looks similar to Chipper Jones' stance, but features hands closer to your face and looks a little more focused towards the pitcher. Many Road to the Show players have suggested messing with the custom settings to make Moncada's feet farther apart, but the upright look works well for the stance, in our opinion.</p><h2>Ken Griffey Jr. (former player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461477-img_6462.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461477" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461477-img_6462.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461477"></a><figcaption>Ken Griffey Jr.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461477-img_6462.jpg"></figure><p>Ken Griffey Jr. is one of the most recognizable baseball players in history and he was known to have arguably the smoothest swing of all time. That holds up in MLB The Show 25, as Griffey's default stance is great for both contact and power hitters as well as both sides of the plate. The stance looks pretty normal but the swing drives through the middle of the plate and the bat ends up right behind the batter with one hand up in the air.</p><h2>Freddie Freeman (current player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461479-img_6461.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461479" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461479-img_6461.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461479"></a><figcaption>Freddie Freeman</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461479-img_6461.jpg"></figure><p>Rounding out the list is the current reigning World Series MVP, Freddie Freeman. Freeman has always had a smooth swing, but it's one that works best for lefties in MLB The Show 25. The stance is designed to pull the ball and pull-hitters usually hit from the left side of the plate.</p><p>It places the bat behind the batter's head with the back elbow up a little farther than the front one, which is close to the batter's face. The right knee is slightly bent to place a little more weight on the left leg so you can really drive the ball into right field. Even if you're a right-handed hitter, though, don't feel like you can't use Freeman's stance.</p><p>And that does it for our top batting stances in MLB The Show 25. Of course, these are just our suggestions, so you can try them to find your preference.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Two Point Museum: It’s Great]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/two-point-museum-it%E2%80%99s-great.1138464/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-review-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Having bounced off the last two games in what's now a fairly long-running series--<em>Two Point Hospital</em> (2018) and <em>Two Point Campus</em> (2022)--I wasn't super pumped to be sitting down with <em>Two Point Museum</em>. A week later I can see that my indifference was <em>wildly </em>misplaced; it's one of the best, if not <em>the </em>best management games I have ever played.</p><p>My main problem with the first two games in the series wasn't necessarily with them as <em>games</em>, per se, but more their setting. I found them weirdly stressful: As the custodian of a hospital and then a school, there was a duty of care, a constant pressure to get people in, make them better (or smarter) then get them out. Fail and I could get people hurt, or even <em>killed</em>, a level of responsibility I absolutely do not want in a relaxing "click and watch some little guys move around" video game.</p><p>Not here. <em>Two Point Museum</em> just wants you to give a never-ending stream of guests and customers a good time. The general public are rarely in danger, are surprisingly patient as you repair stuff around them and are basically in your museum for the same reason you are: they want to have a coffee, learn some stuff and see some cool shit. This shift in focus changes the experience entirely; it's no longer a game about care, it's a game about being a fun guy.</p><p>And that's fun! Thanks to the vibe switch, <em>Two Point Museum</em> feels almost <em>Sims</em>-like at times, because there's less emphasis on the pinpoint optimisation of your museum (though you can do that if you like) and more of a focus on creative sandboxing, designing cool exhibits, then agonising over how you're going to decorate them.</p><p>This construction side of the game is so important here because your museum runs on "buzz". You generate buzz via the quality of your exhibits, which is partly down to stuff like their rarity, but mostly down to how you style them by adding stuff like plants, information displays, lighting and speakers. There aren't hard rules you need to stick to in order to upgrade your exhibits; the game assesses you more on the quantity of stuff you add, not the quality of its placement. You can spend hours dressing up your dinosaur bones exactly how you like, and if that's how you like it, the game will reward you for it.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Two Point Museum | Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BXgVvAMUZ4Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Beyond the positive vibes and very enjoyable sandbox/construction tools, this is also a <em>very </em>good management game. Its interface, combining on-screen alerts (like icons appearing over the heads of guests and staff) with a speedy set of menus, is almost frictionless; you're always alerted to the exact location and cause of a problem (or even a shortcoming) almost instantly, and solving those issues usually only takes a click or two. Not once during my entire week with this game did I ever feel lost, or wondered exactly what was causing an issue, or how I was supposed to make something better. While I know that sounds like the absolute basics of this genre, you'd be surprised--<em>Planet Coaster 2</em>, I'm looking at you--how many rivals can't get it right.</p><p>Well, no, I did get lost <em>once</em>, and that was when crimes were being committed. <em>Two Point Museum</em> is full of crime. It has a whole system attached to detecting and defeating it that would be more at home in a game about art heists or jewellery stores. Criminals are forever trying to break in and steal your stuff, and you have various ways of trying to stop them, from putting security guards near exhibits to building a network of cameras around the museum. But the act itself is strangely punitive; you sometimes get almost no time to react before you can lose a whole exhibit when a single thief drags an entire Stegosaurus skeleton down a toilet (don't ask) and escapes. Those things can take ages to build, so to lose them in an instant is weirdly at odds with the rest of the game's casual, fun-loving, build-whatever nature.</p><p>A game about running a modern museum and managing a diverse staff of skilled workers could also have been areas <em>Two Point Museum</em> tripped up, but I was pleasantly surprised by its handling of both. First, how they managed to make a whole game about museums work without once having to whistle awkwardly as we collected antiques or raided tombs is a miracle--you instead build collections based on dinosaur bones, fossils, fish, ghosts and space--which <em>sounds </em>weird, but once you start playing the game it really does make sense within <em>Two Point's </em>cartoonish universe.</p><p>And second, there aren't many games where the phrase "pay your workers" is more important. Everyone you hire can eventually be trained to be <em>elite</em>; as they learn more and get better at their jobs, they ask to get paid more, and you have to pay them a lot more. Unlike loads of other management games, you can't skimp here; if you don't pay them they get angry and walk, and losing your best workers can cripple your entire operation. So look after your people! Good lesson!</p><p><em>Two Point Museum</em> is out now on PC, Mac, Xbox and PlayStation.</p><figure><figcaption>My copy came with some bonus Sega stuff. Welcome to the second-most popular exhibit in my entire museum. </figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/monster-hunter-movie"><h3>That Live Action Monster Hunter Movie Kinda Rips</h3></a><p>Who would’ve thought Paul W.S.

It's been four months since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2</a> was released, starting life as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">really great shooter that had more tech issues than you can shake a stick at</a>, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> have kept themselves busy with some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-first-patch-is-coming-next-week-though-my-favourite-parts-are-still-the-imperfections">hefty patches</a>. The first one alone had almost 2000 fixes, with the second one following that up with more than 1700. As of today, patch 1.3 is here, this time bringing in over 1200 changes, fixes, and improvements. Obviously quite a bit less than the previous two main patches, but a sizable figure nonetheless, and hopefully a sign that the game is getting to a healthy point.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Over on Steam, GSC Game World highlighted a few of the more notable changes that come with the patch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/831582351143207687">Steam</a>, covering a broad range of aspects like AI, general balance, story bits, audio bits, and story progression. On the AI and combat front, mutants' movements during combat are smoother now, and NPCs will have an "improved" reaction to hearing the sound of footsteps.
</p>
<p>
Balance wise, A-life encounters will generally be a bit rarer now, and arch artifacts have had a rebalance themselves; weird water has decreased radiation protection, and weird flower has an increased smell masking effect now for example. There's also a bug that could let players "permanently stack the effect of unequipped artifacts" that has been fixed now too.
</p>
<p>
I really can't list out all of the other patch notes here as there's just too many, which continues to be impressive work from GSC Game World. You can check the <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en/news/patch-1-3">full patch notes</a> if you're that desperate to take in every single change. And in case you were wondering, this won't be the last update either, CSC Game World did also note that they have already started working on the next update.

          <p>It's been nearly two years now since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/05/phil-harrisons-successor-announced-at-sony-shuhei-yoshida/">game industry veteran</a> Phil Harrison <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/after-the-death-of-stadia-vp-phil-harrison-has-left-google/">left Google</a> following the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/google-stadia-officially-shuts-down-january-2023-will-refund-game-purchases/">implosion of the company's Stadia cloud gaming service</a>. But the passage of time hasn't stopped one company from taking advantage of this week's Game Developers Conference to poke fun at the erstwhile gaming executive for his <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/meet-the-stadia-developers-blindsided-by-googles-latest-product-shutdown/">alleged mistreatment of developers</a>.</p>

<p>While Gunther Harrison probably hasn't fired any GDC attendees, the famously bald Phil Harrison was responsible for the firing of plenty of developers when he <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/report-stadia-undershot-to-the-tune-of-hundreds-of-thousands-of-users/">shut down Google's short-lived Stadia Games &amp; Entertainment (SG&amp;E) publishing imprint</a> in early 2021. That shutdown <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/google-praised-stadia-studio-for-great-progress-one-week-before-killing-it/">surprised a lot of newly jobless game developers</a>, perhaps none moreso than those at Montreal-based Typhoon Games, which Google had <a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/google-buys-triple-a-game-dev-typhoon-studio-to-beef-up-stadia/">acquired in late 2019</a> to make what Google's Jade Raymond said at the time would be "platform-defining exclusive content" for Stadia.</p>
<p>Yet on the very same day that <em>Journey to the Savage Planet</em> launched as a Stadia exclusive, the developers at Typhoon found themselves jobless, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/google-closes-stadias-dedicated-game-studios-after-less-than-2-years/">alongside the rest of SG&amp;E</a>. By the end of 2022, Google would shut down Stadia entirely, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/meet-the-stadia-developers-blindsided-by-googles-latest-product-shutdown/">blindsiding even more game developers</a>.</p>
<h2>Don’t forgive, don’t forget</h2>
<p>After being let go by Google, Typhoon Games would reform as Raccoon Logic (thanks in large part to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/life-after-stadia-new-studio-raccoon-logic-picks-up-where-typhoon-studios-left-off">investment from Chinese publishing giant Tencent</a>) and reacquire the rights to the Savage Planet franchise. And now that the next game in that series is set to launch in May, it seems the developers still haven't fully gotten over how they were treated during Google's brief foray into game publishing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/silent-hill-2-remake-proves-that-remakes-aren-t-the-easy-option<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the era of remakes, developers have come under fire time and again for rehashing classic titles instead of pioneering new ideas. However, taking a beloved game from a different era and reimagining it for modern audiences is no small undertaking. Devs have to preserve everything that was amazing about the original story and gameplay, while polishing areas that might have been held back by the technology and capabilities of the time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At GDC 2025, Anna Oporska-Szybisz, senior level designer at Bloober Team, gave us the inside look at what is required to take an already beloved game and catapult it to new heights, discussing the difficulties faced when building levels on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2 Remake</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As a die-hard fan of the 2001 hit, the weight was heavy on her shoulders as she set out to rebuild a place treasured by horror fans around the world.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Managing fan expectations around classic games">Managing fan expectations around classic games</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oporska-Szybisz started the breakdown with a surprising point: fan theories. One of the hardest things developers face when remaking games as popular as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the relationship players have built with the story. She stated that “remembering is caring,” admitting that developers do look at the theories players share online, taking those perceptions into account when restructuring the story.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-comedic-cheat-sheet-that-helped-build-tactical-breach-wizard" target="_self" data-discover="true">The comedic cheat sheet that helped build Tactical Breach Wizards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This sensitivity to the player isn’t a small undertaking, as everyone who played the original game took something unique away from James’ story. When building a new title, devs don’t juggle as many preconceived notions of what the narrative or mechanics will deliver. In a remake, however, every element is an equation, one part innovation, two parts nostalgia. If not balanced correctly, the remake’s story might be unrecognizable or fail to resonate with longtime fans of the series.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oporska-Szybisz specifically had to tackle this when redesigning the Labyrinth level of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2 Remake</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The notoriously difficult maze of puzzles and boss battles stumped many players in 2001, including Oporska-Szybisz, and she wanted to make it better without losing the iconic and nostalgic elements of one of the game’s final challenges.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Don’t fix what isn’t broken">Don’t fix what isn’t broken</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oporska-Szybisz broke down the process of reimagining the Labyrinth, and laid out the three rules she uses to approach the rebuilding of a remake level. “Good Enough” describes elements of a game that don’t have issues. If it’s not broken, there isn’t any reason to scrap it and start over. She explained that they “try not to overdo things that only need small adjustments”.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-ufo-50-s-incredible-8-bit-journey" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside UFO 50's incredible 8-bit journey</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The “almost enough” bracket covers elements that almost hit the mark, but maybe didn’t have the polish they needed. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has several puzzles that were aggressive and innovative for the time, but lacked some of the quality-of-life mechanics that are available today. These puzzles, maps, perspectives, and visuals are perfect candidates for a bit of reworking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The “not enough” bracket encompasses mechanics that were held back or poorly balanced in the original. In this category, Oporska-Szybisz specifically calls out the cube puzzles in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that manipulates the perspective of a room with very few clues to help the player through the puzzle’s requirements. The goal was to fully reimagine this puzzle to make it intuitive and approachable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She mentioned one of the biggest hurdles in remaking games is that “it’s tempting to change a lot to make it 'better' but it’s often best to find a middle ground,” when reworking elements in remakes. The original game was loved for a reason, and too much of an overhaul can actually hurt the game, not bolster it.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="An iconic level remastered">An iconic level remastered</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using all the criteria she had broken down, Oporska-Szybisz then jumped into the painstaking process of what it takes to remake a well-known game level. The Labyrinth in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was an infuriating combination of difficult puzzles and impossible navigation. When I first played it, I became so turned around that I put the game down for months. James’ hand-drawn map was early-00s fog-of-war in the worst way. All the corridors looked the same, all the rooms were the same color, and it became a hazy blur to navigate.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-indika-s-powerful-bleak-exploration-of-religion" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside Indika's powerful, bleak exploration of religion</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oporska-Szybisz saw these problems in her playthrough and decided to go back to the foundations of what a Labyrinth can be. She looked to the classic Greek myths surrounding Theseus and his journey through the Labyrinth. She realized that the remake could rebuild this location with the same hints, using the setting to tell a story rather than just challenge the player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team split the once one-note level into three areas: Rotten, Desolated, and Ruined. Each is distinctive in color, offered different enemies, and required different strategies to navigate. They were also a depiction of the stages of James’ grief, literally leading him through the maze inside his own head.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oporska-Szybisz's team took something that had once left controllers thrown on a sofa and turned it into a beautiful piece of symbolic storytelling. They also took care to preserve elements of nostalgia from the original Labyrinth, like Pyramid Head’s cameo and most of the well-known puzzle rooms.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Remakes aren’t easy">Remakes aren’t easy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oporska-Szybisz’s breakdown of the level-rebuilding process in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2 Remake</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> offers a unique look at the complexities of breathing new life into classic stories. If done correctly, long-time fans can enjoy a world that they loved with modern niceties, while new fans can join in on a world they might not otherwise have the chance to experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Remakes are often the key to accessing titles that have been lost thanks to lacking or poor-quality ports. Devs may have to scrap and rebuild a remake concept multiple times to balance that "good enough" space Oporska-Szybisz spoke of. “What is the right amount of symbolism without throwing it in your face?”, she asked as she explained the difficult process of injecting inspiration into level elements, how do you keep the “glimpses of the past” while offering something fresh and exciting?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s hard work, but the art of it is vital in preserving titles we love and passing them on to new generations of players.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Laura Gray, known as Ezra when not putting pen to paper, is a D&amp;D enthusiast with a love of all things written.

I was trying to create a digital version of a theater game/score I am really fascinated with. I think it's called Lane Work, from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/viewpointsbookpr0000boga">The Viewpoints Book</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where actors are restricted to only moving back and forth in their own lanes, at different speeds (and then allowed a single action and a single phrase). The couple of times I played or watched it had been really powerful, and so I thought that could be an interesting direction to make something out of preexisting games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, instead of having multiple games showing at the same time and inspired by this Increpare game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.increpare.com/2017/08/running_memories/">Running Memories</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I started playing around with crossfading them at different intervals. I was also very interested in modular synthesizers, so at this point I was changing the character’s moving speed (the controller analog input) based on knobs, as well as the rate the crossfading happened. The effect was really mesmerizing, and at this point I realized that I could try making the fade actually have something related to the actual movement rather than it being a thing that happened in time.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-indika-s-powerful-bleak-exploration-of-religion" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside Indika's powerful, bleak exploration of religion</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, I spent a good amount of time figuring out good ways to make this happen, and instead of having the position of the characters in the games themselves dictate the crossfading, I made an invisible map where an invisible character would walk around, and in doing so would crossfade the games that were being displayed. From there, it was mostly technical issues and finding "samples" and placing them in the map.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(This is what it looks like on the inside. You are that square walking around a big map. The three closest games to you get crossfaded)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The main tools I used for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were the multi console emulator </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk">BizHawk</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for playing, "sampling," and playing back video games from many sources (and which has a great API to do a lot of what we do). I also used Unity for compositing the games' visual output and the logic in which that happens.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The latest version makes use of our awesome toolset </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/plunderludics/unity-hawk/tree/main">UnityHawk</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which allows us to very seamlessly integrate BizHawk within Unity. UnityHawk is extremely handy and replaced my early-on convoluted patchwork stack of Python scripts sending and receiving OSC messages from Unity and BizHawk. I also used the modular synthesizer emulator </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://vcvrack.com/">VCV rack</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the prototyping phase.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> weaves together many games from PSX and N64 into its exploration of memory, nostalgia, and movement in digital spaces. What challenges do you face in weaving these experiences from different consoles together into a single playable experience? How do you bring multiple games together, let alone ones from different systems?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the previous question answers this, but I can go into a bit more detail. Earlier on, I was using Unity to composite images from the BizHawk emulator using this library: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hecomi/uWindowCapture">uWindowCapture</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This allowed me to capture different emulator windows running in the background into textures in Unity. Then, there was a Python script bridging Unity and BizHawk through this protocol called OSC. With that, I could send messages to and from Unity and to and from BizHawk’s LUA scripting toolset.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That was a huge mess, and starting it up was also very unstable. Gurn Group and our friend Dan over the next year put a lot of effort into simplifying all of this by creating UnityHawk, which allows us to basically communicate directly to BizHawk from Unity and not have all those extra layers of indirection.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The multiple systems issue is solved by BizHawk, which is a godsend for us, allowing us to very seamlessly run games from a lot of different consoles. One friction point was that sometimes some games didn't take analog input, or the d-pad would affect the game differently, so I had to make sure each game had a correct input mapping so they all ran smoothly (if you look closely, you can see that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mega Man</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, for some reason, only turns right. I never got that one).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Has mixing these games together resulted in any interesting unintended results? Created something useful that may have taken you by surprise?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I am always really excited to see moments where players move beyond the places that I preselected for them. Sometimes this happened because I didn't know it was possible to get there without jumping, but most times it’s because they either die or hit a condition in which the game is expecting input other than moving (a cutscene or a dialogue). I think a lot of these moments create an exciting variation on the general infinite going forward of the game. I particularly love this one moment where you can get to a dialogue in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Majora's Mask</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> saying that you have a stupid horse while in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Croc</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> you are stuck on a moving platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How does it feel to repurpose and reshape the works of others in such a way that they pull from their existing meanings while also creating whole new ones? What interests you about creating things in this way?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For me, the most exciting thing about "plundering," as we call it, is having a whole new view on playing any game. I notice how the characters move in all of them, how long it takes for the game to boot and actually get into gameplay, how long it takes to be free from a tutorial interrupting you, how the swimming animation looks, how there seem to be bridges pretty early on in every game, how some 3D games have animations when pushing against walls and some don't, the different colors of the grass, places in which you can't jump if your character is stuck (I call these jump prisons), and many many more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I hope that making playable things in this way will also make people imagine their own possibilities, and also make an intuitive understanding that games are what we make out of the tools we are given. Playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tomb Raider</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> because you want a snapshot of all the tigers is in the same level of playing it to get to see the entire story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I also appreciate the historical aspects of it. While I can't deny the nostalgia factor of this project, I think it's important to be able to look at old games and think of them as "good for their time," rather than simply good on their own. Video game development is not a linearly progressing form, and many, many interesting things have been lost for the sake of streamlining and maximizing engagement. A lot of these early games are really bad, but a lot of them also surprise me immensely (the semi tank movement in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Croc</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, for example, feels like something lost to the modern 3D platformer).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, I think it's also interesting in new games, as in new rules and objectives, rather than new content. We, as game developers, love mashing our loved references together to create new work anyway—Metroidvanias, Soulslikes, roguelikes etc.. We recreate these ideas from scratch over and over, without much examination on what that process is actually giving us.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(Oops, I wrote a manifesto).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What appealed to you about creating an experience by connecting several other games together? Cross-fading them over one another and connecting them? How did crafting </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> in this way help enhance its themes?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was interested in the different ways it felt to move in the different 3D games, in the ways in which sometimes it feels like you were moving in one game but in a different game's scenery, and also in the dream-like narrative that arises out of the crossfading. The crossfading being driven by the movement of the player allowed me to make the feeling of actually moving between games—of it feeling like certain laces led to other laces.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I personally didn't have particular themes in mind as I was making it. I pretty much trusted the process and let the games guide some internal meaning that could arise out of the piece. I think </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> works pretty much as a conceptual plunderludics work—something to spark the possibility space of making games out of other games: "here's a very simple structure to combine together multiple games, in any amount. Now, imagine the possibilities of making it more intentional—of highly crafting the transitions."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I remember once talking to Bennett Foddy about the dream of making a narrative/single player version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Multibowl</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a video game with its own arc/story that is made completely out of premade pieces from other games. I don't think </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> achieves this, but I hope it makes people imagine it as well, and maybe even live tiny, uncurated narrative moments for themselves while roaming around. I'm hoping to bring a new version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to GDC that will have an ever grander set of games, and an even more intentional placement of things in the map.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Why did you include the games that you choose for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>? Why these specific titles?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a funny question. There's, again, not a lot of intention behind it, I wanted to have as many games as possible for the initial show where I was gonna display it, but I also didn't want to simply play games until the very first playable moment and then switch to the next game. This was, in a way, also a research project in 3D game movement. So, I was pretty much going down a list of games that sounded interesting, playing them for a bit, and "sampling" them in the meantime until I felt like moving on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The sampling aspect itself is more interesting and curated. I had some samples beforehand that I was using for testing and stayed on the final project, like Link on top of a tree which I was using for this </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://plunderludics.github.io/works/linked%20jumps.html">earlier experiment</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. However, once I decided to not have the jump button in the games, I started looking for jump prisons, and created my own little game out of searching for save states (I like calling them samples): finding locations in which, if the character can't jump, you are stuck in a particular area. There's not many of those, but I am always excited when I find something like that. I particularly love the one in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Croc</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> where you walk on the moving platform. That’s probably my favorite sample.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, I also started sampling moments where characters were in similar states, like being on a bridge, or being in a green place, or swimming; things like that. I didn't end up using a lot of these since I didn't want the same game to repeat too much, but I hope to expand on the project with more things like this.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oh, and I have also been fascinated with Any Austin's youtube series Unremarkable and odd Places, and the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk10mVrUQvk">sample from </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk10mVrUQvk">Spyro</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was taken straight from that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What interested you about exploring movement and the possibilities in 3D space? What ideas went into crafting a play space that would get the player to think on it</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a great final question for me to segue into shamelessly using this moment to promote my own, more commercially viable, work. While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a work within my plunderludics practice, it is also a research project for me—looking at a variety of 3D platformers and seeing what works and what doesn't, what might've been forgotten in the past, and how we got to the kind of games we have today. Myself and my friends are working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2888670/pondlife_discone_a_videogame/">pondlife: discone (a videogame)</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (Wishlist pls) which is the best 3D platformer game of all time (As in, it's already the best. We are simply still working on it to make it even better). Since we are developing a lot of our movement system from the ground up and reinventing the wheel in many ways, it’s great to be able to travel back to the time when the wheel was being invented and see what people were doing back then!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I am very interested in movement in games—the general embodying you can achieve with different controls, as well as the feeling of mastery and weirdness of exploring a new body. I also like playing games in ways they are not intended to be played (mostly trying to climb things that were not made to be climbed), so I also like playing these games in search of such structures—unintentionally designed challenges that work regardless, or in fact, work because of, the way these games work. It’s fascinating to me.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I love seeing people take these challenges even further, like the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A">Mario 64</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A"> half A press challenge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, trying to beat </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIA4KYiHHlU">Dark Souls 3</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIA4KYiHHlU"> without walking</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To3d6XKsMcQ">playing 4 instances of </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To3d6XKsMcQ">Mega Man</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To3d6XKsMcQ"> at the same time</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJyg1nzbZPg">randomized </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJyg1nzbZPg">Zelda</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfTDu9lzgtFHVirg_tSbRsSG6g0zKSdz6">many more</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

            <p>
I like a good puzzle game, but to be honest I don't play them all that often. Not because I'm bad at them, thanks for assuming I'm a numpty, it's more just that I prefer games with a really good hook to them - think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal">Portal</a> as the prime example of such a game. Clean, knows exactly what it is, and uses its concept in increasingly interesting ways without overstaying its welcome. I have no idea if Chromatic Conundrum will manage that or not, but I've never seen a game use light as part of its puzzles in quite the same way before.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
You can take a look at a snippet of gameplay below, but here's the lowdown: you need to move around boxes that emit different coloured lights to line-up with on sensors to open doors (think of Portal again and having to put boxes on buttons). Overlapping these boxes can create new colours, which you might need for certain sensors. Sometimes, you'll need to cast shadows so that certain sensors are left in the dark. It's one of those kinds of games that are so simple in concept, but it's the execution that really sells it to you.
</p> <div>

<p>
I'm a really big fan of how simple it all looks. There really is no denying Portal's influence on this game, add a few more textures in there and it could be an Aperture Science test chamber. The stark black and white really makes the colours pop though, really shows you how clean, simple design is sometimes the best way to go.
</p>
<p>
Of course, immediately it feels like this could be a problem for colour blind people, and there's no mention anywhere of any kind of accessibility features, but it still looks to be early enough days for the puzzle game, so hopefully that's something that gets added in.
</p>
<p>
Those of you as enamoured as I am by Chromatic Conundrum can wishlist the game on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3081690/Chromatic_Conundrum/">right here</a>.
