			<p>With Octopath Traveler 2 having been released in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii-same-systems-superior-stories/">2023</a>, I did not expect to see a new entry in the series that made HD-2D popular anytime soon. <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-announced/">Back in July</a>, however, Square Enix surprised fans of the series worldwide with the announcement of Octopath Traveler 0, a new game which isn't a proper sequel to its predecessors, but a sort of new and improved take on the story elements and gameplay ideas seen in the mobile game Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent as well as some brand new gameplay mechanics, such as town building mechanics that will allow players to rebuild their hometowns and customize it with a ton of visual customization options.</p>



<p>During Gamescom 2025 last month, I was given the chance to try out Octopath Traveler 0 before its release later this year, getting a taste of both the town building mechanics and the gameplay loop, which doesn't seem to stray too far from the classic JRPG loop featured in the first two entries in the series. Unfortunately, a total of around one hour wasn't enough to appreciate the finer details of the experience, and the few minutes I spent rebuilding the town weren't particularly impressive, as, aside from placing some buildings here and there, I couldn't experience how much choices would impact the development of the town and its inhabitants, although things seemed promising enough.</p>

<p>The second half of the Octopath Traveler 0 Gamescom 2025 demo, on the other hand, felt way more familiar and engaging. Set during one of the early story chapters, I was able to explore a beautiful and lively HD-2D town, interact with NPCs using the series' trademark Path Actions, which can have widely different outcomes depending on a variety of factors, and eventually proceed to a dungeon whose design is in line with the design of dungeons of the previous two entries in the series - a few alternate paths, but a generally straightforward design that easily prevents players from getting lost. As I explored the dungeon, I got into quite a few battles which felt instantly familiar, as the turn-based combat system of new entry in the series hasn't been changed a whole lot. As such, before long, I started hitting enemy weakpoints to Break and stun them, and Boost my characters to enhance the power of their skills to get rid of them in a single turn. The biggest change to the Octopath Traveler 0 combat experience is the bigger party size, eight members instead of four positioned in a front and back row, which I expect will open up a lot of interesting strategies and that is sure to influence enemy design considerably, since it will be easy to hit an enemy weakness with so many characters on hand. Having so many characters and widely diverse skills at my disposal, however, did not make the boss battle awaiting at the end of the dungeon any easier, so even those who mastered the previous two entries in the series should find plenty to sink their teeth into.</p>



<p>Thrown into the middle of the adventure with little to no knowledge of skills and synergies for eight different characters, playing the Octopath Traveler 0 Gamescom 2025 demo felt overwhelming, at times, but as soon as I got a little more acquainted with them, I was hooked once again. With the game's Job system promising to deliver the usual excellent customization features the series is known for, and plenty of unknowns regarding story, characters and the town building mechanics, which still managed to show promise in a short one hour session, I cannot wait to sit down and spend more time with what it setting out to be a more than worthy new entry in the series when it launches on December 4 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that another retro N64 game is coming to Nintendo Switch Online tomorrow, and if you're a fan of relatively obscure 90s shooters, you're in for a treat with this one.</p>

<p>As revealed by a brand new trailer, the latest N64 title to come to Switch Online is none other than&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64</em>, the Nintendo 64 version of a game that was also released for PC and the original PlayStation in 1998.</p>

<p>Indeed, this isn't the first time Acclaim's FPS has been re-released; back in 2018, as part of its 20th anniversary, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease" rel="nofollow">tireless</a> retro <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poed-definitive-edition-nightdive" rel="nofollow">stewards</a> Nightdive released a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Forsaken</em>, complete with support for modern hardware, a new automap feature, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forsaken-64-nintendo-switch-online-shooting.jpg?itok=gueTtUR7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forsaken-64-nintendo-switch-online-shooting.jpg?itok=pW3UCucT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Forsaken 64&nbsp;</em>will soon be available on Nintendo Switch Online.</figcaption></figure><p>This being Nintendo Switch Online, however, the version you're getting here isn't Nightdive's remaster; rather, it's an upscaled version of the original N64 game, so if you prefer your retro re-releases faithful to the originals, then this one's for you.</p>

<p>It's also worth mentioning that&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64&nbsp;</em>is only available as part of Nintendo Switch Online's 18+ collection, so if the age on your account is lower than that, you won't be able to play it even if you are signed up for Switch Online.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ridge-racer-64-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">other</a> N64 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-halloween" rel="nofollow">titles</a> on Switch Online, you also won't be able to check this one out if you're not signed up for the Expansion Pack addon, so make sure to grab that if this is a game you want to play on your Switch.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer showing off exactly what you can expect from<em>&nbsp;Forsaken 64&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo Switch Online right here.</p>




<p><em>Forsaken 64&nbsp;</em>will be added to the Nintendo Switch Online catalog tomorrow, so if you're tired of playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">that other game with the same release date</a>, you know where to head.

            <title><![CDATA[Randy Pitchford: How 20 Years of Borderlands Led to Borderlands 4]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/randy-pitchford-how-20-years-of-borderlands-led-to-borderlands-4</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/randy-pitchford-how-20-years-of-borderlands-led-to-borderlands-4.1287408/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There's a lot of words you could use to describe Randy Pitchford. The sometimes controversial, always energetic Gearbox CEO is often his studio's biggest cheerleader, and it comes off as earnest, which isn't something you can say about a lot of CEOs.</p>

<p>That passionate commitment to his craft really came through when we chatted with him and narrative director Sam Winkler on the show floor at PAX West. A <em>Borderlands 4</em> rage room punctuated the conversation with loud smashes, but honestly, that level of mayhem felt so on brand.</p>

<p>We asked Pitchford and Winkler about the efforts that went into <em>Borderlands 4</em>'s endgame this time around, along with what they think worked for fan-favorite DLC characters like Krieg and Gaige, especially in light of the newly confirmed DLC character.</p>



<h2><em>Borderlands 4</em>'s Biggest Hype Man</h2>

<p>It's been six years now since Pitchford, Winkler, and the team started working on the newest <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/borderlands" rel="nofollow">Borderlands</a> </em>game.</p>

<p>"This is a non-trivial percentage of my life," Pitchford said. "I wouldn't trade it for the world. For us, this is literally our lives. And we don't fuck around. Everything in the game is because someone did something. A human being put their heart and soul and sweat and tears into trying to do the best they did. It's not AI making this shit."</p>

<p><em>Borderlands </em>isn't just something that Pitchford creates to satisfy the bottom line. There's genuine joy when he talks about the game. That bleeds into when he talks about development, because he knows that a more fun game will be a better product for the end consumer—including himself.</p>

<p>That was evident when I asked him and Winkler about their favorite Vault Hunter to play as in the upcoming iteration. Part of me expected a diplomatic "I couldn't choose my favorite child" response without detail, but instead, I got a meaningful answer that sounded like these two were genuinely excited to play the game, even after countless hours of play testing.</p>



<p>"When I started, I thought I was just going to be Vex for life, and then when Rafa came online, I started messing around with that," Pitchford said. "But as I'm coming into launch, what I've been playing over the last few weeks, it's all been Harlowe." In fact, he has a ritual where he'll try to 100% the game when it releases, and he plans to do that with the Gravitar herself.</p>

<p>Winkler, on the other hand, has had to focus on the narrative whenever he plays an internal build, so he couldn't really savor the character he really wants to play: Amon, the Forgeknight who plays like an elemental space viking.</p>

<p>"I knew from talking to the character designers and constant back-and-forth meetings about this, they're like, 'Oh, this character's more technical' so I'm going to have to pay close attention while I'm playing," Winkler said. "So I'm reserving it. This is my treat at the end of the road."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I've been working on <em>Borderlands </em>for over 20 years. I'm starting to get pretty good at it." —Randy Pitchford</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>Crafting the Perfect Endgame</h2>

<p>Historically, the franchise has responded and adjusted well to new player patterns and tastes. Case in point, one of the big changes to <em>Borderlands 4</em>'s Ultimate Vault Hunter mode is the ability to create new characters starting at level 30 once you beat the campaign.</p>

<p>"We have actual telemetry that kind of informs us that look, for a lot of players that complete the main game, the deterrent from trying other characters is starting over," Pitchford said. "And starting them with an endgame-viable baseline can let them explore more."</p>

<p>"And respects their time," Winkler added.</p>

<p>Of course, getting to max level is a whole other ball game. Pitchford cautiously said that on average, there's likely more play time getting to level 50 than there is getting to level 30. Though of course, that depends on what you do to gather XP.</p>



<p>The biggest change for endgame this time around, however, is their internal approach. From the start, Creative Director Graeme Timmins has kept the endgame in mind, specifically because he's always been the one to work on it post-launch for other <em>Borderlands </em>games.</p>

<p>"If you want the kitchen to be clean, you get the guy that has to clean up the mess to manage the kitchen while it's cooking," Pitchford said.</p>

<p>He also admitted that yes, previous iterations have taken some wild swings for the endgame, but with iteration comes increased precision, taking them closer and closer to a bullseye. This time around, the key focus is riding that thin line between ensuring gear is always viable while there's always another piece out there that's a little bit better.</p>

<p>"We used to kind of invalidate loot a lot, and I think it's better to not invalidate loot but to not kill the loot chase," Pitchford said. "So we had to design it so that you can have both living almost paradoxically on top of each other."</p>

<p>Another big part of the endgame that Pitchford and Winkler were excited about was the proficiency system, which introduces more reasons to continue playing after rolling credits. There are challenges involved that keeps things interesting, like killing a certain number of enemies or a more difficult iteration of an enemy.</p>

<p>"Tying some of the progression in the endgame to specific challenges to me makes the hunt more interesting than just 'number go up,'" Winkler said.</p>

<p>"You have completionist mindset and progression mindset working together, which is really kind of a fun kind of psychology," Pitchford added.</p>



<h2>Player Feedback &amp; Gameplay Data</h2>

<p>There are two big factors that Gearbox considers as they iterate on their games: player feedback and gameplay data. The folks at Gearbox have a good finger on the pulse of their community—though admittedly, the community does make it easy.</p>

<p>"One thing that we can count on from our audience is they're not going to hold back," Pitchford said. "If they have opinions, we will hear about them. But we love them."</p>

<p>Winkler said that with modern game development, launch is often just the start of things, as that opens the door to the biggest QA session they'll ever have. In this case, it's all about the data they get on the back end while players, well, do their thing.</p>

<p>"They're going to break our shit," Pitchford said.</p>

<p>"Exactly," Winkler responded. "And we can respond super fast. We get instant feedback and we can make it as good as possible because we've got people like Graeme and Grant [Kao, Associate Creative Director]."</p>



<p>By analyzing the telemetry, like they did for determining the need for endgame-viable new characters, the studio can see what needs fixing, tweaking, and updating. It's a lot of data to sift through, but with all those data points, it's easy to see what's breaking the game and what's breaking the player.</p>

<p>"When we have millions and millions of players playing the game—let's say there's 5 million people playing—that 1% of god-roll player, well guess what? That's now 50,000 people that are just fucking crushing because they got the shit," Pitchford said. " t's really wild how the edge cases are massive numbers of people when you have the game launch at the scale."</p>

<h2>Crafting a New DLC Vault Hunter</h2>

<p>Just last week, the team confirmed that it's working on a new DLC Vault Hunter for <em>Borderlands 4</em>. It's a shift from their 4-character strategy for <em>Borderlands 3</em>. which was primarily driven by data showing that players mainly stuck with one character.</p>

<p>Of course, the level 30 starting point seems like the new way to combat that barrier while satisfying the huge demand for DLC characters. After the popularity of Gaige and Krieg from <em>Borderlands 2</em>, it's no surprise that people are clamoring for more.</p>



<p>"One of the reasons why I think both Krieg and Gaige went well is because we didn't have the same stakes for them that we had for the main characters," Pitchford said. "We could actually fuck around. Krieg would never work as a main playable, because the gameplay style is so weird. But because it's so weird and interesting, it kind of resonates."</p>

<p>There's a lot that goes into a new Vault Hunter. They need to be relatable, have a worthy backstory, look exciting, play well—in other words, they need to be iconic. It's a lot of pressure, especially with Gaige and Krieg setting the bar high. But Pitchford is confident that he and his team have found something good with this upcoming character.</p>

<p>"There's a certain point where—and that's when you kind of know it's going to work—where the character stops being this thing we're making. And then the character is like, it's there now. Now it's telling us what it's going to do and who it needs to be," Pitchford said.</p>



<p>"I'm feeling the genesis of it, and I'm really kind of pumped about it. I love that moment when it shifts from being the thing that we're trying to make to oh, now it's got a life of its own. It's going to tell us what it's going to feel and say and do. I love that."</p>

<p>For Winkler, who oversees a lot of the scripts for these characters, that magical moment happens when the voice actor nails what that character should sound like.</p>

<p>"For me, it's the moment where we get the actor in the booth, and it's like, OK, this could work on a page or at a table read. And then someone spins my fucking flack into gold and goes, oh, there it is. And now I get to go back and rewrite all this stuff because I've got the voice in my head."</p>

              <p>In a world where (almost) everything exists online, it’s more important than ever to keep your privacy secure: That’s where a VPN (or <em>Virtual Private Network</em>) comes in. <strong>It’s your own personal internet bodyguard</strong>: It keeps your data under lock and key and your online behavior hidden from hackers, trackers and even your internet company. Of all the VPNs available, NordVPN is the world’s top service.</p> <p>NordVPN has a few very cheap plans that are really good: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/"><em>Basic</em> plan only costs around $3.09 per month (down from $11,59 per month) if you subscribe for two years</a>. f you want something with a bit more bells and whistles, the Plus package is the most popular choice: It’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/">about $3.99 monthly (down from $14.99) with the same two-year subscription</a> and comes with some handy add-ons that are nice to have if you want to get the most out of your VPN experience. Both of them are <strong>73% off the original price</strong> right now.</p> <p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordVPN</a></p> <h2>Safe and Secure Connection</h2> <p>NordVPN <strong>makes your connection very safe with military-grade encryption</strong>&nbsp;so your data is encrypted and no one can view it. And <strong>they don’t keep logs</strong> so your browsing history stays just that – yours, and not on their servers or tracked. If you require an extra level of protection, NordVPN offers a Double VPN feature that routes your connection through two servers for double encryption.</p>

 <p>The Plus plan adds even more protection in its Threat Protection Pro (similar to an antivirus software) which prevents annoying ads, trackers and malware that slow you down or invade your privacy. It also has NordPass which is a decent password manager (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-password-managers" target="_blank" rel="false noopener">check out Gizmodo’s list here</a>) that helps you store and keep your passwords safe so you don’t have to remember them. And if you worry about how many devices you can protect, <strong>NordVPN’s got you set with up to 10 simultaneous connections</strong>.</p> <p>Speed also matters when you go for a VPN, isn’t it? With <strong>over 7,000 servers spread across more than 120 sites worldwide</strong>, NordVPN gives you fast and reliable connectivity wherever you go. This makes streaming and gaming smooth and uninterrupted. You will not need to suffer from lags or buffering.</p>

 <p>If you’re still not convinced, no problem: <span><strong>NordVPN has a 30-day money-back guarantee</strong></span>. Try it, test it out with no obligation. If you don’t enjoy it, simply get your money back.</p> <p>And if you want to save even more or be able to customize your protection, NordVPN has other options too—from Basic to Complete and Prime—that give you options with additional features like encrypted cloud storage and identity theft protection. But in the end, for great privacy and security at a cost that won’t hurt the budget, NordVPN’s Basic (and Plus) plan is where it’s at.</p> <p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordVPN</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The announcement of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-global-release-times-confirmed">Hollow Knight: Silksong’s release date</a> of September 4, 2025, delivered in a brief trailer two weeks ago, was amazing, celebratory news for Silksong fans who had been waiting for such news for over six years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it was a far less celebratory day for the developers of around 10 other video games with existing marketing plans to launch right around that same time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the ensuing weeks, the list of games that have moved their release dates for Silksong has only grown longer as developers reconfigure marketing plans and find new dates that work. As of this piece’s publication, that list includes Demonschool, Aeterna Lucis, Little Witch in the Woods, CloverPit, Megabonk, Baby Steps, Faeland, Starbirds, and Moros Protocol. Even <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2837590/view/534359257319997765" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Stomp and the Sword of Miracles</u></a>, an indie game with no release date plans anywhere in sight, elected to delay its Kickstarter launch and demo release due to Silksong.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But is it actually the right decision to move a smaller game out of the way of a bigger one? What if your small game is so different from the big game that you could stand to set up a Barbenheimer situation? What if GTA 6 stealth launches tomorrow?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both GTA and Silksong have prompted plenty of discussion this year about what devs can and should do when their game suddenly shares a release date with a juggernaut. So I asked a couple of experts about the thought process behind setting and moving release dates, and what they think the right choice is when GTA 6, Silksong, or another marketing monster drops into your launch window unexpectedly.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Delay?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Just deciding on a video game’s release date in the first place can be one heck of a puzzle, I’m told. The game has to be ready, for starters, it has to be able to make it through the complex platform certification process. You have to make sure, if you’re a publisher with multiple games, that none of those games are stepping on one another’s toes. You want to avoid seasonal sales on storefronts like Steam, because you won’t get visibility during that time. You want to speak with platform partners to ensure the time makes sense for them. And you have to deal with all sorts of other factors: maybe a developer is going on vacation a week you want to release and need them to be there for bug fixes. Maybe someone on the team is getting married. Maybe the developer just really likes Tuesdays!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So with all that work put into just finding a date in the first place, moving to an entirely different date sounds like a terrible idea, right? Well, Adam Lieb says it often is. Lieb is the CEO of marketing platform Gamesight. A big part of Lieb’s job is to work together with developers and publishers to plan marketing around their games, and he tells me he’s worked on over a thousand different games in the last five years, largely on PC and console.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong Release Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which all means that Lieb, as a part of his job, makes recommendations on when publishers and developers should release their games. And while there are many factors to consider, including competition, Lieb says he doesn’t always advise devs to delay if a big game appears in their existing launch window. Why? Simply put, delays are expensive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The most boring business reason is that every day your game is ready to launch, and you don't launch it, it's costing you money,” he says. “The game is ready. You could be generating revenue on that game… If it's going to be the difference between game success and failure, of course you should always do it, but when that's not the case, you're just talking about wasting a bunch of costs that you shouldn't be spending to push something like three months.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But pure cost isn’t the only reason Lieb doesn’t always advise moving games. He tells me that a lot of the conventional wisdom for why someone might move a game out of another game’s launch window doesn’t apply in every case. For instance, is it a good idea to release an indie platformer shortly after Silksong comes out? You’d think it’s not, but Lieb proposes something different:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you have an indie platformer, a great time to launch it is probably, I don't know, two to six weeks after Silksong comes out. You've got probably a brand new audience that's playing that style game either for the first time, because it's a huge game, or they haven't played it in a long time, or it's their favorite genre, it doesn't really matter. You've got more people playing indie platformers during that time. [Silksong] probably doesn't have a thousand hours of content. People are going to play it for 20 to 40 hours, or something like that. Then they're going to be looking for the next game to play. So, if you have a game that is in the same space, you actually do kind of want to be around their launch window, maybe even before.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As an example, Lieb mentions the original Splitgate, which he recalls came out right before a big Halo update and benefitted from Halo fans excited about the update and wanting to play something like it right away. We also discuss The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered’s shadow-drop earlier this year, and its launch extremely close to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Both games are RPGs, yet both sold well — perhaps, Lieb suggests, in part because excitement for one fed directly into interest in the other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Analyzing those close comparisons is another big part of Lieb’s job. When working with a game, he looks at data to determine what other games players “index” for, so that developers can avoid competition or, alternatively, play off interest. For instance, if Gamesight was working on Borderlands 4 (hypothetically — Lieb and I did not discuss this particular game at all), he might look at what games players of Borderlands 3 also played around the same time, and then advise Gearbox to steer clear of any sequels or similar releases with Borderlands 4. And sometimes, games that index high are not what you’d expect, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood"><u>Palworld players indexing highly for Helldivers 2</u></a>, or are driven more by content creator trends than similar genres or gameplay or anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Lies of P did so much better in the post-Elden Ring world because there was this huge influx of Souls players, and then they came off of it, it was almost like a warm audience, and then there's a new game in the genre,” Lieb shares as an example. “People were hungry for more of that type of game, and then that type of game appears, and it was actually great for them.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Getting Out of the Way, and Getting Over It</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Lieb provides me with compelling reasons why delaying a game may not always be the best idea, even if GTA 6 is approaching rapidly in your rear view mirror. But Nigel Lowrie, co-founder of Devolver Digital, which is publishing Silksong-delayed Baby Steps, had a more breezy take on delaying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lowrie says he walked into 2025 fully prepared to delay Baby Steps or whatever else if he needed to; GTA in particular was “blinding” as he looked at the calendar ahead — at least until it was delayed to 2026. And Silksong wasn’t the only indie game of concern, either. He was wary of Deltarune, and continues to keep an eye on ConcernedApe’s The Haunted Chocolatier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Silksong, he continues, was different. Silksong trended on social media during publisher showcases it wasn’t even in. He calls it a “cultural moment,” saying that the marketing itself is effectively part of the experience of the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“People do enjoy Death Stranding 2,” Lowrie says. “But people spent probably more time or just as much time engaging with the marketing and promotion of Death Stranding 2 than they did [playing Death Stranding 2.]  And there's that sense of, that's part of the experience in a lot of ways. We'd likened it to Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones was this cultural moment and everyone watched Game of Thrones for an hour every week or whatever when it was on. But when I look back on my experience, I know my wife and I, we'd get in bed immediately and just speculate about next week. And it sounds silly, but really, we spent a lot of time engaged with that series or these games through speculation, hype, promotion… I'm not saying it's just as fun as playing the actual game, but it is part of the experience. And so you have to be mindful of those kinds of things too, when games reach that level people love talking about it along with actually playing the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the prospect of massive games like Silksong or GTA always ready to disrupt a calendar, Lowrie says he ensures he’s always ready to move a game. So when Silksong’s trailer hit, he chatted with the developers of Baby Steps — Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and Bennett Foddy — to see how they felt. They looked at how many people watched the Silksong trailer or were even just in the queue ahead of time, waiting for it to start. “That many people with a little video that was a minute and a half long, everyone assumed it had to be the release date, that's the only reason it would make that big a stink, and there were like hundreds of thousands of people waiting for it to start and you're like, that's important.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The group came to the conclusion that Baby Steps could move, and so it did. He says he’s seen criticism online from those who think Baby Steps, or other games, should not have moved. But Lowrie says it’s different when it’s your game that your livelihood depends on. “You can't AB test reality,” he says. “Maybe Baby Steps would've just been fine September 8, it could have been. But am I willing to risk this team's livelihood and the future of the game they've worked on for five years to see if they both work out? I'm not. And I also want to listen to what they want, and what they want is to have their own spotlight and I couldn't agree more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And for what it’s worth, Lieb agrees. Though he gave me many reasons not to delay a game, he also acknowledged there were many reasons to delay when GTA 6 or Silksong comes knocking, and the need to be in a media “spotlight” was one of them. There are only so many hours in the day, he says, and if every content creator is covering Silksong or GTA, your game is out of luck. “The day GTA comes out, all you can do is write stories about GTA because that's what people want to read about,” he says. “There might be content creators that love your game, and wish they could play it on launch day, but sorry, dude, can't.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">GTA 6, the juggernaut</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Silksong, both Lowrie and Lieb agree, is a big deal, and unique in the way it’s captured and consumed a massive portion of the gaming audience. But GTA 6, they said, was on another level even further beyond that. “I mean, there are AAA games and then there's AAAA games and I'd argue that Grand Theft Auto is potentially the AAAAA game, it's just bigger than anything else both in the scope and scale of the game and the kind of cultural impact that it has and the attention it demands,” Lowrie says. Lieb’s take is similar: “I would say that GTA for the last year and a half has been a part of almost every conversation around launch dates I have heard.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lieb adds that GTA 6 is so massive it’s impacting release date conversations even in genres far outside of what you’d normally consider GTA competition. “What's funny with GTA is, because we do a lot of genre analysis comparisons because of the RP servers, there ends up being almost every type [of game]. Someone’s built a horror GTA RP server or whatever, so that competes with Silent Hill somehow. And you obviously take that with a little bit of grain of salt, but the scope of that game is so large that it ends up competing with stuff that it otherwise wouldn't. Almost every other game, if you're a shooter, you don't care a lot about other things besides shooters. There are some things you maybe should be slightly cognizant of, but generally if you're a FPS, that's the genre you care about. But GTA has been this little bit of a black cloud that looms kind of over everything. So, that, I think, has caused people to be more hesitant with dates.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is why, both he and Lowrie tell me, so many developers and publishers steered clear of fall 2025 when they thought GTA 6 was releasing then. Once it moved, suddenly that period was safe again, and it filled up with releases. But we should expect everyone to give May 26, 2026 a wide berth. How wide, I ask Lowrie? He doesn’t know exactly just yet, though he says GTA 6’s ability to not need months upon months of aggressive marketing is helpful — none of his games are likely to cross streams with any big GTA 6 gameplay trailers or events. It’s just the release date that’s scary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I ask both of them about a Barbenheimer scenario or, more applicable to video games, a Doom/Animal Crossing scenario. Is there a game that could release alongside GTA 6 and succeed by virtue of being incredibly different? Neither of them are confident it could, and Lieb in particular says it’s a bad idea to risk it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The problem is if you are the head of marketing, head of publishing, whoever's trying to make this decision with the larger team, and you've got to put together a PowerPoint presentation that says our game is launching the same date, everyone's going to be like, ‘You're crazy.’ It doesn't mean that it's a bad idea, it just means it's super high risk, and it's going to be hard to get everyone to be on board, because if you're wrong, and it does blot out the sun, and no one's talking about any other games. No journalists are writing about any other games. No creators are creating content for any other games. And you look back, that's a career-defining bad decision.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6’s date is set now (as far as we know), so hopefully Lowrie and other developers and publishers won’t have to deal with any more surprises on the release date front for a while (at least until The Haunted Chocolatier and Hades 2 v1.0 get dates). But I do finish up by asking Lowrie what he recommends developers do when a massive game suddenly descends upon them, upending all their carefully-laid marketing plans. Lowrie notes that there are so many games coming out now, you’re almost guaranteed to share a release date with <em>someone. </em>And if it’s someone big, he prefers addressing it with both humor, and humility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's cool to know your place in the food chain and embrace it, it's fine. I am very proud of Devolver, but we know that we're not about to go up against juggernaut, GTA 6 or whatever, so just have fun with it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty Movie On the Way from Paramount]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-movie</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-movie-on-the-way-from-paramount.1287375/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paramount has announced that it's working on a live-action&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>movie, and the studio is promising to deliver what it calls "the hallmarks of what fans love about the iconic series".</p>

<p>In a press release, Paramount confirms its intention to make the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>movie, pledging to honor "the brand's rich narrative and distinctive style" and to provide "an authentic and exciting experience for longtime fans and newcomers alike".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't really have many more details than that; Paramount says the movie will be an "unforgettable cinematic event", and we know it'll be live-action, but beyond that, the studio, along with the franchise's publisher Activision, are remaining tight-lipped for now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-movie-casino.jpg?itok=DSDJRxOP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-movie-casino.jpg?itok=g7qXN4QO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>is getting its first movie.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't know, for example, whether Paramount's movie will adapt any of the existing&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games, or whether it'll be an all-new experience. There are also a range of time periods in which&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games are set, so we don't know whether the movie will be a period piece or a more contemporary one.</p>

<p>We can, however, make an educated guess as to why the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>movie exists. Back in October last year, Activision revealed that the series as a whole had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">crossed 500 million units sold</a>, and that most recent release&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>enjoyed the franchise's biggest launch to date.</p>

<p><em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games are, however, also very expensive to make. In January, a report emerged which revealed that 2020's&nbsp;<em>Black Ops Cold War&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballooning-call-of-duty-budgets" rel="nofollow">cost an eye-watering $700 million</a>, which includes its initial release and subsequent live-service content additions.</p>

<p>It's worth bearing in mind that since&nbsp;<em>Black Ops Cold War&nbsp;</em>is five years old, budgets are likely to be even higher now, and so making a movie with Paramount makes sense as a way for Activision to bolster its coffers for future development.</p>




<p>Following on from last year's&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, the next installment in the series,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em>, is due to launch this November. Unlike&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>, it'll be set in the near future, and will also feature co-op play for its campaign.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Summer is over. Sorry, folks. September is here, and even though the season doesn’t technically end until September 22, you and I both know that date is meaningless. Once August ends, I’m swapping my tank tops for flannels, drinking pumpkin spice lattes, and rewatching <em>Over the Garden Wall</em> again. And with summer ending, school is starting—a great time to save on a bunch of tech stuff with all the back-to-school sales. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3877/">Take this student laptop for instance. Normally priced at $1,400, this has dropped by 81%. That brings it under $300 to just $260 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><strong>This student-ready laptop is working with a powerful Intel N150 processor with an integrated graphics card</strong>. This thing won’t be playing <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> with ultra-high settings or anything, but it’s perfectly capable of taking care of basic everyday task a student might need. Things like browsing the web, sending emails, drafting up essays, or building slideshows will be easy-peasy. It comes pre-installed with Window 11 Home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3877/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The laptop’s got 4GB of RAM with 128GB of internal storage. However, it does come with <strong>an extra 128GB in the form of a microSDXC card</strong> generously included. That’s 256GB of workable space.</p>

<h2>Microsoft Office 365 Included</h2>
<p>You also get a full year subscription to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/microsoft-365">Microsoft 365</a>. That includes access to Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and more. Plus with OneDrive, you can get even more storage on the cloud which you’ll be able to access anywhere from your other devices. Forgot to submit your paper, but you’re sitting in class with your laptop back in the dorm? Not a problem. Just pull it up on your phone and send it away.</p>
<p>The anti-glare display stretches across at 14 inches and is capable of a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. You can expand onto a second monitor over either USB-C or HDMI which can support resolutions of up to 4K at 60Hz. In addition to those ports, you get two USB-A ports and an audio jack.</p>



<p>Collaboration is easy with the built-in mic and HD 720p web camera which can record crisp and clear videos.</p>
<p>With a long battery life of up to 11 hours on a single charge, you can keep it running all day. You won’t need to bring your charger with your when taking your laptop out to all your classes for the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3877/">For a limited time, you can save 81% on the HP 14 student laptop</a>. The price is down to just $260 for back-to-school season and it even comes with a year of Microsoft Office 365.</p>

<p>The exec also pointed to the success of the Switch 2 and its moderate price to emphasize his point--though didn't say anything about the potential for a Switch 2 port for Wilds.</p><p>Tsujimoto is speaking mainly in the context of the Japanese market, where the cost of buying a PS5, including peripherals and subscriptions, comes close to 100,000 yen (around $670 USD). This price point is not easily reachable for young people, Tsujimoto says, adding that this is true in international markets as well as Japan.</p><p>By contrast, he mentions that the response to the Switch 2 was "better than we had expected" at 49,980 yen (around $335 USD), saying that this "reaffirmed the high level of cost-consciousness among ordinary consumers."</p><p>After its strong first month, sales for Monster Hunter Wilds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-expansion-is-coming-sooner-than-expected-after-suffering-underwhelming-sales/1100-6533593/" data-ref-id="1100-6533593">fell off dramatically</a>, with Capcom reporting only 477,000 copies sold between April 1 and June 30. While the cost of the PS5 may be a factor, the game has also suffered from performance issues, most <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-problems-will-be-addressed-in-an-update-this-winter/1100-6534077/" data-ref-id="1100-6534077">heavily impacting PC players</a>.</p><p>Despite the steep decline, Monster Hunter Wilds is still far from a flop sales-wise--as of August 2, Monster Hunter Wilds was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">best-selling game of 2025</a> in the US.

The driver is set to roll out between now and October 2, and will allow users to adjust settings and update their devices on PC without having to connect to a PS5.</p><p>The new PS Link driver will add a quick menu that's accessible from the system tray or by pressing the PS Link button three times on the device itself. The menu allows users to adjust audio settings for the Pulse Elite or Pulse Explore, and it shows the battery level and notifies users if a new firmware update is available.</p>

<p>With the driver installed, users can also update firmware for either audio device or for the PS Link dongle directly from the PC. The Elite and Explore will need to be directly connected to the PC via USB cable in order to update firmware.</p><p>PS Link is Sony's proprietary wireless audio technology, promising high-quality lossless audio with reduced latency. The wireless tech is separate from Bluetooth, meaning you can use a separate Bluetooth connection at the same time as the PS Link devices. Currently PS Link is only used for the Pulse Elite and Pulse Explore headsets, and as such, the driver is only relevant to these devices--Sony reminds users that the PlayStation Accessories app is the go-to for other wireless PS5 accessories such as the DualSense range of controllers.</p><p>The PS Link driver should install automatically when you plug the USB device into your PC, however the driver is rolling out over time, so there's a chance it might not be ready yet. If the driver doesn't install for you straight away, Sony recommends trying later, with the rollout period running until October 2.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s myriad layers to the first person shooter genre, from slick sci-fi arcade blast ’em ups and boomer shooters, to realistic and not-so-realistic war shooters, and the tense, slow-paced tactical SWAT action. There’s something for everyone… almost. Because while many have been overjoyed with what EA are producing with Battlefield 6, there’s always a few comments on trailers and posts wishing and dreaming for a return to the Vietnam War. Those prayers are going to be answered, in part, by Hell Let Loose: Vietnam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell Let Loose: Vietnam | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JzYzYNVWZ_A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Hell Let Loose and Battlefield might have their similarities on paper –&nbsp;they’re both large-scale multiplayer shooters that rely on squad dynamics, classes, and vehicles –&nbsp;they are strikingly different in a lot of ways. Battlefield aims to be all action, all the time, to bring you those “Battlefield moments”, but Hell Let Loose takes a more realistic approach with a more defined command structure, bespoke squads for different roles, a real need for more communication to succeed, and a TTK that forces you to be much more cautious.</p>


<p>Applying that to the Vietnam War is quite fascinating, especially given the vast disparity in military technology and battle tactics that the United States and North Vietnamese armies employed. For many –&nbsp;myself included –&nbsp;the bulk of our understanding of this war comes from Hollywood, which, while films often sought to protest by showing the horrors of war, the excess of violence and unimaginable destruction of napalm bombing runs, the NVA are often reduced to being surprise ambushers shredding the jungle foliage around American soldiers on the big screen.</p>


<p>So, Expression Games is having to embrace the major differences between these two sides of this war in a lot of ways. Perhaps the most notable difference will be in how you can quickly get around the map. For the Americans, the use of helicopters was huge for navigating the difficult jungle terrain quickly, bringing supplies, soldiers and medical assistance to wherever it was needed. That’s found in Hell Let Loose: Vietnam by making helicopters a flyable vehicle for this side.</p>
<p>On the other side, the NVA can build and create tunnel networks to aid their own rapid traversal. This was described to me as officers being able to plant and connect tunnel entrances and exits around the map, giving faster, but still not instant movement between points for their team –&nbsp;time taken will depend on the distance being travelled. Naturally, the US will want to try and limit this sprawl of tunnels, and finding an exit means that this can be destroyed and, if it’s at a midpoint of a tunnel, potentially make a whole tunnel unusable. You’ll need to listen keenly for the audible cues to try and find them.</p>
<p>Given the terrain, another new addition comes in the form of speed boats to navigate the river networks, for both the US and the NVA, though the six maps promise plenty of variety drawn from the Vietnamese landscape, and taking inspiration from moments in the war such as Operation Starlite and Operation Piranha in late 1965.</p>

<p>The war will rage between the two sides, each with 50 players, and just like in the first game, there will be bespoke squad types, sizes and roles within them. A new addition for Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is the mortar squad, taking on much of the role that calling in an artillery strike did in WW2, with smaller 3-player mortar squads able to bombard defences –&nbsp;a smoke trail will be the giveaway for the firing location, so you’ll want to keep on the move. It will, of course, build up to being able to call in napalm strikes for the US, but the Viet Cong do have their own aircraft and can have less spectacular bombing runs called in as well.</p>
<p>This game marks a major jump forward for Expression Games. For one thing, they’ve now made the jump to Unreal Engine 5 for this game, and they’re planning to launch simultaneously across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC this time –&nbsp;cross-play will be split between PC stores playing together and consoles playing together. Not only that, but there won’t be an early access stage before a full release, albeit with some beta tests expected in the run up.</p>
<p>Most significantly, Expression Games feels that they’ve grown enough that Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will not fully supplant the original game. The studio is large enough now that Hell Let Loose will still be supported with content and patches going forward, alongside Vietnam.</p>

<p>While fans of the WW2 original might think that Expression could have moved to the War in the Pacific for similarly themed style of war, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is the bigger dose of wish fulfilment for war gaming fans. Arguably it is the more difficult conflict to adapt as well, but the team’s plans for how to balance the massively different battle tactics, technology and destructive options might seem to have a great grasp of how to manage this.</p>

<figure><a title="FF Tactics" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c88ce0310fb7/ff-tactics.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>After 28 long years, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/final_fantasy_tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> is finally getting the remaster it (hopefully) deserves when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Ivalice Chronicles</a> launches on Switch on <strong>30th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>According to director Kazutoyo Maehiro, however, development on the upcoming remaster wasn't entirely smooth-sailing thanks to one key issue: the original source code was essentially lost. Speaking at a panel during PAX West (thanks, <a href="https://www.thepopverse.com/gaming-final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chronicles-source-code-lost-pax-west-2025">Popverse</a>), Maehiro explained that when the original PS1 title was released in various regions outside of Japan, the original code was overwritten multiple times.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hxpnts&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We would basically take that data from the Japanese version and overwrite the English data on it, and when we wanted to do another language, we would keep just stacking on top and overwriting and overwriting."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So to try and find the original source code, the developers had to mine their way through the various versions and essentially pick out bits that they thought were tied to the original. In addition, the team even relied on fan websites to provide some of the necessary data, with Maehiro stating that they "do such a good job of keeping all of that up to date".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So we kind of went on a journey to find the original version, and we were using whatever resources we had available to us, so all those different versions would be analysing what was there to try to find what we felt was the original.</p>
<p>"On top of that, we actually had to go to different websites made by fans and look for data there, because we know you guys do such a good job of keeping all of that up to date."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey, whatever works, right? There have been multiple instances in which games' sources codes have been lost or unpreserved, perhaps most notably when Konami attempted to revive <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/silent_hill_3">3</a> as <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/silent_hill_hd_collection">HD ports</a> for the Xbox 360 and PS3. Developer Hijinx Studios had to work with an incomplete code, thus resulting in development issues and glaring technical oversights in the final product.</p>
<p>So it's good that Square Enix has actually gone out of its way to ensure it could work with the most authentic, original source code when developing The Ivalice Chronicles. Hopefully it will result in a faithful homage to the PS1 title, and we can't wait to check it out properly later this month.</p>
<p>Maehiro has also implied that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/strong-final-fantasy-tactics-sales-may-lead-to-more-remasters-and-sequels">more remasters and sequels could be looked at</a> should The Ivalice Chronicles perform well at launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Much like the most <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/">recent entries in the series</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is not going to leave the last generation of consoles behind, nor will it skip the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">X</a>, known Capcom leaker Dusk Golem commented on the ninth entry in the popular series launching early next year, saying that it should also release on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, corroborating other rumors circulating online. As for the timing, it's not yet known if these two unannounced versions of the game will launch at the same time as the PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S versions and how they will compare to them, as the insider speculates it will be a different version of the game with different tech behind it.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/3) I won't be at around the bush, Resident Evil Requiem should be releasing in PlayStation 4 &amp; Nintendo Switch 2, seems this was kinda' known behind the scenes &amp; in the grapevine. I'm not the first person to say this publicly actually, just corroborating. Talked about it with</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963020567076077587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Commenting further on Resident Evil Requiem, Dusk Golem touched upon some of the technical aspects of the game, saying that they expect the game will be optimized and polished in the vein of the Resident Evil 4 remake. The developers of Requiem are likely being helped by the team behind previous entries in the series, who have a lot of PC experience, and are taking the time to focus on optimization and polish. Not featuring an open-world setting like Monster Hunter Wilds is also going to ensure the RE Engine will handle the experience well. Hopefully, this will indeed be the case, as some recent games powered by the RE Engine, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, left a lot to be desired in terms of performance and optimization on all platforms, although they were open-world games that offered something different than what the survival horror series usually does.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">RE4R over Wilds for certain. Resident Evil Requiem I think is helped the team behind RE games have a lot of PC experience, don't need a full open world, &amp; I think they took time to focus on optimizing &amp; polishing the game, alongside reworking a few areas. <a href="https://t.co/KewUKQEf2T">https://t.co/KewUKQEf2T</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963195557947588740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Besides commenting on Resident Evil Requiem, Dusk Golem also talked about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-zero-remakes-ambitious/">Resident Evil 0 remake</a>, which is one of the remakes of previous entries in the series to be in the works. Much like the ninth entry in the series, this remake was initially meant to be out by now, but both received internal delays. Last year, the development of the 0 remake was rebooted while changing hands, much like it happened for the Resident Evil 4 remake, so it may be a while until we will see this remake for the first time.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>(1/2) Originally, Zero Remake &amp; Resident Evil Requiem were meant to be out by now. But both received internal delays, Zero received a form of reboot &amp; changed hands in who's working on it late last year.</p><p>Keep in mind various scopes of reboots are common in this series, not <a href="https://t.co/oFfWwEMyrc">https://t.co/oFfWwEMyrc</a></p></div>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963188874697687188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Considering how CAPCOM believes the high price of current-generation consoles is impacting sales of their games, it wouldn't be surprising for Resident Evil Requiem to launch on PlayStation 4 as well. Hopefully, being a cross-gen release won't impact the experience a lot, and from what I experienced during Gamescom, it definitely looks like it hasn't in any significant fashion.</p>

            <p>Shams Jorjani, boss of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead, has taken to Discord to address the rise in reports of performance issues following the arrival of the shooter's Into the Unjust update. In addition to admitting that the new addition has missed the mark from a stability pespective, the exec added that the game's Xbox release now being in the rear view mirror should free up more resources to tackle performance problems.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/out-very-soon-helldivers-2s-giant-terminid-caving-update-is-a-feast-of-nods-to-aliens-and-dune-plus-dragons">Terminid spelunking expedition-themed update</a> arrived yesterday, players have cited an uptick in crashes that Arrowhead are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-into-the-unjust-update-has-caused-an-uptick-in-crashes-and-arrowhead-are-working-to-isolate-fixes">already looking into</a>, with the installation size the game's ballooned to on PC and your usual sorts of pesky bugs also being sources of ire, at least among vocal online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In light of that, Arrowhead CEO Jorjani made one of his fairly regular trips to Helldivers 2's Discord server last night, to address some of the concerns folks there were raising. "Performance is something we’ve talked about a TON today. It’s not good enough," he admitted <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1412463875068133376">fairly early on</a>. "A fix for some of the most immediate things is being prepped."</p>
<p>"Nobody is saying 'this is fine' at Arrowhead or PlayStation," he added an a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1206861061043527710/1412555284089671740">separate post</a>. "We are talking about what to do differently - cus we really want to release content AND keep performance in line. With [the] Xbox release behind us more resources will be available." Jorjani made the last point a number of times, when discussing fixes for performance issues that've drawn ire from players on and off for a while, but have come to a head with this update.</p><p>The update isn't the root cause of the issues. Instead, the CEO links them to a build-up of engine-related limitations he calls "technical debt". "The technical debt is crippling," he wrote in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1206861061043527710/1412560709145071669">another</a> of these many posts. "With the Xbox release behind us we'll be able to take a much better stab at it. Like a double stab with a bigger knife."</p>
<p>Jorjani reckons a single massive performance-focused update - something <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1412550041654001725">he said</a> Arrowhead would "prefer not to have to do", but will if it's "needed" - wouldn't be enough to tackle all of this tech debt. He also suggested that pulling all the game's developers off of creating new additions, like warbonds, and putting them onto fixes isn't the simple solution it might seem, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1206861061043527710/1412557539530510399">writing</a>: "if we could put every single soul on just performance/stability and significantly improve those we would - but not everyone can make an impact on performance and the issues that need to be fixed are complex and take time to work at."</p>
<p>I didn't run into any major issues while dipping my toe into the update last night, but here's hoping Arrowhead can offer some performance relief soon. For now, their CEO doesn't reckon this uptick in player dissatisfaction has put the shooter back in as dire straits as it found itself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-emerge-with-a-bullet-pointed-peace-offering-to-pacify-mutinous-helldivers-2-players">following the Escalation of Freedom update last year</a>. The studio ended up unveiling a 60-day plan of tweaks, in an effort to turn around player sentiment back then.</p>
<p>While acknowledging there are "definitely some similarities" between the two situations, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1206861061043527710/1412555636767723541">Jorjani argued</a> that this time it at least isn't a double whammy of player frustrations about how the game plays mechanic-wise and how it runs. "Since then, I think it's safe to say we've fixed one thing and kept wobbling on the other," he wrote. "I hope we proved back then that we won't give up till we get it right."</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dawnwalker">The Blood of the Dawnwalker</a> is the debut fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from new Polish developer Rebel Wolves, a studio founded by former members of Witcher outfit CD Projekt. In June, obvious vampire thrall Mark <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-former-witcher-3-devs-vampire-rpg-shows-off-a-guy-being-blood-explosioned-by-a-flying-old-lady">expressed happy emotions</a> about main character Coen's balance of mortal and undead abilities - by day, he'll trot around having regular human chinwags with people and participating in regular human swordfights, by night he transmogrifies into a nimble Nosferatu, able to teleport and slash people with his talons. Now, it's time to dig further into the game's two critical resources, which are handily encapsulated by the title: time and blood.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The game revolves around a 30-day, 30-night quest to rescue your family from some bastard vampire lord's castle. Time doesn't tick down continuously, however, as in the likes of The Legend Of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Instead, each day-night cycle is broken into eight periods, represented by a bar. Within each period, you're free to explore and carry out less significant tasks without advancing the clock. The world is frozen, however lively it may appear: burning houses will flake and fizzle away indefinitely without collapsing into ash. Actions marked with an hourglass option, however, bring that period to an end and shuffle you onto the next.

<p>
"We were thinking that if time would flow naturally, it might be quite unpleasant. The playstyle would change on the go [from human to vampire and back to human] constantly without your input," creative director Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-interview-killing-time-and-major-npcs-in-ex-cdpr-devs-new-rpg">IGN</a> in a recent interview. "So that's where the time as a resource idea came in."

The other thing to know is that the sequence of tasks, events and objectives is strongly player-led. You can rock up to the aforesaid castle and pick a fight with Vlad The Endgamer after completing the prologue, if you choose, though you'll be poorly equipped to prevail. The majority of other goals appear to be optional. You can even skip the daytime periods entirely if you dislike mingling with the human cattle. The game doesn't end following the resolution of the business with your loved ones, and it's possible this won't prove to be the most important part of the tale.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of human cattle, Dawnwalker also lets you get your fangs into NPCs, including significant story characters. The more necks you suck, and the more general mayhem you cause, the more Notorious you'll be. The world reacts to high notoriety in ways familiar from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> games: expect more guards, but also, more opportunities to terrify the smallfolk into doing your bidding.
</p>
<p>
One of the more interesting twists is that you can deprive Coen of blood to nourish his human side, but this may eventually cause him to escape your control. "If you starve Coen, if you don't feed him enough, and if you go into important conversations, he can lose control and just kill off important NPCs," Tomaszkiewicz told IGN. It reminds me of Don't Nod's Vampyr and also, the Dark Urge from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
I like the sound of this skippable, rearrangable and segmented campaign structure. I also quite like the day/night playstyle distinction, though I'd like to know more about Coen's vampire abilities. Not that Blood Of The Dawnwalker is exclusively about vampires. Rebel Wolves are already teasing future games in the world, with Tomaszkiewicz telling <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dawnwalker/gamescom-2025-interview">PCGamesN</a> that "in this origin story, we needed the vampires because Coen has this vampire nature, but when we're thinking about the saga, we'll include parts that are not about vampires at all, and are instead about other species."
</p>
<p>
It's out in 2026. Seems like a promising throat-guzzler, if you ask me, but then again I am partial to such things (see bio).

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-changes-strategy-to-boost-sales-slashing-2025-ipads-to-a-new-record-low-price-2000622668</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-changes-strategy-to-boost-sales-slashing-2025-ipads-to-a-new-record-low-price.1287330/</guid>

              <p>Apple does not usually opt for leaving things at full price – basically as though they’re afraid to give discounts. It’s the brand image: high-end gear, high-end prices. Which is why this Amazon deal feels like a surprise: It apparently chose to do things its own way, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3886/">and it’s discounting the 2025 iPad 11-inch (Wi-Fi, 128GB) to a record-low $299 instead of $349</a>. So if you’ve ever thought that Apple deals don’t exist, well… here’s the proof that sometimes lightning does strike. The iPad itself? It’s rocking a <strong>near-perfect 4.8/5 rating</strong> from thousands of customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3886/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful and Affordable Tablet</h2>
<p>This iPad driven by Apple’s A16 chip which is the same fast silicon you usually only see putting iPhones into hyperdrive. Plus, you get 128GB of storage which is perfect for someone who requires space for apps and plenty of files. Add in all-day battery life, and you have a tablet you can easily carry around without concern for where the next power outlet will be.</p>
<p>Apple has put an 11‑inch Liquid Retina display in this iPad which is bright, clear and just nice to look at. Movies are colorful, games come alive on the screen, and sure—if you’re a designer or artist—the detail is great. Plus, the True Tone feature means the display adjusts to the lighting around you, so your eyes don’t feel fried after hours of use.</p>



<p>Now, let’s not forget the cameras: The front has a 12MP camera that’s perfect for FaceTime calls, online classes or Zoom meetings. Throw in Apple’s Center Stage technology and you are still well-framed on camera even when you move a little as you talk. The rear also has a 12MP camera which is handy for document scanning, taking quick shots, or even taking decent-quality video if your phone is out of reach.</p>
<p>With Wi‑Fi 6, uploads and downloads feel way faster and streaming is smoother. No dropped connections when you’re bingeing or working in the cloud. Apple also dumped the old Lightning port and replaced it with USB‑C which is a huge win. That means faster charging, quicker file transfers, and easy pairing with third‑party accessories.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: this isn’t some stripped-down iPad that only lives to tantalize people into buying it. It’s the full 2025 model, with iPadOS preloaded and ready to go, and that’s where things come together. iPadOS has been optimized to really make the most of Apple’s processor, so multitasking is a joy, split‑screen is second nature, and you can actually do actual work on it.</p>
<p>So, let’s be real. The new iPad 11 is $299, its lowest price ever, and it just so happens to be one of the highest-rated tablets on the site. This is a tough bargain to beat if you’re looking for something that can do work, school, and entertainment in one fashionable package. Just hurry up—because with prices like these, stock never lasts long.</p>

			<p>After much <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/">teasing</a>, a Stellar Blade sequel has been confirmed to be in the works.</p>



<p>As reported by Genki_JPN on X, the sequel to the popular action role-playing game originally released on PlayStation 5 last year has been confirmed to be in active development by Shift Up in a new financial report. Details on the game are scarce, but the Korean developer confirmed the second entry in their series will retain the action-packed gameplay of the original while incorporating an expanded universe and improved gameplay. In addition to developing a new entry in the series, the developer is planning to create various works related to the Stellar Blade franchise to expand the IP.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Shift Up say they are currently developing a Stellar Blade sequel that will have an expanded worldview and enhanced gameplay!</p><p>"We are actively pursuing the franchise development of the 'Stellar Blade' IP and are currently developing a sequel to 'Stellar Blade'.</p><p>This sequel will… <a href="https://t.co/zpLoYw0S5s">pic.twitter.com/zpLoYw0S5s</a></p></div>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1963102317886283809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Besides the possibility of a new entry in the series being discussed various times in the past, no one will likely be surprised to learn that the Stellar Blade series will continue, given the fantastic success of the game on both PlayStation 5 and PC. On Steam, in particular, the game became a smashing success right from release, selling 1 million units in three days and becoming the <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-fastest-selling-korean-game-steam/">fastest-selling Korean game</a> on the platform to date. Hopefully, the game will hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-switch-2/">other platforms</a> as well, as it is an action RPG that deserves to be enjoyed by as many players as possible.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PC and PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's glowing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review</a>.</p>

              <p>Nintendo is adding a welcome fifth game to its grown up Mature section of the Nintendo Switch Online on September 4, with the arrival of 1998’s <em>Forsaken 64</em>. The six-degrees shooter is a total classic, and a superb addition to the top-tier version of Nintendo’s subscription service–although you’ll be hard-pressed to work out why it’s still considered an M.</p> <p>In the mid-90s, with the arrival of 3D graphics cards, developers were suddenly handed a whole other axis in which to explore. The stand-out example of this new-found freedom was 1995’s&nbsp;<em>Descent</em>, known as a “six degrees of freedom” game, where you controlled a floating ship that could orientate itself however it wished in 3D spaces. That shooter was created by Parallax Software, a name you might not recognize until I tell you the studio split in two, one half becoming Volition. (The other half became Outrage Entertainment which developed the incredible <em>Descent 3</em>.) So, the developer best known for <em>Saints Row</em> and&nbsp;<em>Red Faction</em> essentially launched a whole new genre, and it was into this that publisher Acclaim Entertainment released <em>Forsaken</em> in 1998.</p> <p>OK, that’s perhaps a somewhat generous way of observing just how derivative Probe Entertainment’s <em>Forsaken</em> was of&nbsp;<em>Descent</em> and its 1996 sequel, but it remains the case that&nbsp;<em>Forsaken</em> was outstanding in its own right. While wantonly lifting weapon types, power-ups and indeed the entire concept of flying a ship through 3D tunnels from its–uh–inspiration, the game became a pioneer of the growing 3D graphics market, and a solid six-degrees shooter in its own right.</p>

  <p>The N64 version of&nbsp;<em>Forsaken</em> came out just a week later, despite being partly developed by a different Acclaim studio, Iguana UK, and even having its own unique version of the storyline. The PC and PlayStation version of the game had you playing as a nefarious rogue attempting to plunder a nuclear-destroyed Earth for its treasures as a get-rich scheme, while <em>Forsaken 64</em> took a more noble interpretation, casting you as someone trying to take down those looters. It plays out the same, but Nintendo players had the moral highground.</p> <p>It’s obviously this version that’s due to arrive on the Nintendo Switch Online subscription service September 4, as part of its higher tier “Expansion Pack.” Except, for reasons that aren’t immediately clear,&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64</em> is to be part of the separate <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Nintendo-64-Nintendo-Classics-Mature-2592474.html">Nintendo 64 – Nintendo Classics: Mature</a> app. That currently hosts&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark</em>,&nbsp;<em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</em>,&nbsp;<em>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shadow Man</em>, all of which were originally released with an M rating in the ’90s. However,&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64</em>‘s rating is a bit more confusing. The game was released with an M rating in the US, both on the box and the cartridge, <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/3485/forsaken-n64/">but despite the ESRB then and now rate the game as a T</a>. There’s some speculation this might be because the game featured a cheat where pressing Z, Down, C-Up, C-Left, C-Left, C-Left, C-Left, C-Down on the Start screen would unlock a Gore Mode, which would easily bump the game up from T to M in those days. If that cheat has been preserved for this release, then Nintendo presumably erred on the side of caution. Although of course this is all made a nonsense given&nbsp;<em>Golden Eye 64</em> remains a T and in the main app! And it all looks so gorgeously innocent and mild some three decades later.</p> <p>This release will support all the original 4-player multiplayer modes, which are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCerd9OfTLY">still super-satisfying today</a>. The only real challenge this faces is being added on the same day&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> comes out.</p>

            <p>Fighting game players are up in arms following news that RTS - a gaming talent agency and owner of the Evo tournament series - has been acquired by the Saudi Arabian mega city project Qiddiya.</p>
<p>This news came yesterday afternoon via an official statement by CSO at Qiddiya Muhannad Aldawood, who wrote on Linkedin: "Excited to share that Qiddiya has acquired full ownership of RTS, a strategic step that will further strengthen our esports business and unlock new opportunities across the broader gaming ecosystem. And most importantly, this will enable Qiddiya to keep fueling the continued growth of Evolution Championship Series (EVO), the world's largest fighting game event since 1996, with unlimited [potential]."</p>
<p>The response online from fighting game community members was largely one of disappointment, as various fans of the genre came out to express sadness at the new owners and emphasised the importance of supporting grassroots community-run events. Saudi Arabia has been criticised by Human Rights organisations for its prolific use of slavery,  the death penalty, and more.</p>

<p>Professional <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> player ChrisCCH, who previously refused a place at the Saudi-owned Esports World Cup, <a href="https://x.com/ChrisCCH_/status/1963035397988221121">wrote on X</a>: "Not terribly surprising, but still unfortunate news. Sad for the LGBTQ+ members of the community, and also worried about the scene becoming increasingly funded by money that will disappear as soon as the funders get bored."</p><p>Sajam, a popular commentator and content creator within the fighting game space, <a href="https://x.com/Sajam/status/1963045416716652659">stated</a>: "I think the news personally just makes me want to think about more ways to create cool stuff for the rest of our community. It feels like the pieces that belong to fighting game fans are shrinking all the time."</p>
<p>With a general distaste around Evo following the news, some have looked to other American alternative events to attend, including CEO. One user on X Roycebracket <a href="https://x.com/roycebracketfgc/status/1962914707955699911">summed up their thoughts</a> with: "CEO is about to become the real evo" while LandedIt took a more humorous approach, writing: "Glory to Alex Jebailey ceo 2026 4 jebaillion entrants".</p>
<p>In response to the news, Evo general manager Rick Thiher posted his own statement: "Everything I have worked on in fighting games has been with the ambition of bringing our communities together. Inclusivity, community, and connectivity matter to me. It’s deeply personal that they remain part of what I work on and that the future of Evo respects that."</p>
<p>Whether or not this uproar on social media actually manifests into a material impact on the future of Evo remains a question mark: there's a big difference between expressing displeasure on Twitter and taking actual action.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/madden-26-review.1287288/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As tick follows tock, runs follow blocks, and the Raiders enter another rebuild phase, we have the yearly arrival of Madden. While there are alternatives out there, rightly or wrongly, it remains the NFL’s premier simulation. Despite some players experiencing burnout after more than forty entries in the franchise, it continues to push, improve, and tailor its experience for modern players and the latest consoles, and this year’s earth-shattering change-up for Madden 26 is that it’s come to the Nintendo Switch 2, making it the first handheld Madden in years.</p>
<p><iframe title="Madden 26 Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EZrgXXHSaBQ?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>More impactful is the fact that Madden 26 on Switch 2 is the same game that PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series gamers are getting. There’s no legacy edition, no simple roster update, and no sense that you’re playing a version of the game from several years ago. This is the full Madden 26 experience, but on the go, and it makes for the most addictive and easily accessible entry we’ve had in a long time.</p>


<p>There’s two absolutely huge time-sinks in Madden 26, and they’re the classic combo of Franchise mode and Ultimate Team. Franchise mode remains the choice for the purist: pick your team, pick your coaching style, and then attempt to wrangle your team all the way to the Super Bowl through multiple years, taking control on the field and in the back office.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of the real-life sport, it’s the mode that makes you feel as though you’re genuinely part of it, and EA have made significant changes to the way Franchise functions in an effort to make it feel more realistic and more involved. Personally, I think they’ve done a great job. You’re in control of your full staff team, and they’ll come to you with suggestions and pointers, giving you a nudge on a player that’s worth trading for, or helping you to evaluate your team’s overall health. Players will also come to you to discuss their position within the team, and you must choose how to motivate them and what you expect from them in their role.</p>


<p>Trading is a little messy, and some of that is because the menu controls aren’t labelled clearly, and they’ve opted for some buttons to take double duty while others, like the shoulder buttons, don’t do anything. There are definitely a few other behind-the-scenes quirks in Madden 26, and you have to hope that someone will notice and make a few changes in a patch, especially for players who are going to spend a lot of time in the menus.</p>
<p>Ultimate Team is the other key draw here. Collect player cards, complete challenges, upgrade your team, and take your team out against other players to see how it fares. Ultimate Team thrusts a lot of stuff at you for free, and if you’re the patient type, you can get away without spending extra money on buying card packs. At least for a while.</p>
<p>Madden Team has a way of insinuating itself into your psyche, and sooner or later – sooner in my case – you’re going to break and spend your real-life money on a bunch of ephemeral player cards with slighter better stats than the ones you own. I do this every year, and since I’ve never got too carried away, I remain perfectly happy with my choices. If you have anything against predatory monetisation, or you’re nursing an addictive personality, perhaps this, and likely all of EA and 2K’s sports games, are not for you.</p>

<p>The Switch 2’s menu performance is nowhere near as snappy as that found on the PS5, and Madden Ultimate Team is where you’ll feel that the most. It’s not diabolical, nor truly off-putting, but it is slower. If you’re the sort that wants to rush through team selection, optimising your cards and opening packs, the Switch 2 is the slowest place to do that. However, you can do that with Switch 2 anywhere you want, assuming you have an internet connection. You can’t take your PS5 on the bus.</p>
<p>The need for an internet connection is something that Madden largely relies on these days, and while you can play Franchise Mode offline, it prevents the EA servers from helping out with any simulations you might be doing, and you’ll be without the live rosters available with the online version. This is a bit fiddly on Switch 2, as an active connection is much less of a guarantee, and I did find myself waiting for everything to sync up a few times when I was waking up the Switch 2 from sleep. Still, this is (disappointingly) nothing new for the franchise or gaming in 2025.</p>
<p>Outside of Ultimate Team and Franchise Mode, there’s also Superstar, which once again lets you create your own character, fight your way through the NFL draft and then build your position and importance in your team. I still like this – who doesn’t enjoy putting themselves in the game, and supplanting Brock Purdy as the lead Quarterback for the 49ers – and you can tailor your player so that he fits exactly with how you think you’d play in real life. You might need a good imagination. There’s more of a documentary feel to Superstar, and Madden 26 as a whole, and I think it’s a great fit, feeling as though you can put more of yourself into the player than ever before.</p>

<p>Performance is going to be the key question mark over the Switch 2 version, and it’s fair to say that Madden 26 plays a competent game of gridiron on the handheld. It’s not the fastest, or the smoothest, but the player models look decent, the animations remain intact, and all of the features you’ll find in the PS5 version are present and correct. Frankly, it’s remarkable and exactly what I was hoping for. After struggling with previous Maddens on my ROG Ally and the non-existent support for Steam Deck’s Linux OS, this is truly the only viable way to play Madden 26 on the go. It’s excellent, and it’s been a long time coming.</p>
<p>There is a gentle caveat to that; there remains the slight shonkiness in the menus and in some of the on-field action that we’ve come to expect from Madden. I genuinely think that this is the best it’s been at launch for a number of years, and none of it truly detracts from the experience, but in an ideal world everything would function perfectly, and all the jank would be gone. Still, the team will undoubtedly continue working on it throughout the season, until we arrive at Madden 27.</p>
<p>I have to talk about the EA Music in Madden 26, if only because it’s one of the best sports game mixes I can remember. The 166 track lineup is all over the shop in terms of genre and timeline, jumping from 50 Cents’ In Da Club through to We Go On by Bia and then The Contract by TwentyOnePilots, before taking a sojourn into rock and metal with Bush’s Machinehead, Electric Callboy’s Elevator Operator and Korn’s Freak on a Leash. Hell, there’s Megadeth, Chappell Roan and Lizzo nestled up against each other. If you’ve got an eclectic taste in music, it’s absolutely spot on. If you don’t, you can turn off all the songs you don’t like.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 Digital Edition hardware revision, reportedly set to launch in Europe soon, will feature a rather critical change that makes the new release effectively feel like yet another price increase for the system.</p>



<p>As reported today by the ever-reliable billbil-kun on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps5-slim-numerique-chassis-e-vers-une-reduction-du-stockage-ssd-60471">Dealabs</a>, the new CFI-2100 console model discovered back in June 2025 via certification documents filed in Japan is set to launch on September 13 in Europe for €499, the current price of the system. The new hardware revision has been created to optimize production costs, something that is reportedly being achieved by including an SSD with a smaller capacity than all the current Digital Edition models, 825 GB instead of 1 TB, a critical change for a system that cannot run physical games without an additional purchase. The new PlayStation 5 Standard Edition hardware revision, on the other hand, will retain the 1 TB SSD when it launches at a later date. The system's packaging will also feature a visible 825 GB label, so it should be easy to distinguish between the current and the next hardware revisions.</p>



<p>Although this new PlayStation 5 Digital Edition hardware revision is being released to avoid another price increase, it effectively feels like one, as those purchasing the system in the future will get less than others did at the same price. This new release comes during a tumultuous time for console gaming, as both <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">Sony</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">Microsoft</a> increased the price of their systems worldwide in the past few months, making this console generation the first one where systems were cheaper at launch, at least on paper. Hopefully, the global economic situation will improve in the future and prevent other price increases, which would be as disastrous for users as for publishers, as some of them, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-high-price-playstation-5/">CAPCOM</a>, believe that the high price of systems is impacting the sales of games.</p>

            <p>Last month, the beloved PlayStation published <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> made its Xbox debut, after months of many asking and developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/getting-helldivers-2-on-xbox-would-need-sony-and-phil-spencer-to-duke-it-out-arrowhead-community-lead-says">Arrowhead joking the move would require "Sony and Phil [Spencer] to duke out" for a port to happen</a>.</p>
<p>And, it seems like this debut has gone down rather well with Xbox players. If you head over to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/browse/top-paid-games?PlayWith=XboxSeriesX%7CS">Xbox website now</a>, you will see that Helldivers 2 is currently listed as the "Top Paid" game on the store.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, according to data from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/augusts-most-downloaded-games-across">Alinea Analytics</a>, Helldivers 2 shifted 926k copies on Xbox six days after its release. To compare, the PlayStation version of Helldivers 2 sold 633k copies six days after its own launch last year.</p>
<p>On the same day that PlayStation's Helldivers 2 arrived on Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-coming-to-playstation">Xbox's Gears of War series also landed on PlayStation</a> thanks to a revamped edition of the original game known as Reloaded.

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has opened up all manner of possibilities for gamers and Nintendo itself. With Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 being one of 2025’s biggest and best games, it would only be fitting if the Switch 2 could welcome the GOTY contender onto the console.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-teases-new-content-and-other-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> could already be 2025’s Game of the Year. That’s how revered and successful it is. It’s the highest-rated release this year, and a wider reach could introduce even more players to its unreal world. While it’s anything but official, a new quote from its developer suggests all hope isn’t lost.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It would look good. Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.nintenderos.com/nintendo-switch-2/sandfall-interactive-esta-explorando-lanzar-clair-obscur-expedition-33-en-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintenderos</a> has reported that Sandfall Interactive isn’t ruling out bringing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to the Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>



<p>“We have some possibilities that we will explore, but at the moment we cannot confirm anything,” was the company’s official response when prompted by Nintederos on a Switch 2 port.</p>



<p>Reports are circulating that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/many-developers-still-dont-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many developers are struggling to get Switch 2 dev kits</a>. This understandably holds back many games and is likely to delay a ton of future third-party ports to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>With Sandfall not ruling out a Clair Obscur Switch 2 crossover, this could be the reason why an announcement is taking so long. We’ll keep you updated on the situation and developments on a future Switch 2 version.</p>



<p>Will you buy Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 if it arrives on Nintendo’s new hardware? Or are you busy and impatiently waiting for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-franchise-sandbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel</a>?
