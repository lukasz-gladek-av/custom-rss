If approved, the acquisition would be one of the most expensive in the history of the video game industry and would make Electronic Arts a privately held company. Given the questionable ownership, the internet is not taking the news well.</span></p> <p><span>The Saudi Arabian government‚Äôs attempts at sportswashing away the stink of its dire human rights laws, as evidenced by its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367"><span>investments in various facets of the video game industry</span></a><span>, are well-documented at this point.

Beyond that, the Saudi Arabian government has been hosting events with industry figureheads like Hideo Kojima.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We may not be getting a handheld Xbox anytime soon, but this will be the next closest thing. Asus has partnered with Microsoft to create an update to the ROG Ally with official-branding for Xbox. The Asus ROG Xbox Ally enters the market as a new competitor to the Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch 2 to be your go-to gaming handheld. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4361/">It‚Äôs set to arrive on October 16 and the pre-order window has just opened up.</a> Head on over to Amazon and reserve yours today for $600.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs talk about the core improvements on this model over the existing Asus ROG Ally. This new model is now powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor and puts to use an all-new streamlined Windows OS. Both will lead to a smoother user experience both in and out of your games.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4361/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Your Gaming Library, Anywhere</h2>
<p>Access your full library of PC games and boot up directly into the new Xbox App UI. Stream Xbox games from either your console or from Microsoft‚Äôs cloud streaming service. The Xbox Game bar can be accessed quickly via the Xbox button on the left side of the handheld. The Asus ROG Xbox Ally also has support for Steam, Epic Games Store and other game stores so you won‚Äôt just be locked into the Xbox architecture.</p>
<p>The gaming handheld comes with 16GB of dual channel RAM along with a 512GB PCle Gen4 M.2 2280 SSD. Storage is upgradable if you wish to download more games than the default capacity allows.</p>



<p>The screen measures in at seven inches across, same as the Steam Deck, and weighs just under 1.5 lbs. ‚Äî almost exactly the same as the Steam Deck on that front too. The display is capable of 1080p HD along with a refresh rate of 120Hz. The redesigned chassis is pulls inspiration from the model Xbox wireless core controllers, employing new contoured grips for better comfort gaming all day long. Choose to play either handheld or hooked up to your TV via the dual USB-C ports.</p>
<p>The Asus ROG Xbox Ally has a 60Wh battery to your game time running long and can recharge fairly quickly. Just have it plugged in for a half hour will get it back up from zero to 50% battery life.</p>
<p>Alongside this model is the upgraded Asus ROG Xbox Ally X which features a more powerful processor, more RAM and a full 1TB SSD, doubling the base model‚Äôs storage capacity. It also comes with an 80Wh battery. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4361/">Unfortunately, most storefronts appear to be sold out on the X model, but you can still pre-order the Asus ROG Xbox Ally for $600 over at Amazon.</a></p>

<p>Silver Lake was part of the consortium involved in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/china-keeps-the-algorithm-critics-attack-trumps-tiktok-deal/">this month's controversial deal</a> to bring Tiktok under the control of US-based companies. Back in 2013, the private investment firm also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/michael-dell-wins-buyout-bid-after-icahn-takes-ball-goes-home/">helped take computer-maker Dell private in a $25 billion deal</a>.</p>
<p>Affinity Partners CEO Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Trump, said in a statement that he has "admired [EA's] ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games ‚Äì and now enjoys them with his kids ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt be more excited about what‚Äôs ahead."</p>
<p>EA first went public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1990, and by 1996 its market cap had risen to $1.61 billion. Last week, the company's valuation was hovering around $43 billion.</p>
<p>EA brought in $7.5 billion in revenue in the 2025 fiscal year (ending March 31) on the strength of franchises including <em>Madden NFL</em>, <em>EA Sports FC</em>, <em>Battlefield</em>, <em>The Sims</em>, <em>Dragon Age</em>, and <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>.</p>

            <p>Heart Machine, the studio behind sci-fi Zelda-like Hyper Light Drifter, has a new metroidvania out next month called Possessor(s).</p>
<p>Publisher Devolver released a new gameplay overview trailer over the weekend revealing its PS5 and PC release date of 11th November.</p>
<p>Possessor(s) is a metroidvania (or "search action" game, as the developers are describing it) set in a quarantined cyberpunk city, with players taking the role of high school student Luca who's struck a deal with a demon.</p>

<p>As with Hyper Light Drifter, the game is visually arresting, here a clean animated aesthetic as Luca explores a cityscape controlled by a corrupt energy megacorporation.</p>
<p>Combat, meanwhile, is inspired by Nintendo's Smash Bros. fighting series. Luca will be able to juggle enemies with aerial attacks, with makeshift weapons ranging from a computer mouse, to a guitar and a pair of sunglasses.</p>
<p>It's looking great, especially if it can live up to the exceptional quality of Hyper Light Drifter, though there's stiff genre competition from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> at the moment.</p>
<p>Still, Heart Machine in January released a surprising miss with its roguelike Hyper Light Breaker that remains in early access, but has a Mixed rating on Steam. It's still being regularly updated, though, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-light-breaker-receives-community-suggested-fixes-as-studio-acknowledges-risk-of-early-access">studio acknowledging the "risk" of early access</a>.</p>

<p>The deal, which is expected to close in Q1 FY 2027, was confirmed earlier today, following a report last week from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAjGI4bh2ChypG-9gaU4qrQZFignKjZm8EjJFqEKJbszfMv0Uyk0spCKAkIGRcw%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68d6e0aa&amp;gaa_sig=Zf9usHKAPLc-xSauIbct6cEJae6QEXZDp84TM7SJsSlbIQtorAg_Hxy8OCUW_MYx6L4o8fLt5FyADejiqmwsQA%3D%3D">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>. The company is most famous for its series of sports titles, <strong>The Sims</strong>, <strong>Battlefield</strong>, and for publishing BioWare's <strong>Dragon Age</strong> and <strong>Mass Effect</strong> series.</p>
<p>Notably, the deal is made up of an equity investment of $36 billion dollars, with a $20 billion dollar debt in EA's name. This, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lzy2ieztws2w">as Schreier puts it</a>, could lead to layoffs, more monetisation, and cost-cutting measures.</p><div><figure data-videoid="zEeK-8I84eI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zEeK-8I84eI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zEeK-8I84eI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zEeK-8I84eI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61cb68kjgyhv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>Andrew Wilson, Chairman &amp; CEO of Electronic Arts has shared this statement on the deal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúOur creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world‚Äôs most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The PIF previously owned 9.9% of the company and was already the third-largest institutional owner of EA. As a reminder, the PIF owns stakes in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/saudi-arabias-pif-further-reduces-its-stake-in-nintendo">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/5percent-of-capcom-acquired-by-saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund">Capcom</a>, Embracer Group, and Take-Two Interactive.</p>
<p>Turqi Alnowaiser, the PIF's Deputy Governor and Head of International Investments, says that ‚ÄúPIF has demonstrated a strong commitment to [global gaming and esports] sectors, and this partnership will help further drive EA‚Äôs long-term growth, while fueling innovation within the industry on a global scale.‚Äù</p>
<p>In terms of the other acquirers, Silver Lake is one of the companies potentially involved with TikTok's US spin-off, while Affinity Partners is the investment firm founded by the current US President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Silent Hill f officially arrived on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this past September 25, 2026, <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/corporate/ja/news/topics/20250929/">and according to Konami, by Sept. 26, 2025</a>, the latest entry in the Silent Hill franchise and the first one to make several big changes such as setting the game in Japan and not in the US for the first time, hit one million copies sold.</p>



<p>One million copies sold in one day is a huge milestone for what is the first new Silent Hill game in years and a continuation of the momentum that Konami was able to kickstart with the help of Bloober Team delivering above and beyond what players expected in the Silent Hill 2 Remake.</p>



<p>It took the Silent Hill 2 Remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-becomes-million-seller/">a week to hit one million copies sold</a>. Konami could have had no better endorsement in the return of its beloved horror series than to see the first brand-new entry hit the same sales milestones as a nostalgia-charged remake six days faster.</p>



<p>"<em>The remake of Silent Hill 2 released last year, surpassed one million units shipped worldwide within a week of its release, but Silent Hill f is growing in shipments at an even faster pace in each</em> <em>region, including Japan</em>," Konami writes in its announcement of the sales milestone.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's good to see one of the videogame industry's most influential series make such a strong return with its last two entries, but more particularly with Silent Hill f simply because it's the first brand-new game because of how many big swings and risks it takes to change things up.</p>



<p>In our review of Silent Hill f, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo wrote</a>, "<em>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for the next major&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>update, and since it'll arrive not long before the spookiest day of the year, you can expect lots of creepy treats to enjoy.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Version 2.3, which will, naturally, follow on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-22-release-date" rel="nofollow">September's Version 2.2</a>, will be arriving on October 15th, bringing three brand new Agents for your team, a new map to explore, and more.</p>

<p>First and foremost, you'll be exploring the brand new Timesworn Hills area, which, as HoYoverse says, is a place where "ghost stories echo through abandoned ruins". You'll be investigating the disappearance of miners in the region, which will lead to the discovery of "unsettling truths".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.3-release-date-spook-shack.jpg?itok=fgIjtAP4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.3-release-date-spook-shack.jpg?itok=R4R73ypu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.3 will have you investigating miners' disappearances alongside the Spook Shack faction.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, you'll also be recruiting new Agents to your cause, starting with Lucia, an S-rank Ether Support Agent who can boost her allies' HP and damage, making her a valuable asset as you explore the Timesworn Hills.</p>

<p>She's joined by Yidhari, an S-Rank Ice Rupture Agent whose damage is boosted as her HP falls. You'll need to strike a balance between risk and safety if you want to maximize her damage potential.</p>

<p>Your final new Agent in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.3 is Komano Manato, an A-Rank Fire Rupture Agent who gains damage as his HP scales. S-Rank Agents Vivian and Ju Fufu will also be available during this update as rerun banners.</p>

<p>You can also expect a new powered-up version of Soldier 0 - Anby, who first debuted during&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-16-march" rel="nofollow">Version 1.6</a>, as well as a new turn-based combat challenge and the return of the Snap! Shining Strike photography event.</p>




<p>News of this latest&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>update comes shortly after HoYoverse announced two brand new free-to-play games being added to its lineup, namely <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima" rel="nofollow">autochess creature-collector&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima" rel="nofollow">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-cozy-life-sim" rel="nofollow">cozy life sim&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em></a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em><a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for free right now</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, as well as mobile devices. Version 2.3 launches on October 15th across all platforms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lots of awesome movies that hit theaters over the summer have finally released to streaming. So if you missed them on the big screen, now‚Äôs your chance to see them on the small-to-medium screen. James Gunn‚Äôs take on<em> Superman&nbsp;</em>starring David Corenswet as the titular super-powered man arrived on HBO Max. There you can also check out Tim Robinson and Paul Rudd‚Äôs painfully awkward, intense, and hilarious <em>Friendship</em>. And Zach Cregger‚Äôs invigorating horror flick <em>Weapons&nbsp;</em>can now be rented from most places that offer digital on-demand. But in order to watch any of these, you‚Äôre gonna need something to stream to ‚Äîsomething like Amazon‚Äôs Fire TV Stick. Right now, you can get one for dirt cheap. These things normally aren‚Äôt too pricey to begin with, starting at $35. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">For a limited time, however, you can snag one for about half price at just $18.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Amazon has upgraded its line of Fire TV Sticks over the years and this is the latest model, albeit, the first in the lineup. It doesn‚Äôt support 4K, and it‚Äôs still stuck back on Wi-Fi 5. While it does only stream in Full HD 1080p, most streaming service charge extra for 4K streaming to a point where they‚Äôre not even worth it. Netflix‚Äôs premium plan is now up to $25 per month. That‚Äôs more than you‚Äôre paying for the Amazon Fire TV Stick and that‚Äôs just for a single month. You‚Äôll likely be streaming most content in regular HD anyway, so in practice, you may not even notice the difference between getting this one or shelling out for the Fire TV Stick 4K.</p>



<h2>Xbox Games Right to Your TV</h2>
<p>One big bonus of the Fire TV Stick is it now supports Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. You no longer need an Xbox console to play Xbox games. Stream games from the cloud like&nbsp;<em>Black Myth Wukong</em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, or even the newly released <em>Borderlands 4</em>. The first two are just part of Game Pass, but the latter does require you to purchase a copy.</p>
<p>If you are intrigued by the prospect of playing Xbox titles directly off the Fire TV Stick, you can consider picking up the unit bundled with a Luna Controller. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4360/">That normally goes for $105, but has also been marked down halfway to just $53</a>. You can also choose to pair a different Bluetooth controller such as the official Xbox core wireless controller. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">Otherwise, just go with the standard Fire TV Stick HD, now only $18.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>was revealed during this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">Xbox summer showcase</a>, and it was an instant highlight of the show for me. It's a mixture of reggae musical, renovation sim, and spooky mystery adventure game, and what's more, it's tiny UK studio Friday Sundae's first title.</p>

<p>I got a chance to sit down with a demo of the game, which showcases a slice of gameplay during which I (partially) renovated a hotel, sojourned down to a creepy abandoned island, and fought off monstrous chair-spider ghosts.</p>

<p>All of that might sound like tremendous fun, and I have faith that with a little extra time, it could be. Unfortunately, the demo I played is in serious need of some extra work before it's ready to open its doors to the public.</p>

<h2><em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>Is Ambitious as Heck</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-renovation.jpg?itok=9gMkHCD2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-renovation.jpg?itok=-kGJaHGy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</em>'s renovation mechanics are simple, but satisfying.</figcaption></figure><p>During my time with&nbsp;<em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</em>'s demo, which lasts around 30 minutes, I got to experience a tasting platter showing off all three of its core pillars. It's a pretty brief demo, and I don't think it necessarily does the full scope of&nbsp;<em>No Ghosts&nbsp;</em>justice.</p>

<p>The renovation mechanics on offer here are...fine. If you're expecting the depth of something like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/house-flipper" rel="nofollow">House Flipper</a>&nbsp;</em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/powerwash-simulator" rel="nofollow"><em>PowerWash Simulator</em></a>, you're likely going to be disappointed; the systems are fairly surface-level, and they don't amount to much more than "point the right gun at the thing".</p>

<p>Still, the feelings of hoovering up loose debris or popping broken pieces of a boat back onto its hull are satisfying, and I can imagine that the areas you'll be expected to renovate will increase in complexity as you progress through the full game.</p>

<p>There's a fun little twist on the renovation mechanics whereby you need to use your house-flippin' tools to right the scenes of memories so they can progress, but again, they're not too much more than just following on-screen instructions.</p>

<p>During this demo, I didn't get much of a chance to explore <i>No Ghosts</i>' gorgeous English seaside setting, but I'm hoping that the full game will offer more incentive to wander the environs of the Grand and uncover hidden secrets. It's hard to say how well exploration and narrative will stack up since the demo is so short.</p>

<p>It's impressive that Friday Sundae is attempting to cram a reggae musical into&nbsp;<em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>as well, but I have to say I'm a little worried about how that element is going to pan out.</p>

<p>This demo offers one brief musical sequence, which admittedly isn't anywhere near enough to express a full opinion, but the character animation feels a little too stilted for singers to express the full range of the songs' emotions.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Friday Sundae's game can capitalize fully on the immense potential of incorporating musical sequences into its exploration-renovation loop, but on the strength of the song snippet presented during this demo, I'm skeptical.</p>


<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-memory.jpg?itok=s3PC3PDZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-memory.jpg?itok=UgQfltwr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I had to restart this section multiple times because of bugs.</figcaption></figure><p>Let's get one thing out of the way first: this is a demo, and it's an early one at that.&nbsp;<em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>is not due to launch until 2026, so Friday Sundae has plenty of time to rid itself of some of the more bothersome bedbugs in its hotel's rooms.</p>

<p>That's a good thing, too, because I encountered no shortage of bugs during my time with this demo. I had to restart chapters multiple times due to game-breaking (demo-breaking?) progress bugs, and the starting position for one chapter restart in particular is halfway through the floor.</p>

<p>Performance-wise, my rig struggled with&nbsp;<em>No Ghosts&nbsp;</em>as well. This is perhaps an even more subjective criticism than any other I've offered so far, but I'm running an RX 9070 XT and a Ryzen 7 9700X (plus 64GB of RAM), which is way above the game's minimum specs.</p>

<p>Despite that, performance was iffy, with lots of slowdown and chugging in scenes that weren't even particularly busy. Not only that, but some sections stuttered and froze up for several seconds, and while they always righted themselves in the end, I constantly worried each hitch would be the point at which the demo crashed.</p>

<p>I couldn't find a way to change the graphical options beyond resolution upscaling, and changing those options didn't seem to alter performance for me at all. Again, though, I should stress that there's every chance you won't experience these issues. We all know how mercurial PC gaming can be.</p>

<p>At the end of the demo, Friday Sundae sets up an exciting escape sequence, and my support character yelled at me that there was no way I could take all of the things chasing me, so I should just "leg it", in his words (a colloquialism I appreciated seeing as a Brit).</p>

<p>However, when I then dispatched every enemy chasing me with relative ease,&nbsp;<em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>didn't seem to know what to do, so it just kind of didn't do anything for a while before a title drop anticlimactically brought the demo to a close.</p>

<p>It was a funny moment, sure, but it also made me worried about <i>No Ghosts</i>' future. Yes, there's still lots of time for Friday Sundae to fix it, but I'm not sure this demo was ready for release, at least not in my eyes. This one's going to need a lot more time in the oven.</p>

<h2><em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-petting.jpg?itok=PQaRA2Oy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-petting.jpg?itok=--oLLint 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The cat is very, very cute.</figcaption></figure><p>I'm really rooting for Friday Sundae and&nbsp;<em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</em>. The genre mixture on offer here is so unique and so mad that I want nothing more than for this game to launch and blow me away.</p>

<p>Sadly, on the strength of this demo, I think it's got a very long way to go before it can achieve that. It's messy, janky, and glitchy, so it's safe to say that a lot of renovation is needed before this hotel is ready to admit guests, even for the demo itself.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-sales-1m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-sales-top-1m-outpacing-silent-hill-2-remake.1311427/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, the latest entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>survival horror franchise, has managed to hit a major sales milestone, and it's outpacing the last big release in the series as well.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/corporate/ja/news/topics/20250929/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> (for which we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>sales topped one million within a single day of the game's launch. Naturally, that figure includes both physical sales and digital shipments.</p>

<p>As Konami says in the press release,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>managed to rack up a million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">in its first week</a>, which means that&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>&nbsp;reached the same milestone significantly faster than its predecessor. Konami will doubtless take this as an encouraging sign for the franchise as a whole.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-f-sales-1m-kneeling.jpg?itok=KJEVVgw- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-f-sales-1m-kneeling.jpg?itok=uklUoOrg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The latest&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>game,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, has reached a million sales already.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>went on to pass the two million sales mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">in January this year</a>, and if&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>continues at its current pace, then it won't take the latest title in the series too long to pass its predecessor on that milestone as well.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, it's the latest entry in the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>series, although it's technically a spinoff of the main games that doesn't require any prior knowledge to enjoy.</p>

<p>Developed by Hong Kong-based studio NeoBards, the game revolves around Hinako Shimizu, a high school student who must get to the bottom of why her sleepy town of Ebisugaoka has suddenly become wreathed in fog and populated by dangerous monsters.</p>

<p>Konami's goal with&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>was to return the franchise to its Japanese roots, hence the setting being a Japanese town rather than the more Westernized locales of prior titles.</p>




<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>'s strong sales performance will likely come as a relief to Konami; the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-bloober-team-new-silent-hill" rel="nofollow">revealed back in June</a> that it's working on a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>alongside&nbsp;<em>SH2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team.</p>

<p>While we wait for more on that, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/silent-hill-f/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/silent-hill-f/9n5nfrqv2hqq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill F Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Silent Hill f was developed by NeoBards Entertainment, while Bloober Team made the Silent Hill 2 remake. The new game is set in 1960s Japan and follows the character <a href="https://silenthill.fandom.com/wiki/Hinako_Shimizu" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hinako Shimizu </a>as she solves puzzles and fights horrible monsters.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-spirited-away/1900-6418411/" data-ref-id="1900-6418411">Silent Hill f review</a> scored the game a 9/10. "Silent Hill f is not just a return to form, it's a remarkable evolution; it's a visual spectacle, a mastercraft in psychological horror, a work of narrative brilliance, and a new benchmark for the Silent Hill series," reviewer Jessica Cogswell said.</p><p>No new Silent Hill games have been announced, but a movie--Return to Silent Hill--is set for release in 2026 from director Christophe Gans. He also directed 2006's Silent Hill movie. 2026 will also see the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-movie-release-date-cast-story/1100-6534453/" data-ref-id="1100-6534453">new Resident Evil movie from director Zach Cregger.</a></p>

            <p>A new live action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> trailer has been released which takes shots at Call of Duty's celebrity-focused marketing strategy, introducing a squad of household names including actor Zac Efron before quickly blowing them up.</p>
<p>This squad, which also features basketball player Jimmy Butler, country singer Morgan Wallen, and MMA fighter Paddy Pimblett walk across a ravaged bridge to Smashing Pumpkin's The World Is A Vampire. They all represent one of the classic Battlefield specialist classes, with weapons covered in colourful camos and charms.</p>
<p>After Zac Efron and his crew explode, they are replaced with a collection of standard looking modern military soldier types take their place and engage in typical video game live action trailer shenanigans. It's a two-birds with one stone affair where EA has clearly taken a little pot shot at its largest competitor, while also highlighting several key selling points for Battlefield 6 - those being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">a lack of gaudy cosmetics</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">the death of a limiting specialist system</a>.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">proved exceptionally popular judging by its open beta tests</a>, and has established itself as a real competitor to Call of Duty this year. It's done so by tackling many problems FPS players have had with Call of Duty for several installments now - those being the prevalence of crossover and cameo skins, as well as a shift away from its modern military roots (at least as far as the multiplayer is concerned).</p><p>EA and Battlefield Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-finally-got-our-first-look-at-battlefield-6s-campaign-and-it-looks-like-a-return-to-form-for-ea-and-dice">recently showed off the campaign in a recent Sony State of Play</a>, which is sticking true to the modern military presentation people seem to be craving, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">whereas Black Ops 7 is diving into a more mind-bending space with its campaign</a>.

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">Earlier today, EA announced it is to be acquired by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, investment firms Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners for $55bn</a>. Now a private company, the deal was financed with roughly $36bn from the trio and $20bn worth of debt. This deal marks the largest all-cash sponsor take-private investment in history according to EA's official press release on the matter.</p>

			<p>EA is going to be acquired by an investor consortium for $55 billion, as it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reportedly-closing-in-on-deal-to-go-private-massive-50-billion-buyout/">widely rumored last week.</a></p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/EA-Announces-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-PIF-Silver-Lake-and-Affinity-Partners-for-55-Billion/default.aspx">press release shared today</a>, the publisher of successful titles like the Battlefield series, whose <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/">highly anticipated sixth entry is launching next month on PC and consoles</a>, confirmed it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an investor consortium comprised of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners in an all-cash transaction of $55 billion. Going into further details, the agreement's terms indicate the Consortium will acquire 100% of EA, with PIF rolling over its existing 9.9% stake in the company.</p>



<p>The press release continues that the acquisition agreement was given the go-ahead by the EA's Board of Directors after the opportunity was carefully evaluated. According to Luis A. Ubi√±as, the Lead Independent Director of the board, it was concluded that the opportunity delivers compelling value for stockholders and is in the best interests of all stakeholders.</p>



<p>Although EA has entered into the acquisition agreement, the transaction is expected to close in Q1 FY27, and will be subject to closing conditions, including approval of regulatory bodies and EA stockholders. After the transaction is closed, EA's common stock will no longer be listed on any public market.</p>



<p>Andrew Wilson, Chairman &amp; CEO of EA, commented on the news, saying:<em> "Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world‚Äôs most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work. Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building."</em></p>

            <p>Remember when you were young, and had your first crush? All of a sudden your hormones are going nuts, and here's this person you can't think about without your face contorting into a goofy smile, or talk about without bashfully giggling. Well, it seems that's how part-time Gearbox exec and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hey-randy-im-not-sure-if-saying-that-a-real-fan-will-figure-out-how-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-is-a-good-look">full-time social media poster</a> Randall Steward Pitchford II feels about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>'s freshly revealed first DLC Vault Hunter.</p>
<p>It's understandable to be fair. Which of us hasn't found ourselves gazing longingly at a former casino robot dressed like a goth version of John Wayne, before volunteering to help animate its card-throwing? Sometimes, C4SH rules not just everything around you, but your very heart.</p>

<p>C4SH is the name of this cowbot, whom you'll be able to play as if you splash out for him when he arrives alongside the game's first story DLC early next year. The Vault Hunter's "a drifter who chases the probability-breaking highs of cursed eldritch artifacts, with his bio continuing that the first story DLC, Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, "is full of cosmic horrors that harbor uncanny curios, some of which can surely bend the odds in C4SH's favour."</p><p>As you might have guessed, C4SH is aimed at folks who like playing in a way that comes with high risk for potentially high reward, with the buckarndroid's skills being deliberately unpredictable. That's all cool, but the more important thing emphasised in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/nfyubGFy_AE">C4SH's reveal at the Tokyo Game Show</a> is this: Randy Pitchford fucking LOVES him.</p>
<p>"C4SH is important to me because I think he and I have a lot in common," the exec said during this on-stage reveal, having previously descibed the cowboy robot as "very dear to me, very personal to me." What's engendered these strong feelings in such a famously chill and dispassionate fellow? Well, Pitchford has both won and lost while doing some real life gambling, the CEO said, and he's also a professional magician. "I‚Äôve mastered sleight of hand with playing cards, and we used my demonstration to help animate the character in the game," said the smitten Gearbox skipper.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We'll have more to share in the coming months about C4SH and Story Pack 1, but for now, check out what's up next in our post-launch roadmap, including our first Seasonal Mini-Event, Bounty Pack, and Invincible Boss. <a href="https://t.co/FUYq5qduqO">pic.twitter.com/FUYq5qduqO</a></p>‚Äî Borderlands (@Borderlands) <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands/status/1972142127967850710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>So, if you've ever wondered what it's like to basically be Randy Pitchford - or at least a cyborg Clint Eastwood that he sees a lot of himself in - now's your chance to find out. I assume there's a posting interface built into the HUD when you load in as C4SH. Either that, or you'll have to run two monitors for the authentic experience of arguing with tweeters about the capabilities of their game-playing boxes as you play Borderlands. Remember: when it feels like you should probably stop posting, do not stop posting.</p>
<p>As they've revealed C4SH, Gearbox have also put out a DLC roadmap for Borderlands 4. Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, the first story pack C4SH arrives as part of early next year, also includes extra main and side missions in a new zone of Kairos and new gear. Hopefully the majority of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4s-latest-update-aims-to-deliver-more-performance-fixes-ends-up-causing-more-stuttering-for-some">performance issues</a> which've plagued the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> since release will be sorted by then, so you can enjoy C4SH rather than crash.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The version 2.3 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed ‚ÄúMemories of Dreams Bygone,‚Äù will launch on October 15, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [207 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-997143"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this latest update, players will team up with Spook Shack and set foot in the newly unlocked Timesworn Hills, where ghost stories echo through abandoned ruins in the Hollow. Lucia, Yidhari, and Komano Manato join the battlefield as new Agents, accompanied by fresh gameplay, new outfits for Vivian and Manato, and engaging events.</p><p>The newly revealed Timesworn Hills region, known for its abundant Lumite ore deposits, conceals abandoned research facilities and testing ground ruins where chilling legends thrive. Tales of miners who vanished within the Miasma, the tolling of a phantom bell, creatures that gaze into people‚Äôs hearts, and hypnotists capable of ensnaring victims in endless dreams haunt the land. This new adventure begins with the case of missing miners and Porcelumex employees, drawing Proxies into the Hollow to uncover unsettling truths.</p><p>The new members from Spook Shack bring not only fascination with haunted tales but also formidable strength to the battlefield. Lucia, an S-Rank Ether Support Agent and devoted Ethereal fan, wields dreamlike powers to recreate Ethereals in combat. By accumulating Dream Points, she can enter a Dream state and unleash Ether Veil: Wellspring, boosting all allies‚Äô max HP while enhancing team damage through increased Sheer Force and triggering Aftershocks. Yidhari, an S-Rank Ice Rupture Agent, embodies both risk and resilience. She gains Sheer Force based on her max HP, and her ice attacks always inflict Sheer DMG, piercing through enemy defenses. Her damage increases as her HP percentage drops, rewarding a delicate balance of HP loss and recovery. Meanwhile, Komano Manato, now joining the battlefield as an A-Rank Fire Rupture Agent, unleashes Sheer DMG with strikes that scale from his max HP. In addition, S-level agents Vivian (Ether ‚Äì Anomaly) and Ju Fufu (Fire ‚Äì Stun) will return in this version‚Äôs banners.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_997145"><ul><li><span>‚ùÆ</span></li><li><span>‚ùØ</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>EA has officially been acquired by a group of investors including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund in a private transaction worth $55bn.</p>
<p>EA chairman and CEO Andrew Wilson will continue to lead the company - known for its sports games, BioWare's RPGs, The Sims, and forthcoming shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> - with the transaction expected to be completed in Q1 FY27.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/investors-including-saudi-s-pif-are-reportedly-in-advanced-talks-for-a-50bn-leveraged-buyout-of-ea">News of the acquisition came over the weekend</a>, before an official announcement today. The investor group comprises the PIF, as well as investment firms Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners.</p>
<p>"Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world's most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work," said Wilson.</p><p>"Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energised than ever about the future we are building."</p>
<p>"Electronic Arts is an extraordinary company with a world-class management team and a bold vision for the future. I've admired their ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games - and now enjoys them with his kids - I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead," said Jared Kushner, CEO of Affinity Partners. Kushner is US President Donald Trump's son-in-law.</p>
<p>PIF <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-increases-stake-in-ea-by-55">increased its stake in EA in 2023</a>; now its 9.9 percent stake will roll over. The organisation also holds stakes in a number of gaming companies including Nintendo, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, Embracer, Capcom, and more.</p>
<p>Ubisoft is another, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-to-get-surprise-free-story-dlc-later-this-year">Assassin's Creed Mirage set to receive a surprise free DLC</a> set in 9th century AlUla, an ancient Arabian city. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-claiming-its-signed-a-saudi-deal-for-fresh-assassins-creed-mirage-content">DLC follows reported funding from PIF</a>.</p>
<p>The PIF was designed to diversify Saudi Arabia's revenue via investment in foreign companies. It's chaired by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country's controversial ruler <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>, who has upheld the country's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">notoriously poor human rights record</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://messenger.abeto.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Messenger</em></a> is a very small game made by abeto where you play as a kid on an alien planet, meeting the people who live on it and running some mailperson errands. It's got a wonderful art style, and pretty much any of you can play it right now, for free, since it's a browser game. It even works on phones!</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/caravan-sandwitch-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When I've said previously that I like small sandboxes</a>, this is exactly what I mean. You get access to an entire planet here, but the planet is comically small, around the size of a bigger game's city block, to the point where you can see the curvature just metres in front of you, and you can traverse it in a matter of minutes.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="–ù–∞—à–ª–∏ –¥–ª—è –≤–∞—Å –º–∏–ª–µ–π—à—É—é –±—Ä–∞—É–∑–µ—Ä–Ω—É—é –∏–≥—Ä—É ‚Äî –µ–π –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ messenger.abeto.co/üëà–∑–∞–ø—É—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—å –¥–∞–∂–µ —Å –æ—Ñ–∏—Å–Ω–æ–≥–æ ..." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMbitNHf9Ps?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>You very quickly get to know every square inch, and every square inch has a lovely lived-in amount of detail, so in no time at all this little planet starts to feel like home. And in a nice touch, you‚Äôre not alone; it‚Äôs got a very basic form of multiplayer, so popping in and out of the game are other messengers from around the world, who you can communicate with via emoji and just generally follow around and hang out with.</p><p>I would have paid $20 for this on Steam; the fact you can just fuck around with it for free in a browser is wild.
