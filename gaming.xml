<p>Yep, this looks awesome</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Developer Fumi Games and publisher PlaySide Studios have announced that the vintage noir FPS title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mouse-p-i-for-hire">Mouse: P.I. for Hire</a> will be launching on the Switch 2 on <strong>19th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Utilising the talents of voice actor Troy Baker in the starring role, Mouse showcases stunningly authentic rubber hose animation as you explore a corrupt city full to the brim with armed gangs and crooked cops. Visually, it looks awesome, but we're equally enamoured by the gameplay, too. There are some seriously weird weapons on display!</p>
<p>We're expecting silky-smooth performance on the Switch 2, but as ever, we'll keep you updated on any new information as soon as hear. For now, if you're a fan of old-school animation and FPS games, this definitely seems like one to keep a close eye on.</p>
<p>Now let's check out the list of features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Black and white, hand-drawn rubber hose animation, inspired by cartoons of the 1930s<br>
- Fast-paced FPS combat, where constant movement is key<br>
- A thrilling single-player campaign that unravels a complex web of crime and corruption<br>
- Over 20 noir-infused levels, teeming with mice, rats and shrews<br>
- Fully-loaded arsenal of over a dozen unique weapons and equipment - with a cartoon twist<br>
- Devastating consumable power-ups, capable of turning the tide of any battle<br>
- Unlockable movement abilities and Metroidvania-inspired level traversal<br>
- Original jazz soundtrack, featuring a big band orchestral ensemble</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-missed-expectations-dont-nod-signs-deal-with-netflix/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-nod-admits-lost-records-bloom-rage-missed-expectations-signs-deal-with-netflix-to-create-new-game-based-on-%E2%80%9Ca-major-ip%E2%80%9D.1337527/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Developer and publisher DON'T NOD has <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850">published its latest financial release</a> which goes over its half-year results for 2025, which includes a few notable updates from the studio, like how its most recent release, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage performed "<em>below expectations</em>," and that the studio signed a deal with Netflix to make a narrative game based on "<em>a major IP</em>."</p>



<p>It's definitely a disappointing result for DON'T NOD, particularly considering the fact that its last major releases last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and Jusant, also fell below expectations</a>. The studio's total operating revenue took a 5% dip compared to last year for the same time period at €13.9 million.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the future appears a little more promising for DON'T NOD, with the release of its most recent published title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dont-nod-published-the-lonesome-guild-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-demo-now-on-steam/">The Lonesome Guild,</a> which arrived on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S last week on October 23, 2025.</p>



<p>More importantly, its newly signed deal with Netflix to create a new narrative title based on what's described as "<em>a major IP</em>" could prove to be a saving grace for the studio as it begins work on the title at its studio in Montreal, with Netflix signed on to publish the game.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how that goes, though, because while games with a stronger narrative focus like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Split Fiction, and Dead Take are proving there's an appetite for strong storytelling in games, Netflix <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/806303/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment-studio-shut-down">shuttered its Squid Game: Unleashed studio, Boss Fight Entertainment, just days ago</a>.</p>



<p>Could that just be Netflix wanting to move away from internally developing and publishing games going forward? Sure. Could it also be that Netflix is becoming more cautious of its participation in the video game industry overall? Absolutely, it could be. For now, it has a deal to publish this new game from DON'T NOD. Hopefully, this deal will work out for the Paris-based developer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Classic games like <i>Fallout 3, Dungeon Keeper 2, Theme Hospital, Medal of Honor, Tron 2.0, Roller Coaster Tycoon</i> and more are currently on sale until next week
                </p><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-preservation-program-private-detectives-drm-2000635611">Digital PC gaming storefront GOG</a> has looked outside and noticed all the leaves are orange and falling to the ground. So it’s time for a big ol’ Autumn Sale! This year, GOG has marked down over 4,000 PC games, including a whole bunch of classics that are well worth checking out in 2025.</p>

 <p>On October 28, <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1983173386718019604">as spotted by deals guru Wario64</a>, GOG (formerly known as Good Old Games) <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/autumn_sale_2025?order=desc:bestselling&amp;discounted=true&amp;hideDLCs=true">launched its Autumn 2025 Sale.</a> The sale<a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-fall-autumn-sale-2025-best-biggest-cheapest-deals-games-pc-steamdeck-2000629959">,</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-fall-autumn-sale-2025-best-biggest-cheapest-deals-games-pc-steamdeck-2000629959">which follows Steam’s fall sale back in late September</a>, runs from now until November 4. So you’ve got about a week to pick through the huge list of discounted games and grab one (or more) to help you endure the coming weeks, which bring cold weather, snow, and family gatherings.</p>

 <p>For those curious to hop into the original<em> Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</em> ahead of (or perhaps after) playing the <a href="https://kotaku.com/reviews-round-up-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-it-good-pc-ps5-xbox-2000636600">recently released sequel,</a> you can snag the OG game for just $10. And it, like many of the games on this list, is part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">GOG’s “Good Old Game” preservation program</a>. That means it and others like it will continue to be maintained and supported by GOG for the foreseeable future, letting you easily play the original <em>Bloodlines</em> for years to come. On the flipside, if the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tron-ares-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-jared-leto-fortnite-2000632606">new <em>Tron</em> movie</a> has you in a cyber mood, just know that<em> Tron 2.0</em> isn’t part of this program. So if you grab this classic PC game as part of the sale, you may want to download some mods to help make it play and run well on modern PCs.</p> <p>Anyway, here’s a list of good games and deals I spotted in <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/autumn_sale_2025?order=desc:bestselling&amp;discounted=true&amp;hideDLCs=true">GOG’s big sale</a>.

Kyle Katarn, the hero of the video game, is getting a Star Wars The Black Series action figure. It costs $27.99 and will be available on April 1.

It comes with a blaster and a blue-bladed Lightsaber, with a standard blade and one that mimics the blurred swinging effect. It’s a figure that looks good enough for adults to enjoy as a collectible, but it works equally well for play, with a suggest age range of 4+. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-dark-forces">Star Wars: Dark Forces hit PC in 1995</a>, with a port to PS1 the following year. It’s one of the early “Doom clones,” but it had strong enough story and gameplay elements to stand up on its own. Gameplay-wise, it included novel ideas like the ability to jump and duck, as well as to look up and down, all of which Doom and Doom 2 lacked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Forces is set in the (no-longer-canon) extended universe, around the time of the first Star Wars movie. It follows Kyle Katarn, a mercenary working for the Rebel Alliance, as he uncovers the Dark Troopers Project and goes about trying to stop it. This mission brings him all over the galaxy to locations like Jabba’s yacht, the Imperial mines on Gromas, inside a Star Destroyer, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Dark Forces got the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-dark-forces-remaster">remaster treatment</a> last year, making it accessible on modern platforms and tweaking its graphics and adding various quality-of-life improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hybrid-action-rpg-duet-night-abyss-launches-globally-with-new-monetization-system.1337509/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Free-to-play hybrid action RPG Duet Night Abyss is out now worldwide on PC, mobile devices, and Epic Games Store featuring a dual narrative with two protagonists, no stamina limits for movement or commissions, and no character or weapon gacha systems. Let’s get into the details of what this game has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Duet Night Abyss takes place in the world of Atlasia, where tree-like crystals called Heaventrees were viewed as gifts from the gods and gave rise to a central religion called the Elysian Church. Originally, practically everyone followed this religion, but over time, groups broke off and formed their own factions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play through the story from the perspectives of two protagonists with very different backgrounds, and you can freely choose and deploy each of them across different chapters. You’ll meet people from several of Atlasia’s different factions, and you can unlock many of them as playable characters by using character shards, which can be obtained either by buying the exact number you need for a specific character or by collecting them through gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters are not sorted into tiers or star ratings, all of them are just as viable in combat as the others. There are also no character gacha banners where you have to spend resources and just hope you eventually get what you want. You can identify the character you want, gather the required crystals, and be 100% guaranteed to unlock that character.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/image-4-1761248741433.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As the developers said when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/duet-night-abyss-dev-team-discusses-the-games-narrative-combat-and-latest-updates"><u>we interviewed them in August</u></a>, this was in response to player feedback and was with the goal of making the game more accessible to free-to-play (F2P) players. And as part of the game’s global launch rewards, players can complete events to unlock seven characters for free, giving you the opportunity to build the team you want right from the start. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter what characters you want to use in battle, you can equip them with both melee and ranged weapons and swap between them on the fly. Every character has access to every weapon type, so you can freely equip them however you want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Melee weapon options include standard choices like swords, polearms, and greatswords, as well as more unique ones like the whipsword. There are also a variety of ranged options, from a bow and arrow to dual pistols, grenade launchers, and shotguns. And like characters, weapons aren’t locked behind banners and aren’t sorted into different tiers or star ratings. So you can use whichever combination of weapons you want with no optimization lost.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/melee-and-ranged-weapons-1761248804318.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat will pit you against waves of enemies in hack-and-slash action, where you’ll mow down hordes of foes in seconds. The flow of combat stays quick thanks to the fact there are several mobility options with no stamina requirements, so no need to keep your eye on a gauge to see what moves you can use. At any time, you can sprint, use a grappling hook, dodge, jump, double jump, wall jump, or Helix Leap, which in one button press allows you to cover very long distances very quickly.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/image-6-1761248842756.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can tackle commissions with up to three players in co-op mode, or go solo with two AI companions. There are no stamina restrictions for commissions either, so you’re not limited to only a certain amount of time you can play freely. And you can further customize your fighting style with Demon Wedges, which are versatile add-ons that you can obtain during commissions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Demon Wedges come in three varieties: character, melee weapon, and ranged weapon. They can provide boosts to your health, crit rate, attack speed, and other attributes. These boosts are guaranteed at a set level when you acquire and upgrade them, so you don’t have to keep grinding for the same thing and hoping to get a better version. There’s no randomization involved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of stat boosts, Demon Wedges can also change the mechanics of your characters’ attacks and skills, and you can combine these with certain weapon traits to customize your attack pattern. And once you’ve acquired a Demon Wedge, you can use it across as many characters or weapons as you want. So again, no need to farm for additional versions to equip multiple of them.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/image-7-1761248877455.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters, weapons, and Demon Wedges can all be obtained through normal gameplay. The game’s monetization model is currently focused only on cosmetics, with a range of character skins, accessories, patterns, dye colors, and weapon skins. Both outfits and weapons can be dyed, allowing for an additional level of customization.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/24/character-skins-1761338540276.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers recently unveiled new skins for the characters Psyche, Rebecca, and the duo Truffle and Filbert. They also revealed Christmas-themed skins and a new sword skin called Tough Love. And as part of the game’s global launch rewards, players can get up to 107 Pristine Hourglass and Prismatic Hourglass just for logging in.

		<p>Developer DON’T NOD has released a brand new trailer for its sci-fi adventure, which is due to be released in 2026. The brand new trailer confirms a second playable character to provide a different perspective to Ariane, and that new character is fellow astronaut Thomas. The two characters have different ways of dealing with things, with Ariane being more physical as she moves around while Thomas uses his mind to piece things together due to picking up an injury.</p>
<p><iframe title="Aphelion | Hide to Survive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_oUUnfGffCQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer for Aphelion also shows a creature native, named The Nemesis, to the planet Persephone stalking both astronauts, who cannot fight back. Both Ariane and Thomas will need to hide and move stealthily to avoid detection. Ariane and Thomas are not together in this journey but are looking for each other after crashing onto the planet of Persephone.</p>
<p>Aphelion is due to be released for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mtg-avatar-the-last-airbender-%E2%80%93-everything-you-need-to-know.1337482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> makes its way to <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> in a little less than a month on November 21st, and we just got the rundown of the whole release at a press event. We have some new cards to show off, some new information, and we'll give you the rundown on things specific to this set, some of which you may know already. There's also a look at a Secret lair drop.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Where Are the Avatar: The Last Airbender Commander Decks?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>To get the biggest question out of the way, we learned why there are no precon Commander decks in the set. It seems so obvious with the four types of airbending right?&nbsp;</p>

<p>When they were preparing for this set, they sought a lot of feedback about what people wanted from an <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> set in <em>Magic</em>. The team told us the surprisingly biggest thing people were most excited about was using <em>Avatar </em>as a way to teach people in their life to play <em>Magic</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s generally one of the bonuses to Universes Beyond, but we were told that there was so much specific feedback for <em>Avatar </em>they couldn’t ignore it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it came down to it, they realized they only had the bandwidth to do one of two things: Commander or Jumpstart.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With all the feedback they got early on, they went ahead with Jumpstart.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They also added that not all of the different bending mechanics lend themselves well to a Commander deck, airbending mentioned specifically. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>What’s in the Commander’s Bundle?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Commander is not ignored, however. They are selling a Commander’s Bundle that is very similar to gift bundles in previous sets.</p>

<p>It includes 9 booster packs, one collector booster, 30 <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> lands (15 foil , 15 nonfoil), a click wheel life counter, and some Commander specific staples.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Featuring the <em>Avatar </em>art above, the bundle includes five nonfoil promo cards. Three of them are the same in each bundle: a Sol Ring, Arcane Signet, and Swiftwfoot Boots. The other two are borderless versions of “classic” Commander spells.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Jumpstart Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Jumpstart boosters make a return in <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, as discussed above. &nbsp;If you’re not familiar, these are packs of 20 cards that are all themed around one sort of mechanic or some sort of synergy.</p>

<p>With Avatar, there are 46 Jumpstart themes in total.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will also be some cards from <em>Avatar </em>that are only found in Jumpstart boosters. Here’s some of them:</p>

<p><em>Avatar </em>will join <em>Arena </em>on November 18th and will feature every card in the set, aside from some art variants that will only be in the tabletop version.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unique to <em>Arena </em>will be some sleeves, featured above. The Aang and Katara sleeves will be in various bundles you can purchase, one with a ton of packs aimed at people making decks and the other for those more interested in drafting..&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sokka sleeves will be included as part of the Mastery Pass.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will be three pets to collect as well, featuring the animal companions from the show: Appa, a baby Appa, and Momo.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Avatar: The Last Airbender Bonus Sheet&nbsp;</h2>

<p>There will be a lot of source material cards in the <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> set, 61 in total. Each card will feature a frame or part of a frame of an episode from the show so all 61 episodes are represented.</p>

<p>If you look at the cards, in the bottom left you’ll see exactly which episode that card’s art is from as well. Check out some below.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair – My Cabbages!&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Unsurprisingly, there will be an <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender </em>Secret Lair superdrop. There are still details to come on that, like the rest of the drops and the release date, but they did reveal one to us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think we all saw some form of this set coming, featuring the cabbage merchant from the show. Each one features new ways his cabbages get absolutely wrecked.</p>

<h2>Art Variants in Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Bloomburrow fans who liked the field notes treatment will be happy to see it return with <em>Avatar</em>. Because the world is so full of weird and unique animals, the team thought the aesthetic fit perfectly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another is the borderless elemental frame, each of which will focus on a specific character and highlight the type of bending they are associated with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to some of the new cards shown above, here are some new cards that you likely haven’t seen yet (aside from the Appa Lands, you’ve probably seen those but if not I included them):&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>October brings with it an annual flood of big game releases but a relative desert when it comes to gaming showcases. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rtt9pnU_xA">Fall 2025 ID@Xbox livestream</a> did its best to fill that void, teasing updates and new reveal trailers for a number of smaller indie releases you probably don’t have on your radar.</p> <p>If you’re excited as I am <a href="https://kotaku.com/planet-of-lana-follows-in-limbos-lushly-illustrated-foo-1847076146">for <em>Planet of Lana 2</em></a>, you’ll be happy to hear it’s double the length and scope of the original, taking players into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trQYZNIOzBE">completely new types of environments</a>. We also got confirmation on some release dates, console ports, and Game Pass day-and-date arrivals. Remember co-op off-road trip <a href="https://kotaku.com/art-rally-over-hill-trailer-minimalist-steam-coop-1851746273"><em>Over the Hill</em></a>? It’s coming to Xbox and PC in 2026. Platformer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mcOQY8qhpU"><em>Egg On</em></a>, meanwhile, arrives November 6 via Game Pass on both console and PC. And tower defense roguelike <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kVZpnNukOU"><em>Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp;&nbsp;Road</em></a>, which I’ve really been looking forward to, arrives on the subscription service just a few weeks later on November 20.</p>

 <p>Here’s a bunch of other new game trailers that caught our eyes:</p> <h2><em>Puppergeist</em></h2>  <p>Do all dogs go to heaven? Not in this game. <em>Puppergeist</em> sees a young witch named Claire search for her puppy in the underworld. The only way to find him is by helping other haunted dogs with their troubles through rhythm-based mini-games.</p>

 <h2><em>Awaysis</em></h2>  <p>This 1-4 player co-op dungeon brawler hits Game Pass in 2026. It looks like 3D <em>Castle Crashers</em> with bigger maps and detailed physics gags.<em> Awaysis</em> bravely asks you to consider completing that epic combo while trying not to rag-doll across the level.</p>

 <h2><em>Ungodly</em></h2>  <p>Once upon a time, Mark Otero was creative director on <em>Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes</em>. Now he’s making<em> Ungodly</em>, a dark fantasy RPG from Azra Games. There are barbarians, wizards, and lots of monsters. It looks like an over-the-shoulder dungeon crawler. Unconfirmed if it will be monetized like a free-to-play mobile game or be a complete RPG experience. It was supposed to come out this winter but looks slated for later in 2026 now.</p>

 <h2><em>Task Time</em></h2>  <p><em>Task Time</em> looks like <em>Gang Beasts</em> meats <i>Fall Guys</i>, i.e. it’s a party game that takes place over a series of races in which the best-laid plans are easily ruined by a gnarly physics sandbox. “This is your new favourite friendslop,” reads the YouTube description. See, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/focus-group-man-you-have-no-good-car-ideas">they admit it</a>! Still, my kids are going to go crazy for this one, right up until it causes too much chaos and I threaten to never let them play games again.</p>

 <h2 data-cy="title2"><em>Agni: Village of Calamity</em></h2>  <p><em>Agni: Village of Calamity</em> is a horror noir police procedural set in Indonesia where a covert agent goes rogue to uncover a monster-filled conspiracy. It looks cool and creepy, like indie <em>Silent Hill</em> for Indonesian folklore.</p>

 <h2><em>Don’t Fret</em></h2>  <p>In<em> Don’t Fret</em> you play as a human guitar chased by a giant cassette tape. That’s it. That’s the game. It looks lowkey terrifying.</p> <h2><em>Darkwood 2</em></h2>  <p>The top-down survival horror game returns in an equally moody sequel. You make your way around the “scorched deserts of a dying sea” foraging for food and supplies before night falls. It features an entirely new story so you won’t need to have played the first game to enjoy it.</p> <h2><em>Routine&nbsp;</em></h2>  <p>Explore deteriorating environments. Piece together the past. Don’t get eaten by whatever’s lurking around the corner. <em>Routine</em>‘s analog ’80s flavor of survival horror has been in the making since 2012. It finally has a release date of December 4. It’ll also be day-one on Game Pass. Oh, and Mick Gordon (<em>Doom 2016</em>, <em>Doom Eternal</em>) is doing the music!</p>

Unfortunately, Blackwell Fields is a large-scale area with a ton of open ground, causing players to voice their complaints about the map.</p><p dir="ltr">Blackwell Fields is set on a massive oil field in California, with lots of open ground for snipers and long-range combat. The map offers structures like oil wells, construction equipment, and small pieces of cover, but it doesn't feel like enough to cater to all playstyles. Close-quarter tactics are difficult to utilize here, and it can feel overwhelming to try and capture points.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>As part of Amazon’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/807825/amazon-job-layoffs-2025-ai">mass layoffs announced today</a>, the company is making “significant” changes to its gaming division, including halting much of its work on first-party AAA MMOs, according to a memo from Steve Boom, VP of audio, Twitch, and games.</p><p>“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” Boom says in the memo, which Amazon shared with <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Amazon’s MMO lineup currently includes <em>New World: Aeternum</em>, <em>Throne and Liberty</em>, and <em>Lost Ark</em> (which had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/21/22944611/lost-ark-mmo-long-queue-times-smilegate-amazon-games">a hot start in 2022</a>), and in 2023, Amazon announced that it would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23723787/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">developing a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO</a> in partnership with Embracer Group. Last year, Amazon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/28/24230555/amazon-games-blue-protocol-western-release-cancelled">cancelled a planned western release</a> of the Bandai Namco-developed MMO <em>Blue Protocol</em>, which was shuttered in Japan in January.</p><p>The company isn’t fully pulling back on its work in games. Boom pointed to the launch of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789658/amazon-luna-cloud-relaunch-gamenight-social-gaming">revamped Luna</a> and said that its Studio 5 team, which developed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnqfKmQd2Hs">courtroom game with an AI Snoop Dogg</a> for the cloud gaming service, will “continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games, optimized for Luna.” He also said Luna is a “great example” of “how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon” because it “leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members.”</p><div><p>In addition, Boom highlighted a “successful closed alpha” for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDAH6H-5TOs">the MOBA <em>March of the Giants</em></a> and noted that Amazon is still working with Crystal Dynamics on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/15/23510923/amazon-tomb-raider-game-crystal-dynamics">a new <em>Tomb Raider</em> game</a> (Amazon is also making <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770357/amazon-lara-croft-tomb-raider-sophie-turner-series">a <em>Tomb Raider</em> series</a>) and with Maverick Games on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24166351/amazon-maverick-games-publishing-deal-forza-ps5-xbox">a new open world driving game</a>.</p></div><p>You can read Boom’s full memo below.</p><div><blockquote><p>Dear Games Team,</p><p>This morning, we are making a number of changes in our Games business. While you’ve likely seen Beth Galetti’s note earlier this morning regarding the larger changes at Amazon that are taking place today, I wanted to dive a bit deeper with all of you, since the strategic changes we are making in Games go beyond what is happening company-wide.</p><p>Over the last several months, we’ve been evaluating our go-forward plans, specifically through the lens of our mission to deliver the very best gaming experiences to customers while leaning into the things that Amazon does best. We believe that this is how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon. Last week’s launch of the all-new Luna is a great example, as it leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members, two tenets that are always top of mind in our group. Luna launched with a great catalog of social party games and AAA blockbusters, and we have a lot more to come from Jeff’s team on that front…it’s still Day 1.</p><p>We’ve also taken a critical look at the evolving dynamics of games industry and competitive landscape. While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team.</p><p>While these changes are significant, we still have a lot going on in game development. Our Montreal studio recently concluded a successful closed alpha of March of Giants and is working hard to finish the game. Our Studio 5 team just released <em>Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg</em> as the launch title in Luna and will continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games, optimized for Luna. Finally, we are continuing to work with our external studio partners Crystal Dynamics on an upcoming <em>Tomb Raider</em> title and Maverick Games on an upcoming open world driving game.</p><p>Over the course of the day, both Christoph and Jeff will reach out with more details on how these changes will affect you and your teams. Most countries with impacted employees have been notified. Our other global hubs will follow local processes and be notified at a later date.</p><p>There is no getting around the fact that days like this are hard, and we will be losing team members whose work and dedication have had an incredible impact on our customers over the years. We don’t make these decisions lightly, and yet they are necessary for us to continue to drive our business forward.</p><p>Please reach out directly to your manager or to your HRBP with any specific questions.</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Steve</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/808332/amazon-gaming-layoffs-mmo-aaa-first-party-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>—the first game from AdHoc Studio, which was formed by veterans of Telltale Games— contains a lot of “almosts.” It’s </span><i><span>almost </span></i><span>a revival of the choice-driven Telltale adventure game we’ve been missing for nearly a decade, but without all the walking around and examining the environment while the game was barely holding itself together. It’s </span><i><span>almost </span></i><span>a superhero story, but it’s mostly a workplace management sim with superheroes in it. It’s </span><i><span>almost </span></i><span>as irreverent as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-deadpool-daredevil-leak-audio-voice-lines-overwatch-2-lady-gaga-2000620344"><i><span>Deadpool</span></i></a><span>, but stops short of its fourth-wall-breaking crudeness. I’m still figuring out how I feel about all of those things rolled together in one package, but I can’t deny I felt a coziness typically reserved for pastel farming sims as I slipped back into the better parts of the Telltale house style.</span></p> <p><span>Robert Robertson III isn’t a superhero, but he </span><i><span>was </span></i><span>a mech-piloting hero who once steered a suit that his father and his father’s father passed down to him. Mecha Man, as the family’s shared heroic identity was known, has become a symbol in a superpowered world where everyone believes they can save the day. So when Robert, voiced by Aaron Paul, is defeated and de-meched by a villain named Shroud, it seems like his heroing days are over. That is, until he is approached by the Superhero Dispatch Network, an organization that assigns heroes to odd jobs based on their various powers and expertise. If Robert can’t be out in the field yet, maybe he can put all those years of hero work to use by guiding others.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639683" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639683"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639683">© AdHoc Studio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In just its first two episodes, </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>has all the makings of an old Telltale classic. While the drama of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/if-telltale-s-the-walking-dead-its-ending-on-a-high-no-1829281649"><i><span>The Walking Dead</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/three-episodes-in-the-wolf-among-us-gets-really-good-1561497397"><i><span>The Wolf Among Us</span></i></a> <span>made </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/telltale-employees-left-stunned-by-company-closure-no-1829272139"><span>the now-defunct studio</span></a><span> a household name, my favorite game by the studio has always been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tales-from-the-borderlands-finale-is-its-darkest-episod-1737584368"><i><span>Tales from the Borderlands</span></i></a><span>, which manages to elevate the often tiresome source material into a rollicking action comedy with wit and incredible timing. </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>feels most reminiscent of that as a slapstick, raunchy workplace comedy where Robert’s co-workers are a gang of superpowered misfits.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I still haven’t gotten much time with Robert’s team, but I’ve seen enough to know they’re different from other groups at SDN. These guys are a bunch of ex-villains, some of whom Robert slapped around in a mech a time or two. As such, his identity is kept under lock and key from most people in the company, so as far as this team is concerned, he’s just another in a long line of paper pushers SDN has brought in to try and wrangle them into a proper superhero team. </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>will live or die based on whether or not it can pull off the interpersonal relationships between Robert and his crew, and the brief flashes in these first two episodes show potential.</span></p>

 <p><span>Invisigal, formerly known as Invisibitch and played by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/critical-role-campaign-4-cast-brennan-lee-mulligan-date-2000619230"><i><span>Critical Role</span></i></a> <span>star Laura Bailey, gets the most screen time. Her powers of invisibility allow her to shroud herself in mystery to her foes, like she also does to her friends, and she is pretty much actively rebelling against the entire rehabilitation program, despite turning herself in prior to Robert’s arrival. There will no doubt be a lot to unpack with her as the game goes on, but a lot of the other wannabe heroes are enigmas to me right now. I’ve mostly had to intuit who they are through their stats on a spreadsheet, but thankfully, it sounds like that will change in the next two episodes launching later this week.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639684"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639684">© AdHoc Studio</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>is pretty neatly divided into two halves. One is the “Telltale game” half, playing out as a less interactive version of the choice-driven dialogue and QTEs that defined the studio’s previous work, though here you don’t walk around or interact with the environment at all. The dialogue choices you get will change the cadence of conversations and people “will remember” what you say and do, but overall it’s a much less involved experience. The best parts of </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>are in the dialogue and the eye-catching comic book-style animation, but so far, the actual experience of playing it feels a little thin.</span></p>

 <p><span>This is especially noticeable because of </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s episodic format. Unlike Telltale’s games or the older </span><i><span>Life Is Strange </span></i><span>releases, which had episodes come out over the course of several months, </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s eight episodes are rolling out weekly, two at a time, between now and November 12. Two episodes are coming out each Wednesday for the next few weeks, and these first two episodes are bite-sized. </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>was originally going to be a </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/611909/dispatch-preview-adhoc-interview/"><span>live-action television show</span></a><span>, and that feels about right given its brief, TV-episode-length run times. I enjoyed my time with both episodes, but I was also caught off guard when they abruptly ended and the credits started rolling. When Telltale or Don’t Nod did the episodic format a decade ago, it was because it was developing episodes and putting the tracks down in real-time. </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>seems to be mostly done, its episodes just haven’t unlocked yet. Ultimately, when all the episodes are out, will its episodic format really matter? Or is cutting a game into eight pieces mostly just a nod to AdHoc’s lineage? We’ll know for sure in a few weeks, I suppose.</span></p>

 <p><span>But what about the other half of the game, the actual dispatching? What </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>lacks in more direct control, it makes up for with its pretty entertaining management sim. I was given brief dossiers on my crew and told to send them around town doing heroic things despite their non-heroic attitudes and histories. Surprisingly enough, the big stuff is pretty easy. Baddies are attacking people? Send in Golem, a giant, hulking mud and gunk guy who specializes in defense. Someone needs to reach an objective unnoticed? Probably easiest to send Invisigal because she barely even needs to hide behind cover to get somewhere. It was the smaller jobs that turned out to be more tricky. I thought Invisigal would be able to get a lost balloon out of a tree, but alas, she couldn’t manage it. There was also a point when SDN needed someone to go do some PR, and they decided someone from my group of ex-delinquents would be right for the job. So I had to think a little more creatively about who to send out. There were some obvious non-starters, but Prism is a socialite who dresses like a pop star. She’s probably the one who can sweet-talk the public on a radio show, right?&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000639682" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639682"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639682">© AdHoc Studio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Getting to know your team’s strengths and weaknesses is one thing, but </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s management segments also require you to juggle the crew’s division of labor, breaks, and travel time all at once like any other shift manager. Sometimes a task needs completion but the right person is resting from their last job, so you have to let it sit there and hope they’ve recuperated before the job times out. Other times you just have to send whoever’s on hand and hope for the best. Some jobs are handled by multiple characters, each of whom can handle certain requirements, but even then, you might get pinged to make a call or hack into a system to help them progress. It’s not all chance, and even someone perfectly suited for a given job isn’t guaranteed success.

It’s nice to think these types of games could get a second chance at life, and if </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>helps get us back to that, I’ll just be happy it exists at all.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We received a welcome treat with the launch of Battlefield 6’s REDSEC content, as it included a new DLC trophy list specifically for battle royale and Gauntlet content. Insider Gaming has the full list for you to check out, and for something so short, it’s deceptively grindy.</p>



<p>Once we got wind of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-trophy-list-all-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 trophy list</a>, we’d have been forgiven for thinking this would be the extent of BF 6’s trophies. Alas, we were wrong, and we’re glad to say we were. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale-twitch-drops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REDSEC battle royale</a> content was introduced with Season 1, and so with it came the awesome new Gauntlet mode.</p>



<p>Gauntlet and traditional BR make up the fabric of the new Battlefield 6 trophies and achievements, so let’s check them out.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-6-redsec-dlc-trophies-amp-achievements">All Battlefield 6 REDSEC DLC Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How long have you got? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The extra Battlefield 6 DLC REDSEC trophy list is like a 3ft powerlifter—Small in stature, but doing a lot of heavy lifting. There aren’t many trophies and achievements here, but they will take you a long time to achieve.</p>



<p>Here’s the complete list of DLC REDSEC trophies for Battlefield 6.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Trophy &amp; Achievement Name</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">May the Odds Forever Be in Your Favor</td><td data-align="center">Play 74 matches in any version of Battle Royale.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Here’s Your Birthday Present</td><td data-align="center">Deploy 42 call-ins.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Collector</td><td data-align="center">Loot 10 Superior or Custom items.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stone Cold</td><td data-align="center">Stun enemies 316 times in Battle Royale or Gauntlet.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rise from Your Grave</td><td data-align="center">Revive teammates 1988 times in Battle Royale or Gauntlet.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Army of Two</td><td data-align="center">Win 7 matches in Battle Royale: Duos.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Never-Ending Game</td><td data-align="center">Play 125 rounds of Gauntlet.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Everybody Fights, Nobody Quits</td><td data-align="center">Win a Battle Royale match as a full squad with total squad survival.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mission Accepted</td><td data-align="center">Complete 214 missions in any version of Battle Royale.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Dog of War</td><td data-align="center">College 9 dog tags in Battle Royale or Gauntlet.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mozambique Hotel</td><td data-align="center">Ping a Shotgun in Battle Royale.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-amp-trophies-in-battlefield-6-redsec-dlc">How Many Achievements &amp; Trophies In Battlefield 6 REDSEC DLC?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s a small helping of 11 extra PlayStation Trophies and 11 Xbox Achievements to explore, discover, and obtain in Battlefield 6’s optional REDSEC DLC list.</strong></p>



<p>Quite often, when we do these lists, we have to give Xbox owners the bad news that PS users get an additional trophy. This isn’t the case this time around! DLC trophy lists don’t carry a Platinum, so it’s a level playing field for once.</p>



<p>If you are on PS5, it’s broken down into 10 Bronze Trophies and 1 Silver Trophy. Happy hunting, soldiers.</p>



<p>Let us know what you think of the extra list. Should more live-service games add more trophies and achievements as DLC lists?

		<p>Tower survivor roguelite Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road has been given a release date by Ludogram and Raw Fury, with the game coming on November 20th. There is a demo available on Steam, which will remain available even after the game is launched.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road | Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kVZpnNukOU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road you need to defend a moving city from an endless army of monsters that want to tear the city down. To fight back, you need to gather resources like wood, stone, and gold to use to invest in defences, upgrades, and abilities to take on threats from small monsters to big bosses.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/monsters-are-coming-preview-tower-survivor-mash-up/">Monsters are Coming! so it’s time to get this addictive Tower-Survivor rolling</a></h2>
<p>In our preview of Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road, Stefan wrote, <em>“Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road, to use its full title once more, is absolutely the kind of game I can see myself losing hours and hours to. Tower defence and bullet heaven survival games are already so satisfying in their own right, and their progeny promises much the same. I’m definitely very keen to play more, with Ludogram currently holding a closed beta test to refine it even further.”</em></p>

<p>Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road will be released for PC and Xbox Series X|S. Additionally, it has been verified for Steam Deck and the Xbox ROG Ally.</p>

		<p>The Adepta Sororitas are coming to dish out the Emperor’s justice in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2</a>, with the boomer shooter sequel letting you choose between the returning Space Marine Malum Caedo, and new character Nyra Veyrath, one of the Sisters of Battle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 - Sister of Battle Extended Cut Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-MAMOJqgiaM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Sisters of Battle are more than capable of holding their own in battle, despite having nowhere near the augmentations of the Adeptus Astartes – it’s all mad religious fervour and zeal powering their combat prowess.</p>
<p>In Boltgun 2, Nyra doesn’t have the same level of armour as a Space Marine, but she’s much more agile and can use speed, precision and just setting everything on fire to get ahead.</p>


<p>Boltgun 2 will follow on directly from the end of the first game, giving you a new branching single-player campaign to rampage through, blasting heretics, Chaos Space Marines, demons and everyone else that gets in your way. There’s new Blooletters, demonic Juggernauts and more on the way. The new campaign will visit new worlds, going from the heights of a hive city to the mangrove swamps of a jungle.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun launched in 2023 and was a great slice of old school FPS action, blended with the increasingly popular Warhammer 40,000 universe. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">our Boltgun review</a>, Dom said, “Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is a brisk, brutal boomer shooter and another great reason for a visit to Games Workshop’s science fiction theatre.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Simon says spells</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section><section><p>If you're an adventure game fan of a certain age, you’ll have a place in your heart for <strong>Simon the Sorcerer</strong>. Part of the first major wave of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-point-and-click-adventure-games-for-nintendo-switch">point-and-click adventures</a> back in the late '80s and early '90s, Simon offered a goofy British counterpart to <strong>Monkey Island</strong>’s swashbuckling comedy.</p>
<p>The series now returns with a faithfully written prequel that will delight long-time fans. Telling the tale of the titular conjurer's beginnings as a magical chosen one, we follow Simon as he gets lost in a fantastical world, learns to wield magic, and meets his long-term antagonist, Sordid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/simon_the_sorcerer_origins">Simon the Sorcerer Origins</a> has all the charm of its predecessors and even brings back <strong>Red Dwarf</strong> actor Chris Barrie, who voiced Simon in the first two games. The dialogue is funny, cynical, and very British. Rick Astley even pops up on the soundtrack for nostalgia-tinged opening credits sequence.</p>
<p>Our sarcastic hero is constantly breaking the fourth wall. At one point, a waypoint appears on your map, only to come crashing down into the actual environment. Elsewhere, Simon frequently looks straight at the player to comment on the ridiculously contrived situations the developers have put him in.</p>
<p>Those situations follow the tried-and-true point-and-click formula of hunting down items and finding ways to use or combine them to fulfil an ever-increasing set of goals. Your bottomless wizard hat stores things of all shapes and sizes. How you use these items in puzzle-solving is seldom straightforward, staying true to the genre’s tradition of clever frustration.</p>
<p>While obtuse solutions are expected of '90s-inspired adventure titles, the logic-stretching still frustrates on occasion. Areas are large enough that it can become a chore to wander through environments, trying all your inventory on everything around you.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a user-friendly interface and control scheme make cycling between interactable objects a breeze. Gone is the tedious pixel hunting of yesteryear; now you can flick between points of interest with the shoulder buttons, or reveal everything in the area with a push of the shoulder button.</p>
<p>There's an alternate control system for those who want a bit more of the original's cursor manipulation. Additionally, undocked mode makes full use of the touchscreen. A hint system would have been a good quality-of-life feature, but Simon will occasionally comment on potential solutions.</p>
<p>The hand-drawn artwork is charming, if occasionally clunky. The aesthetic recalls <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/return_to_monkey_island">Return to Monkey Island</a> in its stylised interpretation of the ScummVM-powered heyday. Animation can feel stiff at times, and when the camera zooms in too close, the art does not always hold up under scrutiny.</p>
<p>That being said, Simon the Sorcerer: Origins is a solid return for a beloved series, and the developers at Smallthing Studios seem more than capable of carrying on these magical adventures.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/simon-the-sorcerer-origins]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-far-behind-battlefield-6-on-steam-preorders">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, based on data provided by <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/">Alinea Analytics</a>, shows that in the lead-up to launch, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 trails "<em>far behind</em>" the numbers that <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> was able to pull.</p>



<p>Setting the parameters here: this is based on data from Steam pre-order sales for Battlefield 6 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, 18 days ahead of their respective launches. Within that 18-day lead-up period, Battlefield 6 was able to sell close to a million copies in pre-orders. Black Ops 7 has only managed 200K pre-order copies sold.</p>



<p>These numbers start to look even worse when placed beside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-weeks-from-release-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-isnt-in-steams-top-150-wishlisted-games-is-it-time-for-activison-to-worry">Eurogamer</a> report that spotted Black Ops 7 in the 173rd spot for Steam wishlists. It more or less paints a picture of a player base that isn't exactly looking forward to this year's entry in the long-running annual shooter franchise.</p>



<p>Of course, a few caveats, including the fact that not everyone buying Black Ops 7 on PC will do so through Steam, and that this only accounts for PC players, which says nothing of what pre-orders will be on consoles. There's also the fact that Black Ops 7 will be available on <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-removed-10-discount-on-call-of-duty-add-ons-cod-points-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers/">Xbox Game Pass for Ultimate tier subscribers,</a> which, there may be less of since the recent price increase, but that still represents a subset of players who won't pre-order because they don't need to, they know they'll play Black Ops 7 right at launch.</p>



<p>It's also difficult to really count Call of Duty out. Battlefield 6 has made some impressive strides, like how its concurrent player count on Steam has yet to fall below <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/#max">300K according to SteamDB</a>, the fact that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/">sold 7 million copies in just three days</a> (according to Alinea Analytics in this report, Battlefield 6 has now passed 10 million copies), and how at least in the EU, Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-eu-launch-sales/">beat out the launch sales for last year's Black Ops 6</a>.</p>



<p>But even that comes with a caveat because last year was the first time Call of Duty was available through Xbox Game Pass. So once again, it's difficult to say that the current fighting shape of Battlefield 6 is enough to topple Call of Duty in its peak form.</p>



<p>Particularly because it can easily be argued that Call of Duty is not in peak form, with the game in an <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">ongoing identity crisis</a>. EA and Battlefield Studios are trying to take every advantage they can, and the fact that Battlefield 6 currently has an edge in pre-order sales with the PC shooter player base is definitely a point in favor of Battlefield, but empires like Call of Duty aren't toppled overnight.</p>



<p>"<em>Call of Duty has an entrenched global audience across consoles and PC - including more casual gamers - that purchases the game each</em> <em>year out of habit and brand loyalty</em>," Rhys Elliot, head of market analysis at Alinea Analytics told GI.Biz. "<em>Its causal player base dwarfs Battlefield's, and its integration with Warzone ensures that millions of players are constantly exposed to marketing, in-game promotions, and social tie-ins that convert attention into purchases.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Even if Black Ops 7 feels less</em> <em>exciting to us and the enthusiast media, the sheer reach of Call of Duty's ecosystem - through cross-promotion, platform partnerships, and content cycles - guarantees massive sales volume once the game launches</em>."</p>



<p>And of course, that'll be the ultimate test. When we have sales numbers for November 2025 and player engagement figures from the usual suspects (Newzoo, Circana, Alinea Analytics, GSD, etc.), will Battlefield 6 stand above Black Ops 7 in regional or global charts? That'll likely depend more on what players continue to see out of Battlefield, than what Call of Duty brings to the table.</p>



<p>Today, Battlefield 6 launched its Season 1 update, which included new weapons, vehicles, a new Conquest map, the launch of its first battle pass, and, most importantly, Battlefield REDSEC, the battle royale mode tied to Battlefield 6. This 100-player mode is EA and Battlefield Studios' response to Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>So far, it's off to a strong start with over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/#48h">500K concurrent players on Steam</a>. If things continue to go well, then even if Battlefield 6 isn't able to beat out Black Ops 7 on the charts where it matters, it will have gained a win on perhaps the more important battle, the one within players minds that'll now clearly ring out: there's something else besides Call of Duty that's worth playing and buying going forward.</p>



<p>That said, to match the launch of REDSEC, Activision made Black Ops 6 multiplayer and zombies free for players to try out. The modes you'll usually have to pay for will be free until November 3.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dont-nod-netflix-major-ip-game-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-nod-bringing-a-%E2%80%9Cmajor-ip%E2%80%9D-to-gaming-for-netflix.1337404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Don’t Nod, the studio behind Life is Strange, is working with Netflix on a new narrative-driven game. Furthermore, the title is said to be of a ‘major existing IP’.</p>



<p>If you’ve played any big narrative games this past decade, chances are a Don’t Nod title was one of them. From the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-20-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the iconic Life is Strang</a>e series, the French developer/publisher has quickly become one to watch. Now, in its half-year sales report, the company has a new collaboration: Netflix.</p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-and-don-t-nod-working-on-a-new-existing-franchise-based-game">Netflix and Don’t Nod Working on a New Existing Franchise-Based Game</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Don’t Nod announced its half-year results for 2025 in <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new press release</a>. The company reported that it more than tripled revenue, releasing games like Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage. While the title didn’t meet sales expectations, upcoming projects like The Lonesome Guild and Aphelion hope to turn the tide. However, the biggest news comes with the announcement of a collaboration with Netflix. The company stated that the narrative-driven project is in development at its Montreal studio. It will be published by Netflix and be based on a ‘major IP’. </p>



<p>As to what that IP may be, there are certainly a few possibilities. Personally, with the style of Lost Records, Stranger Things is a no-brainer for Don’t Nod. Given how it fits the mystery/sci-fi genre it mastered with Life is Strange, it’ll feel right at home. However, Netflix is home to many major franchises like Bridgerton, Outer Banks, Bird Box, and Wednesday, so there are plenty of options. It’ll be exciting to see how it turns out, as I’m both a fan of Don’t Nod’s work and Netflix’s catalog. </p>

<section><p>The N64 game's unconventional three-day time limit added an emotional touch to the storytelling that wouldn't have been possible with a more traditional narrative structure.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask celebrated its 25-year anniversary on October 26, 2025. Below, we examine how it leveraged its unconventional time-travel element to tell some memorable stories.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Even a series as storied as The Legend of Zelda has produced a black sheep or two in its long history, but perhaps no installment is as divisive as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/" data-ref-id="5000-1271">Majora's Mask</a>. The second Zelda title released for the Nintendo 64 and the follow-up to the universally acclaimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/" data-ref-id="5000-1272">Ocarina of Time</a>, Majora's Mask retained much of its predecessor's mechanics and assets, but it reframed them with a recurring three-day structure that proved to be controversial among fans at the time. But while this unconventional time loop contributed to the game's divisive reputation, it also gives it a unique identity among the series, and is the reason the game remains so moving more than two decades later.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Majora's Mask revolves heavily around time travel, it was not the first Zelda game to explore the concept. Time also plays a central role in Ocarina of Time, embodied in the eponymous instrument that allows Link to access the inner chamber of the Temple of Time and retrieve the Master Sword. Once he pulls the sword from its pedestal, he can freely trek back and forth between two distinct ages: his idyllic childhood, and the dark future that awaits Hyrule.</p><p dir="ltr">Majora's Mask, however, takes a much more fluid approach to time travel than its predecessor, giving Link a greater degree of control over the flow of time itself. Whereas Ocarina of Time had him repeatedly traveling between past and future to ultimately thwart Ganon, Majora's Mask sees Link reliving the same three days as he attempts to stop the moon from careening into the world of Termina. Should time run out before he can complete his mission, he'll have to use the Ocarina of Time to turn back the clock to the first day, buying himself another 72 hours to fulfill his quest--while also undoing all of the work he had accomplished.</p><p dir="ltr">This strict time limit imbues the adventure with a sense of urgency. Fail to clear a temple before the end of the third day and you'll have no choice but to rewind the clock and begin the entire cycle anew, resetting not only your supplies, but the progress you'd made. Puzzles you had completed would be undone, quests would be reset, and characters you had met would lose all memory of the encounter. Not everything reverted with the clock; some key items--and the insights you gained along the way--carried over, but you effectively started from square one every time you rewound back to the first day. This gives the game a distinct flavor compared to Ocarina of Time, twisting its familiar gameplay loop into a unique shape that sets it apart from the rest of the series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTv_p5hEu0A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fTv_p5hEu0A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">But as much as the time-travel mechanic changes the complexion of the gameplay, its biggest impact can be felt in the storytelling. Nintendo leveraged Majora's Mask's time loop brilliantly when crafting the game's narrative, utilizing the repeating three-day structure to explore more personal, human stories that couldn't be conveyed through a traditional linear narrative.</p><p dir="ltr">Because the game adheres to a strict time limit, every non-playable character Link encounters in Termina follows a particular routine, which reinforces the perception that they are all going about their lives, whether or not you are around to witness them. The postman diligently makes his rounds every morning and afternoon; the traveling performers hang about the inn by day and rehearse in the square by night; and certain shops only open at specific times. These routines offer an intimate look into the lives of the various denizens of Clock Town, which in turn strengthens your attachment to them.</p><p dir="ltr">Importantly, these routines are not immutable. By interacting with certain characters at specific moments, you could change their trajectory for the remainder of that cycle. Without Link's intervention, for instance, the elderly woman from the bomb shop is destined to be robbed on the night of the first day, preventing the store from stocking the larger bomb bag she's carrying. By learning where and when the crime will occur, however, Link can be in the right place at the right time to drive off the thief, ensuring the item is delivered (and earning a rare mask for his troubles). Depending on how you go about apprehending the criminal, you can even inadvertently blow him up, which not only destroys the bomb bag he'd stolen, but also prevents you from completing a related side quest later on in the cycle.</p><p dir="ltr">This loop--reliving the same three days and witnessing every possible fate that could befall the characters you meet--adds emotional depth to the game's many side quests, and it leads to some of the most poignant moments the series has ever conjured. The plight of Anju and Kafei, the betrothed couple who are separated by mysterious circumstances just before their wedding day, receives the most attention and praise thanks to its complexity, an extensive and emotional mystery that takes several three-day cycles to fully unravel. But the most heartrending side story revolves around Cremia and her younger sister Romani, the owners of the ranch to the south of Clock Town.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4592849-9437972220-WiiUV.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592849" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4592849-9437972220-WiiUV.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592849"></a><figcaption>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4592849-9437972220-WiiUV.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite its proximity to the city, you're unable to enter the ranch until the third day, as the main road leading into it has been blocked off by a giant boulder. By the time the boulder is removed and the trail is finally reopened, you find both Cremia and Romani mysteriously sullen; neither speaks much, and from the few words they do say, you can vaguely glean that some kind of tragedy had befallen the ranch and its livestock.</p><p dir="ltr">What happened to the pair remains a mystery until later in the game, when you obtain the Goron mask and are permitted to use the explosive Powder Keg, which allows you to destroy the boulder early and enter the ranch on the first day. At this point, you learn the pair are dealing with two interconnected dilemmas. Cremia mentions ongoing harassment from the rival ranch down the road, while young Romani enlists your aid to defend the ranch's cows from a mysterious pack of "ghosts" that invade at night. The ensuing story is one of the more fraught and involved sequences in the game, spanning all three days and requiring deft playing to aid the pair during their respective quests.</p><p dir="ltr">Even if you do manage to successfully resolve Cremia and Romani's dilemmas, however, there is still a sense of sadness lingering over the ranch come the third day. With the townsfolk planning to shelter in place there later that night, Cremia confides in Link that she is fully aware that not even the ranch is safe from the destruction the moon will wreak, and resignedly accepts the fate that awaits everyone. Romani, however, is too young to comprehend the coming apocalypse. Rather than tell her of what will happen, Cremia offers Romani her first chance to have a Chateau Romani--the ranch's specialty milk drink that is exclusively reserved for adults. And on the night of the third day, just as the pair are set to retire for the final time before the moon falls, Cremia tells Link that they'll both see him tomorrow, never letting on to Romani that the world is about to end.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a heartrending scene, especially after all the trials you've endured with the pair, and is a poignant example of why Majora's Mask remains such a captivating experience even 25 years on from its original release. Although the game's unique time loop may have been divisive among fans at the time, it allowed Nintendo to explore themes and stories it couldn't as powerfully convey with a traditional linear narrative, making Majora's Mask one of the most emotionally resonant--and enduring--games the company has ever released.</p>

<p>Lunar Software has been working on Routine since 2013 though the game disappeared from the public eye for a long time, getting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/09/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-re-revealed-with-a-creepy-new-trailer/">&nbsp;re-revealed in 2022. </a>Routine is a first person sci-fi horror game set on an abandoned lunar base featuring plenty of retro analogue technology as you go face to face with a terrifying threat. Here’s a little bit of bullet pointed blurb from Lunar Software:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigate a retro-analogue future</strong>&nbsp;– Roam through contrasting sectors of the Lunar station, from abandoned malls to deteriorating living quarters.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive design and gameplay&nbsp;</strong>– Full body awareness, diegetic audio, and a minimal UI create a gripping and atmospheric experience.</li>
<li><strong>Explore using tools</strong>&nbsp;– The Cosmonaut Assistance Tool (C.A.T.) is vital, and players must use it to access critical terminals, navigate the environment and identify clues.</li>
<li><strong>Survive the unknown&nbsp;</strong>– Run, hide, or attempt to defend against threats, using the C.A.T. as a last resort.</li>
</ul>
