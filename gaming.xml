          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">Microsoft laid off thousands of workers</a> across the company, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">major Xbox studio cuts and even a studio closure</a>. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has stated that the cuts were necessary and that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">Xbox needs to be a sustainable business</a>. Now, Raphael Colantonio--one of the co-founders of Arcane Studios--has reacted to the wave of layoffs and argued that Microsoft's Game Pass strategy is "unsustainable" and bad for the industry's long-term health.</p><p>"I think [Game Pass] is an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by MS's 'infinite money,'" write Colantonio on <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941512826687980019" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>. "But at some point reality has to hit. I don't think GP can coexist with other models. They'll either kill everyone else, or give up."</p><p>Colantonio added that he is also "<a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941516413803581493" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fed up</a>" with Microsoft's assertions that Game Pass doesn't affect the sales of games. In <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941929277189976439" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a later post</a>, Colantonio wrote that he can explain at length "why the [math doesn't] work for most publishers/devs, nor for Xbox once they stop investing."</p><p>Raccoon Logic studio head Alex Hutchinson <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-who-launched-game-into-game-pass-warns-against-launching-games-into-game-pass/1100-6532306/" data-ref-id="1100-6532306">spoke out about Game Pass devaluing games</a> earlier this year after his game Revenge of the Savage Planet was a day-one title on Xbox Game Pass. Conversely, Rebellion <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-release-atomfall-was-immediately-profitable-report/1100-6531671/" data-ref-id="1100-6531671">touted the launch of Atomfall on Game Pass</a> as a huge success for the company. Earlier this year, Id Software co-founder <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-doesnt-hurt-game-companies-says-doom-co-creator/1100-6529136/" data-ref-id="1100-6529136">John Romero endorsed Game Pass</a> as the Netflix for gamers. Romero's studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-and-quake-veterans-new-fps-loses-funding-with-microsoft-seemingly-to-blame/1100-6532939/" data-ref-id="1100-6532939">had funding pulled from its project</a> just last week, with many inferring Microsoft was responsible. It's unclear if the studio will continue to operate in any capacity.</p><p>Regardless, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford recently stated that it will probably be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-borderlands-4-to-hit-game-pass-or-be-dirt-cheap-for-many-years/1100-6532782/" data-ref-id="1100-6532782">years before Borderlands 4 hits Game Pass</a>. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has specifically said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-launching-new-games-into-a-subscription-service-like-game-pass-makes-no-sense/1100-6509015/" data-ref-id="1100-6509015">day-one launches on Game Pass do not make sense</a> for the company.</p>

Meanwhile, EA Play subscribers can also gain early access to College Football 26, but you'll be limited to a 10-hour trial of the game. When the trial ends, you'll still need to purchase the full game to continue playing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>FBC: Firebreak is an unusual game. Returning to The Oldest House from Control, but this time as a scrappy bunch of volunteer janitors, you have to confront the Hiss-controlled hordes and a slew of existential threats that are as mundane as they are potentially deadly.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak – Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t4YyeHT7spE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you come to it expecting a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/26/control-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Control</a>-themed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2009/11/28/review-left-4-dead-2/">Left 4 Dead</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/03/27/warhammer-vermintide-2-review/">Vermintide</a>, you’ll instead be confronted by something that’s rather different. It’s a little bit Helldivers in some ways, more like horde shooters in others, and with the kind of spooky shenanigans vibe that has permeated the recent wave of co-op horror games like REPO and Lethal Company. Unfortunately, it doesn’t really match up to any of these comparisons.</p>


<p>There’s five missions currently in the game that blend the humdrum with the otherworldly in some very imaginative ways… but it doesn’t quite break through the barrier to make them interesting to play in the long run.</p>
<p>Take the Paper Chase mission, where spooky sticky notes have infested a floor of The Oldest House, covering anything and everything in sight. You have to get rid of them, but the ways you can do so feel so utterly ineffectual as you either shoot them or run through and collect them on yourself – slowing you down in the process – and have to go take a shower to wash them away. That kind of idea is fed through the other stages as well, as you power up turbines, collect radioactive orbs from gloopy wall things, battle through pink…. stuff to reactivate some mechanisms.</p>


<p>The problem is that the structure is so formulaic, with only a small amount of randomisation to mix things up. You start with a small or medium sized area and clear/collect/fix up enough of that stage’s objective to allow access to the next area. This is larger, but now you do the same again with a bigger number to clear. It builds up to the final area which can be a boss fight, rocket launch or similar, and then you have to hustle back to the start point to extract, likely defeating a named Hiss enemy on the way.</p>
<p>There’s really only a handful of different enemies that you’ll encounter, which doesn’t help much with variety. Hordes of Hiss-controlled spanner guys rush you for melee, there’s gun-toting security guards, and floating office chair people for the regular bunch. They’re boosted by bomb squad guys, and then a couple of special enemies, but there’s none of the variety of Left 4 Dead’s special infected, let alone the sheer terror of a Tank appearing. You’ll have some hairy moments, especially when you’re covered in sticky notes or pink gloop, but it always feels like you can handle it by tactically retreating to healing shower stations.</p>
<p>At higher difficulties, you can enable Corrupted Item modifiers, throwing some haunted objects into a level that float around the areas, including a gravity-altering globe map, a snare drum that speeds up enemies, a freezing post box and plenty more. They bring some fun twists and added challenges, but they all have one solution: find the Black Rock Launcher in a safe room or at an ammo station, and then blast the heck out of it.</p>

<p>There’s three player classes –&nbsp;the Fix Kit, Jump Kit and Splash Kit –&nbsp;each of which has a specific and delightfully weird bit of kit, with electric prods, water cannons and fast-fixing spanners. There’s some nice synergies between them, so you can douse enemies with one class and then spark ’em up with another, and their specific additional kit and supers also have different situational uses,</p>
<p>Thankfully Remedy reacted quickly to initial complaints over the game’s introduction. At launch, you were really thrown in the deep end with no explanation over the weird kit classes you could choose, and were forced into a slow level unlock process playing only the first area of a stage, then the first two before the full level was available. It was…. weird. You can now just play a full stage right away, and this is the better approach.</p>
<p>There’s still plenty of muddled design within FBC: Firebreak, though. You unlock perks, abilities and weapon upgrades and cosmetics using research files and level-specific materials that you collect. Levelling up with XP merely unlocks perk slots on the kit you’re using, and and grants access to more perks to throw materials at. The UI for all of this is just a bit too confusing. Going back and forth between the perks research screen and loadout rearranges the icons based on what you’ve unlocked, and it took me forever to understand how to use Resonance.</p>

<p>Resonance is hugely powerful in this game, encouraging you to stick together to boost your team shields at the base level. Perks can also be shared with nearby allies, so you get all of the bullet boosting effects, improved survivability, repairing boosts, and so much more. But first you need to unlock a perk through its three tiers –&nbsp;Weak, Strong and Resonant –&nbsp;and then equip it at the Resonant level, taking up more perk slots to do so. Perhaps its using a controller-oriented UI with a mouse and keyboard on PC, but this took me far, far too long to actually understand. I’m completely unsurprised that Remedy has found a tiny percentage of players actually using perks at this tier.</p>

<figure><a title="Mega Man 35th Anniversary Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/20c388e4a9c34/mega-man-35th-anniversary-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Mega Man is one of the most recognisable video game characters out there. And while Capcom's beloved Blue Bomber hasn't had a brand new game since 2018's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_11">Mega Man 11</a>, the Japanese developer insists that he's "one of our most important IPs".</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/assets/pdf/stock/2025capcom_c.pdf">Capcom's 46th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders Q&amp;A</a>, the company was asked directly about plans it has for the Mega Man series.</p>
<p>The response is, predictably, a little vague, but Capcom acknowledges Mega Man's importance. "The Mega Man series is one of our most important IPs, and we are continuously considering ways to develop it further," the notes state.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wolpys&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>However, as for the future of the series, there's nothing to report: "we do not have any additional<br>
information we can share at this time."</p>
<p>It's not as if Capcom has forgotten about Mega Man, of course; we got the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_battle_network_legacy_collection">Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection</a>, a compilation of the GBA grid-based RPGs from the 2000s, in 2023, and <strong><a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/megaman/xdive-offline/en-us/">Mega Man X DiVE</a></strong> is playable offline on mobiles.</p>

<p>But the fact that it's been more than seven years since a mainline Mega Man game is a little bit of a sting for fans, surely. But Mega Man 11 is also the series' best-selling game, and it reached the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/capcoms-best-selling-mega-man-game-reaches-another-sales-milestone1">2 million milestone earlier this year</a>.</p>
<div><p>Capcom at least is aware of the character's popularity worldwide, and told shareholders that, regarding merchandise "we receive a particularly high volume of inquiries about the Mega Man series from overseas markets" and that the company "will continue to focus on expanding this business further."</p><p>

If you want some Mega Man action on your Switch 2, you can obviously dig out those Legacy Collections, but if you have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, you can actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/psa-you-can-play-one-of-the-greatest-platformers-of-all-time-in-street-fighter-6">play one of the NES games in-game there</a>.</p></div>

And yes, that $91 million is impressive, but it’s still less than  the last three films earned during their opening weekends. </p><p>Overseas, <em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em> has been even more successful, bringing in $171 million during the film’s first five days in theaters.

However, this time around, the film has a brand new cast of characters, is set in a new location, and includes some new, mutated dinosaur hybrid monsters. After the events of the last <em>Jurassic World</em> trilogy, dinosaurs have mostly died out and are now only found on islands around the equator. A team of mercenaries and a stranded family land on one particular island that has giant dinos, where the plan is to grab their blood to create a powerful new medicine. But things don’t go as planned, and people get eaten. </p><p>The movie has received mixed reviews from critics, but fans seem to love it. Do they love it enough to help <em>Rebirth </em>hit a billion? Not sure. All of the previous <em>Jurassic World</em> movies hit a billion dollars by the end of their runs. We’ll have to wait and see if <em>Rebirth </em>matches that, but for now, it’s looking pretty likely. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-box-office-scarlett-johansson-1851785708]]></content:encoded>

Scott accused Hall of leveraging the latter’s big viewership to misinterpret and spread falsehoods about the “Stop Killing Games” initiative, in part by casting it as naïve and unworkable in the modern gaming landscape where always-online and server-centric releases are flopping all the time. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedrama/comments/1emf1cr/thor_piratesoftware_posts_a_response_to_the_stop/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedrama/comments/1emf1cr/thor_piratesoftware_posts_a_response_to_the_stop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It wasn’t the first time</a></span> Scott and Hall went into a tit-for-tat post-and-response spree on YouTube, but it may have been the most beneficial for the “Stop Killing Games” movement. Scott’s video, which elicited <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Scary_Triangle/status/1937355553447043233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Scary_Triangle/status/1937355553447043233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a fresh round of debate from Hall</a></span>, netted over 750,000 views. More importantly, other big names started chiming in.

At the very least, the goal is to prevent companies from taking away games that people already bought by revoking licenses.

Unless something changes, no one will be able to play it ever again following that server shutdown. </p><p>The re-energized “Stop Killing Games” campaign has even elicited a full rebuttal by the European game industry lobbying group Video Games Europe, which represents all the biggest companies from Microsoft and Epic Games to Roblox and Warner Bros. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameseurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VGE-Position-Discontinuation-of-Support-to-Online-Games-04072025.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VGE-Position-Discontinuation-of-Support-to-Online-Games-04072025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The five-page response argues</a></span> that preservation protections would, among other things,  place burdensome limits on game makers, lead to even more costs as game budgets are skyrocketing, and even create issues for player safety and privacy. </p><p> “As rightsholders and economic entities, video games companies must remain free to decide when an online game is no longer commercially viable and to end continued server support for that game. Imposing a legal obligation to continue server support indefinitely, or to develop online video games in a specific technical manner that will allow permanent use, will raise the costs and risks of developing such games,” the lobbying group claims. It also states that companies are already committed to “serious professional efforts to preserve video games.”</p><p>It lists companies investing in their own video game collections as one such effort, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://embracergamesarchive.com/about/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://embracergamesarchive.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linking to Embracer’s private archive</a></span>.

The developers would have explored the angles of CPU and GPU load, as well as memory usage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No reason was given for the cancellation, but speculation has swirled around whether this is related to harassment the developers have faced over Monster Hunter Wilds. The PC version of Wilds, specifically, has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-mixed-steam-user-review-rating-capcom-issues-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-troubleshooting-guide">garnered criticism since launch</a>, prompting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-director-commits-to-addressing-stability-issues-with-pc-improvements-coming-in-title-update-1">commitments to improvements and updates</a> from the team at Capcom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the release of Title Update 2, planned adjustments were hoped to have fixed the problem. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-takes-aim-at-performance-woes-but-opinions-vary-on-whether-it-worked">Results seemed varied</a>, however, and Capcom released a statement addressing several major bugs and issues <a href="https://x.com/MH_Wilds/status/1941110323005857917" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Twitter/X</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all this, though, Capcom <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/support/faq/information_info2025_0266919.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also put out a statement on its official site</a>, responding to what sounds like a more extreme degree of feedback. Per Automaton, Capcom said its staff have faced harassment through social media and customer support channels, including targeted threats against individuals. The company reportedly warned that it will take legal action in severe cases of harassment against employees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So while no official reason was given for the lecture's cancellation, the alignment of these events certainly suggests that concerns over harassment played a role. And it should go without saying that critique and feedback are worthwhile, but these extremes do worse than nothing, and certainly won't assist in tuning Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Wilds itself, Title Update 2 recently went live, and players do seem to be enjoying the addition of several new hunts, especially <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-next-update-adds-the-long-awaited-lagiacrus">the bout with Lagiacrus</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-cancels-lecture-on-monster-hunter-wilds-optimization-amid-harassment-concerns]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-version-0-10-0-is-now-available-introducing-major-new-feature-for-more-accurate-emulation-of-bloodborne-and-other-game.1237314/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, introducing a major new feature that allows for more accurate emulation of multiple games, including FromSoftware's Bloodborne.</p>



<p>The 0.10.0 update, which can be downloaded from the emulator's official website, is packed with a lot of core, libraries, shader recompiler, GPU and GUI improvements, but the biggest improvement, as highlighted in the blog post announcing the release of the new version of the emulator, is the introduction of readbacks, which emulates the shared memory on the PlayStation 4 by reading back memory that was modified on the GPU back to the CPU side, making several games function properly. For example, with this new feature, vertex explosions in Bloodborne and other games should function properly now, as should Trico's climbing ability in The Last Guardian. However, the feature isn't enabled by default, as it is still very experimental and can create issues in games, including performance issues, and, as such, has to be enabled manually via the emulator's config files.</p>



<p>Speaking about The Last Guardian, one of the PlayStation 4 exclusives that still hasn't received an official PC port, the ShadPS4 emulator made some excellent progress emulating the game even before the launch of the new version of the emulator, as showcased in a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM">BrutalSam</a> which also shows the great progress that's been done in other PS4 exclusives like Driveclub and Killzone Shadow Fall. All three games aren't in a perfect state yet, but the progress is nonetheless impressive, considering the game barely launched on the emulator a few weeks back.</p>

            <p>The Stop Killing Games campaign's <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">petition to the European Commission</a> surpassed a million signatures <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake">last week</a>, meaning EU policymakers may soon be debating whether developers and publishers should have the option to render online games unplayable by shutting down their servers. Video Games Europe, a trade association who represent publishers and devs, have responded by outlining why they think that choice should stay on the table.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how any proper debates on the topic go, but the response is worth reading if you're still trying to decide where exactly you stand on the issue YouTuber Ross Scott and <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">have been campaigning about</a> since Ubisoft pulled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> offline.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Video Games Europe, whose <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/about/our-board/">board</a> is currently chaired by Warner Bros Games publishing senior vice president Hester Woodliffe, <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/statement-on-stop-killing-games/">argue</a> that the call to shut up shop "must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable."</p>
<p>"We understand that it can be disappointing for players," they continue, "but, when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws.</p>
<p>"Private servers are not always a viable alternative option for players as the protections we put in place to secure players’ data, remove illegal content, and combat unsafe community content would not exist and would leave rights holders liable," the statement goes on. "In addition, many titles are designed from the ground-up to be online-only; in effect, these proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create.</p>
<p>"We welcome the opportunity to discuss our position with policy makers and those who have led the European Citizens Initiative in the coming months."</p>
<p>The body, whose board also includes representatives from Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, have published a <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VGE-Position-Discontinuation-of-Support-to-Online-Games-04072025.pdf">longer doc</a> alongside that statement, going into more detail about the effects of requiring publishers to either maintain online support while folks are still playing, or come up with an end-of-life plan that leaves the game still playable.</p>
<p>They make ten points in total, two centred around "player safety", three about the potential "impact on companies", and five concerning a possible impact on the intellectual property rights companies have to their games.</p>
<p>The main concerns boil down to the stuff you'd expect: money and the lack of control publishers would have over community-run private servers, were they to wind down support and 'hand things over' to players that wished to keep a game going. In addition to any bottom line impact, they say there would need to be a new legal framework for people doing things with games without direct support or oversight from the company who made the game, and are still somewhat liable for it.</p>
<p>Right now, there are plenty of grey areas that, as we regularly see with the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-are-set-to-introduce-adult-mod-age-verification-for-uk-and-eu-users-soon">modding</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/emulation">emulation</a>, don't tend to jive with the sort of legal surety many companies want, at least in terms of protecting themselves from potential action or headaches over products.</p>
<p>It's stuff Stop Killing Games will need to have strong answers for if they hope to succeed in turning their campaign's goals into concrete laws or rules. To be fair to the consumer group, <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/faq">the FAQ section</a> of their website does address or outline viewpoints on a bunch of areas that Video Games Europe has raised here, as well as citing the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gran-turismo">Gran Turismo</a> Sport and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/knockout-city">Knockout City</a> as examples of games whose online support was ended "in a responsible way".</p>

<p>Scott has also put out a video response to VGE's statement. In it, he goes through the shorter statement, but not the full document, outlining ways he believes these concerns or issues could be addressed - for example by adding to electronic user license agreement docs.</p>
<p>Scott claimed that the points made by VGE are "bad faith arguments", and has called on eligible supporters to contact members of European parliament about the campaign. Scott stresses in the video that he won't be the one debating this directly with EU politicians and groups like VGE, because he's not eligible to be the EU campaign's official spokesperson.</p>
<p>We'll have to see how it all plays out, but I for one look forward to reviews of The Crew potentially having to be read out in European parliament.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-only-games-prohibitively-expensive-to-create-argue-eu-lobby-group]]></content:encoded>

However, you’ll come across some battles with support enemies that can buff or heal other foes in the fight. In these cases, always <strong>focus your attention on the support enemy to make the battle go more smoothly</strong>. Nothing sucks worse than dishing out huge damage on a baddie just to see it get healed back up right after. </p><h2 id="h77288"><a id="3"></a>Always be building something in Norende Village</h2><p>Rebuilding Norende Village is one of the most important parts of your playthrough of <em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</em>.

It takes a long time to upgrade everything, so you want to be making the most of every second.</p><p>One thing that can be helpful to remember—especially early on when you have limited villagers and the time to rebuild something can be in excess of 10 hours—is that <strong>you can leave the game open overnight to help you work through the longer building processes</strong>. Even if your Nintendo Switch 2 goes to sleep, you’ll still be making progress due to the game continuing in real time as long as the game is active on the console.</p><h2 id="h77289"><a id="4"></a>Keep an eye on Tutorial Quests and Achievements</h2><p>If you like getting free stuff, <strong>complete all of the Tutorial Quests and Achievements</strong>. Visit this menu frequently by clicking Right on the D-Pad and selecting the icon that looks like a bulletin board. When you complete a quest here, you’ll earn items or gear that can be extremely useful on your journey. A random recovery item here and there may not seem like much, but it adds up in a game that can be rather demanding at times.</p><h2 id="h77290"><a id="5"></a>Play the game your way</h2><p><em>Bravely Default</em> offers a variety of difficulty options. These settings can change up the experience pretty wildly.. Whether you want a breezier playthrough, a normal challenge, or a brutal experience, there’s no wrong answer. </p><figure id="" data-id="d57c1e1fd90ecd90d0a25730093195a8" data-recommend-id="image://d57c1e1fd90ecd90d0a25730093195a8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A difficulty option lets the player adjust how frequently random fights occur.

			<p>A new nine-minute clip of <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/mafia-the-old-country-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-return-of-the-gangster-franchise/">Mafia: The Old Country</a> gameplay has debuted through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9sqrkte-QQ">IGN</a> that showcases protagonist Enzo embarking on a mission to bring in an enemy of Don Salieri alive.</p>



<p>The mission begins with a short cutscene where Enzo gets the order from Don Salieri himself, presenting Enzo with a chance to prove himself to Salieri and to the rest of the family. Enzo is then escorted to where he can gear up to deal with the "<em>pest problem</em>," which is how the members of the family refer to his assignment. Once he's chosen the proper tools for the job, we get a good look at the Italian countryside while Enzo drives to his target's home.</p>



<p>When he gets there, we get a good look at some stealth combat before all hell breaks loose and Enzo is exchanging bullets with guards, giving us a better look at the third-person gunplay in Mafia: The Old Country. Once he reaches his target, the gameplay fades out before the cutscene finishes, as Enzo knocks his target unconcious.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Even with this clip being cut in areas where developer Hangar 13 clearly wanted to keep things hidden, it's still the best look at gameplay we'd had since 2K and Hangar 13 started to properly showcase the game earlier this year.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-has-gone-gold-ahead-of-its-august-release/">Mafia: The Old Country officially went gold last month</a>, ahead of its early-August release date, as Hangar 13 works to polish what it believes will be "<em>the best-looking Mafia game</em>.<em>"</em> We'll see how well it lives up to those expectations, and the rest of the expectations Hangar 13 has set for the game, when it arrives on August 8, 2025.</p>

In late May, Nintendo released a brief video detailing some of the new features coming to Nintendo Switch Online's Nintendo 64 offerings--which included a CRT filter, rewind feature, and more.

We catch a glimpse of missions, strikes, PvP battles, and PvE features that players can expect.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3JJKAc-C8Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M3JJKAc-C8Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Destiny: Rising will be set in an "alternate timeline before the events of the original game," meaning players who aren't familiar with the massive lore can jump in without needing to experience previous Destiny titles.</p><p>Players can choose to take on the role of a "fully customizable" Lightbearer named Wolf, but they can also select to play as legendary Destiny characters like Ikora Rey and Iron Lord Jolder. The game features include single, co-op, and competitive multiplayer modes,  Primary and Power Weapons, and the ability to share your loadout across different character arsenals.</p><p>NetEase is also adding a new Mythic-tier rarity for gear, as well as a whole new weapon type. The developer is promising "tons of exciting loot to gather for your characters."</p><p>To get players excited and ready for the game's release, NetEase is holding a <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pre-registration event</a> where people can unlock special bonuses when the game launches. This event unlocks more rewards with each player milestone, which is currently sitting at five million, with the final incentive at 10 million.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you are someone who cares even a little bit about video game preservation, then you've likely heard of the Stop Killing Games initiative. A consumer-focused movement petition with the goal of gaining enough signatures so that a new law can be proposed to the UK parliament and the European Commission to disallow publishers and developers from making games that can be taken offline and rendered unplayable. </p>



<p>"<em>An increasing number of video games are sold effectively as goods,</em>" the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games website reads</a>, "<em>with no stated expiration date, but designed to be completely unplayable as soon as support from the publisher ends.</em> <em>This practice is a form of planned obsolescence and is not only detrimental to customers, but makes preservation effectively impossible</em>."</p>



<p>Stop Killing Games was first started by YouTuber Ross Scott, who took Ubisoft shutting down The Crew as the match with which to light the movement's fire. There's also an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-responds-to-the-crew-lawsuit-tells-prosecuting-players-they-never-owned-their-games/">ongoing lawsuit over The Crew being shut down</a>, but that is separate from the petition Scott began.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The largest campaign ever to stop publishers destroying games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w70Xc9CStoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When Scott began campaigning for signatures, it seemed like his first win came early, when Ubisoft announced it would make <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/">offline versions of The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest</a> available for players. It's unclear if the pressure from Stop Killing Games is what led to the decision, but it's difficult to imagine it wasn't a part of the conversation. However, no one (at least not video game publishers) suspected Stop Killing Games would gain enough traction to actually put pressure on the industry's largest publishers and developers. That was, until Scott announced that the petition had surpassed 1 million signatures.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The site says we have cleared 1 million signatures!  I hate being like this, but there's a chance a significant number of them aren't real.  That means we have to keep signing in overdrive mode to make up for them!  I'll have a video on this later today.<a href="https://t.co/EpnNTDR85U">https://t.co/EpnNTDR85U</a></p>— Accursed Farms (@accursedfarms) <a href="https://twitter.com/accursedfarms/status/1940798871678210158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Even with Scott warning that many of the signatures could be faked, and encouraging anyone who hasn't yet to still sign the petition, that milestone and the signs that Stop Killing Games was going to get its shot at having legislation proposed to prohibit video game makers from creating online-only games that can be shut down forever in a moment was enough for video game publishers and developers to collectively respond to the movement. </p>



<p>Video Games Europe, a collective body that represents the European divisions of the largest publishers and developers in the video game industry, and <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/about/our-board/">whose board is comprised of leaders from</a> Roblox, Warner Bros, Epic Games, EA, Activision, Microsoft, Ubisoft, Take-Two, and more, released a statement that was, unsurprisingly, in opposition to Stop Killing Games, claiming that if laws like the ones it is suggesting are passed, making online-focused games would become "<em>prohibitively expensive</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We appreciate the passion of our community;"</em> the <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/statement-on-stop-killing-games/">statement from Video Games Europe</a> began. "<em>However, the decision to discontinue online services is multi-faceted, never taken lightly and must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We understand that it can be disappointing for players, but when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws. Private servers are not always a viable alternative option for players as the protections we put in place to secure players' data, remove illegal content, and combat unsafe community content would not exist and would leave rights holders liable. In addition, many titles are designed from the ground-up to be online-only; in effect, these proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create. We welcome the opportunity to discuss our position with policy makers and those who have led the European Citizens Initiative in the coming months</em>."</p>



<p>Scott has published a response to the Video Games Europe statement, immediately pointing to the fact that Stop Killing Games isn't looking to make it impossible for publishers to discontinue their online games. "<em>We are in no way seeking to impede your</em> <em>right to discontinue online services,</em>" Scott says. "<em>We are saying you can shut down your games whenever you want, but you have to do that responsibly, in a way that doesn't take back rights you already sold to customers</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The industry is lobbying against Stop Killing Games!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5Ay_aOUcFw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Even after a year of campaigning, it is still too early to tell if Stop Killing Games will actually have any impact. The deadline for the petition to be submitted for review is soon approaching, and even after that step, legislation still has to be passed. There are still plenty of opportunities for it to die on the rack. Still, it is clear that Scott has pushed the issue far enough to the point where it could make an impact. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenless-zone-zero-version-2-1-coming-next-week.1237251/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1, and the latest update for the hack-and-slash action RPG is coming very soon indeed.</p>

<p>As revealed during one of the studio's customary livestreams,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1 arrives on July 16th. That's next Wednesday at time of writing, so you won't have very long to wait for this one.</p>

<p>Just like you'd expect, Version 2.1 represents a continuation from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-20-release-date" rel="nofollow">June's massive 2.0 update</a>. Two new areas, the narrative-focused Sailume Bay and the summery Fantasy Resort, will be available for you to explore, with the former serving as the "central stage for Chapter 2's story".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.1-release-date-agents.jpg?itok=ePyUPVQF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.1-release-date-agents.jpg?itok=AGp4R8na 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two new Agents are coming in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1.</figcaption></figure><p>As ever, you can expect to add new Agents to your lineup as well. The first, Ukinami Yuzuha, is a Support Agent who can empower other attackers and use her tanuki friend to throw candy bombs. Well, why not, eh?</p>

<p>Your second new Agent in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1 is Alice Thymefield, an Anomaly Agent whose Blade Etiquette resource can be used to unleash devastating attacks on her opponents. A new Bangboo, Miss Esme, joins the two Agents, providing HP and energy replenishments if she's in your squad.</p>

<p>Reruns for Miyabi and Yanagi will also be available as part of Version 2.1's banners, so if you missed your chance to pick up those two Agents the first time around, you'll have another chance in this update cycle.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new minigames like surfing, sea shooting, and new fishing spots, as well as new outfits to unlock with a summery theme. There's plenty to look forward to as part of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1, and you can check out the trailer below!</p>




<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1 arrives across <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices</a> on July 16th.</p>

We don’t know much about it beyond that it will be some kind of revenge story, as the official description calls it a “raw chronicle of redemption and revenge.”</p><p>“In a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence, one question remains: when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes do you have to go to make your story matter?”</p><p>The next day, the company released a minute-long teaser that is mostly made up of footage from the first season, showing (spoilers) the original <em>Edgerunners </em>crew’s deaths. We then see silhouettes of what seems to be the new cast, with a lingering shot on what looks like a young child holding an old camcorder. I’ve seen some chatter suggesting that this girl could be the daughter of season one stars David and Lucy, but that’s just theorycrafting at this point.</p><p>While we still don’t know much, it does sound like <em>Edgerunners 2 </em>is going to be a bit of a bummer.

Further investigation by some fans has also led to speculation <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NitroExists/status/1942003844927435200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NitroExists/status/1942003844927435200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about <em>Rayman 2</em> being present as well</a></span>. <br></p><p>These all seem like decent guesses based on admittedly very blurry clues, but the question still remains about when they will arrive to the online service. It seems like a good bet they are planned to appear sometime in 2025 if they were teased just a couple months ago, and rumors continue to swirl about a possible Nintendo Direct in July as fans wait for further details about the Switch 2's year-one launch plans, as well as when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-screenshots-release-date-trailer-planet-1851772753&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-screenshots-release-date-trailer-planet-1851772753"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a></span> is coming out in the fall. </p><p>It would also make sense that Nintendo needs to start getting some of these games, namely <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>, out the door soon before bringing their successors—like <em>Smash Bros.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-gpu-is-close-to-xbox-series-s-cpu-to-ps4-says-developer.1237224/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ever since the Nintendo Switch 2 specifications were leaked, fans and experts have been wondering whether Nintendo's new console would be closer in power to last generation's Sony PlayStation 4 or this generation's Microsoft Xbox Series S. </p>



<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-qa-with-virtuos-i-think-we-will-see-it-surpass-the-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our recent interview with Virtuos</a>, we received what is possibly the most in-depth technical explanation to date, courtesy of Eoin O’ Grady, Technical Director at Black Shamrock (a Virtuos subsidiary), who revealed that games already running at 60 frames per second on the Xbox Series S shouldn't be hard for the Nintendo Switch 2 to run.</p>



<p><em>GPU-wise, the Switch 2 performs slightly below the Series S; this difference is more noticeable in handheld mode. However, the Series S does not support technologies like DLSS, which the Switch 2 does. This makes the GPU capabilities of the two consoles comparable overall. CPU-wise, there is a clearer distinction between the two consoles. The Switch 2 is closer to the PlayStation (PS) 4 in this respect, having a CPU just a bit more powerful than the PS4’s. Since most games tend to be more GPU-bound than CPU-bound when well optimized, the impact of this difference largely depends on the specific game and its target frame rate. Any game shipping at 60 FPS on the Series S should easily port to the Switch 2. Likewise, a 30 FPS Series S game that’s GPU-bound should also port well. Games with complex physics, animations, or other CPU-intensive elements might incur additional challenges in reaching 30 or 60 FPS or require extra optimization during porting.</em></p>



<p>One of the key performance accelerators for the Nintendo Switch 2 is, of course, the upscaler NVIDIA DLSS. We asked him why not many games support it so far, and this was his answer:</p>



<p><em>For games like Mario Kart World or the upcoming Donkey Kong Bananza, which feature stylized cartoon-like aesthetics, DLSS may not be needed. Mario Kart, for instance, was in development for many years with the original Switch in mind. Games like these aren’t trying to push graphical fidelity; they have different goals for their art content and tend to hit 60 FPS without relying on DLSS. For third-party games, it’s worth noting that Cyberpunk 2077 has shipped with DLSS. Compared with the Xbox Series S and PS4 versions, DLSS evidently offers better upscaling technology, making a strong case for developers to implement it. More importantly, there are also other games that could benefit from DLSS, but don’t currently utilize it—that often comes down to how these titles are being ported. It is not as simple as taking the PC DirectX implementation of DLSS and running it on the Nintendo Switch 2. Instead, DLSS has to be integrated through Nintendo’s NVN2 graphics API, and the extra work required for this might have been deferred by some developers for their initial ports.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Say what you will about the genre, but this summer's been quite a time for gacha game releases.&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-western-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Umamusume</em></a>&nbsp;is incredibly popular, with even the most unlikely gamers diving into the fray. Hoyoverse continues to dominate the field with updates to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact" rel="nofollow">Genshin Impact</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zenless-zone-zero" rel="nofollow">Zenless Zone Zero</a>,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a>. I've dabbled with several of these in the past few weeks, but the one consuming most of my time is none other than&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-release-date-leaked" rel="nofollow"><em>Persona5: The Phantom X</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's right,&nbsp;a new&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/series/persona" rel="nofollow"><em>Persona</em></a>&nbsp;game is out, and it's another offshoot of&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>. If you're like me and get engrossed in this series' narratives and hooked on the day-to-day, slice-of-life elements&nbsp;it&nbsp;offers,&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>can easily grab your attention and pull you in.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-wonder-2.jpg?itok=2FnLLi8d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-wonder-2.jpg?itok=m6f5iyrc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Introducing our protagonist, Wonder.</figcaption></figure><h2>Familiar Combat with a Mobile Twist</h2>

<p>Much to my surprise<em>,&nbsp;Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>is quite the ambitious title. It's easy to write it off as being a mobile game, but with&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>'s signature art style and gameplay elements, it feels very high quality.</p>

<p>Players take control of a protagonist who, due to certain events, gets involved with the Metaverse, much like Joker from&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>. The narrative is front-loaded with exposition to get players up to speed with how the whole Metaverse world works, so it might feel repetitive for players familiar with the series.&nbsp;Due to all this exposition,&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X</em>&nbsp;feels very similar to the opening hours of&nbsp;<em>Persona 5.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>This also means it takes quite a while to get into actual gameplay, which comprises day-to-day life elements, making friends, exploring Mementos,&nbsp;using Persona in battle, fusing new&nbsp;Persona, and the like. Once you get into the meat and potatoes of it,&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>has quite a bit going on.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-combat.jpg?itok=3euo4RVK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-combat.jpg?itok=1xMvLoAp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat should look pretty familiar to you if you've played&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Turn-based combat will also click pretty fast for those familiar with&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>&nbsp;mechanics. You'll primarily fight demons from the&nbsp;<em>Megami Tensei</em>&nbsp;franchise, each with their own elemental weaknesses and strengths.<em>&nbsp;</em>Paying attention to demons' weaknesses and exploiting those is essential in order to succeed.</p>

<p>Exploit a weakness, and enemies are downed. Party members can do a "One More" attack (essentially the Baton Pass from&nbsp;<em>Persona 5)</em>, and that character can attack a second time. If all demons are downed in combat, you can do an All-Out Attack and deal massive damage to every enemy on the field.</p>

<p>Characters also have their own special attack gauge that fills up over time. These "Highlights" have a wide range of benefits, like dealing massive damage, buffing allies, debuffing enemies, and more, so there are a lot of tools at your disposal. The tutorials for combat and, well, almost every other mechanic aren't that great, but you'll catch on quickly as a veteran of the series.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-persona.jpg?itok=oqTh5nOr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-persona.jpg?itok=ba8X9xnj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's a look at how attacks work in the game. This is Yaoling Li's persona.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Attacks also work a little differently in&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X.&nbsp;</em>You have your regular melee and gun attacks, but Personas have fixed and unique skills. There's a bit more depth with these abilities, so rather than using "Assault Dive," Ryuji has "Pirate Tactics" which deals a set percentage relative to his attack stat, and is buffed if his "Rebound" mechanic is activated.</p>

<p>My intent is not to bog you down with tons of jargon, but just know that characters' abilities are fixed, and you can't change them around. There is one exception to this rule, and that's the player character Wonder.</p>

<p>Much like Joker, Wonder can command multiple Persona. You're able to fuse new Persona in the Velvet Room, assign new skills to them, and customize them to fit in certain combat situations. It's not quite as deep as base&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>'s fusing mechanics, as there are restrictions, but folks will be happy to see the return of this mechanic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-lufel.jpg?itok=RV2OnRzA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-lufel.jpg?itok=pJh462Dd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lufel! He's actually quite good.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Persona5: The Phantom X --&nbsp;</em>Gacha Hooked?</h2>

<p>To address the elephant in the room,&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X</em>&nbsp;is a gacha game. All of these mechanics I mentioned, including fusing Persona as well as upgrading characters and their abilities, are tied behind an absurd amount of in-game currency. I play a lot of gacha games, and these currencies pretty much always confuse me, so there's a learning curve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, party members are locked behind gacha mechanics. You can pull for either new characters (like Joker from&nbsp;<em>Persona 5)&nbsp;</em>and powerful weapons suited only for them. Everyone has their own limits when it comes to gacha, so just know what you're getting into.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best characters will, of course, be locked behind limited banners, although you're gradually given currency to pull for new characters, and there are a few characters you gain from the story that will also be helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-the-phantom-thieves.jpg?itok=PZLpK7p9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-the-phantom-thieves.jpg?itok=3sD5_TDM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Limited time events, for example, may include characters you're familiar with.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>has a clever way of handling characters like Joker and Morgana being playable. These party members are called "Phantom Idols" and are products of the Metaverse rather than their real-world counterparts. And while&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>is technically canon, the ongoing theory is that this game takes place within an alternate universe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are also so many different modes in&nbsp;this game; after all, you have to find ways to keep the player engaged. So, on top of exploring palaces and living out your daily life, there are various challenges that'll absolutely put your builds to the test. By doing this, of course, you get more currency for gacha pulls.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-subway-slammer.jpg?itok=Lhv6Kh19 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-subway-slammer.jpg?itok=3tKACdpW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He's just standing there... menacingly.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Silly Saga of the Subway Slammer</h2>

<p>I swear, my Twitter feed has been nothing but the Subway Slammer since&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X</em>'s launch. If you're wondering who that is, well, you'll learn pretty quick by playing through the story. Like in&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>, some characters need a change of heart, and our first target is ex-baseball player Takeyuki Kiuchi, aka the&nbsp;Subway Slammer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Subway Slammer is a guy that just loves slamming into women on the subway. His habits are purposely misogynistic and actually stem from a social issue in Japan. There are reports of people slamming into others on the subway in order to satisfy some sick perversion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even though it's a real-world issue, the Subway Slammer's saga is written in such an unintentionally funny, over-the-top way. Kiuchi is outrageous with his dialogue, so the whole situation turns into something more akin to parody than real-world commentary. And of course, the police can't do anything, despite him severely injuring a high school girl apparently, so of course, The Phantom Thieves are on the case.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-kiuchis-palace.jpg?itok=jXhIYvEj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-kiuchis-palace.jpg?itok=cLwocUhL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As you can imagine, The Subway Slammer has quite the ego.</figcaption></figure><p>Through Mementos, players infiltrate various rulers' Palaces in order to steal their treasure. This triggers the ruler to confess their crimes and have a change of heart. Again, this is the same deal as&nbsp;<em>Persona 5.</em></p>

<p>The first palace, Kiuchi's domain, is my favorite part of <em>Persona5: The Phantom X.&nbsp;</em>It's the meat and potatoes of&nbsp;this game, so to speak, and the palaces are truly massive. There are puzzles, plenty of enemies, narrative exposition, and more. They're truly enjoyable to explore and find every bit of treasure you can.</p>

<p>Besides changing hearts, much of the story is how you decide to spend your day. You can choose to partake in various activities around the city, like working a part-time job or attending a club at school. These increase your social stats, but I'm still not&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;sure how these factor into&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X'</em>s gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-city.jpg?itok=VdJ1cWcj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-city.jpg?itok=nxU4FJ0j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gettin' myself out of Subway Slammer territory.</figcaption></figure><p>The fact of the matter is, this is a live service title that originally launched in China only, so we're behind on content. Will my social stats come into play later? Who knows. It also remains to be seen if the story picks up beyond The Subway Slammer. The second palace's ruler is a <em>bit&nbsp;</em>more despicable, but it doesn't hit the same way that&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>'s villains did.</p>

<p>I am, at the very least, invested in the main party. Wonder is your blank slate protagonist like Joker, but the sporty Motoha Arai and the trusty animal companion, Lufel, are very likable, as are later additions like Shun Kano. Various side characters also have eye-catching designs and engaging personalities, so I'm hoping things pick up!</p>

<p>This is a mobile&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;PC title. The mobile elements are very evident if you're playing on your computer. Using a controller would have been my favored method in playing&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X,&nbsp;</em>but the control scheme is obtuse and unresponsive. Even with the mouse and keyboard, it's clear that a touch screen was the priority here.</p>

<p>The UI and interface, by the way, is extremely cluttered.&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>&nbsp;is known for its incredibly artsy UI, and while it's often bold in its presentation, it isn't obstructive. There are so many different buttons flashing at you on the screen at any given time, it can be quite annoying to deal with as you're trying to immersive yourself Tokyo or somewhere in the Metaverse.</p>

<p>There are a lot of smaller issues that prevent&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>from realizing its true potential. The UI and controller issues definitely hinder my enjoyment, and the story just doesn't hit the same way...&nbsp;<em>yet</em>. Even still, I'm hooked, since&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>boils down to being more&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>, and more&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>can't be a bad thing, right?&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Persona5: The Phantom X</strong>&nbsp;was reviewed on PC with a copy provided downloaded the reviewer over the course of 30 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has confirmed that a second season of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners&nbsp;</em>is in the works, although it's probably going to be a little while before you can watch it.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/edgerunners/status/1941584253893959928" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2</em>, as CDPR is calling it, is currently in production. It'll air on Netflix "when it's ready", according to the developer, so it sounds like the next season is at least a year or more away.</p>

<p>When it does air,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2&nbsp;</em>will tell a "new standalone 10-episode story" set in the world of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, a story that Netflix and CDPR describe as "a raw chronicle of redemption and revenge".</p>

He's joined by lead character designer Kanno Ichigo, as well as "returning collaborators" Masahiko Otsuka and showrunner Bartosz Sztybor.</p>

<p>Animation studio Trigger will return once again to work on the new series, so you can expect the same sort of flashy, exciting visual style <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-edgerunners-is-anime-set-in-cyberpunk-universe" rel="nofollow">the first season</a> of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners&nbsp;</em>brought to the table. Spoilers ahead for the first season of&nbsp;<em>Edgerunners</em>, if you haven't seen it yet!</p>

<p>Of course, we don't yet know how the story of the new season will dovetail with the original (if, indeed, it does at all). All we know for now is that, as the trailer itself proclaims, "David is dead, but Night City lives on". We'll have to wait for another trailer to learn more, I guess.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out the debut teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It doesn't give too much away, but it does feature some stylish&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>-esque visuals upon which to feast your eyes.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>news, the hotly-anticipated sequel to&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-profits-cyberpunk-sequel-pre-production" rel="nofollow">recently entered pre-production</a>, and between that, the new <em>Edgerunners&nbsp;</em>season, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-delayed" rel="nofollow">recently-delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>Update 2.3, we're in a bit of a holding pattern when it comes to new&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>media.</p>
