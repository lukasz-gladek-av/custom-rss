            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hyper-light-breaker-preview-your-next-roguelite-addiction<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hyper-light-drifter"><i>Hyper Light Drifter</i></a>&nbsp;is a bona fide indie legend, so to have a successor to such a title, well, let's just say the upcoming <i>Hyper Light Breaker</i>&nbsp;has a lot to live up to. Though it's a departure from the original, fans of the series and new gamers alike are going to eat this up.</p>
<p>It's not necessarily a sequel insofar as I can tell, and certainly, it plays different from the previous 2D pixel art hack-and-slash. This time, <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/heart-machine">Heart Machine</a> concocted a gorgeous 3D roguelite with active, action-packed combat and even co-op.</p>

<h2><em>Hyper Light Breaker'</em>s Addicting Gameplay Loop</h2>
<p>During Summer Game Fest, my hands-on time with&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>&nbsp;comprised a solo run through one of the game's limitless procedurally generated dungeons. To begin, though, players begin in a town and equip themselves for battle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vendors sell handy new items like melee weapons and guns, and it's also where we progress through the story -- though I should emphasize, like its predecessor, <i>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</i>features no dialogue and only a cryptic alphabet of alien letters.</p>
<p>And indeed, players can see hints of&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Drifter</em>&nbsp;DNA throughout. It shares a similar bright color scheme, albeit in 3D. The dichotomy of ancient ruins and more modern buildings and tech are still prevalent, as can be seen in the game's dungeons.</p>

<p>Before embarking, players can choose from various characters and are able to unlock more as the story progresses. We're led into this vast, open environment filled with tons of monsters, and of course, tons of loot.</p>
<p>There're also various tasks to complete as noted on your map, so it's your job to explore, gather up equipment, and eventually take on the boss. Looking out in the distance is a great big cathedral, a floating island, and different biomes, all of which I can explore.</p>

<h2>Exploring in&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>Gives me Wanderlust</h2>
<p>Exploration is also pretty easy when you use your hoverboard, a nifty craft allowing you to cross distances fast. Though, like&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild</em>&nbsp;and so many others, there's a stamina meter that limits your use. Oh, and there's even a glider.</p>
<p>Combat shines just as much as <i>Hyper Light Breaker'</i>s combat. It's relatively simple, but with so many different weapons and guns, as well as different abilities attached to said equipment, you can effectively build your character to cater your playstyle.</p>
<p>You're able to parry attacks too, which opens up another layer of complexity -- and to be sure, it's important to parry in combat. A boss absolutely trounced me, and while I pulled off a few parries, I missed just as many.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But defeat is not the end, as there are a limited number of tries graciously granted to players. You'll be able to level up, gather resources, grab new gear, and hopefully try again.</p>
<p>Co-op wasn't available for this build, but you can bring some friends along, which has me quite excited. It's a fun, well-made, relatively straightforward roguelite playing by yourself. But with friends? It should be even better.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-case-for-rewatching-the-boys-before-season-4.898005/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24173211/rewatch-the-boys-season-3-4-what-know-gen-v<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="1bTyTa">This week, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23188742/the-boys-season-3-is-about-tv"><em>The Boys</em></a><em> </em>finally returns after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23894052/gen-v-when-timeline-boys-season-4-clues-connections">a college-bound hiatus</a> for another season of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23984773/the-boys-season-4-trailer-2024-prime-video-release">violent satire</a>. You remember <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23200353/the-boys-season-3-ending-finale-explained">what happened</a>, right?</p>
<p id="lRyGxG">Polygon has seen the upcoming season of <em>The Boys</em> — look forward to lots more on that in the coming weeks — and in studying up to remember where things left off, a funny thing happened. We were kind of pumped at the idea of rewatching <em>The Boys. </em>For all of its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23150699/the-boys-termite-scene-explosion-ant-man">ridiculous juvenilia</a>, the series remains a surprisingly thoughtful dramedy, with breakneck pacing that actually rewards a rewatch. And with only a handful of eight-episode seasons, a rewatch seems extremely achievable.</p>
<p id="I2KcIk">But maybe you only have time for the new stuff, or just want a guided meditation on the things you should know. That’s what this piece here for. Think of this as a quick, spoiler-free syllabus on what to refresh yourself on, because with a show as propulsive as <em>The Boys</em>,<em> </em>it can be easy to miss the finer details in the constant rain of gore and other fluids. </p>
<h2 id="b0TO1Z"><strong>Consider starting over from the beginning</strong></h2>
<p id="p8acVw">Three seasons and a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23943858/gen-v-season-2-release-date-cast-news">couple</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22961941/the-boys-diabolical-episodes-list-grossest">spinoffs</a> across five years is a lot of ground to cover, even with streaming’s abbreviated episode counts. Even if you’ve got a solid-enough grasp on <em>The Boys</em>’ major narrative arcs, the show has reached a comfortable place where it’s built out its world enough that it can lean on its own history and remix it in interesting ways. Granted, the most important thing on <em>The Boys</em> will always be what’s happening this very moment, so you won’t be lost at sea without brushing up. It’s just cool to see how far we’ve come.</p>
<h2 id="MtfTIH"><strong>Gen V is kind of important</strong></h2>
<p id="m56H6y">Without spoiling anything, there’s a bit of a mystery hiding behind <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23891544/gen-v-the-boys-prime-video-early-impression-review">the suped-up collegiate drama</a> of <em>Gen V</em>. What’s at the bottom of it ends up being pretty vital to what <em>The Boys </em>season 4 gets into, so if you’ve been looking for an excuse to finally dive in, now’s your chance. Again, you won’t be lost if you skip it — we just think <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23945317/gen-v-season-1-ending-too-short">the show is really fun</a>, and you’ll feel a little more informed if you’ve seen it. </p>
<p id="erixXI">The most important thing: There was a conspiracy at Godolkin University (if you can believe that a Vought-run organization would have a dark side) that resulted in a supe-specific virus that was capable of killing them. </p>
<h2 id="VHyIHJ"><strong>Frenchie and Kimiko fans have a big season ahead of them</strong></h2>
<p id="BSzE3Q">There’s some reshuffling in <em>The Boys</em>’<em> </em>status quo this season, and the result is a renewed focus on characters outside of the spotlight — namely Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) and Frenchie (Tomer Capone). The pair tend to have their own subplots running in the background in prior seasons, but here they’re front and center, and it’s worth recalling what you can of their history.</p>
<p id="duM6oE">When we last left them: Kimiko and Frenchie kissed in season 3, and even talked a bit about getting out and running away together. But ultimately they had a more pressing problem (Kimiko briefly losing her powers). </p>
<h2 id="vf2NyX"><strong>Refresh yourself on Victoria Neuman’s political career</strong></h2>
<p id="muUnY1"><em>The Boys</em> has always been a political show, both in the sense that it is written from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/10/13/21514329/the-boys-season-3-season-2-ending-spoilers-interview">a clear ideological perspective</a> and in that the machinations of its fictional elected officials and unelected corporations have played a big part in the overarching story. The literal, governmental politics are a big part of season 4’s election-year setting, and an easy way to get your bearings is via <em>The Boys</em>’<em> </em>rising political star, Vicky Neuman (Claudia Doumit), now a VP candidate. Remembering how she got there would do you a lot of good. Also important to remember: The Boys found out she’s a supe (along with some of their allies), but that information is not public.</p>
<h2 id="lq6NwY"><strong>Remember who dies and how</strong></h2>
<p id="MH3ls5">This is kind of a gimme, but on <em>The Boys</em>, death almost always signals a status quo shift. Unlike, say, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/24157742/game-thrones-finale-anniversary-next-show-like"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, where shocking deaths rippled out to change the fate of the Seven Kingdoms or signaled how small its characters were in the grand scheme of things, death in <em>The Boys</em> is on a smaller scale, bodies to burn in an unlikely war of attrition between Billy Butcher and Homelander. While the show loves to revel in its gross-out violence, its writers <em>are</em> keeping score, and the bill may eventually come due — probably in a way none of us are expecting. </p>
<p id="mhgonH"><small><em>The Boys</em></small><small> season 4 premieres with its first three episodes on Prime on June 13, with new episodes weekly.</small></p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the upcoming instalment for first-person shooter franchise arrives on October 25, 2024. The pre-orders for the game are already live and one of the details on the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-standard-edition/9N58QRBG9WDG/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox store page</a> for the game had made many players anxious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The now-updated store page for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 stated that the game would take up more than 300 GB of storage space on the Xbox Series X/S, however, that does not seem to be the case anymore.</p>



<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1800273804389941699" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CODUpdates</a> X account posted a clarification tweet today. The update states that the “estimate file size” for Black Ops 6 pre-order pages “does not represent the download size or disk footprint for Black Ops 6” (sigh of relief).</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>📢 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps6</a></p><p>Correction: The estimated file size currently displayed on the Black Ops 6 pre-order pages does not represent the download size or disk footprint for Black Ops 6.</p><p>The sizes as shown include the full installations of Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone…</p></div>— Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1800273804389941699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Moreover, they further clarified that the install size previously shown included full installations of Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone, and all relevant content packs, including all localized languages combined, which is not representative of a typical player install experience”. – True.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, players can download Black Ops 6 without downloading any other game or language packs. Also, the correct file size for the game will be revealed closer to the release date. Players are certainly happy about this clarification, as 300GB to play one game sounds like a nightmare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, a recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/treyarch-found-out-about-black-ops-6-on-game-pass-shortly-before-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> states that Treyarch wasn’t aware of Black Ops 6 arriving on Game Pass until the very last moment. Additionally, the first beta for the game could be hosted between August 28 – September 3, according to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-beta-dates-possibly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent leak</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suicide Squad Isekai is a new anime series that will see the iconic villainous crew from The DC universe enter an entirely new world. They are still operating under the head of A.R.G.U.S., Amanda Waller, and have set foot on a mission that takes them to an otherworldly realm. The supervillains that will be entering through a “Gate” for this new world include Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Peacemaker, Clayface, and King Shark. They will be entering an Isekai, a fantasy world where swords and magic are your tools, Orcs spread chaos in the streets and dragons rule the skies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following their infamous personality, the crew ends up causing chaos in the Isekai as soon as they enter, and are captured by the Kingdom’s soldiers. The worst part is that the Suicide Squad has bombs in their neck that will explode in the next 72 hours, and they will need to help Queen Aldora and her conquest against the Imperial Army survive. Interested readers can check out all the confirmed voice actors <a href="https://wwws.warnerbros.co.jp/suicidesquad-isekai/#staff-cast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

It's a new adventure game (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-park-survival-is-back-from-the-dead-as-a-new-action-game-game-awards-2023">no relation to the canceled early 2000s action game of the same name</a>) made by Saber Interactive in partnership with Universal. At the time, they didn't share much detail. But today, Saber and Universal have given IGN an exclusive peek into their rendition of Isla Nublar — new characters, new locations, new dinosaurs and all.</p><p>Universal and Saber have shared with us an internal Q&amp;A conducted with Universal Products &amp; Experiences executive producer John Melchior and Saber Interactive creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick, which contained a number of tidbits about what to expect from Jurassic Park: Survival. Going in, we already knew the game will take place one day after the events of the 1993 film. The action will follow InGen scientist Maya Joshi, who has been left behind on Isla Nublar after the characters of the film depart. There, she must survive and attempt to escape the park, avoiding dinosaurs and other hazards as she goes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Jurassic Park Survival Exclusive Concept Art and Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>From Melchior and Hollis-Leick, we learned that we'll not only be revisiting iconic locations from the 1993 film, but we'll also be seeing brand new ones. This particular setting allowed the developers to explore places that were only implied in the film, but never seen — distant buildings, places where visitors were meant to stay the night, and so forth. And the locations that we're familiar with may have been changed by the aftermath of the film.</p><p>"We have been working with all our stakeholders on what the island would have looked like after the events of the film," Melchior said. "This includes areas we all love like the Visitor’s Center and the T-Rex paddock. But also, what we didn’t see, things that were not part of the tour or got cut off by the storm. Those on the island were supposed to be there overnight, so what does that mean? What would they have seen and where would they have stayed if everything went according to plan? That is where we are starting. One thing is certain - the island is as much a part of the story as the characters and dinosaurs."</p><p>Speaking of the characters and the dinosaurs, it sounds like we'll see new ones of both. Hollis-Leick specifically refers to "new characters," plural, meaning more than just scientist Maya Joshi. And in response to a question about "special dinosaurs" in the game that aren't in the movie, Melchior uncryptically replied with "Life finds a way..." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As for what you'll be doing as Maya, we still haven't seen gameplay yet. But Hollis-Leick offered this explanation of how exploring the island will work:</p><p>"The island is full of different types of terrain, many of them quite challenging. The player will need to use caution and planning in some cases, checking routes in advance. There will also be times when the player will need to move very carefully through an environment to avoid the attention of certain predators. Maya, the main character, is neither superhuman nor an action hero. There are real risks for her around every corner and the player will need to use a mixture of intelligence, grit and patience to survive the island’s many challenges."</p><p>There's still plenty we don't know about Jurassic Park: Survival, and there's certainly pressure on it to nail the nostalgic vibe of the film. Melchior says that Jurassic Park is the "most requested" game for Universal to make. Sure, there's the Jurassic World Evolution series from Frontier Developments, but the management sim rendition on the franchise is a very different beast from a single-player adventure. Unfortunately, we may still have a while to wait, as Universal and Saber aren't sharing a release date just yet, but did confirm the game won't be out in 2024. We'll see it out eventually on PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

Surprisingly, it's not about the series going back into the past rather than continuing from the cliffhanger ending of Gears 5, either.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Blizzard developer Jamir Blanco took issue <a href="https://x.com/jamirblanco/status/1799976897662861432" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter) with a social media post by Summer Game Fest founder Geoff Keighley. The Gears of War: E-Day trailer--seen below--sees a young Marcus Fenix fighting off a Locust drone. Keighley said the video was "CG from Blur Studio," a description that Blanco believes "diminishes all the technical achievements you probably didn't notice from how good it was." Blanco added that the teaser was "FULL REALTIME."</p>

<p dir="ltr">For its part, The Coalition stated that the debut trailer for Gears of War: E-Day was in-engine. The video starts with "in-engine footage" text showing up at the bottom of the screen, and the developer expanded on this on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>. This reveal trailer "is honoring the legacy" of the original Gears of War "Mad World" trailer, according to The Coalition, which was "rendered entirely in-engine." It's noted this was "a rarity at a time when the chasm between cinematic trailers and actual game graphics was notably wide."</p><p>It's worth noting that in-engine cinematics don't necessarily reflect in-engine gameplay. We'll have to wait and see how close The Coalition got as we get closer to release.</p><p dir="ltr">Gears of War: E-Day is built with Unreal Engine 5 and takes place 14 years before the original game in the franchise. There is no release window for the prequel yet.</p>

		<p>Luigi might not light ghost hunting, but after a trio of adventures battling spectral miscreants, it’s pretty clear that he’s a dab hand at it. After the popularity and success of the third game a few years ago, Nintendo has decided to revisit the second game in the series, remastering <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/03/21/review-luigis-mansion-2-3ds/">Luigi’s Mansion 2</a> (AKA Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon) for Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="A rude awakening – Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD (Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HTom5fTPwNs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Up until <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/28/luigis-mansion-3-review-nintendo-switch/">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a>, this series always felt like more of a niche spin-off than a mainline franchise. Sure, the original game was a GameCube launch title and a technical showcase, but what everyone really wanted was a new Mario game. Then, over a decade later, Luigi’s Mansion 2 wasn’t coming to the home console Wii U, but to the 3DS instead – in retrospect, the more significant Nintendo console of the early 2010s.</p>


<p>By far and away the biggest part of Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD is the simple increase in resolution. The 3DS gave just 400×240 per eye, which ensured that pretty much every game on the handheld suffered with huge amounts of aliasing – something only amplified if you went for the larger screened XL machines. Just jumping up to 720p on the Switch screen makes a huge difference to the clarity of the visuals, and it just looks really clean and sharp before you consider any other tweaks and improvements that have been made. Assets have been replaced with higher poly count versions, so there’s more detail on Luigi’s dungarees where you can also see the stitching and denim texture, while there’s a more rounded appearance to his nose or the many door knobs he’ll tentatively reach out to open doors.</p>


<p>That said, you can still see that the framework of the 3DS original is still there in various places. It feels most obvious between missions, when you’re zapped back to Professor E. Gadd’s base, and you’ll notice the flatter lighting across Luigi’s face without the nuanced self-shadowing of the sequel, the short and limited animation loops and more. Put Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD up against its sequel more generally, and you see just how far ahead Luigi’s Mansion 3 is in terms of lighting, atmospherics, the packed environmental detail and just how wonderfully interactive and destructible the environment is. Taken on its own merits, Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD is a good looking game, but you might be left hoping for a little more.</p>
<p>Still, you’ve got the classic Luigi’s Mansion style of gameplay, as you take our scaredy-cat plumber from room to room through a haunted building, each one sure to confront you with mischievous ghosts or some kind of environmental puzzle. There’s secrets and little touches to sniff out in every corner, whether it’s just figuring out how to get through a blocked door by tearing off old wallpaper and peeking through broken slats to see what’s going on inside, spotting another route into the room, or spotting secret jewels that are tucked away in each location. It’s a testament to the game’s design that ostensibly hidden routes through the world feel natural and intuitive to find as you explore, especially as you add things like a darklight to your arsenal of tools.</p>

<p>For the ghost battling, we’re stepping back to before Luigi’s Mansion 3, which had a number of new ideas, such as ghost slamming and Gooigi. Fighting ghosts feels pretty simplistic through the opening manor of the game, with a quick flash from the flashlight weakening them and then just having to simplistically move in the opposite direction while vacuuming them up and waiting to tap A and deal a bunch more damage. Things get a little more complicated if a ghost appears wearing sunglasses, hide in the scenery and try to strike from afar, and the first boss battle leant upon some of the environmental puzzling techniques built up through previous missions.</p>
<p>Oh yes, the missions. Where the first and third games present you with a single environment that you gradually open up and clear of ghosts, Luigi’s Mansion 2 took the portable gaming remit to heart with a mission structure. There’s still cohesive locations to explore, but after you complete an objective, E. Gadd will zap you back to base, you’ll get a mission score and rating, and then be sent back in for the next goal. That allows the game to redress and reset the location’s rooms to a certain extent, so that they could be re-infested with ghosts or suddenly covered in cobwebs that need clearing, but it breaks up the game’s flow into 10-20 minute chunks and is at odds with the rest of the series.</p>
<p>Luigi’s Mansion 2 was absolutely one of the highlights of the Nintendo 3DS library, and with that portable consigned to the history books, it’s great to see it get the remaster treatment for Nintendo Switch. As someone that missed the original release, I’m certainly glad of the chance to play it on a higher powered system and am eager to dive into the later stages of the game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-is-a-picture-of-a-banana-so-popular-on-steam.897957/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/banana-steam-popular<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let's take a quick look at the current chart of most-played Steam games, shall we?&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, yep.&nbsp;<em>Dota 2</em>, of course.&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>, naturally.&nbsp;<em>Banana</em>? Uhh...what?</p>
<p>It's true: right now, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">"game"</a> by the name of&nbsp;<em>Banana&nbsp;</em>is quickly climbing up the Steam most-played charts. According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam's own figures</a>,&nbsp;<em>Banana&nbsp;</em>has attracted an eye-watering 252,171 players in the last 24 hours alone.</p>
<p>The mechanics of&nbsp;<em>Banana&nbsp;</em>are incredibly simple; you click the banana and a counter goes up. That's it; that's all there is to the "game". So, why is it so popular? Sadly, the answer is probably more mercenary than you'd hope. It's all down to money.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/banana-steam-clicker-counter.jpg?itok=zFvxRT7z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/banana-steam-clicker-counter.jpg?itok=1PKCoBFs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm not kidding when I say that the gameplay in&nbsp;<em>Banana&nbsp;</em>is literally "click the banana".</figcaption></figure><p>Here's how it works. Every three hours (rather amusingly,&nbsp;<em>Banana&nbsp;</em>received a recent update putting this limit in place for "bot idling prevention"), you click to secure a banana skin drop. Oh, I see what you did there,&nbsp;<em>Banana</em>.</p>
<p>Every 18 hours, you'll get a rare drop. Effectively, this means that because <i>Banana&nbsp;</i>is free-to-play and requires minimal effort for skin farming, players (and, more to the point, likely a whole heap of bots) are using the "game" to make money.</p>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZERBI-XCVII/recommended/2923300/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this rather disgruntled Steam reviewer</a>, the developer also gets a cut of each transaction, and since&nbsp;<em>Banana&nbsp;</em>is so popular, it's likely that a lot of transactions are happening on the game's Steam marketplace right now.</p>
<p>It's worth pointing out that since&nbsp;<em>Banana&nbsp;</em>is basically a meme game, the review rating for the game is sitting at "Very Positive" at time of writing, but many of the positive reviews (if not all of them) are effectively jokes rather than earnest critiques. Yes, I know I'm still talking about a game where you click a banana.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/banana-steam-skins.jpg?itok=kdUX6GAj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/banana-steam-skins.jpg?itok=dQlMHk6Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>20p for a banana skin really does drive home the cost-of-living crisis, doesn't it?</figcaption></figure><p>Skin farming in gaming is nothing new; it's a problem that games as high-profile as&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike&nbsp;</em>have prominently faced in the past.</p>
<p>Still, the fact that a "game" in which you literally click a banana, and are rewarded with potentially profitable skins for doing so, is as popular as it is feels pretty depressing to me. If you'll excuse me, I'm off to play&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>&nbsp;and not farm a single skin.</p>

			<p>Resident Evil Village sales have surpassed 10 million units globally across all platforms, publisher Capcom has announced.</p>
<p>Capcom announced the news through an <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240611.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official press release</a> earlier today. As mentioned in the release, this sales number includes both physical copies and digital downloads. Another interesting sales figure is that the Resident Evil franchise has now sold 157 million units as of March 31, 2024 (since the release of the first Resident Evil back in 1996) -quite the achievement.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Village was released back in May of 2021. As such, Capcom managed to sell 10 million copies of the game within three years. As reported last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-village-sales-8million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 8 million copies of the game were sold within two years</a>. This implies that an additional 2 million copies were sold over the past year. Shortly after the game's launch, Capcom reported to have shipped 4.5 million copies globally. In January 2022, roughly seven to eight months after the game's global release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-village-sales-surpass-5-7-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capcom announced that 5.7 million copies of the title were sold</a>, thereby becoming the fastest-selling installment in the series.</p>
<p>We reviewed the most recent major new Resident Evil release upon launch. Here's what we wrote about the game<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in our review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Ultimately, Capcom knows when to deliver its big punches, and it begins and ends RE Village with a proper bang. They also leave players with some nice treats after the credits roll, including a solid new incarnation of Mercenaries mode and tons of concept art and extras with interesting behind-the-scenes details attached. You’re left with a game that feels like a high-class horror buffet. The game throws so much at you over the course of its packed 12-to-15-hour campaign that you’re guaranteed to find plenty to enjoy, even if there’s a few things you may be tempted to push to the side of your plate.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Once Human PvP? – Answered]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-once-human-pvp-answered/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-once-human-pvp-%E2%80%93-answered.897948/</guid>

<p>Once Human is shaping up to be one of the year’s most interesting open-world survival games; now, that’s saying something, considering the sheer number of crafting survival games we receive annually. But in this unique world, you’ll face monsters and more. So, is Once Human PvP?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-once-human-pvp">Can You Play Once Human PvP?</h2>



<p>Yes, you can play Once Human PvP. Developer Starry Studios specifically built the game to accommodate both types of players—PvE and PvP—by implementing different servers to suit either preference. </p>



<p>When selecting a server, check its “Type.” It’s the second column in the server browser, following the server’s name. You’ll note there are two: PvE and PvP. If you prefer fighting against other players while surviving against the various enemies and elements, choose a PvP server.</p>



<p>From personal experience with the game, I’ve found PvE far more popular, meaning way more players to interact with. You can’t fight them.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-pvp-works-in-once-human">How PvP Works in Once Human</h2>



<p>When you first start in Once Human, you’ll wake up in a cryo-sleep tank in an underground facility. It’s a short prologue meant to introduce you to the mechanics, give you free loot, and touch on some of the story through environmental storytelling and lore notes found in the world.</p>



<p>But once you finish the prologue, the game truly opens into a massive world. You’ll encounter zombies, SCP-like enemies like The Siren, and other players if you join a PvP server. </p>



<p>The thing is, you can’t immediately start shooting another player and expect a gun battle. You must hold “P’ on your keyboard, enter Chaos, and then you may attack other players and structures. At the same time, others can attack you. It’s similar to the PvP mechanics in Fallout 76.</p>



<p>Why should you PvP in Once Human? Alongside the thrill of fighting a competent player, there are also resources to consider. A human player will have better equipment and items to loot after a PvP battle, often better than what you’ll find in the game world!</p>



<hr>



<p>We’ll have more on Once Human coming soon, so check back in the coming days! In the meantime, don’t forget to subscribe to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

<p>In a new report <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-fresh-jurassic-park-survival-details-revealed-including-new-locations-and-more">by IGN</a>, fans learned more details about the characters, locations, dinosaurs, and release window for Jurassic Park: Survival.</p>



<p>The report includes details from an internal Q&amp;A. It features some compelling new information from Universal Products &amp; Experiences’ John Melchior, and Saber Interactive’s Oliver Hollis-Leick. </p>



<p>Saber Interactive first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-park-survival-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Jurassic Park: Survival</a> at The Game Awards 2023 with a polished reveal trailer. However, the trailer had an ambiguous ending with no release date or window. According to IGN’s new report, Melchior and Hollis-Leick confirmed that “the game won’t be out in 2024.” </p>



<p>Today’s report also mentions that Jurassic Park: Survival will feature new locations that “were not part of the tour or got cut off by the storm.” </p>



<p>Hollis-Leick stated there will be “new characters,” implying there wil be others in addition to the protagonist. They also hinted there could be new dinosaurs that did not appear in the original film, but confirmed nothing. </p>



<p>Hollis-Leick also revealed that players will “need to use caution and planning” to explore different terrain on the island. At times, they will also have to “move very carefully through an environment to avoid the attention of certain predators.” </p>



<p>This hints at dinosaurs potentially having unique behavior, stealth, and making strategic decisions.</p>



<p>Jurassic Park: Survival will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-sales-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Miju Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>&nbsp;sales have topped a million since the game's release in Early Access over two years ago.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1284190/view/4158591103921508999" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new post on Steam</a>, Miju thanks players for helping it to reach this milestone, calling it a "tremendous achievement for our small team of six".&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's important to note that this sales figure takes into account the entire time period between&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>'s March 2022 release date and today, rather than the time between now and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-release-date-10">1.0 release earlier this year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-planet-crafter-sales-million-base.jpg?itok=HPAIVpOv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-planet-crafter-sales-million-base.jpg?itok=zlgkvzQ2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>has enthralled audiences since its launch two years ago.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, considering the relatively small niche&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>occupies (although it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/enshrouded">far from</a> the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/palworld">only open-world</a> survival <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/astroneer">crafter out there</a>), a million sales is certainly nothing to be sniffed at.</p>
<p>Miju says the robust support the game has built up will allow it to continue working on the game into the future, implementing "all the great ideas" its staffers have in order to grow&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>even further.</p>
<p>However, given that the 1.0 release and a new update have just been released, Miju says it's going into hibernation for the summer in order to "recharge our batteries".&nbsp;</p>
<p>The studio says it'll return in a few months with "new content and exciting news", so if you're a fan of&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>, you shouldn't have too long to wait before you know what's coming next.</p>

<p>You'll need to collect resources, build machines to improve your chances of survival, and "eventually geo-engineer an entire planet", as the Steam page says.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/luigis-mansion-2-hd-hands-on-impressions/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For years the Luigi’s Mansion series remained firmly in the shadow of big brother Mario’s many adventures, but 2019’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/luigis-mansion-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a> proved to be a bit of a breakout hit, garnering <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/luigis-mansion-3-bustin-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enthusiastic reviews</a> and eventually selling nearly 15 million copies. In the wake of that success, Nintendo is doubling back and reviving the somewhat-overlooked previously-3DS-exclusive Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon for Switch under the title <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/luigis-mansion-2-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a> (the game has always been known as Luigi’s Mansion 2 in Europe for those confused).</p>
<p>Luigi’s Mansion 2/Dark Moon was quite an ambitious game by 3DS standards, but is it still a scary-good time here in 2024? I’ve had the opportunity to go hands-on with Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD and can comment on roughly the first third of the game (up until the midpoint of the second mansion). Tip-toe on down for my early impressions…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD largely sticks to the series’ standard set-up. That rascal King Boo has escaped his bonds and shattered the Dark Moon which protects the Evershade Valley, causing it to become infested with <em>g-g-g-ghosts</em>. Luigi is again recruited by friend/tormentor Professor E. Gad to don the upgraded Poltergust 5000 and cleanse multiple themed mansions of their pesky paranormal activity.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While there’s always debate about where the line between remasters and full-on remakes lies, Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD is unquestionably on the remaster end of the scale. While the game sports updated textures, character models, and improved lighting, actual level layouts and geometry doesn’t appear to have changed, with everything having a rather chunky, angular 3DS look. That isn’t to say the game is ugly, but it’s a solid notch below Luigi’s Mansion 3, which is one of the most visually-polished first-party Switch titles.</p>
<p>Not a ton has changed in terms core gameplay, either. As in all games in the series, Luigi uses his Poltergust vacuum to both interact with the environment and suck up specters. In battle, your goal is to stun ghosts with your flashbulb, then vacuum them up. Ghosts will try to break free from you, but pulling in the opposite direction fills a meter which allows you to unleash an extra burst of suction power. None of the moves added in Luigi’s Mansion 3, including the satisfying ability to smash ghosts into objects and each other, have been reverse-engineered into Luigi’s Mansion 2 – combat plays out like it always has.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Well, that’s not <em>entirely</em> true. The game was, unavoidably, a bit awkward to play on a 3DS owing to its lack of a second analog stick, but that’s obviously not a limitation Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD has to deal with. You can now move Luigi with the left stick and aim the Poltergust independently with the right stick, much like you can in Luigi’s Mansion 1 and 3. That said, continuing this series’ history of inexplicable control limitations, Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD <em>doesn’t</em> offer a single-stick option where your vacuum always point the same way you’re facing. Sure, more experienced types will want to go with the twin-stick controls, but younger, less experienced players may appreciate a simpler control scheme.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Like other aspects of the game, the level design of Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD is largely identical to how it was on the 3DS, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Each of the game’s multiple mansions are laid out in a satisfying Metroidvania-like fashion, with plenty of goodies and secrets hidden around ever corner. While puzzle design isn’t quite as creative as Luigi’s Mansion 3, there are some surprisingly challenging brainteasers to be found here that require you to examine ever nook and cranny of your environment. Bosses, like the giant spider lurking at the end of the first mansion, are puzzles in their own right, which require very specific steps to overcome and provide an unexpected level of challenge.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Luigi’s Mansion 2’s generally impressive level design isn’t always well-served by the game’s mission structure. Unlike Luigi’s Mansion 1 and 3, which give you a degree of freedom to explore the world as you wish, Luigi’s Mansion 2 is strictly mission-based, with areas of a mansion that don’t serve said mission typically being blocked off.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Also frustrating is the game’s save system, which only records your progress after you’ve completed a mission, some of which can be 30 to 40 minutes long. Have to quit midway through a mission? Too bad, back to the beginning. Die during a mission? Unless you find a hidden golden dog bone item during a mission, too bad. Perhaps the structure of Luigi’s Mansion 2 made <em>some</em> sense on the 3DS – portioning the game up into missions arguably makes it more “pick-up-and-play,” and for whatever reason, Nintendo was fixated on getting people to put their 3DS games and system into sleep mode instead of quitting. But in 2024? This approach to missions and saving feels antiquated and like something Nintendo could have modernized without that much effort (give us a more generous autosave like LM3 at least).</p>

<h2><strong>Current Thoughts on Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</strong></h2>
<p>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD is still packed with plenty of spooky charm, but beyond more versatile controls and a limited cosmetic spit shine, Nintendo hasn’t been terribly brave with this update. Hardcore Luigi’s Mansion maniacs have plenty to look forward to, but those who became acquainted with the series with its popular third entry may have to adjust. I still have more to play (I haven’t tackled the online ScareScraper multiplayer mode at all yet) and am enjoying my time thus far, but I can’t help but notice some of the dust that’s accumulated on this Mansion.</p>
<p>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD arrives on Switch on June 27. You can expect a review from Wccftech prior to the game's launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/enotria-last-song-preview-put-it-on-repeat<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last time I checked out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/enotria-last-song-preview-flavors-of-italy"><em>Enotria: The Last Song</em></a> at PAX West, the preview demo showed off verdant, lush fields and bright, carnival colors reminiscent of Italy. There was a simple pleasure in exploring the space, in terms of aesthetics and soulslike gameplay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Summer Game Fest Play Days, Jyamma Games came back with vengeance, offering a boss rush demo that absolutely demolished me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't lose the will to keep trying, but I definitely felt like I was thrown into the deep end. There's a lot of mechanics layered on top of what you'd typically expect for a soulslike, and as with any unique element system, there's a learning curve that one hour of show floor play time doesn't quite lend itself to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aside from its gorgeous aesthetic, two main aspects stick out to me that set <em>Enotria </em>apart from its usual counterparts: masks and the aforementioned element system.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Masking Up Is Vital in <em>Enotria&nbsp;</em></h2>
<p>At any point, I could switch between three masks, which are essentially classes of their own. I had my base stats, but each mask augments those stats to fit a certain mold, along with completely changing my loadout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the first mask focused on physical damage, with a light and heavy sword. The second mask featured that same light sword along with a one-handed hammer, and it focused on a specific element called gratia, which looks kind of like a holy light.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each mask also comes with special passives you can slot in, so you can create fairly unique builds that keep you versatile and ready for any situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the PAX West demo, Jyamma has sped up the time it takes to swap masks, opening the door more for mid-combat experimentation. If one build isn't working or if it's the perfect time for another build, swapping only took half a second.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I was a little overwhelmed diving into three fully kitted builds, but I imagine in the real game, ramping up to the three will feel more natural and be easier to absorb.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>In Your Element&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Another aspect of the game that took some getting used to was the element system. <em>Enotria </em>features four elements that aren’t easy to ascribe to common things like fire or water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, you have vis, fatuo, gratia, and malanno. These four elements correspond with four status effects: dizzy, wicked, radiant, and sick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gratia, like mentioned above, looks a lot like holy energy, and malanno acts similar to poison. Still, it reminded me a lot of when I was first learning the elemental language of the Persona series; it’ll take me more than an hour to internalize and understand these elements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add onto that, you can get affected by these four status ailments, which is both good and bad. There are upsides to being infected by these elements, which are also augmented by your mask, gems, and passives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the developer fought a boss in front of me, he was being healed from something that would normally damage me, all while he was affected by the wicked status effect. I really couldn’t follow it all in the moment, but the possibility of understanding all this and building explicitly around it could be very interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite finding <em>Enotria </em>much more difficult than when I last played it, I’m still eager to see more from Jyamma’s upcoming title. I think when I’m able to ramp up to the mid- and late-game stages, it’ll all click a lot more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above all, if it showcases more beautiful moments inspired by Italian folklore and culture, I’m on board with seeing where the game could go from here. I’m excited to find out as we get closer to its release on Sept. 16.&nbsp;</p>

  <p id="gM3zrD">Sunset Visitor’s <em>1000xResist</em> — a sci-fi adventure game released on May 9 — strikes at the heart of the experience of being born a child of immigrants, using generations of clones to tell the story of how we inherit our parents’ memories and must decide what to do with them. </p>
<p id="q8QDCG">The narrative centers on a cast of identical (but for their bright, anime-inspired uniforms) clones living in a quasi-utopian undersea society 1,000 years after humanity’s demise at the hands of a mysterious alien force known as the Occupants. All these clones come from a single source: Iris, who found immortality as a teenage girl and has lived hidden away for most of the millennium, save for her memories, which she passes down to her clones. That includes the game’s main protagonist, Watcher, whose assigned role is to observe and record Iris’ story for this new cloned generation.</p>

<p id="NUqZJQ">Iris’ story begins with her memories of living at home with her parents, who are both immigrants who fled Hong Kong after the pro-democracy protests they participated in came to an end in 2019. They left home in search of safety and a new life free from political persecution, state-sanctioned violence, and imprisonment. </p>
<p id="tDVVZS">Iris repeats and replicates these memories, bringing them forward into the present, 1,000 years later. She passes them on to her many clones, who were produced in an effort to create a colony of survivors with potential immunity to the Occupants. You spend the game diving into and exploring Iris’ memories (first as Watcher, then later as another clone named Blue), many of which involve her impressions of her parents’ experiences and retellings of life as political refugees and immigrants in a new and unfamiliar country.</p>
<p id="BmqvFX">In one flashback scene partway through the game, we see Iris’ parents reflecting on their past in the midst of the devastation caused by the Occupants. Her mother wonders if the costs were worth it. “What was the point?” she asks. “It wasn’t just about winning,” her father responds. “If we stayed silent, didn’t stand up for ourselves, they would say this is how it always was… this is what the people wanted. No. They can’t say that. Because it has gone down in history, that we resisted fiercely. That we fought for a different future, until we couldn’t. That legacy lives in us.”</p>
<p id="pqOgKC">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> The rest of this article contains <strong>full spoilers</strong> for the ending of <em>1000xResist</em>.]</p>
<p id="82Ipze">Iris’ colony of clones lives in a giant vessel hidden at the bottom of the ocean. These clones have never seen the surface, nor any other living humans. Yet they still inherit the memory of Hong Kong, the affection for it, the rumination over whether leaving home was the right choice. They inherit Iris’ fragmented dreams, her own thoughts of home, of her parents, of where she came from.</p>
<p id="2B7YrR">It’s eventually revealed that the apocalypse occurred when the Occupants — an alien species drawn to our sadness and trauma — attempted to record and immortalize human memories to use them as a form of sustenance. They unknowingly consumed humanity in the process: When the Occupants expose their trauma, the humans begin to cry and cannot stop. Their bodies die, hollow and desiccated — but their memories live on in the Occupants. These eternal memories, in the form of unending dreams, come at the cost of our living world.</p>
<p id="rIzfq1">Growing up with immigrant parents means living in an uneasy embrace of old dreams and older memories. When these parents leave the countries where they were born, they often leave something behind. Often they become estranged from their families, their own parents, the homes they grew up in, the neighborhoods they were familiar with, their meaning systems, their religion, their gods. </p>
<p id="7w4Isn">Their children then experience these memories of loss secondhand, as memories of a memory. These memories don’t necessarily belong to us, as children of immigrants, but we can’t help but hold them in mind. We look through family photo albums, we watch home videos of familiar-looking streets and skylines; we recognize a feeling of home in them, one that is made slightly uncanny by our distance. </p>
<p id="pC2NvI">In my mother’s closet are rows of old VHS tapes of family gatherings back in her mother country, Tunisia. They’re sites of remembrance and emotion, but they are suspended in time, and disconnected from the lives we live today and what we must plan for in the future. Seeing the characters in <em>1000xResist</em> engage with the deeply nested legacies of those who came before them evokes the feeling I get when thinking about those tapes stored in that dusty old closet.</p>
<p id="UXoDo8">Just as Iris’ parents leave Hong Kong and everything they know, Iris chooses to leave her home, splitting away from her overbearing parents to join the government soldiers and scientists who will whisk her away to the undersea lab where she can be studied and eventually cloned. Eventually she runs again, willingly into the arms of the alien Occupants, who promise to empower her to stand apart from her parents, but they will take something away as well. She will live on, but within an eternity of unprocessed trauma, in a kind of suspended animation — not growing, not moving forward, but looking back, forever.</p>
<p id="iE1yRE">We all wind up repeating at least some of our parents’ mistakes. It’s an inevitability. We grow in much the same ways, with many of the same patterns baked in, and yet we think that, this time around, we’ll do things differently. Like Iris’ father tells her: “We do not get to choose what we inherit.” </p>

</p>
<p id="r0ieqZ">We see this manifested in the decisions Iris makes. She punishes the first Watcher for disobediently taking her own initiative and creating her own clone, just as Iris’ mother punished her for wanting to do things her own way. Iris then hides herself away, removing herself from the hard task of parenting, just as her dreamer of a father often did, leaving the task of disciplining to others.</p>
<p id="TtlF1B">There’s an extent to which the memories and behaviors we inherit, especially when we avoid processing them or seeing our own part in them, can be stultifying. Iris and her clones live in the colossal shadow of a world that no longer exists, playing through painful old memories in a compulsive loop, fleeing and being drawn back endlessly.</p>
<p id="z5ry4g">The game teaches us that to truly grow, to become something separate and new, we have to leave our memories in the past. Iris, held in the timeless embrace of the Occupants, cannot move on from her past, cannot step outside of her dreams. She is haunted by unprocessed memories, and so are her clones. She spreads the haunting like an infection. The memories become vestigial, cancerous, growing and multiplying, weighing down their hosts.</p>
<p id="3EW6wq">The Occupants aren’t acting out of any sense of hostility. They inadvertently destroy the humans by separating them from their memories, which continue on in deathless stasis. But memory, like mortal life, is supposed to fade away. It is made richer because it’s something we have to actively grasp at, like the ephemeral threads of a dream slipping from our minds as we leave our beds. Life is precious because it is momentary and fleeting.</p>
<p id="bmBNrE">At the end of <em>1000xResist</em>, Secretary, a split-off element of the original Occupant, joins back with its original host after 1,000 years with the clones. Over that millennium, Secretary learns many things from humanity, chief among them the temporary nature of life and the inevitability of death. It comes to understand that this fading and flawed eternity that Iris and her clones have been trapped in has long since drifted past its expiration date, and must come to a merciful end. </p>
<p id="XKXWRV">The choice is made to risk venturing out onto the unknown surface, rather than remaining with the ghosts buried below. These remaining clones, free from Iris’ all-eclipsing memories, must learn how to leave the past behind, while continuing to cherish and learn from it. Children must learn how to make their own memories, while bringing the hard lessons learned by their parents with them.</p>
<p id="HWop5x"><em>1000xResist</em> locates the kernel of hope within a future full of compromise and failures. It shows us how protest movements may fail, how capitalism and state power will do their best to crush us. But it also shows us that running away, escaping into a fantasy, wrapped in the arms of some eternal, unreal past, is no way to live. We must accept the past as gone, while understanding that we will always bring a part of it with us as we walk forward into the uncertain future. </p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240611.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new press release</a> from Capcom today, Resident Evil Village has officially sold 10 million units globally since it first launched in 2021.</p>



<p>Capcom adds that Resident Evil Village is now “the fastest title in the series to hit this milestone.” Further, the press release states that “the title continues to gain new users, selling approximately 2 million units each year.” </p>



<p>This is partly attributed to the support for new platforms. Capcom wisely capitalized on the Halloween season in 2023, bringing Resident Evil Village to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-village-iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone and iPad devices</a> on October 30 last year.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Village earned strong ratings at launch, and still maintains Very Positive ratings on Steam. It is often praised for its narrative and inventive horror. </p>



<p>Claims from reliable leaker Dusk Golem surfaced last month about the next major installment of the Resident Evil franchise. They first suggested it could launch in January 2025, but later elaborated that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-isnt-coming-anytime-soon-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t coming anytime soon</a>.</p>



<p>Two weeks ago, the same leaker also claimed that Resident Evil Code Veronica and Resident Evil Zero could be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom’s next remakes</a> for the series. Late last year, Capcom officially confirmed that it plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-plans-to-keep-remaking-resident-evil-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continue making Resident Evil remakes</a>. This isn’t likely to slow down following the enormous success of Resident Evil 4.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Village is available globally on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and the Nintendo Switch.</p>

That's quite the mouthful, but it's probably worth it. Deluxe Edition includes the game, Steelbook, FOX patch, "!" sticker, and character art for <a href="https://zdcs.link/8BbLw" target="_blank">£89.99 (with free delivery from Amazon)</a>. </p><p>But, it's only available in the UK. This seems like a fair trade, as those over the pond aren't able to purchase the recently revealed Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Collector's Edition including that sweet terrarium. But, if you'd prefer to snag the Deluxe Edition while in the States, here's how you can do it.</p><p>Amazon UK will happily ship the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Deluxe Edition to you, for a small fee, so if that's the edition you're most excited about, place your order ASAP to avoid disappointment. Using the link below should allow you to place a preorder via Amazon UK and ship it to the US.</p><div id="201882"><p><h3>Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater Deluxe Edition - PS5</h3></p><div><p>Release Date: TBC. Preorder now and pay nothing until dispatch.</p></div></div><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta was one of the many games to get a spotlight <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase">at the recent Xbox Showcase</a> but, much to the disappointment of fans, a release date was not revealed with the new trailer then. But, GameStop recently tweeted a preorder link to Snake Eater, saying the MGS3 remake will arrive on November 17. <a href="https://x.com/GameStop/status/1800271874590449796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The post</a> has since been deleted.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is said to be a faithful remake of MGS3, so much so that Konami isn't <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-reportedly-isnt-recording-new-voice-acting-for-metal-gear-solid-3-remake">even planning on recording new voice lines for it</a>. Despite that, the Delta symbol in the name of the remake (stylized as Metal Gear Solid Δ: Snake Eater) is meant to highlight "'change' or 'difference' without changing structure," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-explains-why-theres-a-symbol-in-metal-gear-solid-3-remake">Konami previously explained</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>For more info on Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater preorders, be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">breakdown on every edition available to purchase</a>, and what's included.</p><p>Other big deals in the UK today include the <a href="https://zdcs.link/AdVgp?_ga=1195960001.1647009307" target="_blank">INIU 140W 27K portable charger on sale for just £37.98</a> using the listed vouchers on Amazon.

This souped-up stealth action game has all-new graphics and cut scenes, based on the Unreal Engine 5. However, it will reportedly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-reportedly-isnt-recording-new-voice-acting-for-metal-gear-solid-3-remake">use the same voice acting tracks</a> from the original game.</p><p>And while you'll still be able to use the same (stiff) control scheme as the original, in Delta you can opt instead for modernized controls. That's how I'll be playing the game, thank you very much.</p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Astro Bot Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-editions">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-release-date-editions">College Football 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-ps5-pc-release-date-preorder-bonus">Concord Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-collectors-edition-preorder">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-preorder">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-release-date-special-editions">Madden NFL 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/master-detective-archives-rain-code-plus-is-up-for-preorder">Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Plus Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-collectors-edition">Metaphor: ReFantazio Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-release-date-deluxe-edition">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-stories-collection-preorder">Monster Hunter Stories Collection Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-shadow-generations-preorder-guide">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-special-editions">Star Wars Outlaws Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-release-date-collectors-edition">Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p>Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

Miyazaki revealed the entrance to the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is the withered arm hanging from the cocoon in the Mohg, Lord of Blood boss fight area.</p><p>Today, June 11, Bandai Namco re-tweeted a post by streamer Cohh Carnage that highlighted who Steam achievements indicate the majority of Elden Ring players on Valve's platform have yet to defeat Mohg.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Bandai Namco US (@BandaiNamcoUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1800330011171496440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>As Cohh Carnage points out, as it stands just over 62% of Elden Ring players on PC will not be able to play Shadow of the Erdtree because they have yet to defeated Mohg. It’s a similar stat on PlayStation and Xbox, with around two thirds of players having failed to defeat Mohg on each platform. Perhaps that's unsurprising given Mohg, Lord of Blood is an optional boss players who mainline Elden Ring might have missed.</p><p>Thankfully, IGN has a guide on <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/How_to_Prepare_for_the_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">how to prepare for the Shadow of Erdtree DLC</a> if you need to scramble ahead of the expansion's release later this month.</p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-first-impressions-of-the-big-dlc">IGN’s impressions of Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, which launches June 21.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Quickest Ways to Get Ready For Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</p>
      </div>
<p>"Friendly PSA for all those looking forward to Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree," Bandai Namco <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1800330011171496440" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on social media</a> in response to a user explaining how the achievement for beating Mohg had only been unlocked by 37.8% of the game's players on that platform. "You have less than two weeks to prepare!"</p><p>Finding exact numbers on PlayStation and Xbox is a little trickier, as several Trophy and Achievement-tracking have wildly different results, but it's a safe bet that a chunk of the respective playerbases have yet to take on conquer those bosses. If you are looking for some help, you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-mohg-boss-battle-guide-how-to-beat-the-lord-of-blood/1100-6501655/" data-ref-id="1100-6501655">Mohg</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-beat-starscourge-radahn-in-elden-ring/1100-6501545/" data-ref-id="1100-6501545">Radahn</a> boss battle guides for tips and tricks on how to defeat them.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-adds-new-difficulty-modifiers-and-10-more-bosses/1100-6523942/">Shadow of the Erdtree looks set to push players to their limits</a>, as not only does the expansion add 10 more bosses, it also throws in a new difficulty-adjusting feature, and players won't feel overpowered when they enter new areas.</p><p>"Yes, Shadow of the Erdtree is more of the same Elden Ring gameplay you know with new weapons, items, and areas to enjoy. But that is something that no other game has offered and no other developer has delivered," Tamoor Hussain wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-of-the-erdtree-renews-the-awe-and-adventure-of-elden-ring/1100-6523901/">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree preview</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Everything To Know So Far</p>
      </div>
<p>Call of Duty campaigns are known to be about 4-6 hours in length, though obviously this doesn't represent the kind of experience you might have for a great variety of reasons. For Black Ops 6 specifically, Miller said the development of the game's campaign responds to the call from fans for greater variety.</p><p>"They don't want one note for your experiences. Luckily for us, Black Ops kind of lends itself to that, where you can do your heist missions, and your puzzle-solving and stealth and your big military incursions as well…While they want a lot of freedom, and they want a lot of variety…they also want to get taken on the roller coaster rides as well," Miller said. "I think a big goal for us all is just to give players the opportunity to be smart, where you're not just taking them on this journey the whole time, where they have the opportunity to explore and decide how they want to get through a situation."</p><p>Unlike past Call of Duty games, Black Ops 6 was developed over a period of about four years, which is longer than usual, Treyarch confirmed in the interview. Another big shift for Black Ops 6 is that it's the first entry in the Black Ops series that wasn't made using Treyarch's own game engine. All Call of Duty games for console/PC are now made on the same unified engine. Miller said this change "definitely had its benefits."</p><p>As for Black Ops 6 coming to Game Pass at launch, Miller said he learned of this decision not very long ago, though the developer did not specify exactly when. It was reported in May that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-on-game-pass-is-not-guaranteed-microsoft-having-internal-debates-about-it-report/1100-6523291/" data-ref-id="1100-6523291">Microsoft still had not decided if it would put Black Ops 6 on Game Pass.</a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316985-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.30am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316985" data-ratio="0.56038647342995" data-width="621" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316985-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.30am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316985"></a><figcaption>The Black Ops 6 campaign is about as long as you'd expect</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316985-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.30am.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316986-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.37am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316987-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.43am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316988-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.49am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316989-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316990-screenshot2024-06-11at8.34.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316986,1300-4316987,1300-4316988,1300-4316989,1300-4316990" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4316986-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.37am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4316987-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.43am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4316988-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.49am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4316989-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4316990-screenshot2024-06-11at8.34.04am.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316986-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.37am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316987-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.43am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316988-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.49am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316989-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316990-screenshot2024-06-11at8.34.04am.png"></figure><p>With Black Ops 6 coming to Game Pass, it means the game might be able to reach an even wider audience, Miller said. And this led Treyarch to think more about the "onboarding" experience for people who might not be familiar with Call of Duty.</p><p>"It's been four years since [the last] Black Ops… Zombies is super deep rich. It's got quest lines and story. Some people just may not even remember that. With new players, how do you bring people into that universe?" Miller said. "Sometimes we take for granted that a lot of people play Call of Duty and have been playing Call of Duty before. 'Oh, they'll get it. You know, they've played this before.' So I think it has forced us to relook at some of that."</p><p>Black Ops 6 launches on October 25 for Xbox and PlayStation consoles, as well as PC. A multiplayer beta is coming prior to launch, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">here's how to get into the Black Ops 6 beta.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/a-command-conquer-retrospective<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For my RTS book I am writing, I decided to take it upon myself to replay the entire Command &amp; Conquer series as I only played bits and pieces of them back in the day. Returning to the game that defined the entire genre at the time was interesting, as it also meant going back to a different time in game design and game presentation. Whether or not the games hold up to this day is debatable, but the style is certainly timeless.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="I'm a Mechanical, I'm a Mechanical...">I'm a Mechanical, I'm a Mechanical...</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The original game holds a fond memory for a lot of RTS fans being the one that really kickstarted the genre. Even after 25 years, the style of the game has gone from cutting edge to now a time capsule of 90's FMV and animation. The live-action scenes may be a bit hokey, but that's part of the charm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The faction design may not have the same depth that&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>StarCraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;would achieve and set the standard for, but it does a good enough job here given the challenge of the AI. GDI units are stronger, but in a game built around counters, being able to field more units than your opponent is the greater advantage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a funny way, while NOD is technically weaker with all their units, they make up for it thanks to the AI and pathing in the game. You are allowed to run over infantry with heavier vehicles, and this completely breaks the balance of the game in favor of Nod. The medium tanks by GDI are too slow to reliably run over units and the scatter command can get away from them, but not with light NOD tanks. Most of my wins in the game came from a mass army of light tanks running down all the infantry, including the anti-vehicle ones. This is important as the AI for units is a bit weird when it comes to moving and shooting. Flamethrowers and grenadiers will destroy enemy infantry but require them to get close enough to target and fire of them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The mission design goes all over with a focus on baseless missions and those when you do have to build. The AI is very aggressive when it comes to rebuilding, and your goal in every situation is to destroy the command yard to take it out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The challenge of these games is that both factions are given maps where they simply don't have the easy unit to win.</span></p><p>Superweapons are still just as super today (source Author)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With GDI, you must take on several bases with anti-infantry defenses without any strong vehicles. While NOD must deal with airstrikes with some of the worst anti-air defenses in the entire series. With these early games, you're not really playing a RTS battle, but a RTS puzzle that you need to solve in order to win. The GUI here, even in the remaster is still a bit clunky compared to modern examples, and no attack-move will be one of the biggest things to get over to play it. The music still rocks with many classic tracks, and if you're looking for the best possible version of this to play, then definitely play the remaster released in 2020.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hell March"><span>Hell March</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Alert</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;1 delivered a spin-off that would turn into its own universe, the memorable music, and some of the strangest FMV videos. This also kicked off a tradition by Westwood with swapping the faction strengths between games -- now, the allies have the weaker, but more agile units, and the Soviets have stronger, but more expensive ones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The mission design as a whole is given a huge remodel -- with larger maps, more advanced command missions, and...sigh, naval battles. The naval missions are my least favorite in any RTS, and this one has multiple ones. Like before, you are going to have to figure out how to win against an AI that loves to keep building while its command yard is alive. Pathfinding is still wonky in places -- flamethrower towers and those super jumping attack dogs are going to cause a lot of problems. While it doesn't have the same charm as the original in terms of the story, it does set the stage for more craziness down the line.</span></p><p>The first Red Alert is a long way from where the series would go (source: Author)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can tell that this started out as more of an expansion/side project to the original game, as much of the GUI and structure are the same, and it wouldn't be until the next game that the production value and the design took a giant step forward.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of the classics,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Alert 1</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is just okay for me, but I don't remember it as fondly as the original with exception to Hell March 1.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie"><span>A Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiberian Sun</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is when you can tell that Westwood really got a budget for the movies, and seeing the "a part of Electronic Arts" tag at the start caused some pain to my soul. Once again, what was one cutting-edge 24 years ago is now more cheesy, but it holds up. Returning to this one, it was a bit of a shocker to see professional actors like James Earl Jones chewing through the scenery along with Joe Kuccan.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This one is interesting in terms of unit design, we're now in the period where the factions have to be as different from each other as one can. So you have GDI with disc-throwing grenadiers, NOD with tunneling APCs and flame tanks, and those artillery guns that NOD has are perhaps the greatest ground unit of all time in terms of how busted they are.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The mission design in this one gets more diverse compared to previous games. Many missions are a part of a chain in the story, and you are free to decide which ones to do to grant you an advantage in the main one. If you want, you can ignore them for a harder mission but will cut down the playtime. This is the one where in terms of faction design, I'm all-in for NOD. Like the previous games, unit counters are a huge deal and while everyone has more health, the counter damage is far stronger. A few rocket infantry will shut down air units quite easily, and the APC rush with NOD's underground APCs are just fun to do.</span></p><p>Tiberian Sun is when the series really starts to distinguish itself from other games (source: Author)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And speaking of NOD, this is also where the developers really embraced NOD as the cool faction and gave them the best toys. Of all the strategy games at the time, including&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>StarCraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, NOD became the official "troll faction" of RTS. You have an army that can rain toxic missiles down, completely stealth their entire base and units, send APCs and tanks underground to harass, and they get damn Terminator cyborgs and stealth tanks, and the as-for-mentioned heavenly artillery guns. Meanwhile, GDI gets jetpack troops and sonic tanks, which are still cool, but again, with the counter system in play, they get taken down quite easily.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of the wonkiness that exists in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiberian Sun</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is with all the older games thanks to the UI. We're still not at the point where there is an actual attack-move command, and the game really likes the mission objective: "literally kill every single unit and building and wall section of the enemy." The mission design is well done, but it is broken by the AI and the defenses. The artillery gun by NOD has no equal -- there is no ground unit that counters it. Even when the GDI gets their own siege unit in the expansion, it has shorter range, less armor, and it's not as accurate. This, combined with the pathfinding and AI makes some missions just too annoying to play to enjoy. Which is a shame, as the game features some interesting mission designs all the way through the expansion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I would still recommend playing this one for the time capsule effect of seeing how sci-fi changed from the 90's to the 2000's.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hell March 2"><span>Hell March 2</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Alert 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;would become the last C&amp;C game officially worked on by Westwood.&nbsp;Keeping with making their factions as cool as possible,&nbsp; like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiberian Sun</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the Allies and Soviets are now fully different in terms of their units and strategies. The allies get more flexible aircraft and jetpack soldiers, while the Soviets get tesla power, apocalypse tanks, and soviet squids.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both sides feel good and distinctive to play, and this is helped by some of the best variety of mission designs. You still have a mix of base and base-less missions to do, but there are more factors to deal with than just killing everything that moves. The AI has also been programmed that once it loses its major buildings to just send everything at the player to end the match as quickly as possible.</span></p><p>In terms of tone and unit design, Red Alert 2 is my favorite (source: game)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The FMVs are a joy to watch and marvel at early 2000's technology and popular actors at the time. In terms of improvements, we finally can set rally points from buildings, but still no attack-move.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For multiplayer,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Alert 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;still holds up as one of the more interesting RTS to play, as the Allies and Soviets are now delineated into different nations that have one unique unit added to their pool like the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Age of Empires&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">series. I really like the expansion that forces the player to fight against Yuri with his own tricks and buildings to deal with in even more unique missions. Every mission can be won through using brute force, but there are often ways to completely shut down the enemy fast if you know what you're doing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was a great one to revisit and a fitting, and sad, swan song for Westwood Studios. If you have the chance to replay any of the older games, this is one you should check out and there are fan mods that add even more content to it.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="C&amp;C 24"><span>C&amp;C 24</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Generals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is officially when EA Los Angeles took over as the developer for C&amp;C, and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Generals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;represents that major shift in tone and design. Being released in 2003, the game was released during the era of heightened patriotism following the events of 9/11. Instead of alternate worlds, the game takes place in the "real world" with controlling the US, China, and the Global Liberation Army which is the stand-in for Middle-Eastern terrorists. Strangely enough, this is the most dated part of replaying the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Command &amp; Conquer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;games, with the tone now becoming more serious.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead of three separate campaigns, there is now a loose set of missions split between the three factions going from China, to the GLA, and finally the US. Of this period, you can tell that EA Los Angeles was pushing C&amp;C to become more eSports friendly. Unit pathfinding and AI are far worse compared to previous ones. You must set units to either attack or guard move if you expect them to do anything when you're not watching. The rock-paper-scissors balance of the series is spiked here -- unit counters will destroy their targets very fast, but the AI itself doesn't do a good job of prioritizing targets -- I watched ten tanks attack a solo infantry unit while there were tanks behind them picking them off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The problem is that the developers want their cake and eat it too: It wants to reward the player focusing on every single encounter, but you can't do that and reasonably build an army and manage your economy at the same time. Not having the vertical command bar for buildings and construction at all time really hurts this one in my opinion. When I sent a fully stocked army to fight something smaller, and their one supposedly weaker units kill my guys immediately, it doesn't feel right.</span></p><p>Generals felt the most off to play second only to C&amp;C4 (source: Author)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is the first 3D RTS in the series and it shows, with very blocky polygons and a lack of textures for everything. The one aspect of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Generals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;I do like is the sub factions of the different generals introduced in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Zero Hour</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Each general pushes the faction in a different direction -- getting specific strengths and weaknesses compared to the base one. I like when RTSs allow the player to customize their factions and do things beyond just the standard build orders; it's why I still love the home city concept from&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Age of Empires 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. For me,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Generals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;does not hold up as someone who didn't enjoy competitive RTS play and UI/UX, and it hits especially harder after going through the originals up to this point.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Kane Lives"><span>Kane Lives</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Command &amp; Conquer 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiberium Wars</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and its expansion are viewed by fans as the real ending to the Tiberium side of the franchise, and having not really played it up until now, I must agree with them. The pathfinding and general AI are far more improved than they were in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Generals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the 3D is far more improved with greater use of effects for lasers and shots and the graphics still hold up to this day.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The campaign structure in this is my favorite of the series, allowing players to replay missions easily, see how they did, and what they missed. There is still micromanagement in this one and I'm not a fan of the hotkeys used, but I do like that the game allows you to rebind every key to your choosing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The return of FMVs is a great thing, but the tone is very different, and in a way represents how Sci-fi and TV changed from the 90's to the 2000's. The 90's was the era of camp and cheese for action shows, while the 2000's was when drama and seriousness became more popular. Still, Joe Kuccan knows what he's doing, and seeing Billy Dee Williams and Michael Ironside on the GDI side was a hoot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, there is one big problem with the game that does knock off a few points. The game's final patch rebalanced aspects for multiplayer, but also impacted the singleplayer campaign. There are maps where the enemy doesn't need to spend money to literally pump out infinite units to defend and attack. On one map, I did not even have enough tiberium available to build an army to attack the enemy with. If you're hoping to beat the game on hard difficulty, you had better be a pro eSports RTS player. It's unfortunate, as I can see why fans treat this as one of the better modern C&amp;C games, but when I watch my anti-infantry tower lose to infantry while my AA guns don't stop enemy aircraft, I can't fully recommend the base game in this state if you're looking for a more casual experience without mods.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The problems are fixed with the excellent expansion&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kane's Wrath</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;that adds in missions that try to fill in the pieces before and after the base game, also introducing new sub-factions for each of the three. The sub factions come with unique tech upgrades and units that push the factions into different directions. The game was also released after the major balance patch to the base game, so the entire campaign is balanced around the multiplayer changes. I would still recommend playing them both, as they do sadly represent the final real Tiberium setting games. In terms of unit designs, continuing with the previous two, all three factions are 100% distinct from each other, and this is made more with the sub-factions introduced in Wrath. Of the games I played, despite the balancing issues, I would still put this as my second favorite design-wise.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Space!"><span>Space!</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Alert 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is the final game we got on the Red Alert side of the franchise, and they went big here. This is the game where the production values are at its highest -- with some of the best looking and detailed units of any RTS. The FMV cutscenes reach peak cheese factor and&nbsp; almost reminds me of the&nbsp;"Sharknado" franchise, especially with all the celebrities coming in to ham it up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For our game, we get three completely different factions like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Command &amp; Conquer 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with each having unique units. This is by no means a carbon copy of the previous games and it does play the most different next to&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Generals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Every map is designed as a coop experience, and the AI does do a really good job in this one. In return,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Alert 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s map design is good, but the missions lack the variety seen in previous games, as every map was designed to fit two players. The enemy AI is weak here, as it's not really playing the same game as you are, obviously due to the 2 v 1 effect on most maps. It will not rebuild structures, and sniping essential unit productions early will make any map a breeze.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The gameplay is the most micro-intensive of the series, but that's still low compared to other RTS. Every unit has a secondary or special feature that can do everything from change its form, to launch a special attack, and much more. It can be a bit much to keep track of, and why I would place it lower on my list compared to C&amp;C 3. The biggest difference in this one compared to previous that I don't know where I stand, is how resource gathering is far simpler with only one harvester per ore field allowed. It makes it far easier to set up your economy, but also very easy for someone to disrupt it, and removes some of the advanced play and economy strategies of previous games.</span></p><p>If this doesn't sum up the absurdity of Red Alert 3 I don't know what will.

Featuring far smaller army limits, always online connections, and the worst use of account progress for multiplayer. After a lot of trial and error, I did manage to get it to work, and easily found it to be the worst in the series.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The concept of having different MCVs that act as the sub factions of previous games is a good one, but how it's done here simply doesn't work. It reminds me a lot of when I played&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gotham Knights</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, in that to make the different characters work, they took one fully-fleshed out character (Batman) and split him four ways. Here, you can’t build defenses unless you are the "defense" class. The idea is that you can play the campaign in coop, much like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Alert 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, however, there is no AI to help you or provide backup here, which fundamentally breaks the game's missions. Since each player is drastically limited in terms of units they can build, going up against an AI that can pump out more units means that you will never win the numbers game, and that makes it impossible at the start to make any progress. I would have made it for singleplayer that you simply have the command total of two MCVs to make things balanced. Sure, you do get upgrades for each class, but they're tied to account level, which makes the singleplayer frustrating and I would imagine the multiplayer impossible for starting at account 0.</span></p><p>The whole account system concept just doesn't work with a limited pool of units (source: Author)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is next to no personality to the different units, and there are far more here than previous games, but this is used to bloat out the new counter system that&nbsp;further adds different armor types that makes things even more confusing compared to previous entries. Since you don't start with any anti-building units, it means fighting other MCVs and structures takes forever. Also missing is the delightful cutscenes and cheese of previous entries. In the span of four missions, my "wife" who had about 3 minutes of screentime is killed, which makes it hard to care considering my character is a camera and doesn't say anything throughout the entire campaign.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As I'm writing my book on RTS design, I think C&amp;C4 had some good ideas to making a faster-paced RTS, but how it's presented here just doesn't work. You can't have low unit totals with low-quality units, and tying everything to an account level that most people aren't going to jump through hoops for was a bad idea.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How Does it Hold Up?"><span>How Does it Hold Up?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking back,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Command &amp; Conquer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is a franchise that is defined by its aesthetic. While it never gets to the same level of technical precision and balance that made&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>StarCraft&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">work, it didn't need to. The great FMV scenes, varieties of missions and units, and fantastic music made it all work. The irony is that the games that you could tell EA really put their finger on the scale to make things different and more competitive-friendly (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Generals&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>C&amp;C4)&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">turned out to be the worst entries that don't hold up or are as memorable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It also stands as an important lesson for RTS designers today that style is certainly a missing element from a lot of these games. Having units as memorable as the kirovs, avatars, and even the GDI orbital laser are nowhere to be seen. Unit variety is also a huge point and why these games are so memorable in terms of strategies and tactics. I do still think the idea of sub-factions like in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Zero Hour</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>C&amp;C 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;have value, but I've yet to see any other studio capitalize on this style of design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From a GUI/UX perspective, the series has come a long way.

With that said, hotkey standardization is mixed across all the games, and no easy way to set control groups from unit production does hurt things for casual players.

<p>I’ve always loved the art of the Metal Slug series of side-scrolling shooters, so I’ve been keeping a keen eye on the fetching grid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> antics of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-slug-tactics">Metal Slug Tactics</a> ever since it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-slug-is-trading-run-and-gun-for-turn-based-tactics">first announced</a>. For as long as I’ve been excited, I’ve also been worried. It’s been a polarising experience, like being alternately fed delicious sandwiches and those inedible rotlogs they sell at Subway. Still, I’ve remained cautious: is all this great pixel-art just a shroud pulled over a ho-hum tactics game to rescue it from naffness? It’s with this in mind I hungrily dove into the Steam Next Fest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1590760/Metal_Slug_Tactics/">demo</a>, as one might hungrily dive into a bin to eat literal garbage if their only other option was Subway.</p>

<p>I jump into the first mission as Metal Slug mainstay Marco Rossi, a man who will not take off his bandana under any circumstances. The official fan wiki describes Marco’s appearance as a cross between Sylvester Stallone and David Bowie. I get distracted imagining Stallone singing Space Oddity for a bit, then decide I better play some videogame, much like a Subway worker returning from break and realising they must slap together another horrendous vomit-tube of a sandwich.</p>
<p>Every turn each character gets one move and one action, but if you take the action first, you also lose your move. This feels on the more restrictive end as far as action economies go, but you can use "synchronisation" attacks to stretch that economy out, further than a pack of Subway meat over a thousand anemic dirt-loafs. These are special tag-team actions you trigger for free by setting up orthogonal flanking postions. For now, though, it’s just Marco. I can pick between a pistol and a machine gun, but the latter has limited ammo. It’s here I notice some nice quality-of-life bits. You can undo moves and fast forward enemy turns, though there <em>is</em> a restriction on the undo-ing, which I’ll unfurl below like a yellowing lettuce leaf on a stale roll that costs eighteen pounds, or sixteen pounds with ten years' worth of Subway loyalty points.</p>
<p>The game soon introduces some welcome slapstick hijinks. I use a switch to drop a hanging bomb-crate on a couple of idiots. This doesn’t cost my action, but, just as promised, prevents me from undoing previous moves. The crate does exactly 1996 damage to the two fools, which is the year the original game released. Cute. What’s a bit less cute is, as much as I still adore the art style, is the enemies I’m fighting are some irksomely lazy middle-eastern stereotypes straight out of, well, the mid-nineties. It’s up to you how you feel about this stuff, of course, but alongside the occasional strain of middle-eastern instrumentation in the soundtrack, and the non-descript Islamic architecture, it’s all a bit unironically "America, fuck yeah" for my tastes. Preservation, eh?</p>

<p>Anywhoo. The further you have a character move, the more ‘dodge’ you generate. I’ve seen this in a few tabletop games before - it’s a useful and flavorful way to represent evasiveness in a turn-based ruleset, and I like it a lot. Running also generates a resource called ‘adrenaline’, which is spent on special actions. For Marco, these are an area-of-effect missile strike, and a buff that lets him or an ally shoot twice. The strike is silly fun, and it also destroys an entire tank. Metal Slug’s tank designs are one of my favourite things about it, so I’m a little sad to see it go, much like a beloved local bakery being replaced by a Subway even though there's already six of them on the same effing street.</p>
<p>Soon, I’m joined by a couple of pals, Eri and Fio. Eri has infinite grenades, which sounds ridiculous, but I can only throw them orthogonally - same with her grenade launcher, albeit with a longer range. It’s the same with many of the weapons and abilities, actually, so you’ll need to think carefully about positioning rather than just vaguely being in range. You can also hit your own dudes if they’re in the same line, which is quite funny if tactically nonoptimal.</p>

<p>After the tutorial, I’m given the chance to select a mission from an overworld map, each with different primary and secondary objectives. I’m also warned there'll be an ‘enemy response in four turns’, which sounds like some sort of board game risk-reward aspect to it all. I pick one in a village dotted with buildings, and find out that most weapons can’t target enemies on different elevation levels. This goes against my years of tactics training, but also means my team are safer than I thought they were. So, a restriction for offence, but more to consider for defence? I don’t hate it! Annoyingly, the game only tells me this after I’ve deployed though, like an underpaid Subway worker only letting me know they're out of honey mustard <em>after</em> they've already assembled my disgusting pus-cylinder.</p>
<p>I’m rewarded with some XP after the mission, as well as some mods, which can do things like improve my grenades or give my guns more ammo. Level-ups let you pick between three randomly chosen abilities. Marco gets an explosive punch, for example, while Eri can now create detonating clones of herself. So! As a package, it does indeed seem like there’s some worthwhile tactical depth here, as opposed to the cover n’ flank copy paste coasting on an art style I was afraid it might be. As I said above, it could maybe do with coasting on a little less of the exact same artstyle in certain areas, but I’m just as interested in your take, reader. Is this art objectively dope, or am I just a wistful, nostalgic fool? Either way, this one’s still due for release in the last chunk of 2024 - an already unwieldy, gelatinous chunk, of the type you might discover in a horrible Subway sandwich. Which, as you may have picked up, I'm not especially keen on.</p>

                <p>Gamers have come to expect that most of the AAA titles are going to available on either consoles or PC. But at this year's Worldwide Developer's Conference, Apple signaled its increased focus on gaming by bringing some pretty big games to Mac. As a centerpiece for that shift, Ubisoft announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is coming to Mac on November 15, the same day that it's hitting PC and consoles.</p><p>"At Ubisoft, our mission is to enrich players' lives by creating original and memorable gaming experiences," said Ubisoft producer Marc-Alexis Côté during WWDC. "We see a huge opportunity to share our passion for games to more players in the Apple ecosystem thanks to the unified gaming platform with tight integration of Metal and Apple silicon."</p><p>According to Apple, the new Game Porting Toolkit 2 will allow developers like Ubisoft to bring more advanced games to Mac with greater Windows compatibility. Following Ubisoft's brief presentation of Assassin's Creed Shadows, Apple confirmed that the following games are also coming to Mac and other Apple devices.</p><ul><li>Control Ultimate Edition</li><li>Dead Island 2</li><li>Frostpunk 2</li><li>Palworld</li><li>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</li><li>Resident Evil Biohazard</li><li>Resident Evil 2</li><li>Riven</li><li>Robocop: Rogue City</li><li>Sniper Elite 4</li><li>Valheim</li><li>World of Warcraft: The War Within</li><li>Wuthering Waves</li></ul><p>That's a small list of impressive titles for now. But if Game Porting Toolkit 2 allows more developers to easily bring their games to Mac, then that list has the potential to get a lot larger in the near future.</p>

The new title is set in the distant past with the Doom Slayer as a kingdom's last hope against the hordes of Hell. While the game's melee weapons and dragon-riding experiences are new to the series, The Dark Ages' directors Hugo Martin and Marty Stratton told GameSpot that the latest sequel was inspired by both Doom 1 and Doom 2.</p><p>"At the beginning of project, everybody kind of goes back and plays the original Doom," said Stratton. "There were so many things in that original game that just have have fueled us... It's always that evolution, but there's just so much of the DNA even with the way that we develop and our our team size."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> DOOM: The Dark Ages Taps Into Classic DOOM To Create Something New</p>
      </div>
<p>"When we were talking about like what is Doom [in development], it was very much like borrowing from those ideas of the original Doom and Doom 2. As the brand has evolved and the ideas through the lore and all the different gameplay mechanics have evolved... it's amazing when you play the game you're just like 'this is unbelievable.'"</p><p>Additionally, the directors explained that the slower-moving projectiles in this game also came from the first two Doom titles.</p><p>"I think in the original Doom, in the opening hours, we all remember imps or soldiers firing slow moving projectiles... and they hit hard," explained Martin. "And if you get hit by one of those, you're in a lot of trouble... That's where the movement comes in. Instead of constructing a multi-tiered arena... if we ground it, slow down the projectiles, make them hit way harder, and create patterns in the space, then that's the jungle gym you're going to move through."</p><p>Martin and Stratton cited King Leonidas from 300 and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings trilogy as their primary inspiration for the Doom Slayer in this game, specifically to give the players the sensations of power and skill that those characters conveyed on screen. Martin also noted that Leonidas in particular inspired the shield, which was later combined with a chainsaw for the Doom Slayer.</p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC in 2025.</p>

<p data-characters="433" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’ve been playing the <em>Destiny</em> franchise since the first game’s alpha. I have fond memories of loading that early version up and blasting through everything it had to offer multiple times. Ever since, I’ve been hooked on this universe that, while not always giving me exactly what I wanted, was a space where I could live out a few sci-fi fantasies and explore an ever-evolving world spread across multiple planets. </p> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">When <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> was finally released, it took me back to some of the best times I’ve had with the series and the community at large. Though, this might not be for the reasons you’d think. You see, this expansion had one of the biggest and error-filled launches I’ve seen in all the time I’ve been playing <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2</a></em>, let alone the entire series. </p> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="717" data-injectable="true">But that’s okay because it took me right back to pretty much every expansion’s release. First, as expected, the game’s servers <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-destiny-2-server-not-available-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simply went down</a> as soon as they were supposed to go live. I was waiting on launch night and it must have taken three or four hours, much closer to me needing sleep, before they were up. </p>
 <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false">Overnight, players received all sorts of funny error codes. This might be the expansion with the most inventive list to date, including <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-destiny-2-error-code-cat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cat</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-destiny-2-error-code-currant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Currant</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-destiny-2-error-code-weasel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weasel</a>. Players were getting more errors than they were time in the game. Then, when I jumped in the next day, there was even more server downtime and queues to get into <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2s-the-pale-heart-location-leans-into-strangeness-and-wouldnt-look-out-of-place-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pale Heart</a> after that. </p> <figure data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">Don’t get me wrong, this was incredibly annoying for everyone at the time. I couldn’t help but feel pure nostalgia for the situation, though. I remember eagerly anticipating every <em>Destiny</em> and <em>Destiny 2</em> expansion, only to be hit by a brick wall on launch day as everyone attempted to get in and blocked each other out. </p> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true">It genuinely got to the point that I just stopped trying to play on release day. For example, the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-destiny-2-warmind/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warmind</a></em> expansion was released close to my birthday, so I took the day after its launch off and blasted through the campaign and extra content at a time when I knew I’d be passed all the bugs and server queues. </p>
 <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true">All these launch errors and issues are far from solo experiences. The <em>Destiny 2</em> community would share their woes and silly memes while waiting to get into the latest expansions. It was like hanging out with a group of fans at a concert while waiting to get in and see the band. You’re all in this together, no matter how cold and tired you are of waiting and how many delays you’ve had. You’re all going to see this thing through to the end, and that bonds you somehow. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true">I didn’t feel this with <em>Lightfall</em>. That expansion, had a fairly smooth launch, but it also had a lot less content and scope than <em>The Final Shape</em>. In a way, I’m really pleased that Bungie somehow managed to bring back all these memories of rubbish launch windows from the franchise. It made me feel all warm and fuzzy and somehow even more excited about playing through the campaign. </p>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">I don’t know what the future holds for<em> Destiny 2</em> expansions. We’re going to be living through an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-episode-guide-echoes-revenant-heresy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Episodic content delivery system</a> for a full year before we get anything else, and those Episodes might have smooth-as-butter launches. Part of me hopes they don’t because I want to have this feeling again and again for as long as <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s servers have left. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-village-sales-top-10-million-around-the-world.897855/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village&nbsp;</em>sales have passed a major milestone in the three years since the game was originally released.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240611.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>, Capcom says that sales of the game have crossed 10 million around the world, making it the fastest&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>game to reach this milestone.</p>
<p>Although it's the fastest in the series to achieve this goal, it's not the first;&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>remake have both sold over 10 million copies apiece, although it clearly took them longer to do so than&nbsp;<em>Village</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-village-sales-mia.jpg?itok=SwmNJgrW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-village-sales-mia.jpg?itok=Tkaz8PdH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Resident Evil Village</em>'s sales are pretty impressive.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only has&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village&nbsp;</em>managed to cross the 10 million threshold, but Capcom says that it's sold around two million copies per year since its release, which tracks given that&nbsp;<em>Village&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales">sold around eight million copies</a> at last count.</p>
<p>Per Capcom, the 10 million figure includes sales of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village Gold Edition</em>, which packs in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-village-shadows-of-rose-review">extra DLC</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lady-dimitrescu-sounds-like-fun-in-resident-evil-village-gold-edition">other content</a>, as well as versions of the game released for iOS and Apple's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-announces-resident-evil-village-and-no-mans-sky-for-m2-devices">M2 devices</a>.</p>
<p>All told,&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em>'s sales provide a pretty solid foundation for whatever the next game in the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>series turns out to be. Sadly, none of this summer's showcases have yielded an announcement on that front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-village-sales-castle.jpg?itok=yyuRmr2z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-village-sales-castle.jpg?itok=2N7v-4VF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Resident Evil Village&nbsp;</em>continues the story of Ethan Winters.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em>, it's the eighth mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>series (although it's far from the eighth game overall).</p>
<p>It follows directly on from 2017's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-groovy">excellent</a>&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em>, with returning protagonist Ethan Winters journeying to a remote Eastern European village to look for his daughter.</p>
<p><em>Biohazard</em>'s first-person gameplay returns (although a third-person camera mode is also available as DLC), but&nbsp;<em>Village&nbsp;</em>is a slightly more open-ended and lengthy experience than&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 7</em>, with various distinct areas to explore and lots of monsters to fend off.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/metaphor-refantazio-preview-worthy-of-atlus-35th-anniversary<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When a new&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/series/persona"><em>Persona</em></a>&nbsp;game releases, it feels like a cultural moment within gaming. Though it might not be&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>&nbsp;in name,&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>&nbsp;is about as close as it gets, which means this very well might be the top RPG of the year.</p>
<p>During Summer Game Fest, we got a hands-on preview of&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, including some dungeon-delving gameplay as well as a boss fight. I was excited for this game before I played it, but now I am ravenous for it. I need more.</p>

<h2><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>'s Combat is Fresh but Familiar</h2>
<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>&nbsp;trades&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>'s Japanese setting for a more fantastical world, and that is evident as I begin my dive into a dungeon. My task? Rescue hostages and defeat a necromancer. Classic fantasy, but it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dungeon feels appropriately ancient and fantastical, and has a stylized, almost hand-drawn look. This aesthetic extends to the characters and UI, which is especially impressive. Once again, <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/atlus">Atlus</a> has outdone itself in terms of overall look and feel.</p>
<p>If you've played&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/persona-5"><em>Persona 5</em></a>, the way our hero controls in this dungeon is quite similar to how you'd control Makoto Yuki or Joker. You're able to freely explore the dungeon, and if you see any enemy, you can attack it in the overworld.</p>

<p>Weaker enemies can be defeated by slashing at them in real time -- you do&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>have to engage them in turn-based battles, though the option to do so is still there. For larger foes, you're able to stun them by unleashing multiple attacks, thus starting a battle at an advantage.</p>
<p>Turn-based battles are very similar in feel to&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>, as well. Or really, most other turn-based RPGs, but what&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>&nbsp;excels at is keeping battles flashy, entertaining, and it throws in a couple new twists, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's your standard weapon attacks as well as a defensive option, and items. Spells are, once again, akin to&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>&nbsp;in that you have elemental-based attacks and buff/debuff options. For the latter, these seem to share the same name as those from&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/persona-5"><em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<em>Persona.</em></p>

<h2>The Flow of Battle in Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>
<p>There's a smooth flow to the battle with the systems in place, said systems being synergy skills, the ability to position allies in the front of back, and turn icons.</p>
<p>Players are granted four turn icons, at least during my demo. Certain skills consume one, two, or possibly even more turn icons, so you might not even have a chance to use all your characters in one round. Deliberate strategic planning is needed.</p>
<p>By exploiting an enemy's weakness, you're able to gain a turn icon and keep the battle going. It creates this sort of cadence similar to "One More" from&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Positioning allies in either the front or back was a curious inclusion, but as I understand it, those on the frontline take more physical damage, while those in the back row take less. The trade-off is, those in the back also deal less physical damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Synergy skills are where all these elements come together and create a wonderfully familiar, yet fun combat system. These are skills that require allies to be in the same row, and by working together, they unleash powerful attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These obviously consume more turn icons than other skills, but the benefit is usually worth it. Keeping track of and managing these turn icons while trying to unleash the most damage is going to delight RPG fans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All these skills came together and create a fun little dungeon-diving experience -- I tackled a minotaur and its minions without much issue, freed the hostages, and my party goes on its way.</p>
<p>We do see some cutscenes from companions I progressed. These are through cutscenes, and as one might expect, the protagonist has dialogue choices. This time, however, we control a voiced protagonist, which is a welcome pivot from the&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>&nbsp;series.</p>

<h2>Another Day in the Life of a Hero</h2>
<p>We also got a small taste of the social elements in&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio.&nbsp;</em>Our hero's base of operations in on this awesome ship (or maybe submarine) called the Gauntlet Runner, which has this steampunk vibe.</p>
<p>It has a bunch of amenities, from the pantry, to the toilet, and hey, even space to sleep. You can spend your time accordingly until it's the end of the day -- I decided to clean some weapons with one of my companions, thus earning this game's equivalent of&nbsp;social stats.</p>
<p>So yeah, it boils down to being&nbsp;fantasy&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>, but I am most definitely not complaining. I'm sure we'll be able to spend time in other ways, and the min-max gameplay fans of the series know and love will be prevalent here.</p>

<p>The end of my demo tasked me with defeating a boss on the deck of the shop -- this hideous beast with a human face and tentacles that'd smack my companions around. He gave me a right proper thrashing, so there is&nbsp;<em>definitely</em>&nbsp;challenge to the game's combat.</p>
<p>Rest assured,&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>does have its own identity, though the&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>&nbsp;roots are still there. I can't wait to dive into more dungeons and explore the world and learn its lore, and we don't have to wait <em>too</em> long to do so!</p>

<p>One of the most popular retail gaming and trade-in companies for games, systems, consoles and accessories might have made a big blunder last night. </p>



<p>Soon after the Ubisoft Forward 2024, GameStop took to X (formerly Twitter) to announce that the Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater pre-orders have gone live on their website. In the same, <a href="https://x.com/GameStop/status/1800271874590449796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">now-deleted post</a>, GameStop also mentioned a release date for the game, set for November 17, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s interesting is that Konami has yet to mention any release date for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Which begs the question, why did GameStop go for November 17, 2024? Interestingly, this isn’t a random date and is closely related to the game. November 17, 2004, was when the original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater was released, and according to GameStop’s tweet, the remake could be released on its 20th anniversary. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier claims</a> stated that the game should arrive in 2025. However, it could easily be a mistake at GameStop’s end, which could be why the post was deleted or if GameStop was on to something.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Konami was present at the Xbox Games Showcase event recently, where they unveiled a brand new trailer for the Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake. The developers are rebuilding the original game’s narrative, characters, voice actors, gameplay, and music for modern consoles and systems. The title is being developed in Unreal Engine 5, bringing realistic environment details and character models to the table.</p>



<p>Additionally, Snake’s clothes go through wear and tear when damaged during the battle, thanks to the upgrades to the battle system. The bruises and bullet wounds from these battles will be reflected on the body, and injuries will leave a mark permanently.</p>



<p>Moreover, you can choose to use the modern control style or go for the classic controls for the most nostalgic experience. There are new viewing angles for the player, too. The new style is a third-person view, and the Legacy Style brings the classic overhead view into the picture.&nbsp;Interested readers can learn more about the game editions for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>Will Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater be released this November? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
