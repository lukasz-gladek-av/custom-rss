            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-playstation-handheld-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is reportedly in the early stages of developing a brand new PlayStation handheld intended to challenge Nintendo's current dominance of the market.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg report</a>, which cites the usual "people familiar with its development", Sony is looking to both take on Nintendo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-sold-13936-million-units-super-mario-bros-wonder-sold-1196-million" rel="nofollow">hugely popular Switch</a> and to head off competition from a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-handheld-confirmed-but-years-away" rel="nofollow">potential Xbox handheld</a> as well.</p>

<p>Much like said Xbox handheld, however, the PlayStation device is likely many years away from release, and Bloomberg's reporters say that Sony "could still decide against bringing it to market", so we're very much still in the early stages of development.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-vita-new-playstation-handheld.jpg?itok=v3T5njU- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-vita-new-playstation-handheld.jpg?itok=MOWL6QRz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony's last true foray into the handheld market was the ill-fated PlayStation Vita.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the Bloomberg report, the PlayStation handheld would be designed to play PS5 games on the move, although it's unclear exactly how the device would work in this regard.</p>

<p>It's likely, however, that the handheld - if, indeed, it ever comes to market - won't predominantly use cloud streaming, because that would put it in direct competition with the PlayStation Portal, a handheld device <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonys-playstation-portal-gets-release-date-while-fans-keep-asking-for-real-portable" rel="nofollow">designed to play PS5 games</a> when linked to a console <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-update" rel="nofollow">or via the cloud</a>.</p>

<p>Bloomberg says that the Portal was originally intended to function as a standalone device, much like Valve's Steam Deck. Presumably, however, that scope got cut down during the device's development.</p>

<p>As it stands, the PlayStation Portal is capable of streaming PS5 games, but it doesn't have any native capability to play them. It's likely the new PlayStation handheld would feature hardware capable of playing PS5 games natively, although it's very unlikely it would support physical media.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-portal-playstation-handheld.jpg?itok=KNkrAFWr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-portal-playstation-handheld.jpg?itok=dmyE0aQq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If the new PlayStation handheld ever sees the light of day, it probably won't work similarly to the Portal.</figcaption></figure><p>News that Sony and Microsoft might be considering bringing new handhelds to market comes as anticipation for a new Nintendo Switch console mounts.</p>

<p>Nintendo has promised to share news regarding the Switch's successor <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">sometime before April next year</a>, but the company hasn't specified exactly when we can expect the device to arrive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>showrunner Christian Linke has revealed that the show, which recently ended on its second season, won't be the last&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>-based streaming series you'll see.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2309678052" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview on Twitch</a> with popular&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>streamer and content creator Necrit (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/arcane-showrunner-confirms-noxus-ionia-demacia-league-of-legends-shows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>), Linke revealed that&nbsp;<em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>will be part of a "cinematic universe", so although Jinx and Vi's story may be over, the story of&nbsp;<em>Arcane</em>'s wider world is just beginning.</p>

<p>According to Linke, the next shows to arrive as part of this universe will be based in the nations of Demacia, Noxus, and Ionia, all of which are very important powers in&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>' world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arcane-showrunner-league-of-legends-shows-jinx-vi.jpg?itok=PhaGGNgd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arcane-showrunner-league-of-legends-shows-jinx-vi.jpg?itok=yhgo3Y9G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>may be over, but the wider world of&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>shows is just beginning.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not up on&nbsp;your&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>lore, here's a quick primer. Many of the game's most upstanding characters, like Garen, Lux, and Fiora, come from Demacia, but the nation has a dark side as well; it's an isolationist fortress that does not treat its mages well.</p>

<p>Noxus, by contrast, is a brutal nation of military conquest and dog-eat-dog philosophy. Its leader, Jericho Swain, is a sinister general aided in his conquests by a demon, and its ruthless warriors include the likes of Darius, Draven, and the colossal undead Sion.</p>

<p>Finally, Ionia is a magical nation that has tried to maintain its neutrality in the many conflicts between Demacia and Noxus over the years. Its most famous inhabitants include the operatic serial killer Jhin, the martial arts legend Master Yi, and&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>' version of the trickster hero Wukong.</p>

<p>It makes a lot of sense to expand&nbsp;<em>Arcane</em>'s world; the show has proven popular with both&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>fans and non-fans alike, and one of its principal characters has even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-ambessa-revealed" rel="nofollow">found her way into&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>as a new champion</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jhin-league-of-legends-arcane.jpg?itok=Gum57RGT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jhin-league-of-legends-arcane.jpg?itok=wIxlsDxy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could theatrical serial killer Jhin be one of the characters we'll see in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>Ionia show?</figcaption></figure><p>Linke says the next&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>show is already in development, but he doesn't go into detail regarding which of the three nations the show will focus on (assuming it's just one, of course).</p>

<p>In any case, all nine episodes of the second season of&nbsp;<em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>are currently available to stream on Netflix, which, naturally, is also where you'll find the show's first season if you're yet to catch up on it.</p>

<p>Christopher Judge has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to deny that he was teasing an announcement about God of War.</p>



<p>The God of War actor recently took to TikTok to say that “the next two weeks will be chocked full of announcements and all kinds of good stuff. ” He ended the message by saying “boy,” a phrase that became popular in the recent God of War games. </p>



<p>Whether Judge knew it or not, his tease that there would be announcements “in the next two weeks” coincides perfectly with PlayStation’s 30th anniversary, leading people to believe that an announcement of God of War is on the horizon.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, several rumors circulated that a God of War Trilogy remaster was in the works. Judge’s tease, combined with the rumors, led many fans to conclude that it could be announced during a rumored 30th-anniversary showcase.</p>



<p>However, Judge quickly denied the claims on X. “Absolutely not true! You can’t tease something you know nothing about. I will be making announcements in the near future, I can guarantee none of them will be about OUR beloved God of War. I am awaiting updates just like everyone else,” <a href="https://x.com/iamchrisjudge/status/1860887360931569956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>.</p>



<p>Whether Judge got into trouble with PlayStation because of his original statements remains to be seen, with some people suggesting that the tweet was just to keep the impending announcement a surprise.</p>



<p>As for now though, we’ll have to wait and see. Do you think we’ll get a God of War announcement in the coming weeks?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-the-last-of-us-part-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler fares fairly well in The Last of Us Part 1, although it is inferior to both AMD FSR 2 and NVIDIA DLSS in certain scenarios.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> provided an in-depth look at the PlayStation 5 Pro update released for the remake of the first entry in the series, also providing a comparison between the AI-powered upscaler featured in the mid-generation system, AMD FSR 2, and NVIDIA DLSS. For comparison, the PC version was running with similar graphics settings, and sharpening was set at the lowest for both FSR 2 and DLSS, as PSSR seems to not use post-process sharpening.</p>
<p>Compared to AMD FSR 2, the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler shows once again how it delivers a slightly better image in motion, as FSR 2 aliases foliage and fine geometry more. Still, PSSR features some image noise that FSR 2 doesn't, so the two upscalers are pretty much equivalent in The Last of Us Part 1, although FSR 2 delivers a sharper, more stable image than PSSR with the camera at rest.</p>
<p>As we have already seen in other games, NVIDIA DLSS is clearly superior to the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler in the vast majority of scenarios, delivering a basically faultless image quality at rest while looking very smooth in motion, even in Performance mode. PSSR, on the other hand, manages to maintain image detail in motion better than NVIDIA DLSS, highlighting how the new Sony upscaler has the potential to become <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">much better in the future</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last of Us Part 1/Part 2 - PS5 Pro Tech Review + PSSR vs PC DLSS/FSR 2 Face-Off" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/coyPienBLGk?start=486&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler is only one of the features that make the PlayStation 5 Pro a better system than the base model. You can learn more about them in our review.</p>

There’s a reason your PS5 is the size of a small building, and it’s not aesthetic. And sure, in a few years’ time, such tech will likely be small enough to fit into something handheld, but by then the expectations for graphics will be photorealistic 5D liquid-pixels and we’ll be back to exactly where we are now.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>An array of Ubisoft games including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> are broken on some devices running Windows 11 with version  update 24H2 installed.</p>
<p>As such, Microsoft has blocked the Windows upgrade for some.</p>
<p>Microsoft has acknowledged the issues on its support site, and noted that certain Ubisoft games could become "unresponsive while starting, loading or during active gameplay". It added other users may be met with a black screen.</p>

<p>"To safeguard your Windows update experience, we have applied a compatibility hold on devices with these games installed," <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc">Microsoft wrote</a>. "These devices will not be offered to install Windows 11, version 24H2 via the Windows Update release channel."</p>
<p>The company implores users to not manually install the update if they own the affected games, which are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Origins</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</li>
<li>Star Wars Outlaws</li>
<li>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft has issued a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1sXCR6GmB3Kn7OrKiy8DPO/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-140">"temporary mitigation" for Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which should prevent the game from failing and stop responding. It did note there may still be performance issues, however.</p>
<p>Microsoft is currently working on a fix with Ubisoft, promising more information when the companies know more. In the meantime, it has provided the following workaround for users who find a game stops responding to their demands.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Task Manager. This can be accomplished by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc on your keyboard. Alternatively, you can right-click on the Start button and select Task Manager from the menu.</li>
<li>In the Task Manager window, look for your game in the Processes tab. It might be listed under the name of the game or the game launcher.</li>
<li>Click on the game’s name to highlight it. Then, click the End Task button at the bottom right of the window. This will close the game.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other Ubisoft news, the publisher recently announced it was removing those really rather frustrating (read, incredibly frustrating) forced stealth sections from "almost all quest objectives" in Star Wars Outlaws.</p>
<p>Thanks to an update earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-finally-getting-rid-of-forced-stealth-from-almost-all-quest-objectives">players will now be able to enter combat after getting caught while sneaking</a>, rather than getting ported back to the last checkpoint and being made to start the section again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The enemies of survival shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">Stalker 2</a> have a funny habit of showing up right behind you, like a panto villain with an AK-47. Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1gx7ja3/alife_20_in_action/">janky spawns</a>. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed "A-life" by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to "emergent" moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It's just broken.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Often, the game world exists only in the player's field of view," say the developers when asked to define the feature in an <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/faq">official FAQ</a>. "A-Life 2.0 is a simulation system for life in the Zone. Factions and mutants are fighting for living space, migrating, capturing new places, or retreating to safer areas. A-Life is what makes Zone truly alive and unpredictable."</p>
<p>If that is currently present in Stalker 2, it's hard to tell. Right now, it seems enemies spawn in a simple radius around the player, for example, and you'll sometimes even see them pop into the world. If you don't see the enemy themselves as they appear, you will see the white sight marker that abruptly shows you've been instantly spotted by the bad guy who has materialised somewhere behind you. It's not the most intelligent spawning system, but I guess it does keep you on your toes. It also doesn't apply to every kind of enemy encounter - some are scripted, while other bandits and soldiers are tied to particular locations, making those run-ins appear more naturalistic. </p>
<p>Enemies do fight one another when they come into contact as well, but this more often happens after a group of bandidos or pack of blind dogs blinks into existence near an enemy camp simply because you're there. I have come across roaming groups of Stalkers, but again their appearance is sudden, and they're more likely to walk straight into toxic waste and die due to braindead pathing than to get into emergent scrapes with the wildlife. I definitely haven't seen any (non-scripted) instances of factions "capturing new places" or "retreating to safer areas" as the developer's definition suggests. </p><p>After some players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1gw7djs/so_alife_isnt_really_in_the_game_then/">complained about the A-life system</a> being absent (and pointed out that a mention of the feature was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1guf62t/alife_20_is_no_longer_mentioned_on_the_games/">edited out of the Steam page</a>) the developers have responded on Discord and Reddit to say that the system is really there, but that bugs are preventing it from acting as intended. </p>
<p>"There are several known issues with A-life 2.0 system that we are aware of and are working on fixes/improvements," said the studio's community manager on the Stalker Discord (as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/stalker-2-devs-reassure-players-yes-a-life-2-0-is-in-the-game-no-its-not-working-right-and-yes-fixes-are-on-the-way/">PC Gamer</a>). "We know that this system is very important to the Zone having an immersive atmosphere, and we will do our best to fix the known issues."</p>
<p>It doesn't help that "A-life" is (and always has been) a hand-wavey buzzword, even more vaguely defined than Battlefield's "levolution" or Call Of Duty's recent "omnimovement". This leads to confusion and mixed expectations among players about what the feature actually entails. What is also complicating things from a developer perspective, say GSC, is that two different in-game systems are responsible for creating these theoretically organic shootouts. It presumably takes tweaking both to make the world feel inhabited by competing groups who wander around. And for each bug report or complaint they receive, they need to figure out which system is responsible for the unintended behaviour.</p>
<p>"The Combat AI and A-Life 2.0 are different things," one of the developers notes in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1gw7djs/comment/ly8nabt/">a reply to a Reddit complaint</a>. "One is actually a 'brain' for combat scenarios, while the other is an overall and more complicated system that is trying to manage life in the Zone."</p><p>In the meantime, the first patch for the shooter is coming soon, say GSC, who recently posted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-first-patch-is-coming-next-week-though-my-favourite-parts-are-still-the-imperfections"> details about the fixes</a> they're planning. A lot of these will address crashes, softlocks, balance adjustments, and other high-priority stuff, they say. But at the bottom of the list is "A-Life system bugfixes", which further suggests the studio considers it significant enough to sort out soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you’re a fan of Warhammer 40k, you know John Blanche. Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWarhammer/comments/c7ra8t/the_godemperor_by_john_blanche/">emprah</a> - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s "in the grim darkness of the far future…" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - <a href="https://youtu.be/znrCqYFFl9Q">Blanchitsu </a>- named after him.</p>
<p>Basically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer</a> series either. His piece <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WarhammerFantasy/comments/rtgrbg/harry_the_hammer_john_blanche_1983/">Harry The Hammer</a> was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making <a href="https://trademarkfilms.com/films/d121a6f6-231f-481d-86bc-3fe5ee83847f">a documentary</a> on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r0wI7m79Mc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>As per the title, the documentary’s narrative is set up as a hunt for the 46-year veteran of Games Workshop, which seems a little dramatic as far as narratives go: he’s <a href="https://youtu.be/NCOSao1KEQo">not exactly</a> been <a href="https://youtu.be/HnruIB54Zys">elusive since</a> he retired last year. Still, I’ve always quite enjoyed watching something I’m familiar with given an outsider-framing. It’s almost like discovering something for the first time, and I’m sure it’ll be interesting to see which details from Blanche’s long career the filmmakers consider pertinent or interesting to more general audiences.</p><p>What’s doubly exciting is that it seems like the documentary will explore further afield than Warhammer itself. In the trailer, you can see some models and artwork from Trench Crusade - a skirmish miniatures game with work from some ex-GW talent that recently did gangbusters <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1405364378/trench-crusade">on Kickstarter</a>. Even the <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1852841297469415604">Helldivers crew were impressed</a> enough to get hyped<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-devs-once-planned-a-licensed-cosmetic-system-that-basically-let-you-hallucinate-a-different-world"> about a crossover</a>.</p>
<p>Heder himself, according to a website blurb, was introduced to "the world of Grimdark" when out "looking for a gift for his kid". May I suggest <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrenchCrusade/comments/15noh8q/sin_eater/">this Trench Crusade lad</a> with more than a little <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a> influence, Jon? As for you, reader, do try and fish a copy of <a href="https://goblinlee.blogspot.com/2019/05/ratspike-john-blanche.html">Ratspike</a> out of the internet if you’re interested in more of Blanche’s work, alongside fellow fantasy luminary Ian Miller.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/who-is-waypoint-for-and-why-is-vice-doing-this.1044429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/vice-waypoint-site-news-reopen-open<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a reader of <em>this </em>website, you're probably familiar with the fate of a similar website, Vice's Waypoint,<a href="https://kotaku.com/rip-to-waypoint-a-good-website-about-video-games-1850385017#:~:text=In%202016%20Vice%20launched%20a,2023%20it%20will%20be%20gone." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> which was shuttered in April 2023 and its incredibly talented staff laid off</a>. You may not be quite as familiar with the fact that, earlier this year, even amid all Vice's very public corporate turmoil,<a href="https://aftermath.site/waypoint-vice-remap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Waypoint quietly came back</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/section/waypoint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Go take a look</a>! There's a site there with fresh stories and at least three writers' bylines attached to them. It has, if you turned the lights out and looked only at the brief flash of a silhouette before the room was plunged into inky blackness, the outline of Waypoint, in that there is a website there called Waypoint publishing stories about video games.</p><p>That's about where the similarities with the old Waypoint end, though, because this zombie version has very quickly become an incredibly <em>weird </em>website. Managing Editor Dwayne Jenkins is posting there a <em>lot</em>, quite possibly under duress, and nearly everything they are publishing sits slightly askew, like the frame of each blog is hanging from only one nail in the wall.</p><p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/loco-motive-and-games-journalisms-regrettable-relationship-with-indie-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This post, published on November 22</a>, is a great example. Bemoaning the state of indie coverage in games media, it is headlined by a game the author hasn't actually played, and later features attempts to call <em>Alan Wake 2</em> and <em>Dishonored</em> "indie". Its heart is in the right place, at least at the point it first set forth onto the page, but the turns it takes once it gets going are just utterly bizarre.</p><p>Waypoint in November 2024 is a collection of so many of these random thoughts, half-formed ideas and incomplete paragraphs. It's post after post of fever dreams, of unsupervised riffing on the medium, an artist's impression of what a video game blog from 2009 looked like, drawn by someone who wasn't there at the time and doesn't understand how they worked.</p><p>I'm not saying any of this to dunk on Jenkins or the site itself. This isn't a <em>bad </em>website, <a href="https://aftermath.site/its-exhausting-trying-to-read-video-game-website-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the way a content farm or clickbait hellscape might be</a>. It's a <em>weird </em>website, and I'm just trying to understand the point of it. I honestly can't get a read on why it exists, what it's doing with this rare second chance. Is it there to juice SEO? The blogs they're running won't do numbers in that market. Is it ads? There are LOTS of ads on the page, yeah, but there's no way this website has the readership to make them worth anything more than cents on the dollar. Is it to foster a community? The site has no comments, so I'm going to guess it's a no there as well.</p><p>Why would anybody want to read any of this? It's offering nothing that the original Waypoint did, a site with a genuine sense of community, a coherent tone, and work that was so valued by fans that when Vice shut it down it was almost instantly able to pop right back up again. Nu Waypoint isn't even good at the stuff the very worst websites are offering, like SEO slop and clickbait headlines.</p><p>It's like someone at Vice woke up one day, forgot they had already owned a video games website and closed it down, and thought in a rare moment of lucidity "man, you know what we need, a video games website". So they reopened Waypoint, hired some writers, ordered them to blog at a volume that seems harmful and thought that was that. This new website wouldn't need a vision, or a strategy, or any focus on quality; all it would need to do to succeed would be to shovel some content on the page and hope for the best.</p><p>In reality, the reality you and I and everyone else live in, it's all so obviously broken and clueless and detrimental to everyone involved, from readers to writers. I'm left as clueless watching this unfold as I was at G/O Media, as Jim Spanfeller gleefully broke everything he touched, like a flabbier version of the giant baby in <em>Spirited Away</em>.</p><p>Why are the people in charge always so fucking stupid? How can they be the only people on the planet to see that this isn't working, that it's a bad idea, that this is not what readers want or what writers should be put to work writing? Why is it that the dumbest people in the room are always the ones in charge?</p><p>I don't have an answer. All I can say is that, as always, fuck capitalism, go home,<a href="https://remapradio.com/signup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and you can support what Waypoint used to stand for at Remap</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Aftermath co-founder Gita Jackson previously worked at Vice's Motherboard, and appeared on Waypoint's site and podcast. </em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Farthest Frontier will now be released in full next year.</p>
<p>Originally, the town-building early access game was slated for its Version 1 release in 2024. But, with this year now only having a scant five and a bit weeks left (yes, really), the team has announced a change to those original plans.</p>

<p>Developer Crate Entertainment said it had decided to postpone Farthest Frontier's full release for a number of reasons. "For starters, we feel that performance is simply not quite where we would like it to be yet," it wrote in a <a href="https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/the-state-of-early-access-update-07/141562">post</a> detailing the delay.</p><p>"We are seeing your grand 3000+ population towns which are no doubt pushing the limits of hardware, but there is still more we could do to squeeze more frames out of the game, and we want to take the time to get it right."</p>
<p>Another reason is Crate Entertainment still has plans to add a few more bits and pieces to Farthest Frontier. This, it said, "bloats the schedule" somewhat.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the team has put its business hat on, and come to the conclusion now is not the best time to release its indie game in full. "With the holidays rapidly approaching, this is the time of year when big publishers are going to drown the market with advertising, eager for your holiday shopping coin. Similarly, February tends to be a month when everyone's wallets have just recovered from the holiday rush, so in come the big AAA releases," it reasoned.</p>
<p>As such, Farthest Frontier will now get its full launch in the spring of next year. You can check out a trailer for this new release window in the video above.</p>

<p>Our Bertie was rather impressed with Farthest Frontier when he gave it a whirl back in 2022.</p>
<p>"Farthest Frontier is not about going from dozens to thousands, from village to sprawling metropolis, and that zooming out you then feel as the person in charge. It's about staying small and staying close to the people you're caring for," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/farthest-frontier-understands-the-best-moments-of-city-builders-are-the-beginnings">Eurogamer's Farthest Frontier preview</a>.</p><p>"There's no hurry. It allows you time to let the tranquillity of the game wash over you - the gentle music, the sprawling natural world, the simplicity of surviving. It gives you time to lean in and take an interest in the small lives playing out in front of you, to watch them go about their daily work, to know their names, to check their needs are being met. It's a warm and relaxing place to be."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-playstation-event-could-be-coming-soon-as-sony-is-preparing-a-lot-of-content-%E2%80%93-rumor.1044411/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-event-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new PlayStation event like a Showcase or State of Play could be coming soon, judging from what a very reliable leaker revealed today.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, billbil-kun, who proved to be extremely reliable in the past, revealed that a lot of PlayStation content is being prepared behind the scenes, and some new announcements are coming, although the insider cannot say if an event is indeed coming. Seeing as there's a lot of content being prepared, it is unlikely it is just for this year's upcoming The Game Awards show, so something could indeed be brewing outside of single, separate announcements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">👀<br>
A PlayStation event is really happening soon?</p>
<p>I don't have the answer, but many PlayStation stuff are being prepared behind the scenes,</p>
<p>Some fresh news are coming,<br>
Stay tuned... <a href="https://t.co/IrLUZjgLTl">pic.twitter.com/IrLUZjgLTl</a></p>
<p>— billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1860979631148396721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It has been a very long time since the latest proper PlayStation Showcase, as Sony opted to go with usually smaller State of Play presentations for a while. A September showcase to present the PlayStation 5 Pro was long rumored, but it never happened as Sony presented the console without the big presentation many expected to see.</p>
<p>Besides working on games coming in the next year and beyond, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sequel-ghost-of-yotei-showcased-at-state-of-play/">Ghost of Yotei</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-hard-r-not-fully-open-world-2024-2025/">Marvel's Wolverine</a>, Sony seems to be quite active on the hardware front as well, developing not only the PlayStation 6, which will once again be powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">AMD</a>, but apparently also a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-handheld-in-the-works-to-rival-nintendo-switch/">PlayStation 5 handheld system</a> that will compete directly with the Nintendo Switch. Plans for the release of this system, however, have yet to be finalized, so there's the chance it will never be launched. As the company has somewhat gotten back into the handheld market with the PlayStation Portal after the commercial failure of the PS Vita and Microsoft working on a<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/"> portable system of its own</a>, it would be surprising for Sony to skip getting fully back into what is becoming more and more a very lucrative space, as highlighted by the many handheld systems that launched on the market after the release of the Steam Deck.</p>

            <p>You may have noticed some recent changes to our commenting system. I want to explain what has been happening.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago we swapped our in-house commenting system for a third-party system. As soon as the swap was complete, complaints about poor site performance and usability problems flooded in from readers.</p>
<p>Most importantly, a substantial number of you reported that your mobile devices were crashing when trying to read articles - not good.</p>
<p>We treat this sort of reader interruption with the same level of severity as a site outage, and we have been working behind the scenes with the third-party to understand and fix the problem.</p>
<p>But, sometimes the fix is to go back to what you had. So that's what we've done.</p>
<p>As of today, we are back using our old commenting system. No more infuriating "See more" buttons, no more broken notifications, and most importantly - no more crashing browsers.</p>
<p>You may notice your comments from the last two weeks aren't visible - we'll be restoring those in the coming days.</p>
<p>This, and other communities across Gamer Network sites have some of the most eloquent, funny, and insightful commenters on the internet, and we want you to stick around. That will only happen if our websites offer not just the best journalism in the world, but also provide you with the best reading experience and community tools possible. That is our goal.</p>
<p>I am really sorry about these recent changes impacting your ability to enjoy the site.</p>
<p>I'll be hanging around in the comments thread to chat if anyone has any questions, feedback, or ideas for further improvements we should make to our in-house comments system.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> and Riot Games' utterly brilliant Arcane will be followed by three further series exploring other parts of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> world. 
</p>
<p>
Arcane showrunner Christian Linke has now confirmed the locations in which these new stories will be set as Noxus, home to Arcane's Mel Meldarda, plus Demacia and Ionia.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2309678052">Necrit94</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/arcane-showrunner-confirms-noxus-ionia-demacia-league-of-legends-shows/">TheGamer</a>), Linke said these new series would tell fresh stories, but also continue some of the threads already seen in Arcane.
</p>
<p>
"We're really going wide, we're looking at every region and we really now have the ability to build a slate to tell many more stories - and continue some of them," Linke said.
</p>
<p>
Talented animation studio Fortiche will once again be at the helm for these series, after its award-winning work on Arcane's two seasons, but there's no word yet on when these new series might materialise.
</p>
<p>
Production work on the next show began a year ago, Linke noted, so hopefully we won't have another three year wait to see more.
</p>
<p>Linke had previously mentioned the development of further League of Legends shows when it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">confirmed that Arcane would end with its second season</a>.</p>
<p>"Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and our partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," Linke said in a developer update video earlier this year. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with the second season.</p><p>"But Arcane is just the first of many stories we want to tell in Runeterra. We've been with Riot through Vi and Jinx's entire journey thus far, from becoming in-game champions to characters featured in different cinematics to main characters in a TV show. Their arcs have grown so far beyond our original dreams, and we want to give the same treatment to more champions."</p>
<p>
In related news, a recent League of Legends leak has suggested the game will get a Noxus-themed season next year, as the game gets ready to host Mel herself beginning in early 2025.
</p>
<p>
"Some iffy pacing moments aside, Arcane's second and final season truly puts the money on screen," our Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">Eurogamer's Arcane season two review</a>. "This is a striking, emotionally wrought, hard-punching climax."

			<p>Microsoft has had to pause issuing the<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-windows-11-24h2-download-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Windows 11 24H2</a> update to users who have certain Ubisoft games installed on their PCs as the games become unresponsive. Here's the blurb from the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help article</a>:</p>
<p><em>After installing Windows 11, version 24H2, you might encounter issues with some Ubisoft games. These games might become unresponsive while starting, loading, or during active gameplay. In some cases, users might receive a black screen. The affected games are:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-once-sent-from-the-golden-hall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>​Assassin's Creed Valhalla</em></a><br>
<em>​Assassin's Creed Origins</em><br>
<em>​Assassin's Creed Odyssey</em><br>
<em>​Star Wars Outlaws</em><br>
<em>​<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></em><br>
<em>Note: Ubisoft released a temporary mitigation for Star Wars Outlaws to prevent the game from failing and stop responding. You might still experience some performance issues.</em></p>
<p><em>To safeguard your Microsoft Windows update experience, we have applied a compatibility hold on devices with these games installed. These devices will not be offered to install Windows 11, version 24H2 via the Windows Update release channel. IT administrators using Windows Update for Business reports can check these issues using the following safeguard IDs: 54437462 and 54580160.</em></p>
<p><em>Important: We recommend that you do not attempt to manually update to version 24H2 using the Windows 11 Installation Assistant or the media creation tool until this issue has been resolved</em>.</p>
<p>If you are already affected by the issue, the best workaround is simply to close down the game via the Task Manager if it has hung up. Microsoft and Ubisoft are currently working on a solution, and we'll update this story once it becomes available.</p>

<p>That’s a fair few key issues targeted, which is reassuring, although I do get the sense the series’ history with bugs has primed the audience to be a little more forgiving this time around - understandable given the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-stalker-2-moves-the-series-forward-and-why-it-reflects-ukraines-rebellious-spirit">extraordinary circumstances</a> that GSC Game World faced during development. Personally, I only have one request: please do not patch out this guy’s dodgy teeth:</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/stalker-2-teeth.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure>
<p>I’m not sure if the screenshot fully conveys what I’m talking about here, so do have a look at the <a href="https://youtu.be/YAoWRJ27S7E?t=156">Gameranx video</a> where I found the footage. And, yes, I admit this is a strange thing to get excited about, but I’m genuinely happy to see such imperfect, yellowing (even if it’s partially the flashlight) teeth in a game. It’s the sort of realistic touch that feels incredibly minor until you realise just how few games actually do it. Like, I say 'dodgy', but they're not even dodgy, really. They're just a normal bloke's normal, imperfect teeth.</p><p>I haven’t spent enough time with the game yet to tour its full menagerie of miscoloured mouths, although after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">reviewing the game</a>, James tells me that dodgy teeth aren’t too rare, if not exactly common. I may have honed in on this lad’s gnashers specifically because I’d so recently been blinded by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>’s pearly whiteout, even though its far from the first game to be populated by bizarrely blemish-free inhabitants. It’s the sort of manicured unreality that’s so common I don’t even tend to notice it until something like Heart of Chornobyl comes along with characters that look well and truly worn out. More bad teeth, I say. More scars in uncool places, more stretch marks. I’m serious!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larians-huge-2023-profits-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">While the mainstream success of Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> is undeniable, developer Larian has yet to announce a sales figure. But after financial records for last year were made public, we finally have an idea of just how big Baldur’s Gate 3 really was.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Confirmation comes from financial records posted by the Dublin, Ireland holding company for Larian, which is ostensibly based in Belgium, and controlled by majority shareholder, founder, and CEO Swen Vincke. (Ireland is one of the world’s most significant tax havens, with corporate tax revenues exploding in the country over the last decade.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to a paywalled report by the <a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/dublin-firm-behind-baldurs-gate-game-posts-249m-profit-after-runaway-success/a2033961431.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Irish Independent</a>, Larian posted a €249 million (approx $260.9 million) pre-tax profit for 2023, which included the August release of Baldur’s Gate 3. Revenue for the year hit €427 million (approx $447.5 million).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian has never announced a sales figure for Baldur’s Gate 3, although publishing director Michael Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1761874915752325387" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">indicated in February</a> that the game had sold well over 10 million copies, and Hasbro, the parent company of Dungeons &amp; Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast, said in March that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-has-made-90-million-for-hasbro">Baldur's Gate 3 had earned it $90 million due to its licensing deal with Larian</a>. The Irish Independent reported that Baldur’s Gate 3 had sold around 15 million copies and paid out a €28 million dividend this year as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian’s bumper 2023 financial results are in stark contrast to the company’s 2022, which saw a loss of €214,000 (approx $224,100) off the back of just €22.7 million (approx $23.7 million) in revenue. Baldur’s Gate 3’s wild success, then, was a game-changer for Larian, and that’s without taking into consideration the ongoing sales Baldur’s Gate 3 has pulled in so far in 2024. Indeed, Douse has said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-player-numbers-are-up-compared-to-last-year-seemingly-due-to-mods">Baldur’s Gate 3 has 20% more active daily users this year than last</a>, with mods helping to fuel seemingly never-ending interest in the RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke told IGN in September that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-one-year-later-larian-interview">the success of Baldur’s Gate 3 meant Larian was now in a “luxurious position,”</a> and could “pick our own destiny and our own path.” The developer shocked the video game world when it announced plans to make brand new games outside the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe, rather than follow Baldur’s Gate 3 with DLC or a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Irish Independent confirmed that while Vincke owns virtually all the ordinary shares in Larian’s Dublin holding company, Chinese megacorp Tencent owns a “large chunk” of preference shares in the firm via its Tencent Cloud Europe division.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t Larian’s only hit game, of course, but its success is a magnitude higher than that of its previous RPGs, including Divinity: Original Sin 1 and 2. Larian opened multiple development studios around the world to aid with the development of Baldur’s Gate 3 as part of its “following the sun” concept of 24-hour game development, with teams handing off work to the next time zone at the end of their work day to speed up development. In addition to Dublin, Larian has studios in Kuala Lumpur, Barcelona, Guildford, Quebec, Warsaw, and its original home of Ghent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Dungeon party game King of Meat will host an invite-only alpha this December, and you can sign up now.</p>
<p>Announced at Summer Game Fest, King of Meat is the debut game from studio Glowmade (comprising ex-Lionhead and Media Molecule developers), with publishing from Amazon Games. It tasks players with creating outlandish dungeons and then completing them with others in online co-op.</p>
<p>The alpha will take place from 4th December to 14th December for PC (Steam) and Xbox Series X/S players in North America and Europe (the test will be in English only).</p>
<figure>
<p>

<p>The alpha will include both dungeon creation and gameplay, giving players a well-rounded look at what to expect in the full release. You can take a look at gameplay in the above brand new explainer trailer.</p>
<p>There's currently no proper release date for the game, though it's expected to launch across PS5 and Switch alongside PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>The test itself is called<a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us/news/articles/king-of-meat-lights-camera-alpha"> Lights, Camera, Alpha!</a> due to the TV show framework of the game, with this essentially being the pilot episode. The game is full of irreverent and silly humour as players take part in a televised gameshow to increase their fame.</p>
<p>You'd certainly expect that sort of humour from the developers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/littlebigplanet">LittleBigPlanet</a> and Fable, though. I got to go <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/king-of-meat-is-a-chaotic-new-amazon-published-game-from-ex-lionhead-and-media-molecule-developers">hands-on with King of Meat</a> earlier in the year and had a fun time with its chaotic action.</p>
<p>You can sign-up for the alpha test on the <a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us/tester-sign-up">King of Meat website</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Larian has reportedly posted a €249m (£207m) pre-tax profit for 2023. This is, of course, thanks in no small part to the runaway success of the Dungeons and Dragon's-based <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>
<p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/dublin-firm-behind-baldurs-gate-game-posts-249m-profit-after-runaway-success/a2033961431.html">Irish Independent</a> [paywall], this bumper figure was shared within financial records posted by the Belgium-based holding company for Larian. The publication notes Larian had previously reported a loss of €214k (£178k), before Baldur's Gate 3 took the world by storm.</p>
<p>At the time of its publication, the Irish Independent stated Larian had sold approximately 15m copies of Baldur's Gate 3, and was able to pay out a €28m (£23m) dividend this year as a result of this. While Larian itself has never shared sales figures, earlier this year it was suggested that over 10m copies had been sold since Baldur's Gate 3's debut.</p>
<p>Larian's game was released on PC in August of 2023, before arriving on additional platforms. While of course <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-already-has-one-of-steams-highest-concurrent-player-counts-ever">being a hit on launch</a>, and going on to secure itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-the-game-awards">swathes of industry praise and awards</a>, Baldur's Gate 3 has continued to prove popular.</p><p>Earlier this month, Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-has-more-players-this-year-than-its-actual-launch-year">game's average daily peak concurrents are up by a not-to-be-sniffed-at three percent this year over last year</a>. Meanwhile, its average daily active users are up by a more substantial 20 percent over last year.</p>
<p>Larian is still supporting Baldur's Gate 3 (the studio recently secured itself a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">nomination for Best Community Support at this year's Game Awards</a>). However, it also has other irons in the fire. The studio previously confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-initially-started-work-on-a-follow-up-as-it-was-the-obvious-thing">Balder's Gate 4 was briefly toyed with</a> before it ultimately decided to try something new instead. </p>
<p>
Larian is yet to formally reveal its next project, it has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Sony is developing a portable version of the PlayStation 5, according to a new report. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch">Bloomberg</a> states that Sony's portable PS5 project is still in the "early stages" and might not ultimately reach the market.
</p>
<p>
However, Sony is reportedly keen to re-enter the handheld gaming market and compete with Nintendo Switch. In reality, that means with Nintendo's still-under-wraps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">which is expected to launch next year</a>.
</p>
<p>
Sony already has a portable device capable of playing PS5 games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-playstation-portal-review-impressive-hardware-but-is-remote-play-itself-good-enough">the PlayStation Portal</a> - although this is limited to playing streamed games only (initially from your own PS5 console, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-portal-update-adds-cloud-gaming-support-in-beta-no-ps5-required">though now also via the cloud</a>). 
</p>
<p>
Intriguingly, Bloomberg states that Sony's initial plans for the PlayStation Portal were for it to function as a standalone device, akin to the Steam Deck.
</p>
<p>Such a device would also help Sony bridge the gap between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, its recent mid-gen console refresh, and the inevitable PS6, which isn't expected until nearer the end of the decade.</p>
<p>
PlayStation is, of course, no stranger to handheld gaming. The PSP constituted the only serious competition Nintendo ever had in the portable console market, and sold more than 76m units. But its successor, the PlayStation Vita, fared less well - and reportedly sold around 16m units.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-all-but-confirms-plans-for-xbox-portable-console">also has plans to launch an Xbox handheld</a>. Speaking this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">Xbox boss Phil Spencer said his company's device was also several years away</a>, however.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/25/towers-of-aghasba-early-access-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Since <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/minecraft">Minecraft</a> and the sandbox survival boom of the early 2010s, the genre has continued to morph and expand, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/towers-of-aghasba">Towers of Aghasba</a> being its latest offering. Where some survival games have leaned more towards horror (<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-forest">The Forest</a>) and others have delved into mythology (<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/valheim">Valheim</a>), there are some common tropes throughout, one being a feeling of isolation. Wandering across Aghasba can sure feel lonely at times – albeit in a mysterious, enchanting way – yet one of this game’s highlights is how lived in the game world feels.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towers of Aghasba - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lTP0rbaw2SQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You wash up on its shores accompanied by myriad members of your tribe, the Shimu. You’ve set sail from Lehorra on a quest to restore the Shimu’s ancestral homeland of Aghasba, pursued by a sinister force known only as the Withered. Instead of having you fend for yourself and create your own emergent survival odyssey, Towers of Aghasba features story-driven quests that help inject its world with colour and character while showing you the ropes.</p>


<p>Ropes are pretty handy, actually, as are sticks, stones, and other basic materials you begin to gather. In true survival sandbox fashion, these can be combined to create basic tools such axes and shovels that then allow you to extract an increasingly diverse array of components and turn those into even more advanced tools and so on. This gameplay loop is near enough set in stone though Towers of Aghasba offers plenty of refinements and deviations to keep things fresh.</p>


<p>One of the Towers of Aghasba’s unique features is its focus on nurturing ecosystems. It’s fair to say the Shimu are a little miffed when they discover that their homeland is nothing more than a dusty, arid wasteland and not the bountiful paradise they were promised. Thankfully they’ve brought a giant magical seed with them that, when planted, births a colossal tree surrounded by verdant green pastures. With it comes new resources to sustain the Shimu as well as various forms of wildlife.</p>
<p>Needless to say, taking care of these ecosystems is vital, but just to emphasise that, a gruff-voiced seedling instructs you to plant seeds, feed animals, and fend off the Withered. In doing so you’ll earn Amity, a nature-infused energy that can be spent on expanding your ecosystems further while also serving as a very loose morality mechanic. Positive actions, such as tending to a wounded animal, will grant Amity whereas hunting that same animal will deplete it. Instead of trying to force players to avoid negative actions, Towers of Aghasba accepts that a balance must be maintained – skinning a Beetlepup is nasty work, yet the meat, hide, and bones will give life to the Shimu.</p>
<p>Hunting, as well as other forms of combat, are fairly simple in this early access version of the game. After establishing your first settlement, you are given a spear, a bow, and a handful of arrows, perfect for fighting the spider-like Withered that can kill you in a couple of hits if you’re not paying attention. Melee attacks are bound to a single button with the added ability to dodge, whereas ranged weapons adopt familiar aim-and-shoot controls. It’s not terribly dynamic, but it serves its purpose with scope for more advanced forms of weapon to appear later in the game.</p>
<p>Navigating Aghasba is similarly straightforward when starting out. You’ll quickly notice just how uneven the terrain is with its many small mountains and valleys though your innate climbing skills will make short work of them. You can stick to just about any surface as well as Spider-Man (or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Link</a>), ascending so long as your stamina bar doesn’t run out. It’s well worth breaking from the beaten path and exploring as Aghasba hides many secrets to uncover.</p>

<p>Going back to the Shimu, they’re not exactly the sort to sit back and let a young wanderer do all the hard work. In this early access build, they won’t actively help gather resources, craft, or join in combat, but they will build (once given the requisite materials) and offer valuable information, usually via tutorial quests. Within a couple of hours of starting, you’ll have a bustling village and the blueprint to all sorts of upgrades and add-ons including tents, campfires, storage bins, and even a farm. While some survival game fans relish in building their basecamps brick by brick, being able to plop down a prefab settlement removes some of that tedious busywork.</p>
<p>Towers of Aghasba is an approachable gateway into the genre that doesn’t hold back on features while introducing some quirks of its own. Its mystical setting is also deeply alluring, inviting you to unearth ancient secrets while restoring life to Aghasba’s derelict landscape.</p>

			<p>Sony is reportedly in the initial stages of developing a new PlayStation 5 handheld console that will compete directly with the Nintendo Switch. The surprising news comes from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, which cites anonymous sources and also clarifies that the plans have not been finalized. The console may not even ever make it to the market. This puts it roughly on par with what we know about Microsoft's Xbox handheld. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it is being made but also added it is years away.</p>
<p>Sony has a long history of making PlayStation handhelds, of course. The first one they produced was the PlayStation Portable, colloquially known as PSP, which launched between late 2004 and early 2005 across the world as a competitor to the Nintendo DS. The PSP was well received and Sony managed to sell a lot of units (76.4 million units as of 2012, the latest public figure), although not nearly as many as the Nintendo DS.</p>
<p>They tried again with the PlayStation Vita, which debuted between late 2011 (Japan) and 2012 (North America and Europe). However, the PS Vita was, by and large, a commercial failure, leading to the decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-stopped-first-party-titles-ps-vita/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandon</a> first-party game development for the platform in 2015.</p>
<p>Sony kind of revived its handheld tradition with the PlayStation Portal, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> earlier this year to seemingly solid sales. However, the Portal is only dedicated to streaming games via cloud. Interestingly, the Bloomberg article reports that was not always the case, as Sony had previously considered making it more like Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-handheld-amd-18-cus-1-8-ghz-gpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> by Moore's Law Is Dead earlier this year suggests that Sony would once again partner with AMD on this new hardware. That report mentioned compatibility with both PS4 and PS5 games, although Bloomberg only mentions that it will be a PlayStation 5 handheld. The latter option seems more likely: considering that the hardware is still a few years away, supporting PlayStation 4 games wouldn't really make sense at that point.</p>

Your first pair is included, and you should get roughly 30 hours of playtime before you need to swap them out.
