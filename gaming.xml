            <p>
Blizzard is removing the Hero Mastery Gauntles PvE mode from Overwatch three months after it launched as "it hasn't resonated with players".
</p>
<p>
The mode will no longer be available to play from Season 11 on 18th June, after it launched in March this year. 
</p>
<p>
Players therefore have until then, during Season 10, to complete the Lifetime Challenges for the mode and compete on its Top 500 leaderboards.

"As we prepare for Season 11, we've taken the time to evaluate a variety of game modes based on how much they are being played," reads a notice on the <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/update-regarding-hero-mastery-gauntlet/901366">Overwatch forum</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Hero Mastery Gauntlet was intended to bring the high score-chasing excitement of Hero Mastery missions into a multiplayer format. Unfortunately, it hasn't resonated with players in the ways that we hoped."
</p>
<p>
Individual Hero Mastery Solo Courses will continue to be available, with more expected in future seasons.
</p>
<p>
Overwatch PvE has been a bone of contention for Blizzard. The online free-to-play shooter's expected <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2s-long-promised-flagship-pve-mode-has-been-scrapped">Hero Mode was scrapped in 2023</a> as development "hasn't made the progress we would have hoped," it said at the time, though it promised other PvE modes were on the way.

</p>
<p>
Then in March this year, Bloomberg reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2s-pve-content-scrapped-as-devs-are-denied-bonuses-for-the-first-time-report-claims">all PvE content had been scrapped</a> due to "poor" sales and Blizzard would "double down" on PvP gameplay.

</p>
<p>
Despite this, the Hero Mastery Gauntlet was added in March: a three player co-op mode that featured tower defence-style gameplay.
</p>
<p>
An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-is-revitalising-the-overwatch-2-experience">earlier blog post from Blizzard in February</a> insisted the developer had "heard [the] feedback" from players about competitive play and stated plans to introduce "big updates" for players to "see how you progress through the competitive ranks".

</p>
<p>
Still, the reputation of Overwatch has plummeted since its early glory days, with Blizzard seemingly testing new features and modes that don't seem to stick.

</p>
<p>A new Hero was added last month called Venture, revealed in the trailer above.</p>

            <p>
Players of EA games such as Apex Legends, FC 24 and The Sims 4 have been greeted with warnings that their "games have been removed from your library". 
</p>
<p>
EA acknowledged the issue as a bug yesterday, and said that it had now been resolved. "We fixed the issue with EA services on PC. Log out and log back in to access your games. Thanks for sticking with us!" EA Help <a href="https://x.com/EAHelp/status/1793255707808268465">wrote</a> on social media platform X.
</p>
<p>
But users of the EA app (the PC replacement for Origin) have said the problem still remains - and Eurogamer has verified this morning that the warning message is still showing for us.

<p>Eurogamer logged into the EA App today and found the notice that stated: 'Games have been removed from your library. View details for more information'. But when we clicked for more information, nothing was shown.</p>

<p>
Players impacted by the issue have reacted in anger, as access to games they've paid for has been interrupted. 
</p>
<p>
"It's outrageous that I spent a fortune on Sims 4 and can't play it," one player wrote. "I never thought you could make an app worse than Origin. But you did!"
</p>
<p>
Others complained that while access to their games had been restored, they still lacked the ability to load DLC. 
</p>
<p>
"By fixed you mean it's still broken right? No DLC is available in DA:I," one user wrote. "Still missing some BF1 stuff from account," wrote another.

            <p>Sometimes you gotta know when to fold, and trying to get new hotness <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wuthering-waves">Wuthering Waves</a> to play nice with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> has got me creasing like an origami crane. While its Epic Games Store release can be worked around, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-proton-ge-on-the-steam-deck">Proton GE</a> will get the game’s own launcher running, no combination of software, compatibility tools, or installation folder deep-diving seems capable of actually booting the game proper.</p>
<p>As such, I’m accepting defeat. Obviously with apologies to any studious <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-academy">Steam Deck Academy</a> readers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I don’t want to say Wuthering Waves will <em>never</em> work on the Deck, as pretty much all its issues with running on SteamOS can be dealt with – right up to that final hurdle of, y’know, launching the game. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-epic-games-launcher-on-steam-deck">Epic app is installable</a> either directly or via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-and-use-lutris-on-the-steam-deck">Lutris</a>, and I could at least get to the launcher stage by grabbing the standalone Windows installer straight from Wuthering Waves’ <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames-ads.com/download/?lang=en">website</a>. Said launcher wouldn’t fire up by itself – I had to dig out its executable, add it as a non-Steam game, and force it to launch with the latest version of Proton GE – but eventually it was onscreen and downloading the game files.</p>
<p>It's literally just that final stage where all the tools and tricks stop working, the launcher’s "Start" button merely looping back to itself after a few seconds of nothing. Reinstalling, switching Proton versions, and keeping the Epic launcher simultaneously running in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-enable-desktop-mode-on-the-steam-deck">Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode</a> all proved inadequate solutions. It’s tempting to have a big "Why! WHY!" tantrum about this – I might have one after this post goes live – but sadly these "just not that into you" situations can still happen with SteamOS, despite the long-running and ongoing efforts of Valve and other game developers to improve compatibility.</p>
<p>One alternative – if you’re not willing to wait for a potential fix, either to Proton or the game itself – is to run the Android version of Wuthering Waves on the Steam Deck using <a href="https://waydro.id/">Waydroid</a>. Youtuber 10 Minute Steam Deck Gamer has <a href="https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamOS-Waydroid-Installer">produced an installation guide</a> for this tool, which can essentially spoof a full Android system within the Linux-based SteamOS, though be warned it’s a pretty complex process, with plenty of command line action.</p>
<p>Patience might just pay off, though. Think of it this way: now that I’ve publicly admitted I don’t know how to get it working, the probability of someone else managing it within a few hours, humiliating me, must have shot up to something like 97 or 98 percent. You’re welcome.</p>

			<p>The Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake's code features something quite interesting, which may have revealed new details on the yet-to-be-revealed Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>As reported on <a href="https://x.com/RibShark/status/1793357532729418129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1793357532729418129%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X/Twitter</a> by RibShark, the game has a 4K performance profile that is obviously not used on the current system. While this could be a development leftover to, for example, capture screenshots at 4K resolution, other discoveries seem to suggest this performance profile could be used in another version of the game. Meatball132 not only <a href="https://x.com/meatball_132?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1793397602190319873%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=">confirmed</a> its presence but also added how the game's codename of GogoS suggests how there could be another version of the game, as the final S in the codename is usually used to distinguish the Switch version from another, which would be pointless if the Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake will remain a current Switch-only title.</p>
<p>While a game like the Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake would likely have no trouble running at 4K resolution on the Nintendo Switch 2, it won't be common for the vast majority of Switch 2 titles to run at such high resolution. NVIDIA DLSS would definitely be capable of making it happen, but only at 30 FPS, and it would be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-30-fps-dlss-misuse/">"misuse"</a> of the upscaler that would limit developers considerably.</p>
<p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is now available on Nintendo Switch. Learn more about the game by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/concord-reveal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/details-on-playstation%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98concord%E2%80%99-to-be-revealed-in-the-next-2-weeks-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.879147/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/concord-reveal/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has been claimed that details on PlayStation’ exclusive’s next big game Concord will be revealed in the next two weeks.</p>



<p>That’s according to reputable dataminer billbil-kun via <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/du-nouveau-a-propos-de-concord-la-prochaine-exclusivite-de-playstation-51320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dealabs</a>, who obtains the majority of his information via datamining. According to him, new details on Concord are set to be revealed by his estimations within the next 15 days (around two weeks).</p>



<p>The dataminer was unable to verify if the announcement would be made during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-showcase-next-month-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heavily rumored State of Play</a> or if it was real, but he’s claimed that the next announcement should reveal details on the game’s characters and a glimpse of gameplay.</p>



<p>Whatever the case may be, Billbil-Kun’s findings suggest that some new game assets have been uploaded somewhere, so an announcement is on the horizon.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun reiterates that he doesn’t know on the exact release date of the new trailer and/or when the game will officially be released.</p>



<p>Developed by the Firewalk team, Concord will be PlayStation’s next &nbsp;PvP multiplayer first-person shooter coming to PS5 and PC later this year.</p>



<p>On the game’s announcement, PlayStation said, “Concord is a bringing together of peoples. It’s the power of games to build connection and inspire social play. The Firewalk team is driven by the type of exciting, unexpected moments and shared experiences that multiplayer games create. Every time you log on is the beginning of a new adventure and every match is an opportunity for a new story. It’s these ideals that define Concord, its unique universe of vibrant worlds, and its rich cast of colorful characters.”</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to hearing more about Concord? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

In a statement provided to IGN, Toasted insisted he will contest the decision. "We are currently listening to and abiding by Warners Bros request to remove the videos,” Toasted said. “However we are going to contest their decision. Right now we are waiting for actual communication from Warner Bros so we can resolve the matter.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

        <p>Dev struggled to find a publisher for free-to-play multiplayer shooter Alara Prime</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>  <div>



            <p>Fragbite Group is filing for bankruptcy for its internal development studio Fall Damage.</p>
<p>The Swedish development team had been working on Alara Prime, a free-to-play four-vs-four shooter that was aiming to release this year. However, the studio struggled to sign a publisher for the game.</p>
<p>Fall Damage was in discussions with multiple potential publishers, but had "not yet been able to fully complete [the process] within the necessary timeframe," according to Fragbite.</p>
<p>This has led to an "unsustainable financial situation"  for the developer;  while the dialogues are ongoing and the game's development is on track, Fragbite's board of directors do not believe Fall Damage will be able to pay its debts that are due and that this situation is not temporary.</p>
<p>Fragbite Group has emphasised that the publicly listed parent company and its other subsidiaries will "continue operations without interruption."</p>
<p>The news comes just seven months after <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fragbite-to-acquire-fall-damage">Fragbite Group acquired Fall Damage</a> in a deal with an upfront fee of SEK 20 million ($1.9 million)</p>
<p>Fall Damage was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dice-veterans-form-fall-damage-studs">founded in 2017 by DICE veterans</a> Gyllenberg, Mikael Kalms, Markus Nyström, and Dan Vanderlind. The studio's management team previously worked on games such as Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Star Wars Battlefront.</p>

<p data-characters="189" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After months of speculation and hype, we finally know that the 2024 edition of <em>Call of Duty</em> will be titled <em>Black Ops 6</em>, and we’ve just gotten our first look at the game’s logo. </p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">In an image leaked from a worker at a news press, Activision has allegedly been printing wraps for USA Today, which includes an image of the Presidents featured on Mount Rushmore with their eyes covered by blindfolds, with the words “The Truth Lies” painted on them. </p> <p data-characters="157" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true">More importantly, the back page of the wrap shows the official <em>Black Ops 6</em>, which is the first time we’ve seen confirmation of the game’s title. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true">The wrap also features a link to <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thetruthlies.com</a>, which was the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/call-of-duty-is-teasing-its-next-entry-with-a-strange-mount-rushmore-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first <em>BO6 </em>teaser</a> we got for the game on Wednesday, May 24. With the TV on that site only going up to six channels, many took this as a hint that <em>Black Ops 6</em> would be the name, but we now know that’s the case. </p>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">The logo is a classic <em>Black Ops</em> logo, with the number six at the end in the series’ iconic orange color. Underneath, the three-headed Cerberus on a shield is also present, which was first seen in the teaser for the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-games-showcase-locked-in-for-june-with-a-rumored-cod-direct-afterwards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">June 9 showcase</a>. </p> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">There had been some confusion around the naming of Treyarch’s next <em>CoD</em> title, considering that the last one, which should have been <em>Black Ops 5</em>, was titled <em>Black Ops Cold War</em>. As hype grew throughout 2024, some suggested it would be titled <em>Black Ops Gulf War</em>, but appears Treyarch has reverted to the number system. </p>
 <p data-characters="128" data-current-count="128" data-injectable="false"><em>Black Ops 6</em> is penciled in for an Autumn release, with many suspecting an October launch for the next <em>Call of Duty</em> blockbuster. </p>

Sony has shared a video detailing the company's future plans for the next decade, including a look ahead at one possible concept for a futuristic PlayStation controller. 
</p>
<p>
"How far will imagination carry us?" the video asks, showing an artist's animated character coming to life before our eyes. 
</p>
<p>
But the controller is the video's most eye-grabbing detail, as we see it being used to pilot a character through space. The pad features a holographic screen hovering above the controller itself, and would easily look home on the Starship Enterprise. (Although many online have made unfavourable comparisons to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2018-what-was-actually-real-in-the-e3-2005-ps3-reveal">infamous PS3 boomerang concept</a>.) You can check it out for yourself in the video below.

<p>
"10 years from now, we will be living in a more multi-layered world where physical and virtual realities overlap without boundaries," the video's official blurb reads. "If Sony, as a creative entertainment company, would be filling the world with new Kando [a Japanese term that roughly translates to 'emotion'] in that future, what kind of experiential value would we be offering to make that happen?" 
</p>
<p>
"To explore this question, we conducted a prototyping exercise under the concept of 'Creative Entertainment Vision'. Envisioning through the lens of Sony's creativity and technology, here we present the future as an extension of our lives today."
</p>
<p>
Sony does, however, state the video's content is "not directly related to any existing Sony products or services". Noted.

Earlier this month, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-shipped-five-times-more-ps5-consoles-last-quarter-than-microsoft-did-with-xbox">Sony had shipped five times more PlayStation 5 consoles than Microsoft managed with Xbox Series X/S in the last quarter</a>. 
</p>
<p>
These latest figures mean that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">Sony has now sold over 59m PS5 consoles since its debut on the market</a>. As Tom noted at the time, this is roughly equivalent to PS4 at the same point in its lifecycle.

            <p>
Embracer's headcount has plummeted by 4532 employees over the past financial year, while 44 studios have been closed and 80 in-development projects have been dropped during this period.
</p>
<p>
This news comes as part of Embracer's latest quarterly financial report, in which CEO Lars Wingefors states the company's restructuring programme is now "successfully finalised" and has "created a stronger foundation for improved profitability, cash flows and long-term value creation".
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-owner-embracer-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-program-to-close-studios-cut-jobs">restructuring programme began in June last year</a> following the Swedish umbrella company's acquisition of a number of studios, many of which have now been divested and staff laid off. A key reason for this was the collapse of a proposed $2bn partnership with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracers-collapsed-2bn-deal-reportedly-with-saudi-arabia-funded-savvy-games">Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games</a>.

<p>

The drop of 4532 employees represents a 27 percent reduction in the company's workforce.
</p>
<p>
Wingefors described this past financial year as "a transformative year for Embracer". He continued: "Throughout the past year, our companies and studios have had to part ways with team members. These were necessary but difficult decisions, and it has been important to carry out the changes with compassion, respect and integrity towards those affected. Post-restructuring, we will strive to make continuous improvements as part of our ordinary business, to further improve operational efficiency and capital allocation."
</p>
<p>
As previously reported, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-announces-plan-to-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-enterprises-and-friends">Embracer will now split into three distinct entities</a>: Asmodee Group, Coffee Stain and Friends, and Middle-earth Enterprises and Friends. Each will, in Wingefors' words, "boast sufficient scale, coherent strategies and a clearer focus, paving the way to unlock value in our high-quality assets".

</p>
<p>
The last financial quarter saw a drop of 10 percent in sales, owing to both the loss of studios and the "softer-than-expected performance" of Alone in the Dark and Outcast: A New Beginning. The Tomb Raider remastered collection has "performed above management expectations", while Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection was "in line with management expectations" despite negative reviews.
</p>
<p>
Looking ahead, the likes of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Killing Floor 3, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, Hyperlight Breaker, Gothic Remake and Titan Quest 2 are the most important releases for the next financial year, along with "at least three other important, unannounced releases". 
</p>
<p>
In total, the company expects to release "more than 70 game projects" during the financial year, though it's unclear exactly how this is calculated.
</p>
<p>
"We are now starting a new and exciting chapter for the businesses and people that make up Embracer Group. I am excited about the future and fully convinced that the best is still ahead of us," concluded Wingefors.
</p>
<p>
Embracer has been widely criticised for its acquisition strategy and the resulting layoffs, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saber-interactive-boss-defends-embracers-acquisition-strategy-after-bittersweet-split">Wingefors was defended by Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch</a> following its "bittersweet" split from Embracer.
</p>
<p>
Layoffs across the industry this year have now <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">exceeded 10,000</a>. Why is this happening? Check out our feature on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">what is going on with layoffs in the video game industry</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/guides/24163081/wuthering-waves-codes-how-to-redeem-redemption<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="xcDNtt">The ability to <strong>redeem codes in </strong><em><strong>Wuthering Waves</strong></em> follows a trend set by other open-world gacha games from recent years.</p>
<p id="KMAOkE">Using redemption codes is an easy way to get free items, including healing items, Shell Credits, and premium currency Astrite.</p>
<p id="7rXo0P">As with other gacha games, it’s likely many of these codes will expire after a certain amount of time, so it’s best to redeem sooner than later to ensure you don’t miss out.</p>
<p id="iN8Vyq">What follows is a<strong> list of active </strong><em><strong>Wuthering Waves</strong></em><strong> codes</strong>, and the rewards you get for redeeming them.</p>
<hr id="NNwCUP">
<h2 id="FmI51E"><strong>Wuthering Waves codes for May 2024</strong></h2>
<p id="FWwhcK">The current active list of <em>Wuthering Waves</em> redemption codes are as follows, added in reverse chronological order:</p>
<ul><li id="Mrzzoc">
<strong>WUTHERINGGIFT</strong> (50 Astrite, 2x Premium Resonance Potion, 2x Medium Revival Inhaler, 2x Medium Energy Bag, 10,000 Shell Credits) — added May 23</li></ul>
<p id="8z1Ork">Note that for those playing on PC through the Epic Games Store, there is <em>technically </em>another code available via the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/wuthering-waves-echo-starter-pack-eae1db">Echo Starter Pack</a>, which is a one-time free add-on that, once downloaded, is redeemed through the same code redemption system. This grants 1x Incomplete Echo, 1x Premium Tuner 10, and 5x Advanced Seal Tube.</p>
<hr id="9EMTW0">

<p id="k4wUwX">To redeem codes in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, you have to <strong>open the Redemption Code screen in the settings menu.</strong></p>
<p id="pfYSQb">This requires some playtime to unlock — specifically, reaching Union Level 2, or around when you start the Utterance of Marvels II mission in Chapter 1, Act 1.</p>
<p id="1PSnUu">To find the Redemption Code menu, first open settings — on mobile, start by accessing the Terminal with the icon in the top right corner, then settings using the cog icon on the bottom right — then go to Other Settings towards the bottom of the list, then select ‘Redemption Code’.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty Black Ops 6 logo has been revealed by some newspaper advertisements ahead of its official reveal.</p>



<p>Although the leak does not reveal much, it does reveal that the game will be named ‘Black Ops 6’ and not ‘Black Ops VI’ or ‘Black Ops V’. Black Ops V was technically the name for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, but for whatever reason the name was changed during development.</p>



<p>It’s unclear what the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-first-teaser-arrived/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 teasers</a> will reveal about the game, but presumably, we’ll be seeing more in the coming days. Yesterday, the first image of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-key-art-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s key art was leaked</a>. </p>



<p>It’s understood that this year’s Call of Duty title,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-to-release-october-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6, will launch in late October</a>&nbsp;(presumably October 25).</p>



<p>The game will have an in-depth deepdive following the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9, where more details on the game will be revealed.</p>



<p>What do you think of the choice to go for Black Ops 6 over anything else? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

<p data-characters="239" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After making it through some early server issues, players have been jumping into <em>XDefiant</em>‘s high-octane gameplay, but players are struggling to level up their weapons, labeling the progression system as “criminally slow.”</p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">If you’ve managed to get into the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-xdefiant-down-heres-how-to-check-the-xdefiant-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">servers</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-xdefiant-unable-to-find-match-playlist-not-found-error/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find a match</a>, and actually been able to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-xdefiants-controller-not-working-glitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use your controller</a> to play, you may have realized that earning XP is a slow process, especially when it comes to your weapons. This isn’t ideal, as weapon leveling is how you unlock attachments for your guns. </p> <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="747" data-injectable="true">In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XDefiant/comments/1cy4mov/weapon_progression_is_criminally_slow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> on the <em>XDefiant</em> subreddit, Lo0ksToTheMo0n stated that even though they had played for five to seven hours, they had “barely” unlocked any gun attachments. “Unlocking the guns and factions themselves is fine but the attachments are absurd. It’s so demoralizing trying your best and seeing all your effort rewarded with what is, pretty much, quite literally a drop in the ocean of progress in this game.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Unlocking weapon attachments is proving difficult. Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="757" data-injectable="true">For some, this decision is intentional, with Enigma_Green writing that they “reckon Ubisoft just wants you to buy Double XP tokens for things like this,” a thought echoed by nickypoopoo69 who stated: “I was at the point last night where I considered buying one of the Founders Packs so I could get a handful of XP tokens. That made me realize what kind of game this really is, and I’m not 100% sure I will continue to play it.”</p>
 <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">Unsurprisingly, players want to see changes from Ubisoft, asking them to make the grind for attachments much shorter. With players currently only earning new attachments every two or three levels, <em>XDefiaint</em> players want to see that switched to every level, meaning you could unlock every addition to the gun by Level 25 rather than Level 50 which it currently sits at. </p> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true">I’ve found the attachment grind incredibly slow too, and can sympathise with the players above. I refuse to pay to give myself an XP boost, especially when fans who did buy them suggest they don’t make that much difference to the grind. </p>
 <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false">With unlockable camos, there’s no need to make attachments the thing you need to spend hours grinding. In the end, it will just push people away—something that Ubisoft can’t afford if they want to be a true <em>Call of Duty</em> competitor. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-popularity-got-bethesda-at-least-80-million-says-report/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We've already reported in multiple instances about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelming popularity of the Fallout TV show</a>. The fact that it proved financially beneficial to Bethesda was inevitable following the incredible <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surge in sales</a> of games like Fallout 4, Fallout 76, and even Fallout New Vegas.</p>
<p>VG Insights <a href="https://vginsights.com/insights/article/transmedia-opportunity-in-games-how-the-fallout-tv-series-made-bethesda-c-80-million-usd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has now attempted to quantify</a> the earnings derived more or less directly from the TV show's renewed interest. They estimate that Fallout 4 sold 2 million copies, earning around $22 million, while Fallout 76 sold between one and one and a half million units, earning around $16 million. Then there's the estimated Fallout 76 in-game spend of $12 million.</p>
<p>VG Insights also expects that Bethesda earned a considerable amount (around $30 million) from just licensing the IP to Amazon for the TV show. The total estimate is, therefore, a respectable $80 million earnings boost following the launch of the TV series.</p>
<p>Notably, this total did not include Fallout Shelter revenue, which VG Insights reckons could be between 5 and 10 million. Moreover, neither Fallout 3 nor New Vegas were considered at all in this analysis. The latter in particular did solid numbers, making it on the UK's Top 10 monthly charts and appearing among the global best sellers on Steam for a while.</p>
<p>That means the grand total could actually be around $100 million. While it might not seem like an enormous amount, it's worth reminding that it is essentially a free bonus for Bethesda, which did nearly nothing in terms of effort. That's one of the reasons transmedia IP is labeled a big opportunity by many industry executives. For example, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-is-a-fantastic-example-of-transmedia-says-embracer-ceo-after-teasing-lord-of-the-rings-opportunity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently praised</a> the Fallout TV show for its performance in this regard.</p>
<p>Moreover, a similar windfall will likely take place for future launches, such as subsequent seasons of the Amazon Prime Video and the inevitable next installment in the game series (which Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-might-be-here-sooner-than-we-thought-at-microsofts-behest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is said to be fast-tracking</a>). All in all, it's a resounding win for Bethesda and one that will likely reverberate for years to come.</p>

        <p>CEO Lars Wingefors says past fiscal year was "transformative" as group presses on towards three-way split</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Embracer has released its full-year financial results, showing a rise in overall sales despite a slow final quarter.</p>
<p>The company reported net sales of SEK 42.2 billion ($3.9 billion) for the full fiscal year, a rise of 12%  year-on-year. Sales for the three months ended March 31, 2024 came in at SEK  8.9 billion ($830.9 million), down 5% compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>The group's debt stands at SEK 16.4 billion ($1.53 billion), compared to SEK 15.6 billion ($1.46 billion) at this time in 2023. Speaking to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> last month, CEO Lars Wingefors explained that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lars-wingefors-on-why-embracer-is-going-away-and-what-happens-next#:~:text=debt%20that%20will%20move%20from%20Embracer%20to%20Asmodee">tabletop leader Asmodee is expected to clear most of this debt</a>.</p>
<p>Embracer Group has been through a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-ceo-says-restructuring-is-over-no-other-studios-for-sale">rough restructuring period</a> that saw multiple studios closed or sold, plus more than 1,400 staff laid off.</p>
<p>Alongside its financial results this morning, Embracer announced that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-cfo-and-deputy-ceo-johan-ekstrom-stepping-down">CFO and deputy CEO Johan Ekström is stepping down</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what you need to know:</p>
<h2>The numbers</h2>
<p><em>Full year (twelve months ended March 31, 2024)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales: </strong>SEK 42.2 billion ($3.9 billion, up 12%  year-on-year)</li>
<li><strong>PC/console games:  </strong>SEK 14.4 billion ($1.3 billion, up 7%)</li>
<li><strong>Mobile games: </strong>SEK 5.9 billion ($550.9 million, up 2%)</li>
<li><strong>Tabletop games: </strong>SEK 14.8 billion ($1.4 million, up 13%)</li>
<li><strong>Entertainment &amp; Services: </strong>SEK 7.1 billion ($662.9 million, up 34%)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net debt: </strong>SEK 16.4 billion ($1.53 billion, compared to SEK 15.6 billion / $1.46 billion at the end of the previous fiscal year)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Q4 (three months ended March 31, 2024)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales:</strong> SEK  8.9 billion ($830.9 million, down 5% year-on-year)</li>
<li><strong>PC/console games: </strong>SEK 3.1 billion ($289.4 million, down 10%)</li>
<li><strong>Mobile games:  </strong>SEK1.4 billion ($130.7 million, up 4%)</li>
<li><strong>Tabletop games: </strong>SEK 3.1 billion ($289.4 million, up 1%)</li>
<li><strong>Entertainment and services: </strong>SEK 1.3 billion ($121.4 million, down 15%)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The highlights</h2>
<p>For the final quarter of the year, the company cited Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered and Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor as key releases that performed well. Looking at the year's biggest sellers, Dead Island 2 sold three million copies and reached seven million players, in part thanks to its inclusion in Xbox Game Pass during the final quarter.</p>
<p>Embracer also reported that some mid-sized titles from THQ Nordic saw  "a more mixed performance". Alone in the Dark's sales "performed below management expectations", while South Park: Snow Daw "delivered within expectations."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the group expects "similar performance" for the new fiscal year, ending March 2025, with the "potential for earnings growth" across PC/console, tabletop and mobile.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and Killing Floor 3 were highlighted as key releases, and are expected to perform "largely in line with" Dead Island 2 and Remnant 2, which launched in the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>Overall, Embracer Group expects to release more than 70 games by March 31, 2025, including at least three unannounced titles. Looking further ahead, the company expects to release a higher number large-sized PC/console games, both from established and new IPs.</p>
<p>The company noted there was a SEK 20.4 billion ($1.9 billion) impact on its earnings before interest and tax. SEK 1 billion ($93.3 million) of this was attributed to the restructuring program, while SEK 11.4 billion ($1.1 million) was related to the sales of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-sells-saber-interactive-for-247m">Saber Interactive</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-to-acquire-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460-million">Gearbox Entertainment</a>.</p>
<p>The group's financial reports also gave an clear indication of how Embracer's headcount has changed during the restructuring.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2023, the group stood at 12,069 total employees, down from 16,601 at the end of the previous fiscal year. Of these, 7,699 are developers, down from 11,426.</p>
<p>There are 141 development projects in the works across all the company's businesses, down from 221.</p>
<p>In his comments, CEO Lars Wingefors said Embracer Group had shown strong improvement in both earnings and cash flows this year, and the strategy to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-group-splits-into-three-everything-you-need-to-know">split into three publicly-listed companies</a> is "tracking according to plan."</p>
<p>"It has been a transformative year for Embracer," he wrote. "The restructuring program, that is now successfully finalised, has created a stronger foundation for improved profitability, cash flows and long-term value creation."</p>
<p>He added: "Throughout the past year, our companies and studios have had to part ways with team members. These were necessary but difficult decisions, and it has been important to carry out the changes with compassion, respect and integrity towards those affected. Post-restructuring, we will strive to make continuous improvements as part of our ordinary business, to further improve operational efficiency and capital allocation."</p>
<p>We spoke to Wingefors at length last month about the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lars-wingefors-on-why-embracer-is-going-away-and-what-happens-next">future of the company</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-ceo-lars-wingefors-im-sure-i-deserve-a-lot-of-criticism">the criticism it has received around its restructuring</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="211" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Wuthering Waves</em> throws players into a fun adventure in an interesting world with a colorful cast of characters. The standout element of the game, however, is the combat, and that means that frames are importnat.</p> <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="211" data-injectable="false">If you are wondering about the 120 FPS <em>Wuthering Waves</em> issue, then I have all the information that you need, but you may need to be a little patient because there are some issues the devs need to work out first.</p> <h2 id="h-can-you-play-wuthering-waves-at-120-fps" data-injectable="false">Can you play Wuthering Waves at 120 FPS?</h2> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true"><strong>So, can you run <em>Wuthering Waves</em> at 120FPS? Not right now. That is the simple answer</strong>. The reason this is such an issue for people is that they were able to play the game at 120 FPS during the beta, but now that the full release has gone live, that option is gone. Folks are mad and want to know why.</p>
 <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">To put it simply, the 120 FPS option was causing some problems for players, resulting in glitches. As such, developer Kuro Games has opted to disable that option in the 1.0 version of the game and bring it back as soon as possible after they have all the bugs ironed out. “While the dev team is solving the problem, this feature will be unavailable during the period. We will inform you when this feature is available in future updates. Thanks for your patience and support,” say the devs.</p>
 <p data-characters="715" data-current-count="715" data-injectable="true">As soon as the option returns, all you need to do is go into your main menu, then the graphics options, and select 120 FPS from the appropriate selector menu. While there are ways to bypass this right now, should you want to, it is not something that I would recommend due to the impact that it might have on your game stability. While there are effective ways to juke that disabling of the 120 FPS option, this isn’t done by magic. You would still be forcing the game engine to run at an FPS that the developer feels is too unstable to provide a satisfactory experience to players. So, if you HAVE taken steps to do one of the workarounds and are wondering why your game might be crashing, now you know why. </p>
 <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="185" data-injectable="false">It seems like the best idea for now is to just wait and play at 60 FPS, and then we can all enjoy a smooth 120 FPS experience when the developers have it fully polished and ready to go.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/23/crown-wars-the-black-prince-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It’s all too easy to brand any turn-based isometric strategy game where you get sad about your soldiers dying as being an ‘XCOM-like’. Take Crowns Wars: The Black Prince as an example, almost straight away the game was pigeonholed as a medieval XCOM. A suggestion that the game is nothing more than XCOM Enemy Unknown with a hasty reskin and a half-hearted change of environment. Thankfully, Artefacts Studio has been anything but lazy and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crown-wars-the-black-prince">Crowns Wars: The Black Prince</a> is very much its own game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crown Wars | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSqm8DQfGHk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set during the Hundred Years’ War – actually 116 years long – Crown Wars casts the player in the role of a feudal lord, desperately trying to survive in the chaotic madness of medieval France. The campaign begins after King Edward III’s successful invasion, in which the King of France was taken prisoner. This power vacuum results in a turbulent kingdom stuffed with rival factions, roving mercenaries, and desperate war bands – the perfect setting for a video game then. Crown Wars loosely follows historical events, but things take a more fictional turn when an evil conspiracy is uncovered that the player must defeat.</p>


<p>The setting of Crowns Wars: The Black Prince is slightly fantastical then, and while it’s not the dragons and giants of high fantasy, you can expect to see cursed English soldiers, alchemists lobbing poison potions, and the occasional fighting bear. All of these over-the-top shenanigans are tempered by regular historical notes and analysis from the developers, the smart integration of which puts other bigger developers and publishers to shame.</p>


<p>The plot, delivered as it is in a series of short cutscenes and text boxes, takes second place to the action strategy on offer. Sure, this is a turn-based game, but don’t make the mistake of thinking it offers a lethargic experience. In contrast to many of its contemporaries, the soldiers, knights, and archers of Crown Wars positively race around the battlefield. Indeed, it comes as a shock when you discover that your Hunter can clear a vast distance, vault a few haystacks, and still have enough movement points left to thwack an unsuspecting mercenary on the bonce.</p>
<p>The speed is what makes the gameplay of Crown Wars so enticing; grand strategies are not conceived with iceberg-like deliberation, but tactics are instead implemented with pace and verve. Attacks can quickly switch from flanking, to feints, and fake-retreats as your small squad of four to six characters dance around a level. For a turn-based game, the dynamism on offer here is intoxicating in its urgency.</p>

<p>This contrasts with the home-screen elements, in which you do up your castle with all those lovely resources you’ve gathered over numerous battles. In return, you’ll unlock new character classes, single use items, and a plethora of weapons and armour. Unlike XCOM, where time is of the element on the campaign map and a playthrough can quickly run away from you, there is no need to rush in Crown Wars. Campaign missions will sit patiently waiting for you, allowing the player to go off and complete skirmishes, raids, and rescues to level up their characters.</p>
<p>As such, expect a certain amount of grinding here, as you have to get your team of fighters up to the required level to take on the next storyline quest. Very un-XCOM-like, but enjoyable in its own way, as investing in your warriors is well worth the time. Indeed, with both avatars and the weapons they use unlocking wonderfully varied abilities, high-level characters can prove unstoppable demons of gory violence.</p>

<p>Controls on the console are decent enough, though occasionally a bit fiddly, but it’s with the player camera that Artefacts Studio is most successful. You can effortlessly zoom in to admire your Paladin’s left butt cheek in all its armour-clad glory, before sweeping upwards to a distant top-down birds-eye view of the entire battlefield with a casual swipe of a thumbstick. The level of camera control is frankly glorious. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said when it’s the enemy’s turn, as the camera fails to show anything you might want to see, regularly missing enemy attacks to show you a church wall or a bit of tree. It’s bizarre that the camera falls apart so spectacularly, and it certainly hampers a player’s ability to identify threats during the enemy turn.</p>
<p>Enemy AI is similarly… interesting, let’s say. Occasionally concocting some bracing strategies, all too often the foes you face are overcome with complete idiocy. When using area of effect attacks they will often friendly fire three of their own warriors to hit only one of yours. They will also expend action points running pointlessly around, leaving them without an attack when they finally get into position.&nbsp;You’ll also have to contend with far too many game crashes – on PS5, at least. Thankfully the auto-save system is robust, so little player progress is lost.</p>
<p>There’s definitely a lot of patching to be done here, particularly to get the challenge to the level that devoted strategy enthusiasts expect. Which is clearly where Crown Wars is aimed, as it makes little attempt to explain its systems to genre newcomers, expecting the player to figure things out through prior strategy-game experience or trial and error. Definitely not one for those new to the genre.</p>

			<p>Developer Moon Studios has released the largest No Rest for the Wicked patch to date, adding support for DLSS and FSR upscaling.</p>
<p>As said, the update is the game's largest early access patch since its PC release last month. Aside from adding support for upscaling, the patch adds the option to remap controllers, the ability to respec your character, a new weapon tryout feature, and plenty of QoL improvements alongside tweaking and visual effect polishing. "Between DLSS and FSR, numerous CPU, GPU performance improvements, and memory optimization we are confident that your experience of playing No Rest For The Wicked will be significantly smoother across a wide range of hardware", Moon Studios writes.</p>
<p>As covered earlier this month, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-holding-back-dlss-fsr-losing-too-much-sharpness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">development team was holding back on adding support for upscalers as early testing showed that the game was losing a lot of sharpnes</a>s when using upscaling techniques such as DLSS and FSR. <em>“We have implemented our first version of DLSS for No Rest for the Wicked but we are not going to ship it just yet", Moon Studios boss Gennadiy Korol. "The image quality we are getting is not quite on par with our native rendering, the HDR highlights and rim-lighting is affected more than we would like. We are also losing quite a lot of sharpness. Our TAA and Sharpening looks pretty great with our own upscaling so until DLSS looks on par or better, we would rather bake it a bit more before shipping it."</em></p>
<p>We've included a video showing off highlights from the game's second early access patch below:</p>
<p><iframe title="No Rest For The Wicked Patch Notes - Early Access Patch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XXQyWvVg_5c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As the full patch notes are quite extensive, we <a href="https://forum.norestforthewicked.com/t/patch-notes-early-access-patch-2/12039" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggest reading through them here</a>.</p>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked is available for PC via Early Access now. The game's full release is also coming to PS5 and Xbox Series consoles.</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>Sony seems to be building a mobile games platform for free-to-play games.</p>
<p>This is according to tech site <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/98435/sony-developing-playstation-mobile-platform/index.html">TweakTown</a>, which spotted a job listing for a mobile platform architect.</p>
<p>The job description says the company is seeking a software engineer to design a platform "for developing, publishing, and operating free-to-play mobile games" which would involve connecting "mobile games to PlayStation services."</p>
<p>Sony currently doesn't have any mobile titles outside of Fate/Grand Order, a turn-based RPG published by Aniplex – a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment Japan.</p>
<p>The games firm launched its mobile division in 2022, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-acquires-savage-game-studios">acquiring mobile developer Savage Studios</a> as part of its creation which <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-owned-savage-game-studios-rebrands-to-neon-koi">has since rebranded as Neon Koi</a>.</p>
<p>PlayStation Studios Mobile Division operates separately from the console business, and is focusing on producing mobile titles using new or existing PlayStation IP.</p>
<p>Xbox is also moving more into the mobile space with the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-mobile-store-to-launch-this-summer">launch of its own storefront this July.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-dev-wants-to-become-the-next-fromsoftware-or-blizzard/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios has released the biggest hit of 2024 (alongside Palworld), surpassing everyone's expectations with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 million units sold in 12 weeks</a>, which makes the game the fastest-selling Sony exclusive ever.</p>
<p>Now, the independent developer has made some changes to its leadership. CEO Johan Pilestedt has nominated Shams Jorjani in his former role so he can focus on game-making as Chief Creative Officer and Chairman of the company.</p>
<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with GamesIndustry</a>, Johan Pilestedt shared the ambitious goals of the Helldivers 2 team:</p>
<p><em>We feel there we have so much more to give, and so many more games we want to make. The ambition level and appetite of the organisation has grown significantly. We now have a taste of blood, and we want more. We pride ourselves on being an independent studio. We have to see what the future holds, but there’s nothing in the plans where we want to be acquired by somebody. I want to see how high we can fly. And bringing Shams on board, we have a good potential to realise that future of turning into the next From Software or Blizzard.</em></p>
<p>Lofty targets indeed, but Helldivers 2 certainly is a great platform to build upon. Of course, there are many ongoing issues with the live game, although Pilestedt is confident they will be ironed out.</p>
<p><em>This is something the organisation has seen before. We had the horrible launch of Magicka, which was really buggy, and me and Shams recognised that we had to interact with the community, talk to them in an honest way, and tell them what’s going on as much as we could. And then take action immediately to resolve the issues. So we’ve seen and been through it before, albeit at a much smaller scale. It is higher stakes this time.</em></p>
<p><em>When we look at the challenge ahead of us, we feel like Frodo and Sam going towards Mordor. The oblivious approach of ‘we’ll take one step at a time, and then we will solve the issues as they come’. The strength of Arrowhead is the camaraderie that we share amongst the team, and the desire to help each other. We know that whatever we’re going through, we’re there for each other and we will be able to take on any challenge, almost, and come out stronger on the other side.</em></p>
<p>For now, Helldivers 2 is so popular a recent rumor even suggested Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-might-be-pondering-an-helldivers-2-xbox-port/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might consider launching an Xbox port</a>. We'll see if that pans out or not.</p>

<p data-characters="376" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The long-awaited <em>Wuthering Waves</em> was finally released on May 23, but some players are having trouble downloading, updating, and playing the new gacha game. If your download for <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is stuck at 99.99%, don’t worry: you’re not alone. Here’s how you can fix your download and finish installing if <em>Wuthering Waves</em> gets stuck at 99.99% while updating.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-fix-wuthering-waves-stuck-at-99-99" data-injectable="false">How to fix <em>Wuthering Waves</em> stuck at 99.99%</h2> <p data-characters="570" data-current-count="870" data-injectable="true">You can fix your <em>Wuthering Waves</em> download getting stuck at 99.99% by <strong>waiting for about 15 minutes</strong>. If you are downloading <em>Wuthering Waves</em> onto an HDD rather than an SSD, it’s even possible it takes a little longer. Even though the launcher doesn’t update its status text, most of the time when players are getting stuck at 99.99% it’s actually the period of time in which <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is verifying your game files and initializing, not actually downloading any more files. This is why a slower HDD can lead to this process taking longer than an SSD.</p>
 <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">However, even after waiting, some players have still been stuck at 99.99% which can mean that the process was interrupted in some way. Thankfully, we have found a fix for that situation as well. Here’s everything you can do to fix your download if <em>Wuthering Waves</em> gets stuck at 99.99%:</p> <ol data-found-items="7" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true"> <li>First, <strong>wait and let the launcher do its thing for about 15 or so minutes</strong>. It can take this long to fully verify your files, and even a little longer if you are on an HDD.</li> <li>If you’ve waited and it’s still stuck at 99.99%, <strong>your install has probably stalled</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Close the Launcher completely and restart it</strong>. After a few minutes, it should pick up where you left it, meaning you may be at 99.99% again.</li> <li><strong>Wait another 15 minutes or so</strong>. If it’s still not completed, close the launcher again.</li> <li>Navigate to the <em>Wuthering Waves</em> install folder at C:\Wuthering Waves\ and <strong>delete this entire root folder</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Reinstall <em>Wuthering Waves</em> from scratch <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from the installer</a>.</strong></li> <li>Proceed with <strong>updating again through the Launcher</strong>.</li> </ol>
 <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false">Even though this is a tedious process, it seems to be the only way to ensure you can fix the <em>Wuthering Waves</em> downloading and updating getting stuck at 99.99%. If you have an SSD, it’s recommended that you download and install <em>Wuthering Waves</em> onto it rather than an HDD as it doesn’t seem to have the problem.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-guide-how-to-get-to-twilight-town/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>In order to kick off Chapter 4 of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, you’ll need to find a way to get to the creepy Twilight Town, which requires a few steps, including figuring out one of the more obtuse secrets in the game. But hey, don’t worry, we have you covered…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd31.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>According to good ol' Professor Frankly, the pipe to Twilight Town is somewhere under Rogueport’s West Side.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd32.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>But how do you get beneath the west side? The key is to slip through the cracks in this grate.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd33.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>You’ll drop down to the underground. Now, use the Yoshi kid to hover jump over the gap to the left, then go through the door.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd34.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>You’ll find a weird brown pipe, which you can’t get through. Hmmm!</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd35.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Head back to Professor Frankly and talk to him about it. He’ll tell you about seeing somebody from Twilight Town in the area. The key is this seemingly innocuous wall next to Merlon’s shop. There’s actually an optical illusion here which hides a secret back alley. Just walk into the middle of the wall, then go to the right or left to slip through.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd36.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>You’ll find the Twilight Town resident Darkly in the back alley. Talk to him and he’ll set you up so you can get through the pipe to his hometown. Head back to that weird brown pipe and you can now pass through.</p>
<p>And there you have it – off to Twilight Town for you. Have a spooky good time!</p>
<p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is available now on Nintendo Switch. You can check out all of&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech’s Paper Mario The Thousand-Year Door guides here</a>.</p>

			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>In order to kick off Chapter 3 of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, you’ll need to get yourself a blimp ticket to the floating island of Glitzville, but doing so is a little more complicated than getting to where you need to go for Chapter 1 or 2. This may well be one of your first real “What am I supposed to do?” stumbling blocks in the game, but don’t worry, we have you covered…</p>
<p><em>Note: The following guide contains minor Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door SPOILERS.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd23.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>According to Professor Frankly, you’ll need to talk to Don Pianta on the west side of town to get your hands on a blimp ticket.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd24.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>So, to start, let’s make sure you have access to the west side. There’s a yellow toad blocking your way to the west side, who accuses you of crushing their contact lens. Go to the nearby shop to buy them a new one (talk to the shopkeeper to do so). The shopkeeper will send away for lens and ask you to wait and… you have to do just that. After about five minutes, they’ll send you a mail saying the lens has come in. Yeah, it’s weird, but that’s how it is. Give the contact lens to the toad and you can now access the west side.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd25.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Now, slightly unintuitively, it order to further your quest in the west side of town, you’ll have to return to the east side of town. If you haven’t already, defeat or pay off the guard, then squeeze through this crack next to the Trouble Center.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd26.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When you emerge from the crack, head through the door to your right. Talk to the gang member Ishnail (the guy with the snail shell). Pay him 64 coins and he’ll tell you to go to the shop on the far west side of town and buy a Dried Shroom and Dizzy Dial in order, then say your favorite color is yellow. By the way, you can actually skip paying Ishnail now that I’ve told you the secret “password.”</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd27.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>So, head to the west end, past the Pianta Parlor, to the shop owned by the ghost with cat ears, Peeka. As previously instructed, buy the Dried Shroom, Dizzy Dial, then tell the ghost your favorite color is yellow.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd28.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>You can then pass through the shop and up the stairs to Don Pianta’s office. He’ll ask you to find his daughter who has eloped with her boyfriend.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd29.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>You can find them down by the docks. Return to Don Pianta after speaking to them (the dialogue choices don’t matter) and he’ll give you the blimp ticket.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd30.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Finally, head north up the central path in Rogueport’s west end and give your ticket to the cheep-cheep.</p>
<p>And there you go – all aboard to Glitzville! Get ready for a fun wrestling-themed chapter!</p>

			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>Unlike most recent entries in the series, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is a full-on RPG, with Mario gaining levels in a straightforward manner by earning Star Point XP by winning battles, but what about your various non-Mario party members? How do you improve their abilities? It isn’t immediately obvious and the game doesn’t do a great job of explaining it, but don’t worry, we’ve got you covered…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd19.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The key to upgrading your support party members is collecting Shine Sprites, collectibles that look like the Shines from Super Mario Sunshine. These are 42 of these in total, spread around the world – usually slightly off the main path, with players often having to use one of their papery powers in order to collect them.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd20.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once you’ve acquired some of these Shine Sprites, head back to the east side of Rogueport off the main plaza. You’re going to want to go into Merlon the fortune teller’s place – you can tell it by the Shine Sprite symbol outside the door. Trade in three Shine Sprites in order to upgrade your party member. This will increase their HP and give them a new ability.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd21.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Each party member can be upgraded twice, but you can only upgrade them the second time after you’ve completed Chapter 5. At that point, you’ll notice Merlon standing outside his shop. He’ll ask you to find the “Up Arrow” item in Hooktail Castle. Head to the easternmost room in Hooktail Castle with the spikes, and use Captain Bobbery to blow up a cracked wall and collect the Up Arrow from a chest. Bring this back to Merlon and you can now upgrade all your support characters a second time.</p>
<p>And there you go – you should now be able to get the most out of your party!</p>

			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>The new Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door features a revamped, more richly-orchestrated soundtrack, but perhaps you prefer the Gamecube original’s more funky lo-fi sound? Well, worry not, you can switch between the two, but don’t go looking for a toggle in the options menu. No, that would be too easy, and Nintendo doesn’t like to make things easy. You’re going to need to get a specific badge to change the music, so here’s how to do that…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd15.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once you arrive in Rogueport at the beginning of the game, head to the main plaza and then the inn. Head up to the second floor of the inn, then go through the door on the lefthand side of the room. This will take you over a small bridge to the semi-hidden “Lovely Howz of Badges.”</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd16.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unlike in the original TTYD, you can now buy a “Nostalgic Tunes” badge for 1 coin. It’s the one that looks like a little Gamecube, naturally.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd17.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This badge doesn’t require any Badge Points to equip, so you can freely equip or un-equip it to change between the old and new soundtrack without having to worry about your BP limit.</p>
<p>And there you go – the choice of tunes is now yours! I like most of the new tracks, but some of the classics still stand up better, so I actually change back and forth fairly often.</p>
