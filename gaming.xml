<p>MVG says it's "decent" but needs improvement</p>

<figure><a title="GameCube Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/46e951e621e03/gamecube-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's online service has made GameCube games available for the Switch 2 and if you're wondering whether it's worth paying the extra money to experience these retro titles but aren't so sure after Nintendo's history with emulation of <em>other</em> legacy systems, this video might be worth a look.</p>
<p>Game developer and YouTuber <a href="https://youtu.be/A3ylCAr0dbs">Modern Vintage Gamer</a>, who has an extensive history in the field of video game emulation, has taken a look at the Switch Online's latest "classic" library and while he finds the experience to be "decent" enough, he can't help but feel there are some underlying issues "Nintendo desperately needs to fix" – drawing a comparison to Switch Online's emulation of Nintendo 64 games, and how the Japanese firm eventually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/nintendo-appears-to-have-improved-switch-onlines-n64-emulation">got on top of these problems</a>.</p>
<p>While the initial first impressions of the GameCube library are "very good", there are apparently some "obvious" differences to the real experience – with the video below highlighting input lag issues, analog sensitivity and calibration, and online performance and networking also causing some problems. Of course, these aren't necessarily going to be a big deal to anyone who is simply seeking a quick nostalgic fix, but if you're a retro purist it may not live up to expectations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>MVG:</strong> "If you're a casual player you may not even realise some of these issues...but if you're a hardcore F-Zero gamer, you may be feeling a little more frustrated with how the game plays."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can get the full rundown in MVG's video below and check out more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ModernVintageGamer">Switch 2 videos on his YouTube channel</a> (he's worked on projects like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/video_mvg_explains_how_the_original_shantae_game_was_ported_to_switch">Shantae port for Switch</a> as well). The tech experts at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic">Digital Foundry</a> have also shared an analysis of Nintendo's new hybrid system calling it a "satisfying upgrade" despite some "problematic" display issues.</p>

It's the only other modern side-scroller in the franchise, and it (thankfully) feels quite similar to Donkey Kong Country Returns in motion. Overall, there's more variety and playfulness on hand in Tropical Freeze's 63 levels. That may sound like a big drop in level count, but many of the levels take longer to complete, so the games feel roughly the same length in the end.</p><p>Like most of the Wii U's best games, Tropical Freeze got a second chance at life on Switch. It's not quite as challenging as its predecessor, so we'd actually recommend starting here if you're new to the series. Tropical Freeze also has more playable characters. Beyond Donkey and Diddy Kong, you can play as Cranky, Dixie, or Funky. Each character has their own unique moves and feels different enough to warrant multiple playthroughs. </p><p>Though Tropical Freeze is basically the same game on Switch and Wii U, the addition of Funky Kong essentially created an assist mode similar to Nabbit and Toadette in New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe.

DKC platformers above. Instead, this remake of the Game Boy Advance classic lets Donkey Kong return to his days as a villain. Essentially a spiritual successor to Donkey Kong on Game Boy--which itself is an homage to the classic arcade game--Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a puzzle-platformer that favors quick wits rather than reflexes.</p><p>After Donkey Kong steals a bunch of Mini-Mario toys, you have to get them back by completing a wide assortment of room-based challenges. Mario vs. Donkey Kong has more than 130 levels in all. Most levels are bite-sized and can be completed in a few minutes, but it also has some clever boss fights and cool optional challenges.</p><p>Just be aware that even though this is technically a platformer, Mario moves much slower than he does in the mainline Super Mario series. There's a weightiness to the movement system that emphasizes the methodical puzzle focus.</p><p>If Woot sells out of the $40 deal, you can get a region-free European import from Amazon for $44.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>As a reminder, these Switch games are also compatible with the Switch 2, and they all have the full game on the cartridge, just in case you aren't a fan of Nintendo's Game-Key Card system. All of Nintendo's first-party Switch 2 games also have the full game on the card, so you collectors don't have to worry about this with Donkey Kong Bananza either.</p><p>Donkey Kong Bananza preorders are available at multiple major retailers, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Donkey-Kong-Bananza-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0F66KLYVH?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>.

Unfortunately, a 45-year-old Oakland man named Jamal Reed-Obafumi has been arrested after being accused of stealing "approximately $10,000 worth" of Nintendo Switch video games from Marin County Libraries, located in Northern California.</p>
<p>Marin County's Sheriff's Detectives arrested Reed-Obafumi last week after he was "connected to a string of at least seven different burglaries of Marin County Libraries". This took place between April and June 2025 across multiple branches.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pgwhiu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The Sheriff's Office further notes how he has been "booked" into the Marin County Jail and is currently facing 12 felony charges, including multiple counts of burglary and committing a felony while out on bail. It's further noted how libraries "must be safeguarded for everyone to enjoy" as they are a pillar of the community.</p>
<p>According to GameSpot, the Marin County Library <a href="https://marinlibrary.bibliocommons.com/v2/search?query=Switch&amp;searchType=keyword&amp;f_FORMAT=VIDEO_GAME">reportedly has a catalog of over "200 Switch games available to borrow"</a>. It's not mentioned if any of the games have been recovered. This follows a story last week about more than 2,800 Switch 2 consoles being stolen from a semi-truck in Texas.

<p>This 11-year sponsorship marks the end of "one of the longest partnerships" in esports history, as detailed by Sports Illustrated. According to the same source, Aghren banned Marquez from all of his future events for "multiple inappropriate actions towards other creators, including multiple women" while intoxicated.</p>
<p>Cloud9 followed this with an "internal evaluation" and has now released the following statement about how it maintains a "zero-tolerance stance regarding harassment or any other form of inappropriate conduct" and would be immediately releasing Marquez.</p>

<p>Marquez responded to this in a post on social media acknowledging how he had "no one to blame" but himself, and never thought he could "hit this low" while apologising to "everyone" at the same time. He also mentioned how this will "probably" get him banned from future tournaments, although there's no official update about this right now.</p>
<p>"Beerio Kart" is described as a drinking game where players drink alcohol and race in Mario Kart. Aghren's event was unofficial and was not endorsed by Nintendo.</p>
<p>Marquez has won multiple major Smash Bros. tournaments over the years and is considered to be one of the greatest <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a> players of all time after success with characters like Jigglypuff, Fox and Falco.</p>

That's a good sign for anyone looking to pick up a few chase cards standalone rather than ripping open more packs than your bank account can handle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRB6b?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lightning, Army of One</a>, for example. Her Borderless variant was sitting around $90, but has now dropped to around $50. Will it climb again? It’s hard to say, but we’ll keep an eye on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/92x2ZE?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rhystic Study, dubbed ‘Stay with Me’</a> and featuring gorgeous full-art of Tidus and Yuna is also down to around $100, having been over $230 not long ago. It's one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-through-the-ages-most-expensive-cards">most popular cards from the "Through the Ages" collection</a>, so well worth keeping an eye on right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Borderless version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObj5n?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</a> is also down to around $50 now, a drop of around $60 from launch week. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w6D5?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivi is also still <strong>rising</strong> in value this week</a>, but it’s still a sharp drop from the $100 market demand last time we looked at him. He can be found for around $55-60 right now, so keep an eye on this one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z624d3?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sephiroth, Fallen Hero’s Extended Art version</a> has crash-landed from around $100 to just $7 since the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-selling-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">pre-release day pricing</a>, that's a big ol' drop, and a good example as why it's good to wait and see on how the market will fall post-release of a big set like this.</p><p id="climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Climbers">Magic: The Gathering - Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/climbers-june-23-mtg-3-1750680503265.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Wizards of the Coast / IGN</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As we covered recently, Final Fantasy’s cards have bizarrely given some syngizing Doctor Who cards a mega boost in value. For starters, Danny Pink’s ability to draw cards from counters makes him an ideal pickup for your Tidus Commander Deck, but the price has climbed steeply from <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAg8Jw?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$4 to over $12 already</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, Barbara Wright might not be the first card you think of when playing Final Fantasy cards, but her Read Ahead ability means she can manipulate Summons from the new set to get to the best effects more quickly. <a href="https://zdcs.link/a037rA?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">She’s still going for around $4</a>, so she isn’t as pricey as Danny, but she was a dollar not long ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Tidus synergy, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn7RE?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tekuthal, Inquiry Dominus</a> is a Phyrexian Horror that, admittedly, wouldn’t look out of place in a Final Fantasy battle. He can double your proliferation of counters, which is ideal for Tidus’ deck. He’s gone from $6 not long ago to over $14 now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from our Blitzball star, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w6D5?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivi Ornitier</a> is getting plenty of love from players (I packed one myself, hooray!). One card that works well with him is the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoGJjl?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flame of Anor</a>, an instant with a trio of effects you can pick one of. If you control a Wizard (like our adorable friend), then you can pick two. It’s up to around $3, with the foil going for over $4. Not big numbers, sure, but not long ago it was a $2 card and it could climb yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve ever wanted to upset pals in a casual game of Commander, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWY6rx?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mesmeric Orb</a> can pair nicely with either Final Fantasy’s The Water Crystal or if someone at your table is playing the Mothman Fallout deck. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first of those combos will get your friends milling themselves endlessly, while the latter can spread so many Rad counters that it could end up being the shortest game of Commander in history. Mesmeric Orb just hit $24 and could climb higher, a $7 increase week-on-week.</p><p id="sealed-sets"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sealed Sets">MTG Sealed Sets</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything else Final Fantasy is pretty hot right now, so if you manage to find anything in stock, it might be worth picking up ASAP to avoid disapointment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for more TCG discussion and market watch?

In case you're not familiar with it, it's basically Mario Kart's take on the battle royale genre, where it's the last kart standing as racers are eliminated after each section of the course.</p>
<p>It's now almost been one month since the new entry hit the track and it's got us wondering how much success our community has had so far in this new mode. Have you won a race yet? Have you been on the cusp of greatness but denied by a blue shell at the last minute? <em>Vote in our poll and let us know in the comments below.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For well over 20 years the website Adventure Gamers was home to all kinds of writing and discussions about a genre that, while having enjoyed something of a renaissance in this "bring back all the old games" era we're living through now, also went through one hell of a drought in the 2000s.</p><p>Whether it was news, reviews or just being home to a popular forum, Adventure Gamers was for many a cozy little internet hangout, whether you were talking about the classics (Sierra and Lucasarts) or more modern series like Telltale's efforts. While the website still technically exists, I'm using past tense for a reason here, because in recent weeks the whole thing has basically gone to shit.</p><p>Earlier this month the site's forums, and its decades of history, were wiped without notice, along with AG's user reviews of games. While some of the content has been saved in web archives, to delete that past at all, let alone without warning, is an extremely shitty move from the site's owners.</p><figure></figure><p>Or, should I say new owners, because while there is scant public information about a recent sale,<a href="https://exagforumites.freeforums.net/thread/2/start" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> discussions among the community suggest that the site has recently been sold</a>, appears to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuregames/comments/1lat2la/comment/mxnfu97/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishing</a> AI-generated content (all bylines have been removed from the site’s articles) and that former writers have been<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuregames/comments/1lat2la/adventure_gamers_is_a_gambling_site_now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> asking</a> to have their names removed from AG's masthead, to no avail.</p><p>No sooner had the forums and archives been deleted than the site began leaning hard into online betting, with four of the six menu items at the top of the page leading to stuff like "Online Casinos" and "Poker Sites".</p><figure></figure><p>Also the site's "About Us" page has <a href="https://adventuregamers.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently been edited to read</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About Us</strong></p><p>Adventure Gamers&nbsp;has long been recognized as the largest English-language website dedicated to the adventure game genre.

The main storyline sees 1-4 players tasked with preventing the evil Order of the Black Worm from stealing the Amulet of Kings and unleashing a multi-dimensional disaster known as "The Planemeld."</p><p dir="ltr">The main campaign is designed to play out over three multi-hour sessions where players create their own character and build and customize them with unique skills to use in combat and exploration. Five of the major regions of Tamriel--Skyrim, Morrowind, Black Marsh, High Rock, and Cyrodiil--are explorable, and each offers its own unique side quests and activities. You can even join several factions, just like in the video games. The box comes with everything you need to play--including dice, play tokens, cards, character sheets, overland map boards, a set of modular hexagon exploration tiles, a rulebook, province quest books, and more.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elder-Scrolls-Betrayal-Valenwood-Expansion/dp/B0DZ3PTD1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elder-Scrolls-Betrayal-Valenwood-Expansion\/dp\/B0DZ3PTD1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elder-Scrolls-Betrayal-Valenwood-Expansion/dp/B0DZ3PTD1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20">The Elder Scrolls: Betrayal of the Second Era - Valenwood Expansion</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elder-Scrolls-Betrayal-Valenwood-Expansion/dp/B0DZ3PTD1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elder-Scrolls-Betrayal-Valenwood-Expansion\/dp\/B0DZ3PTD1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elder-Scrolls-Betrayal-Valenwood-Expansion/dp/B0DZ3PTD1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$50</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Elder Scrolls: Betrayal of the Second Era is a big game, but if you're looking to bolster it with even more content, you can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elder-Scrolls-Betrayal-Valenwood-Expansion/dp/B0DZ3PTD1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Valenwood expansion</a>, which adds the titular province as an explorable region, new encounters, new character classes, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The developers of Spine want you to feel like John Wick inside Arkham Asylum in this stylish action game.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tucked into a corner of Summer Games Fest, Spine is definitely the kind of game meant to turn heads and grab attention. There is a decidedly late-’90s arcade style to the third-person action title that compels players to grab a controller and see what is going on for themselves. While it’s still early, in my hands-on demo with Spine, I can safely say that it’s absolutely something I’m excited to see evolve as it develops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aesthetically, Spine fits the cyberpunk-Blade Runner mold of an overcrowded dystopian city with profuse neon-yet-dark corners everywhere. The player assumes the role of a street artist named Redline who, in the demo, has been accused of a crime she did not commit and quickly finds herself surrounded by thugs at a bar. Redline fights off the enemies with deadly force and keeps going while punching and shooting everything that gets in her way.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Spine Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Players familiar with Sifu will notice an immediate resemblance to that game in the form of the quick jabs, special attacks, and parry-driven finishing moves, but the developer shies away from that particular comparison. Instead, they insist it is a little bit more like Rocksteady’s Arkham series of Batman titles, with a heavy focus on reading tells more than predicting enemy movements.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Rather than comparing combat to Sifu, Spine's developers insist it is a little bit more like Rocksteady’s Arkham series.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of inspiration, the true carnival-game feel of Spine comes from the flashy and over-the-top finishers that are earned by parrying enemy attacks. Not for the squeamish or meek at heart, Redline will often force enemies to swallow a bullet with a gun shoved between their teeth or spin around them like John Wick with a well-placed shot to the back of the skull. The camera zooms, spins, and pans around the finishers to showcase the most dramatic and cinematic angles for her gunkata before Redline quickly moves on to the next goon coming her way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Parrying also works at enemies throwing things or shooting at her as well, allowing her to spot-dodge the incoming projectile with a quick lean or turn that feels immensely satisfying, regardless of the ease to pull off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Occasionally, Redline will pick up another weapon with limited ammo, such as a shotgun, and blow enemies away in one hit. These sections feel more like Hotline Miami than anything Batman has ever done, and sometimes even adopt that overhead camera angle to complete the allusion, intentional or otherwise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There is some degree of Sega Genesis vibe going on with Spine that I cannot quite put my finger on, but it absolutely evokes an alternate reality where beat-‘em-ups became the biggest genre in the world in the ‘90s and iterated on that formula for decades. While there is a lot more to see before deciding where in that storied hierarchy Spine will land, I am more than interested in watching it get there.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/spine-is-a-sifu-meets-shooter-action-game-with-a-technofuturist-style]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, a story finds you at the right time, hits you in the right place, speaks to a part of you you’ve kept buried, deep down. When we find a connection with a piece of art, much of that connection is forged because of when we find it, not just what it has to say. I stumbled onto Ambrosia Sky at the right time, and it spoke to me. No game at Summer Game Fest hit me harder, but I like to think that Ambrosia Sky would have resonated with me no matter when I found it, which is a testament to how developer Soft Rains has crafted this world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of this is the conceit, which is unlike anything else I’ve seen in a video game. Ambrosia Sky follows Dalia, a deep-space disaster specialist known as a Scarab. Scarabs are mystical field scientists whose job revolves around the dead. They’re not soldiers; a Scarab can’t save you. Their job is to catalogue a space, restore it, and say goodbye to the dead. They’re a loose-knit organization of scientists with one purpose: they seek death to understand what kills us, so they can prevent it. They believe that in understanding death among the stars, they can find the key to preventing cellular death and decay. The Ambrosia Project is their attempt at finding immortality. Dalia doesn’t believe in the spiritual side of being a Scarab (for many, it’s a religion, not just a job), but she’s good at it and enjoys the work.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ambrosia Sky - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But at the same time, this isn’t just a scientific exercise for Dalia. Ambrosia Sky sends her to the Cluster, an agricultural colony on Saturn’s rings. Once paramount in humanity’s voyage of discovery and expansion among the stars, it’s now little more than a relic of a previous age, a crucial but forgotten fixture of an age long past. Time has literally passed it by. But it’s where Dalia grew up and escaped from in her own search for something more. And now she’s returning to investigate a crisis that killed almost everyone she knew. It’s hardly a happy homecoming, and it’s forcing her to come to terms with both her own choices and the relationships she left behind, as well as her guilt for surviving what killed most of the people she knew.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>My goal was simple: find out what happened to Gerald Parker, and if he was dead, take a sample of his DNA to send back to the Ambrosia Project, then perform a “bioremediation” on the body.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a lot of setup, I know. But that’s what you have to understand to get where my demo started. I played two levels of Ambrosia Sky (one at SGF, one at home; both are accessible in the Steam demo available now), but I want to focus on the one I played at SGF. My goal was simple: find out what happened to Gerald Parker, and if he was dead, take a sample of his DNA to send back to the Ambrosia Project, then perform a “bioremediation” on the body. See, Sacarbs can only perform death rituals on people who have consented to having their DNA included in the project; even then, getting a viable sample is tricky. You’ll only get one if the person in question has been dead for less than 48 hours. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I entered the area armed with a chemical sprayer and a couple of upgrades built from the fungus Dalia was studying on the Cluster. One essential made my chemical sprayer into a flamethrower – perfect for cleaning out pesky contamination. The other essentially served as an electrical conduit, allowing me to power things like doors by connecting them to anything else that uses electricity. Handy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the moment I entered, the environment felt hostile. I found bodies that had been overgrown by fungus, killed by a disease called clusterlung. Contamination was everywhere. Energized roots charged with electricity covered the walls, spread out like the limbs of an overgrown tree, short-circuiting any electronics they touched. The thick, bulbous roots of the exploder fungus, which does exactly what its name implies, wouldn’t hurt me unless I triggered it, but it did block my path. I had to be careful. Spraying indiscriminately risked a lot of things exploding. If I wasn’t careful where I stepped, I’d get zapped for my trouble. I even saw a small alien life form (Dalia muses that she was told all the aliens were wiped out before she was born) that can transform into a small turret and shoot at me. I had to stay alert.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/ambrosiasky-07-1750715723042.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are other reasons to be careful, too. Dalia is a scientist first and foremost, and like any good scientist, she needs to take samples of the fungus here to understand what it is. That means harvesting it carefully. And that means detaching the fungal fruit (think a mushroom fruit vs. its roots) from the stalk safely, which means precision. I didn’t wanna use my sprayer on the fruit itself. I wanted to sever it from the stalk and then collect it. And the samples I got could be used to upgrade my sprayer later on.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The samples I got could be used to upgrade my sprayer later on.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As I cleaned and collected samples, I learned more about the cluster and the people who lived there. I read messages from Dalia’s former best friend, Maeve, and notes from Gerald. He sounds rude, perhaps condescending. But Dalia knew him. She was one of the only people he seemed to like. One terminal houses an ominous warning from an anonymous sender, sent to Dalia’s stepmother, Hale, who was in a leadership position on the Cluster. “It sleeps but does not dream,” they write. “If it dreams, its dream will end all of time.” What is it? The fungus? Is it true? Neither I nor Dalia know, but we push forward. We are patient. We are careful.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/ambrosiasky-05-1750715581561.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I come across an unpowered door. Remembering my sprayer-as-electrical-conduit, I clean out the electrical contamination and connect from a monitor to the door, opening a room with the area’s gravity controls. I switch them off. That opens up the way forward. In zero-gravity, time seems to slow down. I can move more freely, access places blocked by the fungus, get into position, and more easily sever the explosive fruit from its stalk without burning everything down. It also allows me to get the most out of Dalia’s tether, which can pull me from place to place or snag fruit out of the air. It’s a nifty tool with the gravity off, but with it on? I’m zoomin’.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The farther I get, the more dire the messages on the terminals get. Gerald sends a message to his friend Lorrie telling her to stop the whispering at night. Lorrie tells him it’s not her, it’s the food they’re growing. “It knows we eat it,” she says. As things get worse, and the contamination spreads, I learn Lorrie asked Gerald to leave with her. He refused, and stayed to tend the crops alone.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/ambrosiasky-02-1750715753963.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, I find his unit. The door is open. It’s a small apartment with two floors. As I explore it, I see the remnants of a life. Little decorations, placed with care, that tell me so much in a sparsely furnished space. I find Gerald’s personal terminal. There’s a message from Dalia there that’s fifteen years old, explaining why she had to leave, thanking him for letting her hide in the fields. Dalia can scarcely believe that he saved it. But you never know how what you say or do will resonate with someone else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At last, I meet Gerald. His body is slumped in a chair, overtaken by fungus. And the weight of what I’m doing comes back to me. I am retrieving a corpse, someone she knew. And when she greets him, there’s a sadness, an acceptance, in the writing that haunts me. She reads his Last Will, his consent to be part of the Ambrosia Project. He tells us he’s recording this because he has to, and that he doesn’t care what happens to his body because he’ll be dead. “Make moonshine or save humanity. It’s yours now,” he says. We see what happened to him as a series of beautifully illustrated panels that look like they were plucked from a comic book. And then Dalia performs his Death Rite, an organic act of cremation that spreads out from the panels and his body, until everything is covered, and then falls away. It looks like a time-lapse of a tree sprouting leaves after a long winter. It’s beautiful, in a way. Rebirth. Dalia tells Gerald she was able to do this last thing for him. And then she collects his DNA, and I have to leave.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/ambrosiasky-04-1750715768447.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I could tell you about the trip back, about how the fungus sprouted at random and hindered my progress and I saw another little alien slug. But my mind, and Dalia’s, I like to think, was still in that room, with Gerald. I knew the way back, but it wasn’t where I was.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I played Ambrosia Sky, the words “thoughtful” and “intimate” came to mind often. It’s a game about a crisis on an agricultural colony, yes, but the stakes are deeply personal, and every part of its design feels grounded in who Dalia is, the work she does, and her personal history. The more I spoke to Soft Rains studio head Joel Burgess and art director Adam Volker during and after my demo, the more I realized how intentional all of it was, and how much work it’s taken to create. The title, Ambrosia Sky, evokes ancient myth. Ambrosia, the food of the gods. In this case, the mushrooms that would allow us to sustain life beyond Earth. Even the title tells part of the story.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/ambrosiasky-02-1750715794218.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Burgess told me that he hopes players don’t notice all the work it has taken to put it all together, at least at first. “You want that work to feel invisible. But I hope we make a world and a game that people want to think about, want to spend time in, that lives in their brains well beyond the time that it lives on their screens, to where they then do appreciate the depth, the extra effort that we've put in to make sure that systems work and interact with each other, as well as the characters and their motivations in the world and the setting, and things that exist well beyond the frame of this game,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on my time with Ambrosia Sky, I think they may have succeeded. I played a lot of games at Summer Game Fest. But few of them stuck with me like Ambrosia Sky, and none hit me quite as hard in such a short time. I am excited to see what else Soft Rains has in store for us on the Cluster, but one thing is clear: their ambition is great. Like the humanity of Ambrosia Sky, they reach skyward, pursuing a lofty ideal. And I can’t wait to see what else they have to show us among the stars.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ambrosia-sky-is-a-beautiful-intimate-clean-em-up-combo-of-metroid-prime-and-powerwash-simulator]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Previously unseen concept art purportedly showing character designs from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games-montreal">Warner Bros. Games Montreal</a>'s cancelled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> follow-up Project Sabbath has surfaced online, showing further glimpses of a beardy Bruce Wayne, Damian Wayne, and more.
</p>
<p>
Whispers of Project Sabbath's existence first emerged back in 2016, with Batman: Arkham Oranges developer Warner Bros. Games Montreal said to be at the helm. Along the way, however, Project Sabbath was ditched in favour of what would ultimately become the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-review-batman-minus-batman-is-scrappy-but-riddled-with-charm">rather middling Gotham Knights</a>, and much of what we know about the cancelled game has been gleaned through various bits of concept art that've emerged over the years.
</p>
<p>
In 2019, for instance, concept art from Project Sabbath - which would supposedly see Bruce Wayne's son Damian donning the famous cowl and cape - popped up on 4chan, showing off various elements including an older Bruce Wayne, a rundown Gotham City, Gorilla Grodd, and more. All that was accompanied by claims the game would have used <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a>'s acclaimed Nemesis System. Additional concept art then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-knight-canned-sequel-apparently-shown-via-concept-art">emerged two years later</a>, offering closer looks at both Bruce and Damien.
</p>
<p>
And now, yet more Project Sabbath concept art has emerged, this time from character artist Rodrigue Pralier, who worked at Warner Bros. Games Montreal circa 2014/2015. Although the Artstation page originally featuring the concepts has now been removed, the images have been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/arkhamvideos.bsky.social/post/3ls75vje3d22d">saved for posterity on social media</a>, revealing a further look at Damian Wayne and his beardy pa Bruce, alongside Killer Croc, The Huntress, and more.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a> - the title WB Games Montreal switched its attention to after ditching Project Sabbath - did, of course, fail to generate much enthusiasm among critics and fans, and it was followed in 2024 by Arkham Knight studio Rocksteady's Suicide: Kill the Justice League. That proved to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">another Batman-adjacent flop</a> in a year that also saw Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions underperform and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">limp return of Warner's now-cancelled MultiVersus</a>.
</p>
<p>
At the start of this year - following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-developer-warner-bros-games-montreal-slashes-99-jobs">several rounds</a> of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">layoffs</a> across its studios - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> boss David Haddad <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">departed the company</a>. Just a month later Warner Bros. announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancelling Monolith Productions' long-in-the-works Wonder Woman game</a>, closing the studio, and shutting down Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego too. Since then, it's announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-restructures-leadership-team-following-new-focus-on-game-of-thrones-dc-harry-potter-and-mortal-kombat">drastic shift in leadership</a> that'll see it refocusing on several core brands, including Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC, and Game of Thrones.

                <p>Hytale has been canceled by Riot Games and Hypixel Studios a decade after the project first started development.</p><p>Hypixel Studios' co-founder Aaron Donaghey, better known by the Hytale community as Noxy, broke the news in a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on Hytale's website</a>. "Today, I shared some incredibly tough news with the Hypixel Studios team: we’re ending development on <em>Hytale</em> and beginning the process of winding down Hypixel Studios over the next few months," Noxy wrote. "This is not the outcome any of us - at Hypixel or at Riot - wanted. But after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise."</p><p>Hytale is a standalone game project that sprouted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypixel" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hypixel</a>, the popular <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> server from which Hytale's development team gets its name. It was planned to be a Minecraft-like sandbox game that was more modder-friendly, incorporated more RPG elements, and featured numerous minigames for players to try out alongside the basic sandbox experience. To better understand the project's ambitions, you should watch this developer diary that Riot Games released in 2021.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWW28OCIkNE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GWW28OCIkNE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Noxy's post about Hytale's cancellation essentially admits that this was all too ambitious for the studio. That can be seen in the project's lengthy development timeline. The project has roots going all the way <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-a-brand-new-game-from-giants-of-the-minecraft-community" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">back to 2015</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-has-bought-the-developer-behind-a-minecraft-l/1100-6476132/" data-ref-id="1100-6476132">Riot Games acquired Hypixel</a> in 2020, yet no release was in sight.</p><p>Noxy admits that "it became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game," even after a complete overhaul of the game engine being used to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hytale/" data-ref-id="5000-507834">Hytale</a>. Rather than reducing the scope or adjusting the development timeline to make the project a reality, Hypixel Studios and Riot decided to cancel the game entirely.</p><p>Hypixel Studios will be shut down as a result, although Noxy says Hypixel's developers are being "supported with generous severance and resources to help them find what’s next." As for the Hypixel server that Hytale is based on, Noxy's message explains that it is run separately from Hypixel Studios and will not be impacted by Hytale's cancellation.</p>

As spotted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lscg5aodzt2a">by @Wario64</a>, Valve has started selling the device <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck%2F" rel="sponsored">on its online store</a> again after it was out of stock in the US and Canada for over a week.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/steam-deck-oled-out-of-stock">Valve cited</a> “recent supply chain constraints” for the Steam Deck OLED’s unavailability, adding that it expects the device to come back in stock by the end of the summer. It looks like Valve may have resolved its supply chain issues — at least for now — as the 512GB Steam Deck OLED is currently on sale for $549, while the 1TB version is available for $649.</p><p>Both devices come with a 7.4-inch HDR OLED display, up to a 90Hz refresh rate, a carrying case, and battery life ranging from three to 12 hours, depending on content. The 1TB version adds a “premium anti-glare etched glass” display, a removable liner with the carrying case, and an exclusive startup screen and virtual keyboard theme. However, neither model includes the Steam Deck Docking Station, which is available separately for $79 (there <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23776368/jsaux-rgb-dock-steam-deck-rog-ally-aya-neo">are plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23843324/gulikit-steam-deck-rog-ally-dock-super-nintendo-snes-xbox-elite-gamepad">third-party</a> options out there, too.)</p><p>But if you’re still holding out for a Switch 2, the $450 console has been popping up intermittently at retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/691604/steam-deck-oled-valve-in-stock]]></content:encoded>

                <p>EA has revealed some of the major changes coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a>, and a clear theme has emerged. The company is significantly expanding in-game representations of college traditions, such as mascots, rivalry trophies, marching band formations, and other elements of school spirit. Included among a huge list of additions is one of the few mascots that everyone, regardless of allegiance, seems to be able to root for: a Pop-Tart.</p><p>Yes, one of the internet's favorite mascots is coming to CFB 26, EA announced in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-26/news/cfb26-campus-huddle-presentation?cid=84496&amp;ts=1750691127277" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a blog post</a>.. The anthropomorphic toaster pastry has become beloved among college football fans for its role in the Pop-Tarts Bowl, arguably the most eccentric bowl game among the dozens of bowls in college football's postseason. To put it simply: At the end of the game, the giant Pop-Tart gets put into a toaster, and then an edible version emerges, to be promptly ripped apart and consumed by the winning team.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ6HoJdHslI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZZ6HoJdHslI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The tasty (but somewhat macabre) mascot aside, EA is also expanding the school mascots that'll appear in the game. Over 30 new mascots are being added, bringing more realistic school spirit for universities like Army, Navy, Kansas, Colorado State, and others.</p><p>Other aspects of school traditions are also being enhanced. EA is recreating band formations, light shows, drone shows, and different types of run-outs for some universities, adding additional showmanship and pageantry to games. More of college football's large array of rivalry trophies will be represented in CFB 26, too.</p><p>CFB 26 launches on July 10, but people who preorder special editions of the game can get access three days early. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-26-preorder-bonus-ps5-xbox-series-x-releases-july-10/1100-6531106/" data-ref-id="1100-6531106">Check out our preorder guide</a> for more on the different versions of the game. EA is likely hoping that CFB 26 can replicate its predecessor's success; CFB 25 was wildly popular and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cfb-26-officially-unveiled-with-reveal-trailer-and-first-details-on-whats-new-this-year/1100-6531900/" data-ref-id="1100-6531900">produced over $1 billion in revenue for the company</a>.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/civilization-vii-patch-lets-you-turn-off-some-controversial-new-features/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/with-1-2-2-update-civilization-vii-tries-to-win-back-traditionalists.1226298/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>There's also a new loading screen with more detailed information and more interactive elements, which Firaxis says is a hint at other major UI overhauls to come. That said, players have already complained that it doesn't look very nice because the 2D leader assets that appear on it have been scaled awkwardly and look fuzzy.</p>
<p>The remaining changes are largely balance and systems-related. Trade convoys can now travel over land, which means treasure ships will no longer get stuck in lakes, and there are broader strategic options for tackling the economic path in the Exploration Age. There has been a significant effort to overhaul town focuses, including the addition of a couple new ones, and the much-anticipated nerf of the Hub Town focus; it now provides +1 influence per connected town instead of two, though that may still not be quite enough to make the Hub Town, well, not overpowered.</p>
<p>You can find a bunch of other small balance tweaks in <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">the patch notes</a>, including new city-state bonuses, pantheons, and religious beliefs, among other things.</p>
<p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly to some, you can now issue a command to pet the scout unit's dog.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>As far as I can tell, there are still two major traditional features fans are waiting on: autoexplore for scout units and hotseat multiplayer support. Firaxis says it's working on both, but neither made it into 1.2.2. Players have also been asking for further UI overhauls. Firaxis says those are coming, too.</p>
<p>When <em>Civilization VII</em> launched, I wrote <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/civilization-vii-review-a-major-overhaul-solves-civs-oldest-problems/">that I quite liked it</a>, but I also pointed out bugs and balance changes and noted that it won't please traditionalists. For some players, the review said it might be better to wait. We did a follow-up article about a month in, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/civilization-vii-one-month-later-the-community-and-developers-chime-in/">interviewing the developers</a>. But that was still during the "fix things that are on fire stage."</p>
<p>More than any previous update, today's 1.2.2 is the first one that seems like a natural jumping-on point for people who have been taking a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<p>It's quite common for strategy games like this to not really fully hit their stride until weeks or even months of updates. <em>Civilization VII</em>'s UI problems made it a particularly notable example of that trend, but the good news is that it's also following the same path as the games before it that got good post-launch support: slowly, it's becoming a game a broader range of Civ fans can enjoy.</p>

The studio announced recently that the game launches on August 5 for Android devices, with the first two chapters offered for free as a demo.</p><p>Rather than a direct port, ZA/UM has rebuilt the game in an attempt to make it better complement smaller devices. While the original Disco Elysium is an isometric story-based RPG with full movement controls, the mobile version repackages the art style, characters, and narrative into something more akin to a visual novel. It is now played from a first-person point of view, but you're not moving the character. Rather, you survey rooms and look for items or points of interest to investigate, and all of the interactivity is designed around touch screens.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ‘Disco Elysium For The TikTok User’ Gave Me An Existential Crisis</p>
      </div>
<p>ZA/UM has talked about how this approach is an effort to "completely cater to the habits of today's mobile users." In addition, the developer is emphasizing that the mobile version is more compatible with quick, pick-up-and-play gaming, stating, "This story-rich adventure has been optimized for short play sessions, allowing players to dive in anytime, anyplace on their mobile devices."</p><p>While this type of description might dissuade some players from checking this version out, GameSpot recently had a chance to preview the game on an Android tablet and came away quite impressed. Check out early impressions from our own Lucy James in the embed above.</p><p>If you try out the free chapters and want to grab the full game, Disco Elysium for Android will cost $10 when it launches on August 5. ZA/UM has not yet announced details about an iOS release, but chances are good that it'll come to more devices in the future.</p><p>This might be the only new Disco Elysium-related product in the works, though. Following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-expansion-and-sequel-canceled-report/1100-6521118/" data-ref-id="1100-6521118">significant upheaval and controversy</a>, ZA/UM canceled a sequel and expansion and shifted its focus to a new title, called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-studios-next-rpg-is-a-paranoid-spy-thriller/1100-6530033/" data-ref-id="1100-6530033">Project C4</a>. Highlighting espionage, intelligence, and betrayal, the game will be an RPG inspired by novels like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A new developer diary from Bloober Team has revealed more about how combat works in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, their new and original sci-fi horror game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Deep Dive into The Combat" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qWVTXo05K7s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Combat in Cronos is defined by The Merge, an evolving threat that can dynamically transform each encounter. Enemies known as Orphans can absorb corpses that transforms them mid-battle into more dangerous forms. As they do this, they gain new abilities, forcing the player to adapt their approach and change weapons, but the fascinating twist is that as you kill Orphans, this provides more fodder for others to consume and transform from, building out from traditional archetypes like runners, bruisers and the like.</p>
<p>Bloober’s Jacek Zieba and Shamil Yanbukhtin explain how the encounters have all been hand-crafted to present different opportunities to players, and avoid pigeon-holing them into a single approach. You can use the environment to lure enemies out to give you the advantage, or if you’re super confident in your abilities, go ultra-aggressive and get close enough for melee.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/bloober-team-reveal-cronos-the-new-dawn/">Announced last October</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn’s takes place in a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse. Some of the most notable inspirations include the Dead Space franchise and the movie Twelve Monkeys. The Traveller’s own suit takes its inspiration from older deep sea diving suits, alluding to the theme of diving through time to save people.</p>

<p>Bloober has been dishing out occasional behind-the-scenes and Q&amp;A videos like this, gradually teasing out what to expect from this horror title. We look forward to the next entry.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</span>
						</p></div></div>			
			<p>When I first saw that Sifu developer Sloclap would be shifting gears to make a football game with <a href="https://wccftech.com/sifu-developer-sloclap-has-announced-a-release-date-for-its-new-soccer-game-rematch/">Rematch</a>, I would be lying if I didn't say I was a little disappointed. I like football and sports games well enough. I don't necessarily play EA Sports FC every year, but I've always liked hitting the pitch with my friends, and getting between the posts to make some killer saves, since my preferred position is playing goalie.</p>
<p>I loved Sifu when it released in 2022. It was one of my favorite games that year because of how mechanically tight the gameplay was and how strong the cinematic and visual presentation was. For me, it succeeded at placing me in the middle of a martial arts movie, the perspective shifts that would happen in the levels, the excellent environmental settings for each boss fight, and just how good every punch, kick, and block felt to execute.</p>
<p>I'm ready for Sifu round 2 whenever Sloclap is ready to make it. All this to say, Rematch was not what I expected to see from Sloclap, nor was it exactly what I wanted, which is why I was so delighted when I first played Rematch. I was immediately struck by how tight the gameplay is and how good it feels to do just about everything in Rematch, in the same way it feels good to do everything in Sifu.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>That said, there's a lot about Rematch that I don't like, and so much of that comes from its structure.</p>
<p>But first, the things I do like. On a foundational level, it feels good to shoot, pass, and slide into a tackle. Doing anything, basically, on the pitch feels strong. Dribbling was the only element that took some time for me to get used to.</p>
<p>It also takes some time to get used to controlling the camera while watching for the ball to keep up with the play. You can have a mini-map in the corner of your screen if you like, but keeping track of the action in front of you while covering the map has its learning curve. Funny enough, I do wish there was some version of the camera solution that <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/review-rocket-league-wacky-vehicle-mayhem/">Rocket League</a> has for the same issue.</p>
<p>That said, getting there is a really satisfying learning curve to getting a handle on the controls. Once you start to feel like you can keep an eye on the flow of the game, while maintaining position, and be ready to know what to do when the ball is coming your way, the game opens up in a huge way.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>So much so that I feel confident saying that Rematch is one of the best sports games I've played in years. I can't say for certain that it's because of the focused camera angle, the airtight mechanics, whether you're out on the field or in the keeper's box, or the arcade, backyard-pitch-focused approach to football. It's a bit of everything that makes it a special experience I want to return to, whether I'm playing a 3v3, 4v4, or 5v5 match. Each are balanced by just how good the gameplay is at its core, and it all keeps me coming back.</p>
<p>And that's despite all the things that bring the experience down. The menu, for starters, is about as good as every other major sports game released each year, which is that its somehow, pretty bad. Even with so few game modes to choose from, Rematch aims to emulate its annual sports sim-game peers with blocky, uninspired menu designs, though that also partly comes from the overall bland look the game has.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Having the 'Prologue' remain as an option in the main menu of the game, for example, is a grievous offence in my book. Even if I had only miss-pressed the prologue one time, I'd hate the fact that it was there. I can understand someone wanting to replay the prologue if there were practice drills included in it that weren't already available in the game's dedicated 'Practice' mode. But that's absolutely not the case.</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm harping on a small detail that doesn't matter, and it is a small detail, but it's ludicrous to me that it remains in the main menu where it serves no purpose other than to frustrate you after you accidentally click it and have to wait for the chance to pause and head back to the main menu to access either the Practice menu, or the Systems menu, both of which are options players would actually use.</p>
<p>Again, it's a small point, but it speaks to the larger structural issues that Rematch has. The Practice mode, for example, has a small number of drills demonstrating each area of the game, but there's no "Retry" option when you complete a drill. You're just sent back to the main menu, and have to navigate your way back to the drill if you want to do it again. It's all the more mind-boggling due to the fact that you can aim for bronze, silver, and gold medals on each drill.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>There's also no option to play the same team you just played in an online match. It's almost astounding, really, that there's no option to have a rematch in a game called Rematch. Besides the fact that I think these are poor UI/UX design decisions, what annoys me most about them is the fact that with a press of a button, you can be on the pitch in a free-roaming practice mode. It's a wonderful inclusion that I wish every sports game had, and it makes me all the more confused as to why the rest of the menu design is lacking.</p>
<p>Then there's the whole live service lean to Rematch, which is already a premium title and not a free-to-play game. I can appreciate working towards an unlockable cosmetic as much as the next person, and I'm well aware that having microtransactions in premium games is absolutely nothing new, but I certainly don't have to like it. Especially when the cosmetics you're working towards, that are also purchasable through the game's premium coins that you can buy with real money (or earn in gameplay) don't look all that enticing.</p>
<p>Your mileage may vary on the various hairstyles, shoes, and clothing you can unlock to customize your character with, or the stadium designs you can unlock for practice and matches, but as I mentioned earlier, the overall design of the game is quite bland to me.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's serviceable. Gets the job done, and that's basically my main issue with it. The character models are the only element of it that make it stand out as a Sloclap game, since they look like the same models the studio has been evolving since <a href="https://wccftech.com/absolver-downfall-free-expansion/">Absolver</a>. Three games in, I get that a serviceable design in favor of tighter gameplay and gameplay mechanics is basically Sloclap's trademark. But it's not a positive mark on the studio that, outside of trying to emulate a visual framework like how Sifu was a tailored-down version of martial arts films and their gamut of visual languages, that Sloclap can't seem to define its own visual language that stands out in a crowd.</p>
<p>I'm even more pained by its design and live service bent when I consider that the time spent making cosmetics for players to chase in a battle-pass structure that every studio seems to think is necessary for games these days is time that was taken away from developing a single-player-focused season mode or campaign to play through.</p>

<p>I do genuinely love the core gameplay of Rematch, and I've enjoyed each match I've played, win or lose, but I'm also the kind of sports game-player who appreciates the offline-focused modes that let me have a no-stakes game where I don't run the risk of being berated by toxic players abusing the message function to tell me "Good job" after I make a mistake.</p>
<p>The lack of any offline season or tournament mode not only makes it feel like there's really not much to do in Rematch, it also brings up concerns about what happens to Rematch if/when Sloclap ends their support for the game. As of now, if Sloclap were to stop running the servers tomorrow, there'd be no way to experience a proper match, and like so many other online-only games, it would be up to the community to keep things going. Which is a lot of legwork that not everyone who plays and loves Rematch will be willing to do.</p>

<p>I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention that the rug-pull of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">no cross-play support hours before launch</a> doesn't leave a good taste in the mouth, nor does all the<a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-pushes-hotfix-for-rematch-network-stability-issues-as-rematch-hits-1-million-unique-players-in-first-24hrs/"> bugs and networking issues</a> I've faced along with the rest of the community since the game has been live. These issues will get resolved in time, so they're not the biggest concern, but they are annoying for players jumping in at launch. When I wasn't having networking issues though, the performance was more than solid on both my laptop and desktop.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Rematch is an incredibly solid arcade football game, that is able to capture that feeling of getting a bunch of friends together and kicking a ball around at the local park, elevated by the fact that my avatar in Rematch is far, far better than I could ever be in football, and capable of incredibly acrobatic stunts for some spectacular highlight reels.</p>

<p>I love how solid it feels, whether I'm between the pipes or out on the pitch, and how intense the matches can get whether I'm playing the ranked 5v5 mode or the more casual 3v3. But the lack of content, poor design choices, and a lacking art style combined with a slow-progressing battle pass-like structure and less-than-inspired unlockable cosmetics cut the whole package of Rematch at its knees.</p>

				<p>Rematch is arguably the best sports game I've played in years, and that comes down to the air-tight mechanics at the core of its gameplay, and how good it feels to dribble, make a pass, take a shot, or make a save - all of which wonderfully balances its 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 game modes. It's tackled at the knees by everything around that core gameplay, from its poor UI/UX menu design, to its uninspired visual style and the fact that it currently lacks any offline game modes, and, at least at launch, the several networking issues and bugs that plague the experience.</p>
