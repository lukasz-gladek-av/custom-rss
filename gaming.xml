<p>Every six months for the past several years, we've been sending out the call for reader recommendations that flag Switch games we've missed in the eShop flood. The sheer number of releases coming weekly throughout the Switch generation means there are plenty we simply weren't able to cover.</p>
<p>And with Switch 2 joining the ranks in the last six months, we imagine there'll be a few of those sneaking in when we return for another round in six months' time.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:188793 @ 1760367602 -->
<p>Fortunately, Nintendo Life readers are on hand to send in suggestions for games they think deserve their flowers. This time, we've got 32 Switch games, old and new. We might not be able to vouch for them personally, but they've brought someone joy enough to write up a short recommendation, so take a scroll below and check out the trailers for a better idea.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who sent their recommendations - there's a poll at the end to vote for the games here you've enjoyed the most. Let's crack on in <strong>alphabetical order</strong>, shall we?</p>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/against_the_storm">Against the Storm (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><strong>Pak-Man</strong> kicks things off this time: "Every city-builder fan needs to know about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/against_the_storm">Against the Storm</a>." They've gone a <em>little</em> (a lot) over the word limit but, as you'll see, several readers have taken brevity to the extreme with their recommendations. So it all balances out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Against the Storm is a fantasy city-builder with a "rainpunk" aesthetic. (It's always raining, and the type of rainy-season and collection of rainwater features prominently into your strategy.) You need to manage the needs and wants of the various species that have come to live in your city, raising their happiness so they'll become better workers, giving you the resources to build better things for them, and so on. The graphics are beautiful, the setting is captivating, and the music is wonderful.<br>
So far, so good. Where the game shines, though, was the decision to make it a roguelike.<br>
We're all tired of the word "roguelike" by now, but when it's applied to a city builder like this one, something incredible happens. I'm a long-time city-builder fan, and the momentum of those games always seems to die down once you get your city to a certain level of self-sustainability. You've built everything you want to build, your city is operating at key efficiency, what's left to do? The game becomes boring. This is where the roguelike element comes in. In Against the Storm, you're meeting the demands of a never-seen Queen. She'll send you missions and monitor the happiness of your citizens. Make her upset, or take too long to meet one of her demands, and it's game over. Time to start a new city. Make her happy enough, and it's also time to build a new city, but with some bonus materials and perks to take into your next city. This means you never quite reach that boring self-maintenance phase, and you're always in that exciting, "Time to get a new city off the ground" phase. In true Roguelike fashion, successful runs also give you the ability to unlock new permanent perks and buildings, so every new city is a little bit more complicated than the one before it. I've been playing it on PC for years now and it never gets old. I can't recommend it enough!</p>

<p><strong>Havenn</strong> goes nuclear for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atomicrops">Atomicrops</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a farming roguelike set on the last patch of fertile soil in a nuclear wasteland. You grow mutant corn, cabbages and more to feed a village outpost. At night, you’re tasked with protecting the plants from waves of hungry garden-themed bosses. There’s an eclectic mix of weapons, from spring-loaded leeches to potato grenade launchers – plus you can marry townspeople that will come defend the farm by your side! The game is tough-as-nails, but its bizarre pixel art and catchy pseudo-folk soundtrack along with dozens of collectible “Atomicats” have kept me coming back to play a run for years!</p>

<p>Just an ingenious new way of great storytelling. I wouldn't say earth-shattering but I'd say it's a unique spin on proven methods. And the art, characters and music really rise to meet the creativity.</p>

<p><strong>Joe Crane</strong> calls <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/barony">Barony</a> "amazing, a dungeon crawl with four-player split screen co op."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I play this every chance I get with my 8 and 6 year olds. We are waiting for my 4 year old to get a little older some can have a full team. My kids scream with excitement when Shelob appears and argue who gets Bilbos sword and ring if we manage to kill her. Since I'm playing with kids we are still learning things, locking spells work on mimics, lock picks disarm trapsnot just open chests, if you combine certain items with different classes you get different results andmuch more. There are over a dozen classes and about as many races to combine. I don't know why this game doesnt get more love, it is almost my most played game on my Switch and I am pretty sure it will end at the top sooner then later. Please check it out, this game deserves attention.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You’ll have to take out your opponents' stations before they destroy yours, by placing train tracks and using other abilities. The result is an awesome board game come to life, with a funny game-show story to match, voice acting, and Cartoon Network-style art direction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The optional collectibles double as bad jokes, as one expects from the creator of the Dadish series. The official description includes the phrase 'Questionable therapy' which doubles as the plot of the game. Extremely simple concept but fun and creative, with one bad jump flinging you off into the sky. Short cute levels, perfect if you just have a few minutes to play a game and want to use your brain a little but not too much.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/call_of_the_sea">Call of the Sea (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><strong>Munchlax</strong> rates Out of the Blue Games' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/call_of_the_sea">Call of the Sea</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A narrative puzzle game by the developers of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/american_arcadia">American Arcadia</a>, which sees terminally ill 1930’s housewife Nora journey to a Lovecraft-inspired take on Tahiti to search for her missing husband. The game essentially plays like a series of escape rooms, in fully 3D environments. Many of the puzzles are surprisingly complex, but are satisfying when you solve them. 5 hours long and fully voiced, it is worth the £16 asking price.</p>
</blockquote>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cardfight_vanguard_dear_days_2">Cardfight!! Vanguard Dear Days 2 (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><strong>topsekret</strong> has a thing for this TGC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would strongly recommend <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cardfight_vanguard_dear_days_2">Cardfight!! Vanguard Dear Days 2</a> to fans of TCGs and deck-building games! It's a digital version of the real-life TCG, Cardfight!! Vanguard.<br>
Dear Days 2 is a traditional RPG-style TCG game where there's a story and you naturally get more cards just by playing (no microtransactions). You could easily spend hundreds of hours testing out and perfecting your decks. While it is a sequel to the original Dear Days game (also available on Switch), you can definitely start with Dear Days 2, which has a much larger card pool.</p>
</blockquote>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cato_buttered_cat">CATO: Buttered Cat (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><strong>sketchturner</strong> has high praise for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cato_buttered_cat">CATO: Buttered Cat</a>, saying it's "easily one of the best puzzle games I've ever played."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though having a silly meme as a premise, it actually takes the concept and runs with it in genius ways.<br>
You control two "characters": a piece of buttered toast that can only jump, and a cat that can only walk. Together, they can fly. You have to use their abilities both separately and together to navigate increasingly brain-twisting levels.<br>
The levels start out easily approachable but turn into something where you feel like the smartest person on the planet once you solve it. Thankfully, levels are bite-sized challenges (often only one screen), so even when hard, they're never a marathon test of patience.<br>
The game introduces new mechanics in each world, which radically change the game and keep things fresh.<br>
This game is a formidable brain challenge for sure, but it always feels doable and the puzzles never feel redundant. Truly an overlooked gem!</p>
</blockquote>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cogen_sword_of_rewind">COGEN: Sword of Rewind (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><strong>FX29</strong> wants us to hit rewind on this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One game that fell under the radar is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cogen_sword_of_rewind">COGEN: Sword of Rewind</a>. It's an action side scrolling game where you fight robots and you gotta use your reflexes along with memorising patterns. The game is basically a Mega Man Zero clone, the main character uses a sword like Zero and has a high difficulty similar to Mega Man Zero.<br>
It also has sands of time type gameplay where anytime you get hit the game lets you rewind time to before you get hit. Overall a fun but difficult game that should leave you satisfied until Capcom finally makes a new Mega Man game (fingers crossed).</p>

			<p>The Job System in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles offers unparalleled customization, but choosing the right Support Ability is critical for players focused on maximum Physical Damage. Here's the best Support Ability to maximize Physical Damage.</p>



<p><strong><em>NOTE: Guide based on damage tests conducted in Enhanced Mode's Tactician difficulty, repeated three times under the same conditions to verify consistency. Although enemy stats and damage values differ in Knight and Squire difficulties, the findings from the tests show consistent damage differences. Screenshots captured from the up-to-date Steam version of the game as of October 13, 2025.</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="h-all-support-abilities-that-boost-physical-damage">All Support Abilities That Boost Physical Damage</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Doublehand is one of the four Support Abilities that increase Physical Damage in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Ability Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Job</th><th>JP Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Dual Wield</strong></td><td>Allows the unit to wield a weapon in each hand, even if not a Ninja. Certain weapons can be equipped in this manner, allowing the unit to attack twice each turn.</td><td>Ninja</td><td>1,000 JP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Doublehand</strong></td><td>Allows the unit to wield a single-handed weapon with both hands. Certain weapons can be equipped in this manner, greatly increasing (2x) their attack power.</td><td>Samurai</td><td>900 JP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attack Boost</strong></td><td>Increase the unit's physical attack power (33% bonus)</td><td>Geomancer</td><td>400 JP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Brawler</strong></td><td>Delivers more powerful bare-handed attacks, even if not a Monk.</td><td>Monk</td><td>450 JP</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-best-physical-damage-support-ability">The Best Physical Damage Support Ability</h2>



<p>If you are only interested in the definitive answer to maximize your unit's physical damage with the basic Attack command, here is the conclusion based on the extensive testing: <strong>Dual Wield is the best Support Ability for maximum Physical Damage as soon as you can deal 500 damage consistently in a single hit</strong>  If your unit is not yet hitting high damage totals, Doublehand and Barehanded damage with a Monk with high Bravery and Dual Wield Support Ability are better choices.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Best Support Ability</th><th>Key Reason</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Absolute Maximum Damage</strong></td><td>Dual Wield</td><td>Allows two hits of up to 999 damage, resulting in maximum 1998 total damage, bypassing the single-hit cap.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>High-Level/Pre-Cap Damage</strong></td><td>Doublehand</td><td>Maximizes the power of your single best weapon, providing a higher overall damage multiplier until you consistently hit 500+ damage.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Barehanded Damage </strong>(Monk+Dual Wield Support Ability)</td><td>Dual Wield</td><td>A Monk's innate Brawler works on both barehanded strikes from Dual Wield, exceeding damage dealt by weapons the Ninja can natively equip.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Physical Skill</strong>s (Martial Arts, Holy Sword, Swordplay, Unyielding Blade)</td><td>Attack Boost</td><td>Applies the damage bonus to nearly all physical abilities (like Martial Arts, Holy Sword), which Dual Wield and Doublehand do not.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-testing-methodology">Testing Methodology</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Minotaur monster used as a test dummy</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To conclude that Doublehand and a Monk using the Dual Wield ability are better choices before being able to hit an enemy for more than 500 damage in a single hit, I conducted some tests in a random battle set in the Zeklaus Desert map, using my level 55 Ramza with 97 Bravery right before the final gauntlet of battles at Orbonne Monastery in late Chapter 4. The enemy used as a test dummy was a Level 49 Virgo Minotaur, which had neutral compatibility with my Ramza's Aries Zodiac sign.</p>

<p>While Attack Boost provides the lowest damage increase for the basic Attack command, it is invaluable for abilities that scale with Physical Attack. It applies a 33% bonus to the Physical Attack stat, resulting in a damage bonus for nearly all physical abilities (like Martial Arts, Holy Sword, Swordplay, and Unyielding Blade), where Dual Wield and Doublehand have no effect.</p>

              <p>This past week, Amazon ran its seasonal Prime Day-adjacent sales event. The October one has been given the clumsy name Prime Big Deals Days, but don’t let that fool you. The deals were quite good, but unfortunately the event has come to a close. If you missed out on grabbing yourself something cool at a discount, no need to worry.

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3's cast has been widely acclaimed since the game's release, from Neil Newbon's award-winning role as Astarion to Tim Downie (of <a href="https://paddingtonbear.fandom.com/wiki/Montgomery_Clyde" rel="nofollow " data-mce-href="https://paddingtonbear.fandom.com/wiki/Montgomery_Clyde">Paddington fame</a>) as Gale. But how would the characters--no, not the actors--do if they were auditioning for a <em>different </em>role in the game? We thought that sounded like a great idea, so we got some of the fan-favorite cast together and, potentially under duress, had them audition for new roles.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm Gale of Waterdeep, and I am going to be reading for the role of Lae … of Lae'zel," Downie said. "I smell their blood on you, still! I smell your sweat!"Given that Gale is quite polite and a cat dad, it's tough to imagine him ever having Lae'zel's bloodlust, not to mention her sexual forwardness. That being said, we would very much like an entire game where that is exactly what we get.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Astarion as Shadowheart? BG3 Cast Tries New Roles!</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Neil Newbon's Astarion, meanwhile, read for the role of Shadowheart, with Jennifer English standing by his side and physically forcing him to kneel: Kneel Newbon. Astarion seemed less than thrilled with the situation.</p><p dir="ltr">"I am auditioning for the role of Shadowheart, under no duress … of my own free … free will," he said, while looking up at English to make sure he hadn't done something wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the best was Wyll actor Theo Solomon's turn as Minsc--a ranger who, if he were a cat, would definitely be orange.</p><p dir="ltr">"No, Boo! The druid did not beat Minsc at arm wrestling! It is not fair match!" Solomon said. "And he turned into an Owlbear midway through, and there was grease on the tree stump!"</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Boo" rel="nofollow " data-mce-href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Boo">Boo</a> is, of course, Minsc's "miniature giant space hamster" who is <em>definitely </em>not just a regular hamster that gets swapped out every few years when the last one dies.</p><p dir="ltr">Jennifer English's turn as Astarion and his meme-worthy "full concentrated power of the sun" line--which may have been a Megamind Easter egg--just might be our favorite line-reading. Shadowheart, who is not a vampire, also has much less to fear about the sun itself, so her recasting as Astarion might make the game a little easier!</p><p>Baldur's Gate 3 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2023/1100-6519739/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2023/1100-6519739/">GameSpot's GOTY for 2023</a>.

			<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is due out on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-on-october-16-with-improved-graphics-and-frame-rates-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-version/">this coming Thursday, October 16, 2025,</a> and ahead of that launch, massive leaks are already starting to appear online. <a href="https://x.com/3clipse_tt">X (formerly Twitter) user 3clipse_tt</a> claims to have accessed an early build of the game and has been posting clips from what they've discovered, showing mechanics and features not in the final version. Another user, <a href="https://x.com/PokeVerse93">PokeVerse93</a>, is posting the full Pokédex to X (formerly Twitter).</p>



<p>And, as spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/spoiler-warning-pokemon-legends-z-a-leaks-have-started-ahead-of-its-release/">VGC</a>, you can head to Twitch, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/search?term=pokemon%20legends%20z-a">including at the time of this writing</a>, and find users livestreaming the game.</p>



<p>Needless to say, if you're excited to play Pokémon Legends: Z-A and don't want to be spoiled on things like new Pokémon being introduced, new mega evolutions, and what you're missing out on because Nintendo and The Pokémon Company decided not to include it in the final game, stay away from the above links.</p>



<p>Earlier this year in July, we got our last major look at Pokémon Legends: Z-A with <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-presents-legends-z-a-story-trailer-pokemon-friends-pokemon-champions/">a new story trailer that debuted at a Pokémon Presents event</a>. We also got the reveal of a Nintendo Switch 2 bundle for the game, which, if how Nintendo treated limited editions of the original Nintendo Switch is anything to go by, will surely be followed by a special, Pokémon Legends: Z-A-themed Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is also, unsurprisingly, the best place to play Legends: Z-A, as it is said to include "<em>improved graphics</em> <em>and frame rates</em>" compared to the version on the original Nintendo Switch. We'll see when it arrives, though, if that means that on Switch 2, Legends: Z-A runs at an acceptable, albeit low, frame rate, while on Switch 1, it runs like a slideshow. </p>

            <p>The bumper sticker plastered to the rear of the pickup in front of me reads 'please let me merge before I start crying'. Behind me, an angry mob are starting to sharpen their pitchforks and light their torches. The next stop beckons, and I'm not going to make it on time. There's nothing I can do. For I am Bus Bound in this Steam Next Fest demo, and that bus is too large to slice through gridlock like a hooligan.</p>

<p>Up until this point, the few thumbs down I've earned from stillalive studios' latest bout of bus simulation have been due to my own carelessness. I've mounted the occasional curb, forgotten to stop at stop signs, and occasionally engaged in a bit of touring car-esque paint trading with my fellow road users. This time, I don't think it's my fault. There are cars strewn across the junction, blocking any ability myself and the distressed merger before me might have to obey the green light being pointed our way.</p>
<p>I sound the horn. Come on, its pathetic call tells everyone else stuck in the gridlock, I've got a timetable to keep. No one moves. I look at the list of stops left on the route I've drawn up by connecting various stops around the suburban American city of Emberville. Next up is 99th Street. Get us there, urge the disgruntled passengers. I'd tell them to eff off because there's nothing I can do. I'd tell them to eff off because they haven't paid. I can't though, because in order to circumvent simulating the art of giving someone a dirty look when they try to pay for a £3 bus fare with a £20 note, the method by which my bussing success is measured is likes and dislikes.</p><p>The myriad whims of public opinion are the be-all-and-end-all in this cashless corner of the world's most openly capitalism-loving nation. It's a utopia in which local councils actually get funding and dedicate it to getting strong public transport links up and running. It's an uber-utopia in which that investment's followed up by renovation of city neighbourhoods once you've bussed through them regularly enough and earned the approval of their citizens. The works to improve these areas aren't farmed out to a third-party contractor corporation who respond to getting lucrative government contracts because they've agreed to appoint a cabinet minister to their board by taking a millenium to do the work.</p>

<p>It's beautiful, and far too good to be true. It also dilutes the sim's appeal a bit in my mind. In opting to specifically simulate bus driving, you're putting all of your eggs in that basket. Were Bus Bound more of a generalist sim, or even a bus-centric add-on to an existing one as with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-years-after-teasing-buses-were-coming-to-euro-truck-simulator-2-they-finally-arrive">coaches SCS Software are working on adding to their truck sims</a>, I'd be more forgiving of it not getting as into the nitty gritty of commuting capital. As it is, Bus Bound's more of a straightforward city driving sim whose routes happen to run between bus stops. That does make it a lot easier to get the hang of, and there is plenty of challenge in resisting the urge to drive like an idiot, disregarding the rules of the road like they're nothing.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the AI traffic do a convincing job of simulating the real thing, even down to being receptive of your indicators. It's hard to have an accident that isn't your fault, usually because you didn't check after stopping at a junction or forgot the buses don't have the same stopping distance as your average circuit racer. The city's a vibrant enough backdrop that repeated runs through the same streets didn't get too stale, at least through  the end of the demo hour. The few real-world buses on offer for Next Fest have a decent amount of paint customisation on offer. I'll have to wait until the full thing's out to be allowed behind the wheel of a double decker, but that's fair.</p><p>Having tried the demo, which you can find on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2095420/Bus_Bound/">Bus Bound's Steam page</a>, I've enjoyed its laid back vibes. On the other hand, I'm not sure at this point whether it'll have the sim depth to keep folks around in the long run and carve out a place among the genre's leaders, especially if they're offering coach trips with a bit of real world tourism mixed in. We'll have to see when its 2026 release rolls around.</p>

              <p>Amazon noticed there wasn’t much happening in October. September has Labor Day, November has Black Friday, but October was always quiet. That’s why it created its own shopping holiday: Prime Big Deal Days. The event officially ran from October 7 to 8, but even though it’s over, many of the best deals are still live. From lawnmowers and vacuums to laptops, Amazon seems in no rush to pull those discounts just yet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4730/">This Acer Aspire 15 slim laptop has a pretty affordable starting price to begin with at $350. For the sale, Amazon has chopped off 20% which saves you a whopping $70. That brings the price you pay down to just $280.</a></p>
<p>So what’s this laptop working with? The Acer Aspire Go is powered by an 8-core, Intel Core 3 processor N355 with an integrated Intel graphics. It’s got 8GB of memory an 128GB of UFS storage. It’s a great little workhorse designed for browsing the internet, sending emails, and writing up Word docs. Sorry, you’ll have to go with something a little more powerful if you’re looking to play CyberPunk 2077 in ultra-high settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4730/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Portable and User-Friendly</h2>
<p>The laptop measures in at 15.6 inches with a super narrow bezel to maximize the screen real estate while keeping the computer compact. It displays in a resolution of up to 1080p Full HD which is plenty at that size. For bouts where you’re find yourself on the laptop for multiple hours at a time, you can turn on Acer BluelightShield. This reduces the levels of blue light to help less the effects of blue light exposure. Keep your eyes from feeling strained so you can get your work finished up.</p>



<p>As far as connectivity is concerned, you have a number of different ports along the sides of the Acer Aspire 15. Along the left, you’ll find two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, and an HDMI 2.1 slot so you can display on a second monitor. On the right side, you have one more USB-A port so you can connect to wired accessories like a mouse or external SSD. The laptop has Bluetooth 5.1 and Wi-Fi 6 support so you can utilize fast internet speeds when on a Wi-Fi 6 network.</p>
<p>Video call with colleagues, family or friends thanks to the on-board 720p HD web camera. It can capture high-quality footage even in low light conditions, plus can reduce noise and amplify your voice using AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4730/">Right now, Amazon has the Acer Aspire 15 slim laptop on sale for just $280 even after Prime Big Deal Days.&nbsp;</a></p>

              <p>LEGO Star Wars sets have become hot collectibles that fly off shelves even among people who’ve never seen a single movie. The appeal goes way beyond fandom: these are legitimate display pieces that look expensive sitting on a desk or shelf, and they provide hours of meditative building that actually helps you unwind after work.</p>
<p>This particular <em>Millennium Falcon</em> model celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Lego Star Wars line has a perfect 4.9 out of 5 stars from nearly 1,800 reviews and ranks as one of Amazon’s best-selling sets even at full price. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">Amazon has dropped it from $84 to just $67, which is the lowest price this set has ever been</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite Star Wars LEGO Set</h2>
<p>This isn’t one of the gigantic 7,500-piece LEGO sets that occupies half your dining room table for a month: The <strong>build with 921 pieces is big enough to be a true project but small enough that you can tackle it over a long weekend</strong> or a couple of easy evenings. The completed model is <strong>5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide</strong> which is a nice size to sit nicely on a bookshelf.</p>
<p>The model builds the Millennium Falcon as seen in <em>A New Hope</em> with true-to/detail features such as the characteristic cockpit offset to the right side of the vessel, the disc-shaped satellite dish resting on top, and the four-laser cannons placed at the upper and lower panels. The plates of the exterior embody the worn, lived-in appearance of the galaxy’s fastest hunk of junk with the greebling and textured panels that give depth and realism to the classic saucer form.</p>



<p>The included display stand is what elevates this from a toy to a legitimate decorative piece: The stand angles the ship at a dynamic tilt that makes it look like it’s banking through space during a chase sequence. This angled presentation adds visual interest and creates the impression of motion, which is way more engaging than a flat horizontal display. The stand includes a printed nameplate that reads <em>“Millennium Falcon”</em> along with a special 25th Anniversary Lego Star Wars commemorative brick, marking this as part of the anniversary collection.</p>
<p>In the $67 rather than $84 range, this offers a 20% savings as the lowest price this anniversary set has seen since release.</p>

              <p>It’s easy to feel cramped up when you’re working or gaming on a single screen. An easier (and cheaper) solution than upgrading your entire setup is to add a second display, and bonus points if it’s portable. The 15.6-inch MNN portable monitor is an excellent option to consider for this, and right now, you don’t have to pay the full price for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">It was already quite affordable at $90, but currently it sits at just $60 on Amazon after a 33% discount.</a> This discount is a limited-time one, so act fast to grab it while the offer is still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Slim, Portable Build With Impressive Visuals</h2>
<p>You’re getting a 15.6-inch 1080p IPS panel, which is the same as many full-sized laptop screens. Resolution pushes to 1920×1080 for a sharp, vibrant display, regardless of what you’re using it for. Visuals are pretty much consistent from any angle, and the matte finish helps cut down on reflections, so using it in brighter settings won’t be a problem. And since these specs match what you’ll find on many built-in laptop screens, you really won’t feel a drastic difference when switching between your main display and this one.</p>
<p>There are also multiple display modes for different tasks. We’re talking Extended Mode for a larger screen space, Second Screen Mode for a dual-monitor setup, Portrait Mode to use it as a vertical display, and more. Maybe go with the extended option while playing a game, and the portrait mode when you’re reading something!</p>



<p>Connectivity options include two full-feature USB-C ports and a mini HDMI port, meaning you can connect it to your laptop, PC, smartphone, tablet, MacBook, gaming console, or even a Switch. Just note that your device needs to support USB-C DP Alt Mode or HDMI output. If it does, a single USB-C cable that comes included in the box should be enough to handle both power and video.</p>
<p>The monitor itself is quite lightweight and easy to carry around. You’re also getting a scratch-proof smart cover made of durable PU leather exterior. It not only protects the screen from everyday wear and tear, but also doubles as a stand that you can use to easily prop the monitor up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">Altogether, this is quite an affordable option to consider if you’ve been wanting to invest in a second screen that works with a range of devices</a>. It goes with you wherever you go, and there are no compromises on the visual quality.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>007 First Light’s developers have said that the game’s combat and physicality are inspired by Daniel Craig’s era of Bond movies. </p>



<p>It seems that Daniel Craig and his Bond movies have been a major inspiration for IO Interative’s upcoming origin story, 007 First Light. The developers had previously stated that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-used-daniel-craigs-likeness-for-first-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actor’s head was placed on Agent 47’s body</a> for the first demo. Now, the developers have revealed that the game’s other aspects are inspired by the movies this actor appeared in. </p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-draws-inspiration-from-casino-royale-s-style-of-movement">007 First Light Draws Inspiration from Casino Royale’s Style of Movement</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.edge-magazine-subscription.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Edge Magazine</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/007-first-light-studio-didnt-want-to-create-this-superman-from-day-one-with-its-fresh-faced-james-bond-its-not-very-relatable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Creative Director Hakan Abrak spoke about drawing inspiration from Daniel Craig’s era for 007 First Light. Abrak first stated that it isn’t “one-to-one exactly,” as the dev team is trying to make the game “feel original.” However, the team found it essential that the character is constantly “moving, dynamic and acrobatic, almost like the parkour at the start of Casino Royale.”</p>



<p>While talking about drawing inspiration from these movies, Abrak also spoke about not creating “this superman from day one” where the character is already “on top of the world, and he’s hardened and seasoned, and he’s had his heartbreaks and now he’s hidden behind this iron armor.” The developers feel it won’t be “interesting” to players and provided an example of 1962’s Dr. No, which features Bond already as this super agent, which is “not very relatable”. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gemma-chan-announced-for-007-first-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gemma Chan has been confirmed</a> among the cast for 007 First Light. Additionally, the developers have insisted that the upcoming title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-insist-it-isnt-a-hitman-reskin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t a Hitman “reskin</a>“.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield 6 has been out on PC and consoles for three days at the time of this writing, and already, players are getting frustrated with the XP grind to unlock new weapons and attachments. So, players have turned to an old workaround for Battlefield games: create a custom server in Portal, and farm XP in bot matches. EA, for its part, is trying to stop players from boosting by shutting down the more popular farms, but players can always make new ones.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-6-fast-xp-farms-progression-times-portal-ea-response">VG247</a>, a select few Portal servers were popularized when YouTubers and content creators began making videos with titles like "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5Df2dvxC0"><em>How to Unlock Weapons, Attachments, Gadgets, and Soldiers Faster in Battlefield 6</em>.</a>" Players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o4n1c3/removed_by_moderator/">Reddit</a> were also sharing codes to let other players find their XP-farming servers, as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o5f660/weapon_attachments/">community has seemingly rallied around the feeling</a> that earning XP for weapons, attachments, gadgets, and soldiers is <em>"ridiculously slow</em>."</p>



<p>In response to players using Portal for XP farming, EA seems to be shutting down the more popular servers, and players are now running into error messages telling them that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o5emdf/biggest_shit_take_of_all_launch/">EA's servers "<em>are at max capacity</em>," </a>stopping players from creating new servers.</p>



<p>Of course, this won't last forever, and EA can't exactly play an endless game of whack-a-mole with Portal servers to try and stop everyone from doing any amount of XP farming. It's also not like Battlefield 6 is the first Battlefield game where players have turned to Portal for this exact reason.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">Even in our review</a> of Battlefield 6, we noted that the grind for weapons and attachments, specifically those that can only be unlocked through certain situational challenges, wasn't something we particularly liked, even if it can be seen as a way of changing up the tried-and-true method of just levelling up your character and weapon to unlock everything. </p>



<p>Since theoretically, you could jump into matches and focus on only completing those challenges where possible. But that's not exactly the way to play if you're just trying to have a good time in Battlefield 6, or any multiplayer game, for that matter.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll see EA stop its whack-a-mole game and adjust some of the situational challenges and XP requirements so that players can unlock what they want, without too much hassle, and the game can find its meta more naturally. Rather than it becoming a case of 'players who farmed XP in Portal vs. players who didn't,' and since only one of those sides is going to have better and more weapons, attachments, and gadgets available to them, it's pretty clear which side is coming out on top.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-ecoflow-power-station-sells-out-every-hurricane-season-and-its-now-going-for-pennies-2000634598</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-ecoflow-power-station-sells-out-every-hurricane-season-and-it%E2%80%99s-now-going-for-pennies.1323541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages during hurricane season, winter storms knocking out electricity for days or those rolling blackouts during summer heatwaves – these aren’t rare anymore, they’re becoming the new normal. Having a reliable backup power source is now essential for keeping your family safe and comfortable when the grid goes down.</p>
<p>Amazon just dropped the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/">price on the 1,800W EcoFlow Delta 2 from $699 to $429</a>, which makes it the lowest price we’ve ever tracked for this powerhouse portable power station that <strong>can run 90% of your household appliances</strong>. This is the unit that sells out every time severe weather hits and right now you can grab it at 39% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class Power Station</h2>
<p>The EcoFlow Delta 2 is equipped with a <strong>1024-watt-hour LiFePO4 battery that has 1800W of continuous AC power</strong> through four standard wall outlets. That 1800-watt power rating puts it in a whole different class compared to smaller power stations because it can power high-draw appliances such as space heaters, power tools, electric grills, and even clothes washers.</p>
<p>The unit achieves a <strong>surge capacity of up to 2700 watts to power the initial surge</strong> of power with motor-driven appliances turning on so that your refrigerator or air conditioner kicks on without a hiccup. LiFePO4 chemistry is capable of over <strong>3000 full charge cycles until the battery degrades to 80% capacity</strong>, which equates to about 10 years of day use. This is six times longer compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries used within lower-cost power stations.</p>



<p>The charging speed on this device is completely nuts: The <strong>Delta 2 reaches 80% from zero in 50 minutes</strong> and 100% in 80 minutes with a standard wall outlet. That’s seven times as fast as previous EcoFlow products and enables you to get disaster backup power virtually instantly when storms are looming. The product feeds 1200 watts of AC input to the battery and that’s why it charges that quickly. The fans do run noisier during this fast charging mode and reaches approximately 58 decibels, but the charging speed can be lowered with the EcoFlow app to minimize noise if you are charging overnight.</p>
<p>The front panel is flush<strong> with 15 assorted outlets</strong>: You’ve got four AC outlets that together carry a rating of 1800 watts, two USB-C ports each carrying 100 watts of power (capable of fast-charging two MacBook Pros simultaneously), four USB-A with assorted speeds including two capable of 18-watt fast charging, one 12-volt auto outlet ideal for items such as portable coolers, and one DC5521 output port.</p>



<p>The LCD display shows real-time power input and output in watts, remaining battery percentage and estimated runtime based on your current load. This makes it easy to see exactly how much juice you have left and plan accordingly. The <em>EcoFlow</em> app adds remote control functionality and allows you to monitor power usage from anywhere, adjust charging speeds, and control connected outlets even when you’re not near the unit. The app also provides detailed energy consumption statistics so you can see which devices are draining the battery fastest.</p>
<p>The <strong>unit weighs 27 pounds</strong> which is heavier than the smaller capacity power stations yet light enough to be lifted with one hand with the heavy-duty built-in handle. The compact unit doesn’t occupy much floor space, and the top is level to easily stack items on top of it or store it away under a desk. The power station functions in extreme temperatures as well as features advanced battery management with 62 different protective features that <strong>watch temperature, voltage, current, and other vitals to ensure that everything stays within the safety range</strong>.</p>
<p>At $429 instead of $699, this is a 39% off deal and the lowest price that this power station has ever reached on Amazon. As with these units, they always seem to run out of stock during natural disasters when everyone wakes up as one to the sudden realization that they could use some backup power, so don’t delay waiting until the next hurricane watch to come to a decision.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/code-vein-2-preview-new-moon-same-blood</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/code-vein-2-preview-new-moon-same-blood.1323529/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Code Vein getting a sequel, as announced at Summer Game Fest earlier this year, was a pleasant surprise. The original was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/26/code-vein-review"><u>good</u></a>! It was one of those games that necessarily didn’t blow people away, but was fun popcorn for action-RPG fans who like deep character creators, over-the-top plots, and far more weapons and customization choices than any person can reasonably keep track of. But good or not, loads of excellent games in this genre never resurface after their initial debut, so Bandai Namco being willing to return to its twist on vampires and take another crack at perfecting the pitch is some seriously good news. Sure, the developer has disavowed any plot connections to the original, which has some fans worried. But I just got 45 minutes of hands-off time with Code Vein 2, and came out feeling confident that direct sequel or no, this follow-up feels like a far more fully realized vision of the fast-paced, flashy action RPG that Code Vein 1 was always striving to be.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dress to Impress</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I did get a very, very brief stint of hands-on time with Code Vein 2, in that Bandai Namco let me mess around in the c haracter creator before they took over. No huge surprises here, but if you liked the robustness of Code Vein 1’s character creator and can spend hours tweaking eyebrow shapes, I’ve got good news for you. You can choose from preset designs, of course, for folks who don’t want to sit on this screen all day, but you can also adjust minute details like teeth and ear shapes if that’s more your bag. I had a lot of fun picking out a really big, silly hat for my character to wear. One of my favorite elements of the creator is the ability to select an outfit, and then turn on and off certain pieces of it. Love a cute dress but hate the weird garter it makes you wear with it? Just turn it off! </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once I had settled on a cute hat and hairstyle, I handed the controller back over to the devs, and sat back to watch what they had to show me. The mission they elected to demonstrate was one where the player is sent off with a partner (a buddy) named Josée to restore power to a city area. They selected the quest area from a large overworld map and traveled there instantly, though they arrived not in a closed dungeon but in a large, lovely, ruined city with multiple dungeons available to them just by running (or driving a motorcycle) around. I got to watch some gameplay both from an optional dungeon near where we landed, and from the actual objective dungeon itself, a substation where the hero might be able to get the city’s power running again.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Define “Open”</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One big question I had going into this preview was whether Code Vein 2 was open world, or open zone, or something else. After chatting with the team, asking about the issue several times, and watching the demo, I’m still not 100% sure how to answer this. The team says it’s not open world, but also kept saying Code Vein 2 had “one single overworld” and that traveling is “a bit more open” than in Code Vein 1. There does seem to be a lot of interconnectivity – I watched the he=ro zoom around the outdoor area on a motorcycle (with Josée adorably sitting cross-legged on the back) and covering some meaningful distance without running into artificial walls, but it’s possible there were some much further along. Director Hiroshi Yoshimura also told me that the overworld is “significantly” bigger, while the dungeon sizes are roughly the same as Code Vein 1. Make of all that what you will for now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When I asked about the world, director Yoshimura repeatedly pointed out that the focus was less on exploration and more on the various character companions you’ll meet in Code Vein 2. You’ll be traveling to points in the world specifically for missions tied to these characters that will let you get to know them better. Much of Code Vein 2 does indeed seem to be centered around these buddies, or partners as they’re now called, even more so than the first game since the sequel won’t feature co-op.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Friend Circle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In my preview, I got a decent look at some of the partner dynamics between the main character and Josée. Josée’s got a big ol’ sword she swings around, slow but powerful, and at different points I saw her light it on fire for both close-up and long-range attacks. Without actually playing myself it’s hard to say whether or not the AI has improved from Code Vein 1 (where it could be a bit finicky or, at times, suicidal). Though, if you hate dealing with AI partners at all, they can assist you in Code Vein 2 via “assimilation” – effectively removing them from the battlefield, but giving yourself significant stat boosts and powerful new abilities to compensate. One other feature I did appreciate was the ability of partners to revive you when you fall in battle, and vice versa if your partners fall, wisely on a cooldown so it can’t be spammed for immortality. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From what I could see, Code Vein veterans will be perfectly happy with the sequel’s bursting larder of combat abilities and character customization. Code Vein 2 wants you to get really comfortable cycling through different types of skills, and boy, you better keep track of all those Proper Nouns. But here’s the jist: you’ll attack with your weapon to start building up bleeds on an enemy, then use your equipped auxiliary “Jail” weapon to gain a resource called Ichor. Ichor can then be spent on far more powerful abilities, such as “bequeathed formae”, special, powerful weapons like a huge bow and arrow or a powerful shield. Or, you can activate your Jails for huge finisher moves, like swinging an enormous scythe or briefly gaining big, vampiric wings.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Code Vein 2, like its predecessor, seems to benefit from just trying stuff out and seeing what’s fun and effective.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t mean to spend this whole preview lamenting that this was a hands-off demo, but man, I wish I could have gotten ahold of a controller just to muck around in the menus! Code Vein 2, like its predecessor, seems to benefit from just trying stuff out and seeing what’s fun and effective, and even with just the options I saw in the demo I feel like I could waste a lot of time wildly flailing around with different combinations until I was happy with my particular expression of it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">When This Baby Hits 88mph… </h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I unfortunately didn’t get a chance to see anything from one of Code Vein 2’s most intriguing key features: time travel. It takes place in a present day where a horrible calamity has taken place in the past, and you and your companions are given the ability to travel back in time and change history. Though you’re strongly urged not to meddle with the past, obviously, you do anyway. I’m told you’re allowed to freely travel between past and present most of the time (occasionally you’ll be locked out of doing so), and things you do in the past can influence what’s going on in the present, even to the point of making it impossible to return to the present. But I wasn’t able to see any of that in action during my preview, so it’s hard for me to say how extensive or interesting this element actually is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One other, somewhat fangirly note - hey, I love Go Shiina’s music? Shiina returns as composer for Code Vein 2 after working on Code Vein 1, and he’s also composed for my two favorite Tales games (don’t laugh at me for this): Tales of Legendia and Tales of Zestiria. His excellence was on full display both in my preview and in the story trailer I watched ahead of time, with soaring strings and chaotic vocals backing Code Vein 2’s intense battles. Sign me up for another banger Shiina soundtrack, thanks!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Bandai Namco has confirmed that Code Vein 2 is a complete departure from the story and universe of the first game, it’s familiar enough in gameplay and style that I came away feeling pretty happy with the direction. I’ve seen fans calling it a “soft reboot” and I think that’s an accurate summation: it’s true to the philosophy of Code Vein without being beholden to its lore Wiki. Nothing I’ve seen has shocked me so far, but I don’t think it needs to: everything good about Code Vein 1 is here, just bigger, shinier, and slash-slash-slashier. Now just let me tinker around in the character creator for just a few more minutes…</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/code-vein-2-preview-new-moon-same-blood]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has revealed Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, the first seasonal mini-event for the game, an invincible boss, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bounty Packs are paid DLC that bring new “bite-sized-yet-flavourful” narrative content to Borderlands 4. In Bounty Pack 1, due out November 20, players team up with Rush and “show the Timekeeper's Minister of Culture the true meaning of Mercenary Day, a jolly time for gift-giving and gunslinging with friends and family.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bounty Pack 1 also includes a Vault Card with new rewards that players will earn through gameplay, with 24 cosmetic items to unlock and four pieces of rerollable gear. The rerollable gear can be earned as many times as players like, so it can be an opportunity to obtain a roll with stats that perfectly suit a specific build, Gearbox said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Rush, the affable leader of the Outbounders, is feeling homesick and nostalgic for the holidays he's cherished in years past. By his calculations, it's about to be Mercenary Day, a jolly time for gift-giving and gunslinging with friends and family, and he'd like to bring that same festive cheer to the people of Kairos. But his hopes for holiday merriment stand in direct opposition to Screw, the Timekeeper's Minister of Culture who's charged with keeping celebrations as bland and homogenous as possible. Across a series of all-new Main Missions, you'll show Screw the true meaning of Mercenary Day by any means necessary, and maybe score some new Legendary loot in the process.</blockquote><h2 data-cy="title2">Here's the full breakdown of the Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack 1 Vault Card loot:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>4 rerollable weapons</li><li>4 Vault Hunter Heads usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe</li><li>4 Vault Hunter Skins usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe</li><li>5 Weapon Skins</li><li>5 Vehicle Skins</li><li>4 ECHO-4 Drone Skins</li><li>2 ECHO-4 Attachments</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Bounty Pack 1 also features a few extras to find:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Digirunner Vehicle (available shortly after starting the first Main Mission)</li><li>1 Vault Hunter Style usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe (available after beating the boss and completing the Bounty Pack's final Main Mission)</li><li>1 ECHO-4 Drone Skin (available after beating the boss and completing the Bounty Pack's final Main Mission)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">To access Gearbox has revealed Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, the first seasonal mini-event for the game, an invincible boss, and more., you need to have either bought the Borderlands 4 Deluxe or Super Deluxe Edition (both include the Bounty Pack Bundle), or bought the Bounty Pack Bundle that includes Bounty Pack 1, or bought Bounty Pack 1 individually.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/bl4-bountypack1-1760358945640.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day contents.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Gearbox revealed Borderlands 4’s free seasonal mini-event, Horrors of Kairos. This limited-time event celebrates Halloween from October 23 to November 6. Players will encounter a terrifying new weather effect of blood rain when fighting world bosses, and killing them has a chance to earn you new Legendary loot, Gearbox said. Seasonal cosmetics will be offered through SHiFT codes, too.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>"Murmur" Legendary Tediore Assault Rifle: Executes weakened enemies with guaranteed crits on targets under 35% health</li><li>"Skully" Legendary Order Grenade: This death-dealing grenade fires out projectiles as it seeks out the nearest target</li></ul><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/bl4-horrors-of-kairos-1760358970845.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Horrors of Kairos LTE.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, there’s a free endgame update in the form of Bloomreaper the Invincible. This is the first of the endgame Invincible Bosses coming to Borderlands 4 as free DLC, and is due at some point in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The "Invincible" moniker is a throwback to the raid bosses of Borderlands 2, so these aren't literally unkillable enemies, Gearbox explained, but players' skills “will be tested by the massive health pools, extremely lethal attack damage, and new modifiers of these all-new bosses.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The December update also adds a new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode level for an added layer of difficulty.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/bl4-bloomreaper-1760358988278.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Bloomreaper the Invincible.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-think-he-and-i-have-a-lot-in-common-borderlands-4-developers-used-first-person-footage-of-randy-pitchford-throwing-cards-to-help-animate-the-games-first-dlc-vault-hunter">Gearbox revealed Borderlands 4’s first of two new Vault Hunters coming to the game as part of the paid Story Pack DLCs</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-ryzen-5-lenovo-copilot-gaming-laptop-just-took-more-than-1000-haircut-at-amazon-feels-practically-free-now-2000634493</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-ryzen-5-lenovo-copilot-gaming-laptop-just-took-more-than-1-000-haircut-at-amazon-feels-practically-free-now.1323502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gamers and deal hunters usually don’t fish in the same ponds. Deal hunters are often willing to cut a few corners and give up a few features in the name of the almighty wallet. But to a gamer, sacrificing features like a fast processor and quick, reactive screen mean certain elimination in a battle royal game or enough lag-induced annoyance that those extra few hundred bucks are almost always worth shelling out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/">But when a gaming laptop like this 15-inch beauty from Lenovo takes a sharp and completely unexpected $1,000 price dive at Amazon and is transformed from a $1,700 investment into an incredible $650 deal</a>, the gamers and deal hunters will be racing to be the first to click buy. And while Amazon’s supply of these hot gaming laptops is almost certainly ample, the amount of time left on the deal might not be — it’s always hard to tell just how “limited” a limited-time Amazon deal is.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Specs Check Out</h2>
<p>We know the deal hunters were already satisfied when they saw that 62% discount label on this Lenovo, but the gamers are all about the specs. Good news — they check out, starting with the six-core, 12-thread AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor with a base speed of 3.3GHz and boost speed up to 4.55GHz. Add in the 40GB of DDR5 RAM and large-scale 1TB PCIe SSD, and while it may not be able to go toe to toe with those $3,000-plus pro rigs, the Lenovo massively overperforms on that new $650 Amazon price.</p>
<p>The screen also passes muster — it’s a 15.3-inch WUXGA (1920×1200) IPS panel with a slightly taller aspect ratio than the standard 16:9 for a little extra visual real estate. The 300 nits of brightness combined with anti-glare coating mean you don’t have to dim all the lights and draw the blackout shades to get a good picture. The Radeon 660M integrated GPU is perfect for eSports, mid-level FPS and battle royal games, and most definitely for streaming and creative work.</p>



<h2>Lagless Internet</h2>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 is an absolute must for any gaming laptop, and the Lenovo delivers, along with Bluetooth 5.3 for controllers. There’s DisplayPort support too, along with other ports including two USB-A, one HDMI 1.4, and an SD card reader. It’s preloaded with Windows 11 Pro and Microsoft Copilot, so even when it’s not in gaming mode it’s a more than ample everyday laptop.</p>
<p>While the gaming shoppers almost never look at anything below four figures, and deal hunters won’t normally seek anything with that comma in the price, everyone’s wants, needs, and interests are satisfied by the 62% off limited-time Amazon deal on this 15.3-inch Lenovo gaming laptop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/">It’s just $650 if you’re quick enough to catch it before it’s gone.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Life continues to find a way with a new entry in the fan-favorite saga with Jurassic World Evolution 3, and we’ve got all the platform details for the title.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Releasing October 21</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 makes big additions to the franchise in the form of baby dinosaurs and piece-by-piece construction, with mechanics that were initially seen in the Planet Coaster series and Planet Zoo.</p>



<p>With Jurassic World Evolution 3 roaring onto the scene, we’ve got everything you need to know about the title, including it’s availability on various platforms. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-jurassic-world-evolution-3-on-ps4-or-xbox-one">Can You Play Jurassic World Evolution 3 on PS4 or Xbox One?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Blossoming. Image via Frontier Developments</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Jurassic World Evolution 3 is not available on Xbox One or PlayStation 4, and is solely a current-gen exclusive title.</strong></p>



<p>This marks the first time in the franchise that the title has not been available on PS4 or Xbox One, though it is in line with other <a href="https://www.jurassicworldevolution.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frontier Developments</a> releases. Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster 2, for example, were not released on either platform.</p>



<p>Significant enhancements have been made since Jurassic World Evolution 2, with Planet Zoo’s console version and Planet Coaster 2 both releasing after the previous entry in the series.</p>



<p>Moving forward, it’s further evidence that Frontier Development games are unlikely to be available on last-gen consoles, with any new releases likely to be only PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S moving forward.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-jurassic-world-evolution-3-platforms-explained">All Jurassic World Evolution 3 Platforms, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is only available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned above, there are no last-gen releases for Jurassic World Evolution 3, nor is there any news on a launch on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles. While the Switch 2 may have the capacity for the title on the console, there’s no indication that Evolution 3 will make the jump to Nintendo platforms.</p>



<p>There could be future platform releases later on, however. Planet Zoo was initially released as a PC exclusive in 2019, before being ported to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S later. However, this seems unlikely this time around, unless a Switch 2 launch is on the cards.</p>
