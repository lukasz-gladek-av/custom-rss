            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/endless-legend-2-revealed-at-amplified-25/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>On Thursday, Amplitude Studios revealed the eagerly awaited ENDLESS Legend 2 at Amplified 25. This is a long-awaited return to an award-winning fantasy strategy series that takes place in the <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/endless-space-2-review/">ENDLESS Universe</a>. This time, players will be taken to a mysterious world called Saiadha, where they'll discover new, unique factions that carry out specific playstyles and a detailed story to go along with it. ENDLESS Legend 2 is set to release in Early Access on PC in early 2025. There isn't a specific date for this just yet.</p>
<p><iframe title="ENDLESS™ Legend 2 - Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x5rvxUoYFDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Saiadha is an oceanic world with a constantly changing landscape thanks to tumultuous seasons that cause dramatic tidefalls that cause significant changes to the landscape around you. However, the water will come down as the seasons cycle, and the environment can be explored. The landscape may also provide as an obstacle during this time, thanks to the terrain changes made by the water. This will mean players will have to be strategic in their gameplay in order to contend with the dramatic shifts, as well as uncovering the secrets of this world, and the threats that come along with it.</p>
<p>Players' choices will matter in this game and can lead to detrimental consequences depending on the decisions made. You'll be able to conquer new territories, gain experience, and form long-lasting bonds with allies, as well as points of contention with rivals. When the game launches in Early Access, there will be four unique factions for players to play with, as well as two more being added when the game fully releases.</p>
<p>For those who are eager to get into ENDLESS Legend 2, you can sign up for the Insiders Program, which allows a select group of players to try out ENDLESS Legend 2 before the game officially releases in Early Access. This will allow the players to provide feedback to the developers about what changes need to be made. It's important to note that when you sign up to the Insiders Program, you will be under NDA, and will require a Steam link with Amplifiers, which is the <a href="https://community.amplitude-studios.com/amplitude-studios/endless-legend-2/blogs/959-endless-legend-2-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community platform</a> that Amplitude Studios uses.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that you'll be accepted for the program, but it does mean that you will be considered for future testing opportunities should they arrive.</p>
<p>Will you be playing ENDLESS Legend 2 when it releases?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ex-blizzard-vets-announce-legacy-steel-and-sorcery-early-access-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After working on World of Warcraft for 14 years, some of the developers have jumped ship to create their own game with a brand new fantasy setting of their own. This title is Legacy: Steel and Sorcery, a game that was one of the top games during <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-steel-sorcery-pvpve-extraction-arpg-gets-alpha-demo-for-steam-next-fest/">Steam Next Fest</a> last year. For those who have already tried it out during Steam Next Fest and enjoyed it, you won't have to wait much longer. The game is set to release in<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344320/Legacy_Steel__Sorcery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Early Access</a> on February 12, 2025.</p>
<p>The title combines class-core multiplayer RPG progression and crafting with MMO PvP to create an Extraction title that stands out from the crowd. It also uses a 3rd person perspective, so you'll be able to see your character in full glory when taking part in the action. The game takes place in a high fantasy world full of ogres, rogues, magicians, and warriors.&nbsp; It's been said that this title has been in development long before the Extraction genre took off, but it will still be able to stand on its own two feet as something unique and enjoyed by those who play it.</p>
<p>Although it's a multiplayer game, you have the option to play solo or play as a group of three and create your own parties, where you will then explore the expansive world of Mithrigarde. While there will be a lot of combat along the way, your main task in Legacy: Steel and Sorcery is to get your hands on forgotten treasures, scavenge for supplies, and get back to base without losing any of it. Of course, it won't be as easy as it sounds, as there are tons of monsters to fight off and other teams to fight off to be able to get back with your treasure.</p>
<p>There will be the classic traits of an MMO PVP game, such as looting, battle, leveling, exploring, and, of course, PvP combat. If this game sounds like something you're interested in, make sure to check out the trailer below to get a glimpse of the fantasy action you could get into.</p>
<p><iframe title="Legacy: Steel and Sorcery - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TKQaN0YNOE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Founding players will be able to help provide beneficial feedback to the developers and have helped come up with new classes, maps, and game modes that will be added at a later date. This includes a Wizard and Paladin class.</p>
<p>When the game releases in Early Access on February 12, 2025, the game will cost those who want to purchase it a reasonable $24.99.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Legacy: Steel and Sorcery?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redeption-2-breaks-steam-concurrent/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-2-hits-new-concurrent-record-on-steam-thanks-to-15-sale.1092378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redeption-2-breaks-steam-concurrent/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 has topped a new record on Steam thanks to Rockstar Games’ sale, where the game is just $15.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Red Dead Redemption 2 currently sits with a peak concurrent player count of 86,717 according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1174180/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, topping its previous record of 77,655 in November 2023.</p>



<p>Its success comes from the recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/rockstarpublishersale2025?snr=1_4_4__118&amp;tab=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockstar Games Steam sale</a>, where you can save up to 80% off on Rockstar Games. Red Dead Redemption 2 seems to be one of the better deals at a 75% discount and for a game considered as a masterpiece (and still very much holds up today, may I add).</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 first released in October 2018 on consoles, and released one year later for PC on November 5, 2019.</p>



<p>The western-themed action-adventure would go on to win over 175 game awards and by June 2024 has sold over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-millions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">67 million units worldwide</a>.</p>



<p>As for what’s next with Rockstar Games, everyone is waiting for an update on the highly anticipated GTA 6, which will undoubtedly be The Game of the Year, no matter which year it launches. At the time of writing, the game is still slated to launch in 2025, but Rockstar Games’ lack of update has understandably got gamers, and the industry as a whole, wondering if a delay is imminent.</p>



<p>Its delay and lack of updates even resulted in one developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-parody-grand-taking-ages-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launching ‘Grand Taking Ages’ on Steam</a> as a parody.</p>



<p>Will you be picking up Red Dead Redemption 2 for just $15? Or are you waiting for that all-important GTA 6 update? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Coca-Cola has partnered with Xbox to give away a selection of super bright controllers "representing the most popular flavours in the brand's portfolio", such as orange, lemon, exotic, fruit twist, grape, and lemon-elderflower.</p>
<p>As well as Fanta-inspired Xbox Series X console bundles and wireless controllers, there's also hundreds of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions up for grabs, too, although you should probably note that they can only be redeemed by new members and not existing ones, I'm afraid.</p>

            <p>The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep - the Witcher anime heading to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> next month - will take place in the middle of the live-action show, specifically between episodes 5 and 6, and it includes a scene that was cut from Henry Cavill's first season.</p>
<p>As detailed in this month's <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/sfx/">SFX magazine</a> and shared by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/the-upcoming-the-witcher-anime-movie-features-a-new-version-of-a-scene-cut-from-the-henry-cavills-first-season/">GamesRadar+</a>, writer Mike Ostrowski and co-writer Rae Benjamin call it "a period of not being together [with Yennefer], or a period of trouble, but still on each other's minds".</p>

<p>The writers say they do not interfere with the live-action show's chronology or timeline, but the anime does include a "fun little scene" that was reportedly cut from the main Netflix series.</p>
<p>What, exactly, that scene entails? We're going to have to wait until the show debuts on 11th February, unfortunately - the writers wouldn't say more. But as we know Anya Chalotra reprises her role as Yennefer in the anime, the writers tease that we'll see more of Geralt and Yennefer's relationship in Sirens of the Deep.</p>
<p>"Geralt cannot let Yennefer go, even though he's trying his best," Ostrowski added. "She haunts him. Even if he wanted to be rid of her, he can't."</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us recently, two and a half years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">announcement</a>, CD Projekt finally gave it the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">big reveal treatment</a> late in 2024, confirming Ciri to be the focus this time around. And now Doug Cockle - voice of former series protagonist Geralt of Rivia both in the games and the anime - has had his say, calling the switch to a new main character, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ciri-as-witcher-4-protagonist-really-really-interesting-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-says-geralt-voice-actor">"really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The $149.99 Founders Edition preorders are sold out already, but you can <a href="https://retroremake.co/products/superstation%E1%B5%92%E2%81%BF%E1%B5%89?variant=41951147884567">still preorder</a> the standard $225 SuperStation One for $179.99 right now, with shipping expected in “Q4 or Earlier.” </p><p>While the SuperStation One looks like a PS One — complete with ports compatible with the original PlayStation controller and memory cards — it plays more than just PlayStation 1 games. It’s a custom MiSTER field-programmable gate array (FPGA) machine, as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/512589/superstation-one-pre-order-playstation-console"><em>Polygon </em>points out</a>. That means rather than emulating game consoles, its hardware can actually function <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323002/mister-fpga-project-retro-computer-console-early-pc">just like those consoles</a>, with cores <a href="https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/cores/console/">ranging</a> from the Atari 5200 and NES to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. </p><p>Retro Remake currently offers the system in black, gray, and translucent blue. It comes with a 64GB Micro SD card and has three USB-A ports, an ethernet port, and an NFC reader that you can use to trigger specific games to load. It uses USB-C for power.</p><p>On the video side of things, the SuperStation One will have an HDMI port, along with VGA, DIN10, composite, and component ports geared for retro gaming setups. You’ll also find a 3.5mm audio jack and a digital audio port. Finally, there’s an expansion slot to support Retro Remake’s planned SuperDock accessory that adds a slot-loading disc drive, a 2280 m.2 SSD bay, and four more USB-A ports. That’s not up for preorder yet, but you <a href="https://retroremake.co/products/superdock-preorder-deposit">can put down a $5 preorder deposit</a> for it with an order of the SuperStation One.</p><p>This is Retro Remake’s first console, though the company plans to make more later, as Udon <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-taki-udon-explains-how-his-fpga-ps1-aims-to-remove-barriers-to-fpga-gaming">told <em>Time Extension</em></a><em> </em>last week. The company has released other products, including a DIY kit for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253224/nintendo-switch-lite-oled-upgrade-kit">upgrading the Nintendo Switch Lite</a> to an OLED display.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>PC gaming has dominated the mainstream markets over the past decade, as revealed in this <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025">new report</a> by Epyllion. Traditionally, video game markets have always favored console platforms in terms of product launches, given that the PC version often comes years after the mainstream release, but despite this disparity, it seems like PC gaming has managed to compete in the gaming segment tremendously. Epyllion's newest report has revealed that PC gaming consumer revenue share has grown by up to 20% in years, while console revenue has "stagnated," showing the interest around both platforms.</p>
<p>The data reveals that while both platforms have seen exponential growth over the years, it seems like PC gaming has seen a stronger momentum, which has certainly been reflected in the revenue figures. Since the last decade, PC gaming has been said to bring in up to 220% higher revenue than the console platform, which is indeed astonishing, considering how the general notion is that consoles have contributed more to the gaming industry in general.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Image credits: Epyllion</figcaption></figure>
<p>Epyllion claims that the platform's growth over the years is due to its "compounding advantages" over the console platform and a more interactive environment, which means backward compatibility and greater control over the gaming performance of the respective systems. Along with this, the sluggish selling momentum of consoles has also been attributed to the figures, which is why PC gaming has seen accelerated progress over the past few years, especially after 2021.</p>
<p>Whatever platform emerges at the top, it's safe to say that this progress is ultimately healthy for the gaming markets since the revenue figures rising over the years mean we are witnessing sustainable growth. Let us know which platform you prefer, PC or console, and why.</p>

And make no mistake, terror is an emotion. Horror is something you experience. Terror is the work of the mind, the imagination of what’s absent, of what might be under the rug or around the corner. It is what you <em>live through</em>. Karma: The Dark World has its share of horror, yes. But it is primarily concerned with terror. And more to the point, it is <em>good</em> at it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were times during my roughly two-hour demo when I was playing at night, with headphones off, and I had to pause and take a breath. Horror games don’t generally “scare” me. I don’t jump, don’t yell, don’t scream. I know the tricks. But it was two in the morning and I was tired and alone and wearing headphones and something had wormed its way into my brain, and when I had to climb into that vent to enter that blocked-off, red-tinged room, I decided that was enough for the evening. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Karma is full of little moments like that, where you don’t want to go forward, don’t want to bear witness, but you must. Karma is set in an alternate-history 1976, and you’re stepping into the shoes of Roam Agent Daniel McGovern. Daniel is what they call a Nightcrawler. An employee of the omnipresent Leviathan Corporation’s Thought Bureau, he spends most of his time inside other people’s heads. As my demo started, he was being sent to investigate Sean Mehndez, who was accused of stealing something from the Winston Research Institute. You’re to investigate that, as well as an “unusual incident” that took place in the clerical office around the same time. It sounds, as Daniel notes, fairly routine. It isn’t.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Big Brother is Watching</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Karma’s world is explicitly dystopian, and you’ll notice how wrong everything feels right off the bat. Some people have televisions for heads. Everyone has a social level, and every minor infraction is recorded, catalogued, tracked, and held against you – even things as seemingly insignificant as having a stain on your work uniform or applying makeup during work hours. Telescreens requiring user IDs, shaped like floppy disks, are tied to social level and hang in every room. Leviathan’s all-seeing eye is watching you. None of this stuff was explained in the demo I played. It didn’t need to be; you understand it immediately, the way you understand a weight hanging around your neck, the same way you understand a noose. This world is <em>wrong</em>, which only adds to what’s to come.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Karma is a first-person game, which only adds to the dread that creeps into you as you play. You are always aware of what you can’t see, what you have to look away from to progress, what might happen if you do. Daniel’s investigation starts off innocently enough. You explore the Research Institute, piecing together what has happened and solving simple puzzles. You need an ID to open the storage room, so you piece together the code by reading a diary entry and using that to find the clue you need in the world. But soon, The Horrors ™ start to creep in. “Don’t look back” appears scrawled on a wall when you flick off a lightswitch. If you do, you’ll see… something, a man, a shape, a ghost, appear and then vanishes. When you examine the recordings of infractions, some…thing with too many legs seems to be in the image. Something is deeply wrong here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Karma builds dread in more subtle ways, too. Musical stings that appear and then vanish as suddenly as they came, seemingly at random. The lighting of a room. The destroyed area you’re to investigate. It always feels like you’re moving towards something, witnessing something, and often, you won’t want to. Daniel even moves slowly, lumbering, like he knows he shouldn’t be here, that advancing will lead him to a place he doesn’t want to go.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Splinters in the Mind’s Eye</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most memorable moment of my time with Karma came after I found the evidence of Mehndez’s crime. When I went to return it via the pneumatic tubes that dispensed my orders, I saw Mehndez walking, like a ghost, through the hallway. I followed him, and he led me into a dark room, with a single door. When I entered, I found myself in what I can best describe as Twin Peaks’s Black Lodge: red curtains everywhere, mannequins, a family around a table. It took me a moment to realize I was seeing Mehndez’s memories – his life, his fears, maybe. Something. I read about his daughter, saw her room, and then when I returned, they had moved in front of the TV, and eventually, they led me to an elevator going down. I descended.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What followed was one of the most disturbing sequences I’ve ever experienced in a horror game. Alarm clocks hanging from the ceiling, going off. Bodies covered in some sort of black goo, mannequins splattered with blood, lying haphazardly along gurneys. I learned about what had happened to Mehndez, to his wife, his daughter. I watched their home disintegrate; I put my hand into a computer and watched a man, strung up by his arms, explode; I entered an office and watched it go mad, the mannequins inside cowering in fear. At one point I turned around, tried to go another way, and they were all suddenly behind me, hands up, forcing me to go forward. Sometimes, the greatest horror is to be forced to watch. And I thought of Revelation. And a voice said “come and see,” and I looked.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I saw those mannequins hover, saw the black goo cover the floor, saw Mehndez’s home disintegrate further, learned what befell his family. And the curtains around me, always the red curtains. Then back into the office, answering the ringing phone, previously silent. “War. Peace. Freedom. Slavery. Ignorance. Strength,” said the voice on the other end. I recognized the words. Orwell. 1984. Big Brother is watching you. And I followed them, followed them until I reached an office where I could walk through the screen and see the big eye that had been watching me, and I saw that eye sprout more eyes, and I watched it follow me as I climbed stairs supported by nothing, and I saw three doors leading nowhere, and another phone, and I answered it, and someone, a woman, told me that she was sorry, that none of this was supposed to happen. And I entered the door in front of me, and something came after me, something I barely glimpsed but that horrified me all the same, and I fell. And then Daniel woke up, and I let out a breath I didn’t know I was holding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Was it real? Had it happened? Had Daniel imagined it? Did it matter? Like him, I had experienced it and I will remember those images, real or not. We can be haunted by what seem like dreams, by the unreal, the uncanny, the wrong. It is where horror lives. In the mind. There was more to my demo past this, but terror is best experienced, so I will end here, and say Karma: The Dark World beckons you to come and see. And if developer Pollard Studio can deliver that feeling, that dread that compels, that horrifies, that you feel, for the rest of Karma: The Dark World’s runtime, then it is a journey that I will be happy to live through. My eyes are open.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

First, we shared our picks for the games we most want to see make their way to the Nintendo Switch 2. We also shared our impressions of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>after some recent hands-on time with the game, and look ahead to what seems to be a pretty promising year for Xbox Game Pass. Read on for these takes and more.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b0e671bb3cd9f65e797f21411cca6490" data-recommend-id="image://b0e671bb3cd9f65e797f21411cca6490" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lilith from Diablo is shown inside a Switch 2 screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lilith from Diablo is shown inside a Switch 2 screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment / Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b0e671bb3cd9f65e797f21411cca6490" data-recommend-id="image://b0e671bb3cd9f65e797f21411cca6490" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lilith from Diablo is shown inside a Switch 2 screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The original Switch was a trailblazing device that proved you could take console-quality games on the go, but it was demonstrably less powerful than its PlayStation and Xbox competitors. In the years since the Switch was released, that gap has only grown with the release of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. We still don’t have official specs for the Switch 2, but it will likely be a decent leap forward for Nintendo’s line of handheld/console hybrids. As such, it wouldn’t be too surprising to see some older games make their way to the device that couldn’t feasibly run on the original, so we got to thinking about some big games that we’d like to see ported to the Switch 2. Here are a few of our ideas.  - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6514a2accdf6c3bdbbb1c46b207217d0" data-recommend-id="image://6514a2accdf6c3bdbbb1c46b207217d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1150" data-height="647" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The image of the Four Cyclists of the Apocalypse in the final issue of AMIGA POWER." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The image of the Four Cyclists of the Apocalypse in the final issue of AMIGA POWER." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amiga Power</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6514a2accdf6c3bdbbb1c46b207217d0" data-recommend-id="image://6514a2accdf6c3bdbbb1c46b207217d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1150" data-height="647" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The image of the Four Cyclists of the Apocalypse in the final issue of AMIGA POWER." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is a reasonable chance you have not heard of Jonathan Nash.

They chose to make it so good, and so comprehensive, that it removed the need to make any more. It has now been over ten years since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> first released, more than double the length that’s ever come between an entry in the series before. Honestly, they could re-re-release <em>8</em> for the Switch 2, and it’d still sell millions.

<p>Xbox CEO Phil Spencer denied that Starfield would be coming to PlayStation 5 last year, but after a new interview following the developer direct, his opinion has seemingly changed.</p>



<p>Speaking to Destin Legarie via his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/phil-spencer-120725254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">patreon</a>, Spencer responded “No” after Legarie asked, “Can you solidify that Starfield is staying put for the time being?”</p>



<p>Spencer continued “There’s no specific game that I would… This goes back to my redline answer, there’s no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place that it will find players where we would have business success for us.”</p>



<p>“What we find is we’re able to drive a better business that allows us to invest in a great game lineup that you saw, and that’s our strategy. Game pass is an important component to playing games on our platform, but to keep games off other platforms, that’s not a path for us,” he said.</p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/02/04/exclusive-microsoft-plans-starfield-launch-for-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XboxEra reported</a> that Microsoft would be planning to release Starfield on the PlayStation 5, which is a claim that Xbox would later deny, but is now seemingly true (whether or not Starfield was planned back then remains to be seen).</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-at-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – Ninja Gaiden 4 Announced At Xbox Developer Direct</a></strong></p>



<p>Regardless, following the interviews this week, Xbox has finally decided to just rip the Band-Aid off the whole Xbox exclusivity saga, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-more-xbox-games-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company now pretty much saying that there games will be on every platform</a>, which ultimately, is better for gamers.</p>



<p>What do you think of Xbox’s strategy moving forward? Do you think PlayStation will eventually follow? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Mass Effect 2 is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, January 26, 2025. Below, we look back at its unique episodic structure, and how other developers have not picked up its torch.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Most RPGs are like fantasy or science-fiction novels. The cross-continental journeys of Final Fantasy X or Dragon Age: Origins feel analogous to The Lord of the Rings or The Wheel of Time. Even sandboxes like Baldur's Gate 3 lean on a linear set of events, the disruption of routine key to fantasy fiction. Mass Effect 2 is a serious contrast, instead modeling itself after a season of television. I'm not <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-mass-effect-2-was-my-favorite-mass-effect-5898519" rel="nofollow ">the first person to make this comparison</a>, but even after a decade and a half of further RPG releases, ME2's structure remains striking. The format helped catapult ME2 to upper echelons of many greatest-games lists. It is still the most beloved entry of the franchise, beating out its incomplete and controversial siblings. However, without the novelty of experiencing it for the first time, ME2 feels more like a valiant first effort at something new, rather than the apex of the form.</p><p dir="ltr">To summarize, protagonist Shepard is tasked with recruiting 12 party members to accompany him on a "suicide mission." Outside of a few main quests, most of ME2's runtime concerns itself with recruiting those characters and helping them resolve their personal issues. ME2's main plot is ultimately inconsequential to the trilogy's broader machinations. Instead, the game's series of one-off missions steal the show, making ME2 more character-focused than its kin. One could argue that Baldur's Gate 3, with its three acts, or Dragon Age: Origins, with its hub areas, have episodic structures. But each mission in ME2 is essentially an episode of TV. Most are entirely self-contained, and few relate back to the main plot in any meaningful way. They act the way individual episodes in a television show might act. The game is a serious attempt to bring the long-term, routine-focused dynamics of classic Star Trek to a massive RPG.</p><p dir="ltr">In theory, this offers space for characters to relax, take up space, and show their complexities and shades. Sometimes it even succeeds. The assassin Thane is an obvious highlight--a clichéd character given weight and grace through careful writing and some beguiling alien touches.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="838724666"

in the ensemble. Mass Effect 2's focus on individual characters leads to some remarkable moments, but it also means there is little room for party members to get to know and react to each other. To be fair, this is a problem that many RPGs have. Because you often swap out companion characters, leaving the remainder "back at camp," means that you have little guaranteed time with any individual character and even less time with any pair or trio in your party. Intra-companion interactions are limited to banter or brief reactions. Conflict between party members cannot drive the plot because there is no guarantee that any individual party member will be present at any time. (Final Fantasy solved this problem years ago by assuming every party member is present for cutscenes, but restricting combat to a limited number).</p><p dir="ltr">Mass Effect 2 instantiated this problem in some novel ways. Each of the game's 12 party members are only guaranteed to be present for two missions. DLC characters like Kasumi Goto and Zaeed Massani only get one. This means that party members have to go broad, charismatic, and identifiable. The majority of the cast are recognizable archetypes that get little elaboration: the traumatized punk with a heart of gold (Jack), the neurotic, autistic-coded scientist (Mordin), the beleaguered self-sacrificing warrior (Samara). The returning companions Tali, Garrus, and especially Liara avoid this to some degree (the Liara-focused DLC Lair of the Shadow Broker is perhaps the single best Mass Effect story). But Tali's and Garrus's quests offer variations on their arcs from the first game. What is Tali's relationship to her culture and family? Should Garrus indulge his instincts of vengeance? Neither mission pushes either character beyond where they already were.</p><p dir="ltr">To give credit where it is due, ME2 does try to center character conflict. Opposing party members like Jack and Miranda (who works for the corp that experimented on Jack) get a moment of confrontation. However, these are isolated scenes that are easily defused with a persuasion check. ME2's structure can't allow these conflicts to boil over at a dramatic moment or become a pain point revisited during multiple missions. While individual characters can experience growth and change, the character of the ensemble itself must remain consistent. The only relationships that can develop, at least in a serious meaningful way, are between party members and the player. Even the suicide mission, in which all 12 party members participate, focuses on choices about individual characters. The growth of the ensemble, the development of it unto itself, is a defining element of most great television. ME2 can only manage a few gestures at it.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite all my grousing, ME2 does sometimes capitalize on its format. The episodic structure allows for a wider diversity of settings than the first game's hub worlds and the third's military theatres. Though the game's overall plot is weak, its individual moments remain focused, allowing missions with high and low stakes, from rescuing a lost sister to saving a son from the sins of the father. This gives the game an emotional character, so that when the stakes get higher in the suicide mission, your heart is with the individual lives of your crew more than anything else.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite these strengths, no game has really taken Mass Effect 2's mantle. RPGs like Pentiment, Disco Elysium, and Citizen Sleeper have innovated on the format in entirely different ways. Dragon Age: The Veilguard borrows the ideal of the "suicide mission," concluding in a massive setpiece, but lets go of ME2's more episodic elements. Throwback isometric games like Pillars of Eternity and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous attempt to wrangle the sprawl of tabletop campaigns into video game form. Even literal episodic games like Life is Strange borrow more from the miniseries, rather than the sci-fi television epic. While Mass Effect 2 is beloved, it is not exactly influential.</p><p dir="ltr">Fifteen years later, what Mass Effect 2 best showcases is promise. While hardly an experimental game, it attempts something novel in its genre-space and succeeds, but the gaps it leaves behind are tantalizing. One wonders what a similar game with a smaller cast, a greater focus on character conflict, and an unflagging commitment to episodic storytelling might bring. Its potential is still unrealized.</p>

            <p>35 years after point and click horror game Last Half of Darkness first released it's coming back, remade from the ground up by the same solo dev who created it.</p>
<p>In honour of the 35th anniversary (well, technically 36th now) of the 1989 original, Bill Fisher has gone back to the start by remaking the first Last Half of Darkness with all-new graphics, a new soundtrack, "enhanced" story, and "even more" puzzles. You can check out the announcement teaser below:</p>

<p>"Your aunt sure was a strange one," the blurb teases. "She was some sort of witch or something. A good witch though, practicing only good spells and magic. In fact, she was working on a potion just before she was killed.</p>
<p>"Now the secret will go to the grave with her... unless you can find the missing ingredients."</p>
<p>"I made it on an XT PC 64k RAM system with a 10mb hard drive over a 9 month period, just working part-time on it," Fisher explained. "Was goofing around with some paint programs seeing if I could make some cool looking rooms and locations. It ended up turning out relatively good so I decided to actually package it. Hired an artist to do the package design and found a box manufacturer, etc. Got it in a couple retail stores locally, and sold a few at some conventions but wasn't really familiar or had the right contacts with the distribution side of things so it never was officially released commercially.</p>
<p>"However, right around that time, shareware was starting to really take off... and turned out to be very successful."</p>
<p>Last Half of Darkness is set to release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3096000/Last_Half_of_Darkness/">Steam</a> on 7th February 2025, although if you missed the original first time around, worry not - <a href="http://lasthalfofdarkness.com/">that's still available</a>, too.</p>

            <p>Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> said its brand identity is "evolving" now keeping first-party games exclusive to its own platform is no longer "a path for [Xbox]".</p>
<p>When asked by independent games journalist <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/phil-spencer-120725254">Dustin Legarie</a> if, like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> would continue to have an "exclusivity window" on Xbox systems, Spencer replied with a strikingly simple: "No."</p>

<p>"There's no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place where it would find players, where it would have business success for us," Spencer explained.</p>
<p>"Our strategy is to allow our games to be available.</p>
<p>"Game Pass is an important component of playing the games on our platform, but to keep games off other platforms?" Spencer added."We don't think is the path… that's not a path for us. It doesn't work for us."</p> <div>

<p>"What we're doing now we think really enables us to build the best platform for the world's best games. 'Cos the world's biggest games are available in multiple places, and more and more creators are asking us, how do we stay connected when our game might be playable in all these different places, and we want Xbox to be absolutely the platform that enables that.</p>
<p>"We think that makes us unique. Most of the other platforms out there are single platform on single device, whether that's PC, whether that's mobile, whether it's a console.</p>
<p>And we want Xbox to be a platform that enables creators across any screen that people want to play on."</p>
<p>When pressed on whether Xbox's change in strategy means it may lose its identity, Spencer was firm about that, too.</p>
<p>"I hear them. I'm pretty active in our playerbase, and I'm active in the community. I listen. I think our identity will continue to evolve, which, frankly, it always has. But when I hear concerns, I hear concerns about is: my library of games safe. Am I still going to be able to play the games. And I think over the years, I'm proud of the commitment we've shown to respecting purchases on our platform through back compat, through cross entitlement, Xbox Play Anywhere, through crossplay. Things that we've done to enable people to continue to play, so I hear that.</p><p>"I see the investments we're making in platform and how we want Xbox to show up in multiple places, and your library to be available there. When I think about buy-to-stream - so when if I buy a game, I'll be able to stream it to devices - this is all about making sure that your library of games that you own on Xbox are playable in multiple places, so I'd say it's in evolution of our identity. But I believe it's an identity that this industry needs.</p>
<p>"When you think about where this industry is now and you see the challenges, the business challenges that are out there for many companies, I think us making games more accessible to more people has just gotta be front and centre for us as an industry so we continue to see great games that we've seen over the years."</p>
<p>The comments echo Spencer's position at the end of last year, when he said there were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">"no red lines" over any Xbox game coming to Nintendo Switch or PS5</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24351383/handheld-pcs-challenge-switch-2-editorial<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I stopped buying most games for my Nintendo Switch the day I bought a Steam Deck. My Switch has been a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch">Mario</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">Zelda</a> machine ever since. It’s simple: the Steam Deck took the Switch’s best trick — pick-up-and-play portability — while offering more games that run better. I can easily resume the ones I started on my desktop PC, or continue to play portable titles on my desktop and marvel at improved graphics.&nbsp;</p><p>But the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, coming later this year, may change that value proposition. Not only will it continue to be <em>the</em> console that attracts families and kids with inventive, surprising, must-try exclusive Nintendo games that use <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">its detachable Joy-Cons’ many tricks</a>, but it also has a real chance at convincing the enthusiasts who might otherwise buy a handheld gaming PC — or who were waiting for handheld PCs to become less of a wild west.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Switch 2’s newly magnetic Joy-Con.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Gif: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>The Switch 2 may meet or beat the Steam Deck in performance. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">If history’s any indication</a>, it should <em>easily</em> sell better than every handheld gaming PC combined. When the original Nintendo Switch launched nearly eight years ago, there was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">almost nothing to play but <em>Zelda</em></a>, and Nintendo held its game catalog in an iron grip — but now, the backwards-compatible Switch 2 will launch with one of the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/platform/?sort=games&amp;order=desc">largest and most welcoming libraries of all time</a>, rivaled only by smartphones and computers. The Switch could theoretically become the new baseline for game developers to target, and the most reliable place to find new handheld-friendly titles.</p><p>So: How can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc">the budding handheld PC revolution</a> escape the shadow of the Switch 2? I won’t say I know for sure, but I <em>did</em> just check the industry’s temperature at CES 2025, the world’s biggest tech show — and I’m afraid PC handhelds may stay in that shadow unless the industry does more.&nbsp;</p><p>Handheld ergonomics was one bright spot going into 2025. While I still prefer the Deck’s overall feel, practically every PC handheld I touched had nicely sculpted grips that made them more comfortable to hold than their predecessors. From the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338654/i-finally-touched-the-msi-claw-8-ai-plus">8-inch MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a> and Lenovo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">Legion Go S</a>, to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342995/i-played-with-the-new-legion-go-2-too">the 8.8-inch Legion Go 2</a>, and the giant <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337860/intel-brought-a-big-honking-stereo-3d-handheld-gaming-pc-to-ces-2025">11-inch Tencent Sunday Dragon</a>, even the largest Windows handhelds didn’t feel as awkward as some of their first-gen predecessors.</p><p>There are four places I think the industry has to change — and maybe, band together — if these handhelds want a meaningful piece of the Switch.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>A year made a huge ergonomic difference to Lenovo’s handhelds in particular. (The new one’s on the left.)</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto</cite></p></div><p><h3>Operating system</h3></p><p>Buyers need to know that their game will be ready to <em>play </em>when they press the power button on a handheld. That’s the Nintendo Switch experience, and it’s similar to how the Steam Deck works once games are downloaded — but it’s far from what Windows handhelds currently offer.</p><p>That’s why the three biggest pieces of handheld gaming news at the show had little to do with the hardware itself. They were about ditching today’s version of handheld Windows.&nbsp;</p><p>First, Lenovo revealed it would produce <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">the first authorized third-party handheld</a> to ship with Valve’s easy-to-use SteamOS instead of Windows — something only the Steam Deck has done so far. Second, Valve told us it would bring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">a SteamOS beta to additional third-party handhelds</a> as soon as this April. Third, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming">a Microsoft executive told <em>The Verge</em></a> that the company would finally do something meaningful about its bloated Windows experience on handhelds later this year, combining “the best of Xbox and Windows together.”&nbsp;</p><p>These moves are heartening, as it’s a Wild West in handheld PC land. Most companies opt for a copy of Windows that doesn’t reliably launch games or sleep and wake properly, defeating some of the purpose of a pick-up-and-play handheld experience. They’re filled with difficult-to-navigate UI and unnecessary bloatware, too — to the point that today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">a community-created fork of Valve’s SteamOS UI is already a far better experience</a> than Windows.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also good for SteamOS fans: while the Steam Deck is a great platform for SteamOS, we’ve already seen the Deck can’t compete with the Switch by itself. Game publishers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23999300/fortnite-on-steam-deck-sweeney-says-valve-needs-tens-of-millions-of-users-to-justify-it">don’t see the raw sales numbers</a> to bring big multiplayer games like <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Valorant</em> to SteamOS. (They say <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">cheaters are too big a risk</a>.)</p><p>But, while the CES moves are significant, Valve, Microsoft, and Lenovo are non-committal about how much things might improve. Microsoft would only give me the barest hints about making Windows feel more like an Xbox game console at some point later this year. Lenovo is hedging its SteamOS bet <em>hard —</em> not only will the Legion Go S ship in both Windows and SteamOS varieties, the Windows version will go on sale months earlier, and Lenovo won’t commit to SteamOS for its larger, later-in-2025 handheld.&nbsp;</p><p>No other company announced a SteamOS handheld at CES, either, save for PC maker GPD, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337913/no-valve-isnt-working-with-gpd-to-bring-steamos-to-its-handheld">with a claim that was apparently false</a> or lost in translation. Valve told me it has no other partner devices currently in the works for SteamOS, though it’d be happy to work with more companies. I believe every handheld maker should give SteamOS a shot.</p><div><figcaption><em>CES 2025 brought huge handhelds like this 11-inch Acer, and they’re </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24344308/asus-rog-flow-acer-nitro-blaze-steam-deck-giant-pc-handheld-experiment"><em>not necessarily a bad idea</em></a><em>!</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p><h3>Screen</h3></p><p>This one’s easy: to maximize performance, battery life, economies of scale, and offer a closer-to-game-console experience, handheld PC makers should <em>universally adopt</em> a 1080p-or-lower-resolution HDR OLED screen with variable refresh rate.&nbsp;</p><p>Many PC manufacturers are wasting what little performance they can muster from a handheld chip and battery on a screen with far too many pixels for the task, artificially constraining performance and battery life in exchange for 1600p or 1200p sharpness that most gamers won’t miss on a 7-inch to 8-inch panel. Additionally, every handheld <em>without</em> a variable refresh rate screen is likely wasting a good chunk of the frames that their handheld can serve because their screen is artificially limiting their framerate — VRR was the Asus ROG Ally’s secret weapon, letting it play games more smoothly than competing handhelds even if rivals’ chips offered the same FPS.</p><p>Lastly, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review#:~:text=in%20HDR%2C%20your%20games%20finally%20have%20real%20light">HDR is a revelation on the Steam Deck OLED’s screen</a>, letting both native titles and the HDR games I stream from my PS5 feel like they’re filled with real light that explodes out of the screen. It’s something Windows desktops and laptops have never consistently offered the way today’s consoles do, but handhelds could be the gateway to changing that.</p><p>Is a screen like the one I’m describing expensive or hard to find? Band together, PC companies, and surely a display maker can change that for you.</p><p><h3>Chips and battery</h3></p><p>Unless you count the Nvidia Tegra at the heart of the Nintendo Switch, AMD is the leader in handheld chips. But its semi-custom <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/1/24021717/speaking-of-handheld-pc-gaming-chips-heres-an-incredible-look-at-the-steam-decks-apu">Aerith and Sephiroth parts</a> for the Steam Deck feel like the <em>only </em>ones proactively designed with power-sipping handhelds in mind, leaving everyone else at a portability disadvantage. And it sounds like AMD’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">new Z2 line</a> might not be all that different.</p><p>AMD’s Z1 batch of chips in handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally wasn’t originally for handheld; they’re mildly tweaked laptop processors that need 17 or 18 watts to begin to hit their stride, enough for a complete handheld to drain a typical 50Wh battery pack in well under three hours with mildly intensive games.</p><p>The Z2 line is similarly a set of tweaked laptop chips, and while AMD told me some may offer more performance at the same power and add improved efficiency tweaks, the total consumed power may not decrease. Lenovo product manager Alex Zhu told me it’s looking at running its Legion Go S’s Z2 Go chip at around 20 watts, which might give it worse battery life than the 15-watt-and-below Steam Deck even if its GPU is more capable. AMD also confirmed the Z2 Go is less powerful than the prior-gen Z1 Extreme.</p><p>AMD senior fellow Mahesh Subramony told me the company’s flagship Z2 Extreme chip, on TSMC’s shrunk-down N4P process node with a mix of newer Zen 5, Zen 5c and RDNA 3.5 cores, should be both more efficient and much more capable than the Z2 Go, and quite a bit better than the Z1 Extreme as well, but it’s not a leap forward. That may require AMD’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336246/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-rdna-4-fsr-4-ces-2025">even newer RDNA 4 graphics</a>, and it may require bespoke processors.</p><div><figcaption><em>The MSI Claw 8 AI Plus uses an Intel Lunar Lake chip.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Don’t hold your breath if you’re hoping Intel might provide meaningful competition in the handheld chip realm. While early reviews of the Intel Lunar Lake chip in the revised MSI Claw 8 AI Plus are quite promising, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285513/intel-ceo-lunar-lake-one-off-memory-package-discrete-gpu">its pricey Lunar Lake chip may be a bit of a one-off</a>, with future Intel parts steering away from the power-saving on-die memory that Intel experimentally added. I’m curious if that’s why <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/msi-claw-8-ai-faces-launch-with-limited-availability-first-units-already-in-gamers-hands">MSI hasn’t fully launched the Claw</a> as expected.</p><p>Meanwhile, Intel certainly has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311594/intel-under-pat-gelsinger">bigger fish to fry right now</a> than making custom handheld chips. “It’s not a market that we’re actively pursuing, but it’s a market we’re happy to enable,” Intel VP of technical marketing Robert Hallock tells me of handheld gaming. “It is somewhat extracurricular,” he added, explaining that it’s a fun and exciting but small market and that Intel has to pick its battles. “We’re coming off admittedly, about five, six years of strife and we have to decide where we want to invest.”.</p><p>Some manufacturers have been able to improve the battery life disadvantage of today’s off-the-shelf AMD chips by including a much larger battery pack — the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">Asus ROG Ally X</a> doubled the size of its predecessor’s pack to 80 watt-hours, and it’s no longer the only 80Wh handheld you can buy. But that comes with size and weight tradeoffs that can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld">only be partially engineered away</a>.</p><p>We need handheld makers to join together and make a case for better chips.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Steam Deck still starts at $399, even if the $529 OLED model is superior.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by The Verge</cite></p></div><p><h3>Price</h3></p><p>The PC industry also needs to cut prices if it wants a chance to eat Nintendo’s lunch.&nbsp;</p><p>The Nintendo Switch debuted at $299 in 2017 — around $380 in today’s money — and the OLED version arrived at $349 in 2021. A year later, Valve’s Steam Deck debuted at $399. But today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">the only Windows handheld gaming PC I can recommend</a> costs $799, roughly twice the price of an entry-level Deck, and most Windows handhelds have started at $600 and up. High-end options are great, but the space may remain niche without low-end options, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Only the least expensive model of Lenovo’s SteamOS variant of the Legion Go S <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">will lower that bar to $499</a> this May. And all of those prices are still more than Sony or Microsoft charges for a TV console with far more performance, and likely more than Nintendo will charge for the Switch 2.</p><p>I’m not sure what <em>exactly</em> PC makers would need to do to challenge the Switch on price, but it’s likely not simple. Valve CEO Gabe Newell <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-price-valve-gabe-newell-400-dollars-painful-but-critical">said it was “painful” but “critical”</a> to launch the Steam Deck at $399, hinting that the company may have followed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor_and_blades_model">razor-and-blades business model</a> where console makers initially sell hardware at a loss, then make the money back as people buy games. If so, that’s a tough act to follow, as no other PC maker controls the world’s largest PC games store and can afford to subsidize a handheld that way.</p><p>But not every console has been a loss leader: Nintendo reportedly never sold the Switch at a loss, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609150/sony-playstation-5-ps5-loss-profit">Sony stopped selling the PS5 at a loss</a> less than a year after its debut. So it’s possible to cut prices with the right bill of materials and economies of scale. Lenovo explicitly told me it worked with AMD on the Z2 Go chip to help lower the Legion Go S’s price, for example.</p><p>To compete with Nintendo, a company like Microsoft or Valve or even Sony needs to lead the charge, securing the components and offering the right operating system for dozens of true Switch competitors Imagine dozens of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339889/microsoft-xbox-handheld-windows-operating-system-changes-notepad">portable Xboxes</a> or PlayStations or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">Steam Machines</a>, instead of each PC maker marching to the beat of their own drum.</p><p>I think it’s time for an industry-wide push on handheld gaming. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23948529/nintendo-switch-steam-deck-handheld-consoles-gaming">It might be the future of gaming, period</a>. There’s too much at stake to tackle it one half-baked Windows handheld at a time. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I'll die on this hill, so let's dig in:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favourite Illustration Rares from Shrouded Fable</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/26/am-2x1-13-1737889637157.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty of illustration rares to catch in Shrouded Fable, but these are my favourites.

			<p>Ubisoft's President reportedly agreed to greenlight a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-enhanced-for-ps5-pro-runs-at-4k60-with-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> DLC, which would be funded by Savvy Games Group from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<h2>The Streets of Baghdad May Expand to New Content as Ubisoft Reportedly Agrees on DLC Development for Assassin's Creed Mirage</h2>
<p>Ubisoft's new installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise might not be the only thing fans will be receiving this year, as the company is rumored to expand the previous one. After more than a year since its launch, we are hearing that the <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> is getting its first-ever DLC.</p>
<p>This might be a bit surprising since <em>Assassin's Creed Shadow</em>s is very close to its launch, and getting DLC for the Mirage edition is a report that nobody saw coming. The Shadows will be launching on 20th March 2025, which is roughly two months from now, and the supposed DLC for the Mirage Edition is also coming this year.</p>
<p>The report comes from the French publication Les Echos via prominent AC leaker '<a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1882849239434232101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">j0nathan</a>'. The report suggests that after the visit to Saudi Arabia, Ubisoft's president, Yves Guillemot,&nbsp;<span>agreed to the DLC development for&nbsp;<em>AC: Mirage</em>, which Ubisoft wasn't initially </span>interested in. Ubisoft has partnered with Savvy Games, which will be a major contributor to this project.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Assassins-Creed-Mirage-Ray-Tracing-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The game was initially designed to be a DLC itself and was supposed to continue the Valhalla storyline, but eventually made it to the game market as an individual installment. The game launched in October 2023 but hasn't got a single DLC since that time. Therefore, it's quite a surprise since the launch of Shadows is pretty close.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it is still a rumor, and we still need official confirmation from Ubisoft about this matter. However, considering Odyssey got its crossover three years after its release, which was after the launch of Valhalla, the Mirage DLC doesn't look unfeasible. Still, there are not enough reports to confirm the news, and we have yet to hear about its exact launch date. Until then, stay tuned.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/optic-advice-play-fortnite-grinding-cod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98go-play-fortnite%E2%80%99-optic-methodz-gives-advice-to-young-players-grinding-cod.1092132/</guid>

<p>The Call of Duty esports scene isn’t in the best place, that much is for certain. In the last year or two, Activision has tried to shape up the ecosystem a little and has made some positive changes, but prize pools are getting lower, viewership has taken some hits, and Black Ops 6 is currently in the gutter – just a little bit.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, some of the most prolific OpTic personalities, including Scump, Methodz, and Crimsix, sat around the fireplace to talk about the state of COD esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-you-can-actually-make-money">‘You Can Actually Make Money’</h2>



<p>Scump dropped a bombshell (admittedly a somewhat obvious one) by stressing that if <strong>he </strong>were trying to become an esports pro all over again right now, he wouldn’t pick Call of Duty as his game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If I was an 18 year right now, or 16, or whatever age you’re starting in gaming and I was trying to pursue being a professional in a video game, Call of Duty would not even be on my radar.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Methodz echoed Scump’s sentiment, stressing that the Call of Duty scene’s minimum age requirement is too much of a blocker that’s potentially preventing young superstars from finding a spot in the CDL.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been saying to go play Fortnite.</p>



<p>I’m saying, listen bro – unfortunately… This is crazy to me, the age limit…</p>



<p>The fact it’s still an 18 age limit – I was a pro at 14. Like, there’s a lot of 14 to 18 year olds that would probably turn some heads that just can’t play. But I’m like, dude, if you’re 15, why the f*** would you be grinding COD?</p>



<p>Go play Fortnite, you can actually make money in that.</p>
</blockquote>











<p>In the current system, pro players can’t enter the Call of Duty League until they’re 18 years old. It’s not mirrored in every other esports title, of course. For instance, Counter-Strike’s ‘donk’ just turned 18 this weekend and spent the last year becoming known as one of the best players in the business, racking up some mind-boggling achievements in his debut year.</p>



<p>The OpTic guys say that there are so many competing titles in the esports space that Call of Duty shouldn’t even be on your list of potential targets. Do you agree? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
