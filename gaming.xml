		<p>Have you ever played Factorio and thought, “Hmmm… this could be so much more anime and cosy”? Well, if you have, then Little Rocket Lab is here for you, coming to PC, Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a> in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Rocket Lab - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sxL-Dro4pU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Little Rocket Lab takes the production line management sim and sends that conveyor belt in a different direction. You play as Morgan, an incredibly capable engineer who intends to build a rocket ship on the outskirts of her hometown. She’ll have to do so from scratch, starting off with small contraptions and working up to create sprawling automated production lines.</p>
<p>Thankfully most of the town seems to be quite supportive of this, in part because Morgan is more than happy to help people with their problems along the way. I’m just hoping there’s some kind of narrative undercurrent about keeping the whole rocket production under wraps and secret from the federal authorities and military, who would no doubt have something to say about this project.</p>
<p>It’s not all production lines, though, as you’ll also need to mine resources yourself, explore the region’s coasts, railyards, quarries and underground, and solve the problems of each of the town’s areas – the different areas feature electrical elements, water, cranes, furnaces, will nee automated robotics and crafting to overcome, and more.</p>

<p>Little Rocket Lab is in development by Kyle Schmitz, formerly of Ubisoft Winnipeg, who’s been working on the game for the last few years and now has the backing of indie publishing label No More Robots – somewhat ironic, given all the robots in the game…</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-combat-overview-for-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-released-breaks-down-enemies-weapon-types.1057329/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-combat-overview-for-assassins-creed-shadows-released-breaks-down-enemies-weapon-types/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just like the<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-releases-assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-gameplay-overview/"> last overview</a> Ubisoft released, it has now released a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/pt-br/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf/assassins-creed-shadows-combat-gameplay-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combat overview</a> for Assassin's Creed Shadows, which goes into detail about the different types of attack and defense you'll be able to use, as well as the enemies you'll encounter, and the different weapons you'll be able to use depending on which protagonist you play as. The full details of the combat overview have been posted on the official website of the game, where you'll be able to see tiny clips of the combat in action, showcasing both player and enemy attacks.</p>
<p>There are three main attack types that you will be able to utilize, regardless of whether you play as Yasuke or Naoe. As said on the website, "Remember that choosing to fight as Naoe or Yasuke - as well as your choice of weapon can alter these building blocks." While both characters will have access to Light, Heavy, and Posture attacks, it will vary for both characters depending on the weapon you choose to use. In the videos shown, the combat bears a resemblance to that of Ghost of Tsushima, where you will be able to put your enemy in a vulnerable state under certain conditions, such as a perfect dodge.</p>
<p>In Assassin's Creed Shadows, the ways to defend yourself have expanded, allowing you to Dodge, Parry, Deflect, or Block attacks. Yasuke has a slightly different Parry mechanic to Naoe, which will enable him to counterattack the enemy if he successfully parries the enemy. Naoe's deflect mechanic requires similar timing to that of the Parry, but the deflect changes the axis of combat, meaning that the enemy's flanks are exposed, but also puts Naoe in a vulnerable position if there are other enemies nearby.</p>
<p>"In essence, our core fight mechanics are the same for Yasuke and Naoe. But as a Samurai and Shinobi, respectively, they each have their own weapon types and abilities that make them feel very different from one another," says Charles Benoit, Game Director for Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>Naoe is more of an agile fighter who is quick on her feet and can assassinate enemies easily. However, when she comes up against more than one enemy, she is at a disadvantage, as she has significantly less armor and combat resources than Yasuke. In comparison, Yasuke is a strong warrior who can cut through his enemies with his combos. He will do significantly better against multiple enemies compared to Naoe.</p>
<p>The post also lists some of the attacks that you will have to be mindful of in Assassin's Creed Shadows, giving you advice on studying their attack patterns and tactics so that you can deal with combat, depending on what enemy you're up against.</p>
<p>As stated above, there are some little feature clips showcased in the post that show you some of the enemy attacks in action, as well as attacks from both Yasuke and Naoe.</p>

            <p>It seems as if every "wholesome" game is either a Stardewlike or a Animal Crossingbut. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/little-rocket-lab-is-a-factorio-and-stardew-valley-mashup-about-building-a-rocketship-in-a-cute-town">Little Rocket Lab</a>? Stardewlike. Piece By Piece? Animal Crossingbut. To be more specific, it's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a> but your chibi fox protagonist is specifically running a shop, mending and painting objects to sell while maintaining cleanliness and the plants outside. If you can't get enough of upcycling in Trash Goblin, here's one more for you.

<p>Counter to its cosy vibes, the press release threatens an iota of challenge to your management. "If you think this'll be a walk in the park, Piece by Piece is going to outfox you," it says. "Each day you'll need to tidy up your store, attend to anyone who needs help, then throw a bunch of stuff on sale and see if you can make a tasty profit. Being a good samaritan is great and all, but this fox needs to put food on the table!"
</p>
<p>I am betting I can't end up losing my shop to debt collectors, but maybe I'm wrong.
</p>
<p>I've whizzed through the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/wholesome-direct">Wholesome Snack</a> presentation tonight and written up this and three other stories, representing the most interesting news and games present at the show in my opinion. To cast some judgement across the field: these all seem like pleasant games which could be fun to play, but they're all so derivative, all of them riffing on the same two or three core concepts. It's faintly exhausting. Obviously other genres or tones of games do the same, but this is less "wow, there are a lot of games about shooting" and more "wow, there are a lot of games about shooting realistic weapons specifically, in a modern military setting, with a sniper mission in the desert." Even the dialogue boxes seem familiar.
</p><p>In a way "Animal Crossingbut" is the generous way to describe these games, because at least it requires a "but", suggesting some innovation. I'm not sure that's the case if I compare Piece By Piece to Trash Goblin (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2407830/Trash_Goblin/">on Steam</a> in Early Access) or any of the other shop sims in recent years.
</p>
<p>I hope I'm wrong. Piece By Piece is aiming for release in early 2025 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179050/Piece_by_Piece/">on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ooh, this feels like the biggest news out of this evening's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/wholesome-direct">Wholesome Snack</a> showcase: nourishing photography adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toem">Toem</a> is getting a sequel, appropriately called Toem 2. It looks to follow much of what made the first so well liked, including its pocket-sized black-and-white worlds in which you wander about, snapping photos and helping the locals.

<p>I know precious little about Toem 2 as I write this, hours in advance of the trailer's broadcast. I've got a single sentence description of the game, all the details of which I used in the opening paragraph. By the time you're reading this, however, you may be able to <a href="https://s.team/a/2900640">head to the Toem 2 Steam page</a> for more detail and screenshots.
</p>
<p>All I can tell you is that Alice B liked the original game a great deal for its straightforward pleasures. "It's just fun, isn't it? It's not groundbreaking, Toem, but it's somehow nostalgic and modern at the same time, a silly world that you can just enjoy, guilt-free," she wrote in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/toem-review">Toem review</a>. "No overwrought commentary on modern society. No hidden meaning. Occasionally some hidden socks, or ghosts you can only see when you're wearing magic sunglasses, yes. Mostly having fun and taking pictures. I was here, I played Toem. It was good."
</p>
<p>That's good enough for me. I like a spot of in-game photography and cute worlds where I can do favours for people, a la <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-short-hike">A Short Hike</a>. I really should get round to playing Toem.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can tell these were just added as each game’s release date says December 9, 2024. </p><p> Currently, Microsoft doesn’t support Steam and Game Pass account linking, so it would make sense for Microsoft to add <em>CoD </em>and its expansion to its own storefront if it wanted to add them to the PC Game Pass subscription service in the future. </p><p>Originally released in 2003, <em>Call of Duty </em>(and its expansion United Offensive) were never released on consoles. So unless Activision paid a studio to port these classic shooters to console, I doubt they end up on Game Pass for Xbox. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare-2007/9nfsz9cxljsn?activetab=pivot:overviewtab&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare-2007/9nfsz9cxljsn?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Modern Warfare</em></a></span>, released in 2007, was available on Xbox 360 and is backward compatible on Xbox One and Series X/S consoles, so perhaps it will be added to both Xbox and PC Game Pass. </p><p>Of course, it’s <em>also </em>possible that these games were just added to the PC store because Microsoft wants to bring more of its back catalog to its own platform. We’ll just have to wait and see. The Game Awards are happening later this week, perhaps an announcement will happen there? At this point, only Phil Spencer and Geof Keighley know for sure. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you're already sensing a farming theme in this year's Wholesome Snack showcase, you'd be right - and we're far from done.

It includes new crops, new animals, a new snowy maps where robots consume more biofuel, and a new character selling some handy new goods.

Made Up Games' Pine: A Story of Loss follows a grieving woodcutter as he attempts to rebuild his life after the death of his wife.

We've seen bits of Pine: A Story of Loss before, but it now has a release date: it's coming to Steam, Switch, iOS, and Android on 13th December.

<p>
Winter Burrows, a "woodland survival game" from developer Pine Creek Games, is leaning extra hard into the whole "cosy" thing. It puts players into the tiny shoes of a mouse who returns home to restore their burrow - turning into a toasty retreat from the snowy cold outside. To do that, they'll need to equip for adventure, explore by day and by night, build, make friends, cook and bake, and, of course, cosy up by the fire when the snow sets in. Winter Burrow launches for Steam next year.

<p>
Little Rocket Lab, from developer Teenage Astronauts, looks to have a little bit of everything. It's an isometric pixel art adventure with crafting, automation, and friendship-making that begins when aspiring young engineer Morgan returns to her childhood town of St. Ambrose, to help her aunt finish building the rocket her mother always dreamed of. It's coming to Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in 2025.

And if all this talk of building virtual friendships with NPCs doesn't appeal, how about with real people? That's the hook of Loftia, a "cosy, solarpunk, farming/life/social sim MMO" from developer Cloud Games. Player can farm together, visit each other's homes and neighbourhoods, create communities and host social events, all as they work toward building a sustainable city. Loftia is heading to PC, Mac, and Switch, and is aiming to launch into early access "late" next year.

If you've been wondering what Toukana Interactive, the studio behind the wonderful puzzler Dorfromatik, is up to, here's your answer. Star Birds is a "cheerful asteroid base-building and resource management game" that sees players venturing out across "countless" asteroids in order to create production networks and guide their colony of spacefaring avians to new horizons. And if that's tickled your tail-feather, it's launching into Steam early access in 2025.

What if village life sim, but train? That's the basic premise of Green Tile Digital's Locomoto. Here, you take charge of a "dream train" (whether that's a train made of literal dreams, or just a really desirable one is unclear) then renovate and decorate it in order to bring happiness to the animals that reside in the stations along its line. Fishing and farming also feature as your cross-country journey continues, with Locomoto currently set, appropriately enough, for Steam.

Naiad - a "relaxing, minimalist, and colourful adventure" about exploring a river from developer HiWarp - has been floating around indie showcase for a while now, but the wait is finally over. Players eager to don the guise of a water nymph and dive into its peaceful world - swimming, dashing, befriending animals, and restoring life through song - don't have to wait much longer. Naiad launches today for PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch - although it's worth noting European Switch owners won't get to play until 23rd December.

Ducklings are cute. Protect the ducklings! That's essentially the premise of A Waddleful Life, in which players become mama duck and guide their tiny charges from hatchlings to first flight. It's an adventure that unfolds in the safety of a small, quiet park - which players will need to explore as they forage for food and gather up sticks for stick-based amusements. A Waddleful Life doesn't seem to have a release date yet, but it's coming to PC.

Journey developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/thatgamecompany">thatgamecompany</a>'s acclaimed free-to-play "social adventure" Sky: Children of the Light has been doing its own thing for a little over five years now, transporting players across the seven realms of a beautiful kingdom located among the clouds. A big part of the experience is its regular seasonal content, and next up is an Alice in Wonderland-inspired collaboration that'll be running from 23rd December until 12th January next year. And you can see a little more of its whimsical treats in its newly released trailer above.

Okay, so how about this one: what if village life sim, but PINBALL? The excellently named Pinbleton Park from solo developer Turtlesoup Games is exactly that, challenging players to turn their cosy village into a giant pinball table. There'll also be neighbours to help and lost sprits to gather when Pinbleton Park launches for PC at some currently unspecified future time.

We've had our eyes on Julián Cordero and Sebastian Valbuena's dreamy Ecuadorian football adventure Despelote for a good long while now. This semi-autobiographical slice-of-life adventure about "childhood and the magical grip soccer held over the people of Quito, Ecuador in 2001" looks like an absolute treat, combining an  immediately arresting art style with some wonderfully laidback tunes. So first the bad news: Despelote won't make its previously announced 2024 release window. On the up side, it's now scheduled to release for Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in "early" 2025.

<p>
Sugardew Island island might be yet another farming sim on a list not exactly short of farming sims, but it does add a few wrinkles to the formula. For a start, you're not just running a farm, you're also managing your own farm shop - selling your lovingly prepared wares to the local population of Forest Folk and maybe even indulging in a spot of romance. The big departure from the norm, however, is Sugardew Island's "stress-free" promise. There's no in-game timer and its day/night cycle is turn-based, meaning you won't constantly feel rushed off your feet. And if that sounds intriguing, it's coming to PC, PlayStation, and Switch.

<p>
And finally, some exiting news from developer Something We Made: its acclaimed photography puzzler Toem is getting a sequel. Details are limited, but it looks like players can expect more quirky characters and chill beats as Toem's photographer protagonist sets off on a brand-new adventure about "uncovering hidden details, helping friends along the way, and documenting the world's little wonders". The most obvious change this time, is its art; the original's stylised blend of 2D elements and simple polygons has had a bit of a glow-up, retaining its black-and-white looks while embracing far more detailed 3D. Sadly, there's no word of a release date for Toem 2 yet, but we do know it's heading to PC.

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley">Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley</a> is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on 17th December, launching on the same day as a new Fuddler’s Courtship DLC.</p>
<p><iframe title="[ESRB] Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley – Fuddler’s Courtship &amp; Consoles | Coming 17th of Dec!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twB2woK3HKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley launched earlier this year, a wonderful adaptation of Tove Jansson’s enduring world and characters. Instead of following the Moomins themselves, it casts you instead as the carefree wanderer Snufkin, returning&nbsp;to Moominvalley in the spring, just as the Moomins are waking up from their winter hibernation, only to find that things have changed and that her best friend, Moomintroll, has gone missing. What was once an idyllic natural area, has been cut down in places, drained out, and transformed into more orderly parks. We can’t be having that, now, can we?</p>
<p>Whether you’re coming to the game new on PS5 and Xbox, or returning to it on Switch and PC,&nbsp;Fuddler’s Courtship will add a new pocket-sized adventure to the game, shifting the season to the autumn, and with the colour palette changing to match. This is a story of romance, as Fuddler needs some help from Snufkin and Moomintroll, diverting from their planned pre-winter camping trip with a chaotically romantic new journey.</p>

<p>Either way, this is a charming game and adaptation. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/05/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley-review/">our review</a>, Aran said, “Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley is a delightful game, which will please long time Moomin fans, and could introduce the characters to a new audience and generation. The game is wholesome, one for all ages, and addresses the issue of environmentalism in a careful and constructive way. It is definitely worth playing.”</p>

            <p>Duck Detective's first case was The Secret Salami, which paired its cosy mystery about stolen lunches with a protagonist whose divorce and destitution were played entirely straight despite his being a duck. The results were seemingly delightful, and here comes a sequel.
</p>
<p>Duck Detective: The Ghost Of Glamping will offer a further 2-3 hours of mystery-solving and is aiming for release in 2025.

<p>"This campsite might have ghosts, but the real thing haunting Eugene McQuacklin is his failed marriage and bread addiction," the press release says. A game like Duck Detective risks having only one joke ("What if a duck... was a detective?") but I confess I do not care because in this instance I like the joke. 
</p><p>McQuacklin is joined by a partner this time, but otherwise the facts of the case seem the same as his first outing: a 2-3 hour, fully-voiced mystery in which you have to find clues and fill-out madlibs-style descriptions of the crime. Alice B described it in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/15-steam-next-fest-demos-you-should-play-first-this-february">write-up of the first game's demo</a> as sort of "My First Golden Idol", and given how many people have been overwhelmed by the Golden Idol's recent sequel, maybe that's what we need right now. Developers Happy Broccoli themselves describe it as a "more humorous spin on deduction puzzlers like The Return Of The Obra Dinn."
</p>
<p>Ghost Of Glamping was announced as part of today's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/wholesome-direct">Wholesome Snack</a> stream alongside a spread of other similarly "cosy" games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

How did we end up with a full-length film about a hunter with daddy issues before Doctor Octopus, who has been terrorizing Spider-Man on film for 20 years, got a starring role? Why waste Donald Glover on a glorified Easter egg version of Prowler? Why are we acting like Kingpin doesn’t do more than fight the blind lawyer dressed up as a demon? We need answers, but we’ll take feature films instead.</p><p>To make our case, we’ve rounded up the nine best candidates for their own time in the spotlight, along with some ideas about what <em>kind</em> of genre movie they should star in.

An approach that leans into what Sam Raimi brought to the character in <em>Spider-Man 2</em> would work, which is to say, making him an aspirational scientist whose ambition goes past his reach, resulting in a flawed yet deeply human character.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="227e1eaf27f0e368f68ab89a39330631" data-recommend-id="image://227e1eaf27f0e368f68ab89a39330631" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Lizard yelling at Spider-Man" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Lizard yelling at Spider-Man" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="227e1eaf27f0e368f68ab89a39330631" data-recommend-id="image://227e1eaf27f0e368f68ab89a39330631" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Lizard yelling at Spider-Man" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Dr. Curt Connors’ story could come across a bit like the plot of <em>Morbius—</em>a tortured scientist is looking to science to fix a tragedy, only to have another tragedy befall him. There’s a way to play the story as a “creature feature” genre piece that mixes horror and pathos by having Connors be both Frankenstein and his misunderstood monster. Either way, it can’t be any worse than <em>Morbius</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="37fd90b0dae932b2d6ab271198706b72" data-recommend-id="image://37fd90b0dae932b2d6ab271198706b72" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mister Negative staring menacingly" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mister Negative staring menacingly" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37fd90b0dae932b2d6ab271198706b72" data-recommend-id="image://37fd90b0dae932b2d6ab271198706b72" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mister Negative staring menacingly" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Not dissimilar to Lizard’s, Mister Negative’s story is a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde situation that would naturally lend itself to a riff on that narrative format. Have Martin Li do good by day as the head of charity org Food, Emergency Aid, Shelter and Training (F.E.A.S.T.), and try to take over New York’s criminal underworld by night.

As one of the few female anti-heroes in the Spider-Man rogues’ gallery, this one feels like low-hanging fruit.

But the character is so much more interesting than the film made him seem. An ancient primordial deity, he’s one of Marvel’s most powerful villains, a being of pure evil. <em>Last Dance</em> saw him send some of his monsters after Venom, but what if his solo film focused on the Symbiotes and how they trapped him in the first place? Or an old cosmo society coming across him for the first time and having a horrific, <em>Alien</em>-like experience? Just make it scary as hell, and we’ll be in a good spot.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A handful of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CBNN7BP1,B0CZPM4KLZ,B0CBNQPBCY,B0CLYZD4X2,B0CLYZ1FCP,B0CBNPMX7P&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Studios PC games are discounted at Amazon</a> ahead of the holidays,<strong> all of which are offered as digital Steam keys</strong>--making this a great time to pile a few more games into your ever-growing Steam library. The only caveat? Most of these deals are exclusive to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Prime</a> members. Consider signing up to cash in on the deals, however, as you’ll also gain access to free shipping, the impressive Prime Video catalog, monthly free games via Prime gaming, and tons of other benefits.</p><p>The best deals in the bunch include <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBNN7BP1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sackboy: A Big Adventure</a> for $12.59 (was $60), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBNN7BP1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a> for $27 (was $60), and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/God-War-Standard-Online-Game/dp/B0CBNQPBCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">God of War</a> (2018) for just $20 (was $50).

For a jumpstart, consider springing for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HELLDIVERS-Standard-Online-Game-Code/dp/B0CLYZD4X2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Citizen Edition</a> that’s on sale for $48 (was $60).
