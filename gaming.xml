            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In retrospect, the emergence of the rhythm shooter as a genre, along with its kissing cousin the rhythm character action game, should have been obvious. Combining high-octane, fast-paced combat with the grace and stylishness of rhythm-action was something of a no-brainer, a sentiment with which Kwalee and Simon Fredholm's <i>Robobeat&nbsp;</i>clearly agrees.</p>
<p><em>Robobeat&nbsp;</em>is very much part of the lineage that also contains&nbsp;<em>BPM: Bullets Per Minute&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metal-hellsinger"><em>Metal: Hellsinger</em></a>, although it's far closer in execution to the former than the latter. Unlike <i>Hellsinger</i>, this is a rhythm roguelike through and through.</p>
<p>You play as robo-bounty hunter Ace, who's been dispatched to capture his latest target Frazzer. The only problem is that Frazzer is hiding in a labyrinth filled with traps, robot henchmen, and platforming challenges. That's bad news for Ace, but is&nbsp;<em>Robobeat&nbsp;</em>fun enough for it to be good news for you?</p>
<h2><em>Robobeat</em>'s Rhythm Combat Is Fun</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robobeat-review-combat.jpg?itok=r3vwGJrF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robobeat-review-combat.jpg?itok=XjF7Hco2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7208c5da-8509-4730-8e97-e823fee3ce5c" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robobeat-review-combat.jpg?itok=XjF7Hco2" alt="The player shooting at pink enemies in Robobeat" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Combat in&nbsp;<em>Robobeat&nbsp;</em>is pretty enjoyable.</figcaption></figure><p>Like its stablemates,&nbsp;<em>Robobeat&nbsp;</em>is built around shooting enemies to the beat of a variety of different songs. Each song has a different BPM, and the tempo of the song dictates both your own rate of fire and that of your enemies.</p>
<p>It's a clever and satisfying way to essentially bake difficulty into the core mechanics. Do you prefer your action slower and more methodical, or fast-paced and relentless? Simply choosing a faster or slower song will give you what you want in either case.</p>
<p>The core combat on offer here is addictive and satisfying. Taking enemies down with a series of well-timed shots before wall-running away from danger, spinning 360 degrees, and headshotting the final enemy in a room never stops feeling cathartic.</p>
<p>You'll face a decent variety of enemies over the course of your run, too, and they require different tactics to take down. Knights with shields must be leapt over or headshotted, for instance, while bomb-spewing turrets demand you take cover or dodge with perfect timing.</p>
<h2>Repetition in&nbsp;<em>Robobeat </em>Is a Problem</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robobeat-review-the-showman-boss.jpg?itok=l_tamEOW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robobeat-review-the-showman-boss.jpg?itok=UfZpcO3m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="015ecd35-e8e3-4bf3-b668-26f408a4691e" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robobeat-review-the-showman-boss.jpg?itok=UfZpcO3m" alt="The player fighting the Showman boss in Robobeat" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>You'll probably see this guy quite a lot.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, the same can't be said for&nbsp;<em>Robobeat</em>'s level variety. When the small handful of rooms I'd seen began to repeat themselves after just three or four hours with&nbsp;<em>Robobeat</em>, my heart sank. Sadly, the situation didn't improve over the ensuing hours, either.</p>
<p>Even when new rooms did appear, they were usually just fairly uninspired arrangements of geometric shapes. This meant that combat frequently devolved into running in a circle around each room rather than carefully judging and avoiding hazards.</p>
<p><em>Robobeat&nbsp;</em>offers a variety of weapons with which to take down your foes, but the repetition problem rears its ugly head here as well.</p>
<p>Many of the guns just flat out don't feel good to use. Some, like the flare gun or the default revolver, have a nice kick to them, but others feel like toy guns with minimal impact. Many also require a beat before they'll fire, which feels like it runs counter to the pulsing rhythm's immediacy.</p>
<p>New weapons can be unlocked as you fight through&nbsp;<em>Robobeat</em>'s samey labyrinths, but when the arrival of a new weapon is greeted with a groan and a prayer that it doesn't come up during subsequent runs, something has gone wrong.</p>
<h2>Music Is Great in&nbsp;<em>Robobeat</em>, But...</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robobeat-review-air-combat.jpg?itok=BIyXFb6- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robobeat-review-air-combat.jpg?itok=0fcLAlZ9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4bf0bf03-e660-4432-a331-2fd56d19249b" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robobeat-review-air-combat.jpg?itok=0fcLAlZ9" alt="The player shooting at enemies from the air in Robobeat" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption><em>Robobeat</em>'s soundtrack has a lot to offer, although you can't see it in screenshots, obviously.</figcaption></figure><p>Thankfully, although&nbsp;<em>Robobeat</em>'s gameplay is repetitive and its weapons aren't great, its soundtrack makes up for these deficiencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's nothing particularly innovative; you'll fight to pulsing '80s disco tunes, heavier rock numbers, and even an electro-swing song, which feels like the undeniable highlight of the soundtrack. Smashing your way through&nbsp;<em>Robobeat</em>'s rooms while a propulsive big band-esque song plays in the background never gets old.</p>
<p>I'm still waiting for a rhythm game that features songs with strange time signatures (or even anything other than common time), but I'm assuming this is an extraordinarily difficult programming challenge, so I'll let&nbsp;<em>Robobeat&nbsp;</em>off on that one.</p>
<p>My issue with&nbsp;<em>Robobeat</em>'s soundtrack is that although the individual songs are solid, there's no sense of progression or escalation, and that's down to the fact that&nbsp;<em>Robobeat&nbsp;</em>lets you choose your song on the fly.</p>
<p>This isn't a bad idea in concept; you can scale the speed up or down depending on how you're doing on any given run, and if the vibe changes, you can switch the song up to match it.</p>
<p>However, it does also mean that&nbsp;<em>Robobeat</em>'s moments of natural escalation, like bosses or particularly difficult rooms, fail to land. Even the climactic final boss fell flat because I forgot to change the song, meaning I was fighting him to exactly the same song I'd been hearing for the whole run.</p>
<p>Music in games is a powerful force. See&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hi-fi-rush"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a>'s excellent Nine Inch Nails-soundtracked finale for the right way to implement music as a narrative climax.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Robobeat&nbsp;</em>can't match those pyrotechnics, so while its songs are great, you'll have to do the work yourself if you want a proper sense of buildup and release.</p>
<p>There's also a music importing feature, allowing you to play to custom tracks, but it didn't work well for me. I tried three songs: Radiohead's "Bodysnatchers", Nine Inch Nails' "With Teeth", and Kendrick Lamar's "i".&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Bodysnatchers" and "With Teeth" didn't work at all;&nbsp;<em>Robobeat&nbsp;</em>couldn't figure out their BPM or where the first beat fell, so playing to them felt awkward and stilted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"i" fared better, but after a minute or so, the beat&nbsp;<em>Robobeat&nbsp;</em>had allocated to the song didn't match its actual rhythm. Until this is fixed, you'll get your money's worth from the built-in soundtrack.</p>
<h2><em>Robobeat</em>'s Difficulty Is Weird</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robobeat-review-the-mask-boss.jpg?itok=YQmr0iWH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robobeat-review-the-mask-boss.jpg?itok=GpbxNfx3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4b452ba5-f129-4496-9a04-ea24a1288857" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robobeat-review-the-mask-boss.jpg?itok=GpbxNfx3" alt="The player shooting at the Mask boss in Robobeat" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Can you spot the boss' health bar? No? I'm not surprised.</figcaption></figure><p>Over the course of&nbsp;a run in&nbsp;<em>Robobeat</em>, you'll have several different ways of augmenting your abilities. Weapons have abilities, for instance; you might restore health on a successful hit, or a weapon might set an enemy on fire, causing them to take damage over time.</p>
<p>Like the weapons themselves, some of these abilities feel absolutely essential, while others feel so pointless and vestigial that you may as well ditch a run and start again if you get them on your first weapons.</p>
<p>Similarly, runs offer the chance to augment yourself with card-based abilities. These feature bonuses like increased movement speed, an added fire effect to all weapons, or the ability to fire both weapons at once.</p>
<p>Again, the cards feel wildly uneven. Some, like a higher jump after a slide, felt laughably useless, while others, like the aforementioned dual-fire bonus, felt like they completely broke a run in two.</p>
<p>This being a roguelike, it's also largely random which of these abilities you'll unlock, so some runs can just feel outright cursed as you throw away veritable treasure troves of useless plastic weapons, looking for the one that will work for you.</p>
<p>When you do find your golden build (for me, it was a flare gun paired with a pistol that dealt extra damage to burning enemies),&nbsp;<em>Robobeat&nbsp;</em>finally feels like it finds its groove, and the combat, which gets annoyingly bullet hell-esque when the difficulty ramps up, clicks.</p>
<p>Balancing&nbsp;<em>Robobeat</em>'s weapons wouldn't have helped with its boss fights, though.</p>
<p>While the designs of the bosses are fun and interesting, they have limited move sets, which means that once you've worked out how to dodge their three or four more dangerous moves, boss fights usually devolve into the same tedious circle-running as standard rooms do.</p>
<p>Towards the end of&nbsp;<em>Robobeat</em>, bosses become absolutely insane damage sponges, too.</p>
<p>One late-game boss took an absolute age to take down because of his monstrous health bar, but the fight wasn't engaging or tense; I'd already worked out his patterns, so it just felt like repeating a menial action until it became routine.</p>
<p>This isn't helped by bizarre UI design that makes boss health bars pretty much impossible to see, so I could barely even discern whether I was taking any health away from him (or any boss) at all.</p>
<h2><em>Robobeat&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robobeat-review-ray-punk-boss.jpg?itok=P8w57CwN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robobeat-review-ray-punk-boss.jpg?itok=sK68WzQ0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="fb14b7e1-5258-4a3c-9b5c-05673275ce2b" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robobeat-review-ray-punk-boss.jpg?itok=sK68WzQ0" alt="The player fighting the Ray Punk boss in Robobeat" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>I wish my name was Ray Punk.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Robobeat&nbsp;</em>has rock-solid rhythm-action shooting and a great soundtrack to go with it, and that may well be enough to make you look past its foibles.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, foibles there very much are. Boring level design, strange difficulty spikes, and uneven weapon and ability balancing mean that&nbsp;<em>Robobeat&nbsp;</em>frustrates more often than it delights.</p>
<p>There's a great rhythm shooter in here, and perhaps with a little more work to bring it to life,&nbsp;<em>Robobeat</em>'s song would be clearer. Sadly, it can't quite compete with better entries in its genre. It'll take more chops than this to out-solo&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bpm-bullets-per-minute-review"><em>BPM: Bullets Per Minute</em></a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="x5VY3j">Every monster needs an origin story. Here’s mine.</p>
<p id="h4OQUE">I was born with a rare condition — radioulnar synostosis — which restricts the movement of my forearms. I am unable to turn my hands over palms up, the way you might accept loose change or splash water on your face or land an uppercut. I have lived with this condition all my life, and yet it wasn’t until my late 20s that I started referring to myself as “disabled.”</p>
<p id="CRMXN5">This word carries immense baggage, and many of us within the wide spectrum of disability tend to minimize our experiences or, as in my case, suffer from feelings of impostor syndrome. <em>Could be worse</em>, I often tell myself. <em>You don’t deserve to call yourself disabled</em>.</p>
<p id="ZNgORg">Coming to terms with my disability took a long time, to not only accept my identity, but also to discard the lingering shame and stigma that coincide with being disabled. A major part of this reconciliation was thanks to an unlikely source of solace — horror films.</p>
<p id="rUdq8O">I’ve been a horror obsessive as long as I can remember, but I only recently figured out how to articulate <em>why</em> the genre resonates so strongly with me. On-screen depictions of deformed, disfigured killers and creatures serve as reflections of my own otherness. The phantasmagoric realm of horror, though dark and violent, provides an outlet for me to express the discomfort, frustration, and anxiety surrounding my corporeal limitations.</p>
<p id="fzEk5Y">From a young age, I subconsciously related to monsters, madmen, and every combination thereof. Many even taught me to frame disability in a positive fashion. The archetypal antagonists from the golden age of horror cinema — the Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein’s monster — all underwent a transformation to be imbued with extraordinary, otherworldly gifts. Their differences were a source of power, inverting the traditional view of disability as a hindrance, a burden.</p>

<p id="TNGqmX">My attraction to horror began innocently enough. There were clamshell VHSes galore at my babysitter’s house, including all the Disney classics, many of which were plenty horrific, like the “Night on Bald Mountain” sequence in <em>Fantasia</em>. I carefully studied the imposing figure of Chernabog, the winged, devil-horned demon summoning lost souls from the underworld. To me, he seemed benevolent rather than evil, a counterpoint to the sparkling sunrise that banishes him back to the shadows, an essential element of natural balance.</p>
<p id="Up9i6n">Disney’s version of “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” oddly lumped as a double feature with <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>, presented another kindred spirit — the Headless Horseman. Decked in black and adorned with a blood-red cape, clutching a saber in one hand and a flaming jack-o’-lantern in the other, the Headless Horseman, for me, came to represent the extreme limits of human endurance. A cannonball takes the ill-fated soldier’s head and still his body lingers, perseveres.</p>
<p id="kKiMUd">Another seminal gateway wasn’t even a horror film. On its surface, <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> is a saccharine Technicolor musical romp, but the dream world its characters inhabit is full of menace — maniacal flying monkeys, spear-wielding Winkie guards, and my favorite, the iconic Wicked Witch of the West. Despite her green flesh and pointy chin, I found her beautiful, alluring, and endlessly more compelling than the picture-perfect Glinda. Astride her broomstick, flinging fireballs, stalking Dorothy and her companions through Oz, the Wicked Witch became the reason I watched an old tape of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> so many times that the reel snapped.</p>

<p id="hGuazr">As she pointed toward the camera with her spindly fingers and sharp nails, I imagined the Wicked Witch was singling me out, inviting me into her world. There, everyone was different, from the Munchkins, notably played by a cast of dwarf actors, to the main trio of the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion, who were all “defective” in their own ways, physically and mentally handicapped by the absence of some critical inner faculty. Why Dorothy was so desperate to return to the bleak, monochromatic reality of Depression-era Kansas was beyond me. I would have much preferred to stay in Oz.</p>
<p id="q2V62Y">By the time I finished elementary school, my tastes sharpened, and I craved harder, more acidic fare. My appetite had been steadily whet by a diet of gory comic books and yellowed Stephen King paperbacks. Cable television in the ’90s was also rife with kindertrauma-inducing spectacle. I was allowed to watch <em>Are You Afraid of the Dark?</em> and <em>Goosebumps</em>, since both were on kid-friendly channels. When left unsupervised, which was often as the child of a single mom who had to work multiple gigs, I could sneak episodes of <em>Tales from the Crypt</em> or <em>X-Files</em>. I knew there was a world of adult horror, and I wanted nothing more than to breach this forbidden zone.</p>

<p id="oMDi5q">I caught glimpses of it at the video rental store, where I was compulsively drawn to the horror section. I scanned the shelves, memorizing titles for future reference, studying the macabre cover art, scrutinizing the stills of sliced throats, hacked limbs, and oozing ectoplasm. Although I wasn’t allowed to take home anything rated R, I soon found loopholes that granted me access to films I was desperate to ingest.</p>
<p id="RkYWfp">Staying over at a friend’s house, we would wait until the grown-ups were asleep, then flip to HBO (a luxury we could not afford at my own home). It was there I first watched <em>The Evil Dead</em>, a personal landmark of my initiation into splatter flicks. My friend and I insisted we weren’t scared, as we cowered in our sleeping bags, squealing with perverse delight when the first possessed teenager stabbed her friend in the ankle with a pencil. We chattered throughout the movie to compensate for our obvious nerves, but by the time Ash Williams descended into the cellar searching for shotgun shells with a ravenous Deadite on the loose, the two of us had gone mute with fear.</p>

<p id="XHAHln">Ash, armed with his trademark chainsaw, was clearly the hero (and himself destined to become an amputee in the sequel), but it was the Deadites who entranced me. When the demons seized control, the bodily degradation took effect. First, the teenagers’ eyes went white, and before long, their flesh wrinkled, turned sallow, decayed, bile and pus dripping from spontaneous lacerations. I had never witnessed anything so utterly bloodsoaked, resplendent in viscera, a film that relished in the ways a body can be corrupted.</p>
<p id="CZzZxW">Bodies are frightfully fragile, and we are all one small step away from an accident or illness that can permanently debilitate. Few filmmakers understand the body’s capacity for biological horror more than <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23139794/david-cronenberg-best-body-horror-movies-history-analysis-crimes-of-the-future">David Cronenberg</a>, whose oeuvre introduced me to a world where disability is infused with latent eroticism and regenerative potential.</p>
<p id="iHpWlV">In high school, I got a job at the same video rental store I prowled as a kid. Now I had the freedom to take home whatever I pleased. The older guys who managed the shop would recommend titles to test my limits — <em>Salò</em>, <em>Cannibal Holocaust</em>, <em>Irreversible</em>. Cocksure teenager that I was, enduring “the most fucked up movie ever made” became my solemn quest. But disturbing or violent as they may be, few video nasties were capable of truly scaring me. Knowing I was a devotee of both horror and sci-fi, one of the clerks suggested I check out Cronenberg, so I took a chance on <em>The Brood</em>.</p>

<p id="YuyVHf">I was deeply unsettled by the story of an estranged couple fighting over custody of their daughter. What frighted me wasn’t the deformed, dwarflike progeny — birthed by the ex-wife and telekinetically driven to brutally murder anyone who crossed her. The broodlings were devoted to their mother, as was I, and would do anything to protect her. What shook me was Cronenberg’s metaphorical treatment of divorce, especially after watching my own parents’ messy split. The rupturing of a family resulting in physiological consequences illustrated the link between body and mind, a relationship of which I was all too aware, having dealt with depression as long as I could remember.</p>
<p id="0Y11YJ">For many people with disabilities, physical and mental anguish are synonymous, feeding into one another. Feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and alienation frequently accompany disability. More often than not, disability is chronic, permanent, and insoluble. It can be mitigated, people can adapt, but full-blown cures are elusive. My disability is one such case. I may have accepted this reality, come to terms with my fate, but the journey has not been without frustration, anger, and despair — the monster’s currency.</p>
<p id="YAfbB5">This explains in part why monsters act as they do. Pain begets pain. Violence begets violence. Fear begets fear. As such, the monster embodies the way we perpetuate trauma, wherein the victim becomes the aggressor. This is why we sympathize with Frankenstein’s monster or the Wolfman, because we understand that they were not born to be monsters — they were made that way by forces beyond their control.</p>

<p id="OHRiFa">Which is precisely why I cannot totally fault my all-time favorite Lovecraftian abomination, the titular Castle Freak from Stuart Gordon’s low-budget opus, another film I chanced upon at the video rental store. The freak is imprisoned from childhood by his deranged mother, routinely tortured until his face and body are a tapestry of grotesque wounds and scars. He escapes the confines of his dungeon and spies on the American family who has moved into his home, taking a special liking to the couple’s blind daughter.</p>
<p id="sCOkTa">While the freak wastes no time eviscerating unlucky victims, the lecherous, alcoholic father, played by the incomparable Jeffrey Combs, is no less redeemable. The freak’s feral nature is the byproduct of a lifetime’s abuse. The father, by contrast, has no excuse. Watching this film for the first time, I empathized with the freak and thought of <em>my</em> innate freakishness and the times I’ve lashed out or been cruel. What was my excuse?</p>
<p id="FR010m">Even as the maimed, distorted bodies of creatures like the Castle Freak or the Brood or the Deadites or the Wicked Witch mirrored real-world disabilities and offered me an escape, a safe environment where it was appropriate to root for the villain, I realized that I didn’t want to hurt people, to injure others as I’d been, whether physically or mentally. And more than anything, I was determined not to use my disability as a scapegoat, to behave like a monster and blame it on the way I was born.</p>
<p id="9zoOcd">Strange as it sounds, I learned to take ownership of my mistakes and embrace my faults through horror films, to forgo hiding behind a mask like the boogeymen in slasher movies. Horror demands that we not avert our gaze from “abnormal” bodies. It challenges our prejudices, our preconceptions. These are films that celebrate disfigurement and deformity instead of shunning it. I reject the notion that horror merely co-opts disability as a cheap scare tactic. When I watch a scary movie, I do not see exploitation — I see exaltation, the disabled not as demonic but as divine. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-team-apologizes-for-restricting-criticism.869115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1789895401723822410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent post</a> on Twitter late yesterday, the Marvel Rivals dev team apologized for its divisive contract that restricted criticism during its closed alpha test.</p>



<p>Players included in the closed alpha quickly noticed that the agreement terms denied disparaging comments. Despite some decent word of mouth surrounding Marvel Rivals, these terms quickly drew backlash.</p>



<p>Now, the dev team issued an official apology for “any unpleasant experiences or doubts” and “confusion, suspicion, and frustration.”  </p>



<p>NetEase also reports that they are working on revisions to provide creators with “less restrictive and more Creator-friendly” terms. They refer to “miscommunication” in the terms, and most fans seem relieved by the devs’ swift response.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dear Marvel Rivals players,</p><p>Today is the third day of the Closed Alpha Test, and we are truly grateful for all the love and support from the community.</p><p>We would like to take this opportunity to address the concerns we’ve seen regarding the agreement terms of Content Creator…</p></div>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1789895401723822410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Today’s post goes on to invite honest feedback and sincere thoughts. It acknowledges that “all feedback, positive and negative, ultimately helps us.” Now that closed alpha players will give Marvel Rivals honest criticism, fans will get a better idea of what to expect.</p>



<p>Although the Marvel Rivals closed alpha only began on May 10, its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/39-marvel-rivals-characters-found-from-closed-alpha-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full character roster</a> leaked online last week.  Data mining revealed 39 popular characters, many of which were not officially announced yet. </p>



<p>Soon after, fans also got a look at some leaked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals gameplay</a>, which then revealed a variety of character abilities. </p>



<p>At this time, NetEase has not confirmed a release date or window for Marvel Rivals. But the closed alpha test does give fans an idea of the development timeline.</p>

Officially known today as PUBG: Battlegrounds, the battle royale that birthed a frenzied race to dominate the genre is looking to its storied past unlike ever before. From May 14-28 on PC, and May 23-June 6 on consoles, the original version of Erangel, the game's first and, to this day, most beloved map, will be free for all players.</p><p dir="ltr">It seems the battle royale genre is now old enough to elicit nostalgia among its players as PUBG is not the first to do this--Fortnite OG saw the game's original map return for a few weeks at the end of 2023, and the original versions of Call of Duty and Apex Legends' oldest maps have returned at different times over recent years, too.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> PUBG | Erangel Classic Returns</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">We caught up with PUBG: Battlegrounds' in-game production director, Taehyun Kim, to learn what the team hopes to achieve with Erangel Classic, how it balances nostalgia with quality-of-life improvements, and whether any other map might enjoy a similar blast from the past. He also offered tips to new players who may jump in with the odds stacked against them as they stare down level-500 veterans.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: The team is reversing the clock with Erangel Classic. Can you talk about how long this idea has been in development and what you hope players get out of it?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Taehyun Kim</strong>: The idea of designing Erangel Classic is relatively recent; we started its design five months ago. As developers, we think the current gameplay with seven years of refinement is as good as the old experience. Erangel Classic isn't necessarily about offering a completely new experience. Instead, we hope those who enjoyed the old PUBG: Battlegrounds and those who enjoy the current one can both reminisce about the past and make new memories with this update.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>The battle royale space has long been full of games inspiring each other. How much did 2023's "Fortnite OG" event affect Erangel Classic? Did you take any lessons away from it, in terms of what to do or not to do with your own nostalgic event?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Erangel Classic wasn't inspired by specific games. Instead, the idea came about during a coffee break when some of our team members said they miss the old PUBG: Battlegrounds and want to play in the old Erangel map. That's where we started. The initial idea was simply to provide a gameplay experience in the old Erangel map, but it eventually evolved into the current Erangel Classic after further refinement and development.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you envision any Erangel Classic features sticking around after the event? Personally, I'm partial to the gloomy weather.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">There are no plans at the moment.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Erangel Classic revives some "charmingly tacky" features, to borrow your own words, like the old UI font and the availability of clothing as pick-ups around the map. Was there any internal conflict or indecision regarding bringing back these features, which are nostalgic but also not necessarily helpful?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The UI has been improved in a way that is more helpful gameplay-wise through a lot of internal reviews and discussions. It wasn't an easy choice for us to bring back the less-convenient UI when we already have this advanced version. However, we decided to go ahead with it since we also have cherished memories about the old Erangel and tried hard to recapture the feel and experience from the old PUBG: Battlegrounds.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Erangel in any of its forms is my personal favorite PUBG map. In your own words, what makes the original Erangel map so iconic?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Erangel is PUBG: Battlegrounds' first map, which provided the first experience of the BR genre to many players leaving them with cherished memories. Featuring various terrain types from cities and farms to forests and hills, the map supports all kinds of combat styles. This terrain diversity allows players to develop various tactics and enjoy strategic gameplay whether it's thrilling stealth maneuvers or fast-paced assaults. These characteristics make the game more fun and engagingly challenging, which is why Erangel is considered one of the most iconic maps in the entire [battle royale] genre, not just in PUBG: Battlegrounds.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you envision running any other nostalgia-themed events like this with other maps? Do players have the same affection for any other maps?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We don't have specific plans yet. Erangel is where many of our fans met PUBG: Battlegrounds for the first time, and they vividly remember significant moments like their first chicken dinner they had in the map. These memories are what endear Erangel to our fans. Other maps, meanwhile, have their own unique charms and features, leading to varied preferences among players on them based on their tastes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

480w">     </a>   </p>  </figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>With modern mechanics like ledge-grabs now being applied to a map that previously didn't feature them, has the team found any specific areas of the map in which players may have a drastically different experience, such as reaching new heights that were once unavailable?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We optimized the shape of buildings and collisions for parkour and ledge-grabs in Erangel Classic. Some buildings have a slight difference in their forms or placement, but their climbable heights remain similar compared to the current Erangel. However, you will need to be more careful when traveling around rocky mountains or Stalber since mountain areas are now much higher in Erangel Classic.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>For players who never played on the original Erangel, how do you suggest they approach this massive map, considering they may be going up against some seasoned veterans? What tips or landing spots might you offer as advice?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Erangel went through a lot of changes with the Remaster, but the core gameplay didn't change. Erangel Classic has a simpler layout compared to the current version of the map. It has more flat fields, more rugged mountains, and fewer towns and buildings, meaning that you should be more strategic about where to loot. Also, there's no guaranteed vehicle spawn, so quickly finding a vehicle early in the game is important. In areas like Sosnovka Military Base, you should be especially careful; the absence of catwalks and ferries makes you more vulnerable to attacks on the bridge, like in the past.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Erangel Classic kicks off this week, May 14 on PC, and next week, May 23, on Xbox and PlayStation platforms. Ahead of the event, you can watch a short film, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huwYjpXfyA0&amp;ab_channel=PUBG%3ABATTLEGROUNDS">The PUBG Paradox</a>, on YouTube, starring PUBG: Battlegrounds pros Sshroud and WackyJacky101.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Square Enix is rebooting itself, "aggressively" pursuing a multiplatform strategy that includes PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, and PC in the process. This comes from the company's latest financial earnings<a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592661.pdf"> report</a>, which details Square Enix's three-year reboot plan for long-term growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Within that three-year reboot plan, <strong>Square Enix lists four pillars</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Enhance productivity by optimizing the development footprint in the Digital Entertainment (DE) segment</li>
	<li>Diversify earnings opportunities by strengthening customer contact points</li>
	<li>Roll out initiatives to create additional foundational stability</li>
	<li>Strike a balance between shareholder return and growth investment when allocating capital&nbsp;</li>
</ul><article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="03456771-d8cd-4746-a001-88b0e4c14390" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]"><div>
      
            <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/05/13/622cbe3f/se.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt=""></p>
      
  </div>





</article><p>As part of this plan, Square Enix "will aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs," according to the financial <a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf">report</a>. "Especially, in regards to major franchise and AAA titles including catalog titles, it will build an environment where more customers can enjoy these titles," it continues, possibly alluding to multiplatform releases for future Final Fantasy games and more.</p>

<p>This strategy switch-up follows reports that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, a PlayStation 5-exclusive RPG that launched in February underperformed; Final Fantasy VII Rebirth followed in the footsteps of its predecessor, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake/final-fantasy-vii-remake-review-old-friends-and-new-life">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, which launched exclusively on PlayStation 4 in 2020, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, which hit PS5 last year (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/11/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-version-in-final-stages-of-optimization-expect-a-demo-before">although it's set to release on PC sometime in the future</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Square Enix also says it will "devise a platforms strategy for SD [Smart Devices/PC Browser portfolio] that includes not only iOS and Android, but also the possibility of PC launches. It continues, "Furthermore, the Group will strive to maximize the acquisition of new users when launching a title and that of recurring users after starting management of game operation."&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-qk4TDTo0-E" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Throughout the financial report, Square Enix uses the word "fun" as a focal point for the future development of its games. It says it wants to focus on the development of titles "delivering 'fun' that only [Square Enix] can create and build."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In terms of numbers, Square Enix's net sales are up 3.8% year-over-year at $2.28 billion this year, with digital entertainment sales up 2.5% at $1.59 billion. However, its operating income – $209 million – is down nearly 27%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These numbers and subsequent strategy shift aren't surprising, considering at the end of April, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/30/square-enix-has-seemingly-canceled-some-games-in-an-effort-to-be-more-selective-and">Square Enix canceled some of its in-development games</a> to be "more selective and focused," which lines up with its new philosophy. This likely means we'll be seeing more titles like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/dragon-quest-xi-echoes-of-an-elusive-age/relying-on-the-past#:~:text=The%20plot%20isn't%20groundbreaking,on%20the%20path%20to%20help.">Dragon Age XI</a>, Final Fantasy XVI, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on various platforms and less games like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/foamstars">Foamstars</a> and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/the-diofield-chronicle">The DioField Chronicle</a>. Only time will tell, though, and Square Enix thinks it will take three years for this company reboot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Unless you were living under a rock in 2018, you wouldn’t have been able to miss the phenomenon that was <em>Bird Box</em> on Netflix. The movie, starring Sandra Bullock as the wishes-she-were-blind main protagonist, was based on a book of the same name by author <a href="https://darkregions.com/en-gb/search?type=product&amp;q=josh%20malerman*" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Malerman</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true">Here’s the TLDR; the world suddenly becomes host to some form of Creature, one which remains unseen by the audience, which drives people insane, suicidal, and homicidal when sighted. Malorie, having given birth and also all but adopted another child on the same day (hats off to her, honestly) during this crisis, raises the two children and then takes a blindfolded trip down a river to what she hopes is safety.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">The movie doesn’t actually tell us much about the Creatures, leaving it all up to the imagination, which is arguably part of the reason that the movie became as huge as it did. However, as I said, the movie is based on a book (<em>Bird Box</em>, 2014) by Josh Malerman. There’s also a direct sequel novel, <em>Malorie</em>, which was published in 2019 (and is absolutely not based in Barcelona).&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="664" data-injectable="true">So, like the ever-diligent researcher I am, I watched the movie (twice), ordered both books and read them in the space of a single weekend to try and figure out some facts about the Creatures. This information is mostly from the books, and there’s some interesting discoveries.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">A word of warning, this will feature a lot of spoilers, particularly from <em>Malorie</em>. There’s some parts of the movie which were heavily changed from the source material, too, so if anything here doesn’t quite make sense in relation to the movie – that’s why.</p> <h2 id="h-they-re-described-as-infinity" data-injectable="false">They’re described as infinity</h2> <figure data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bird-Box-tom.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Tom in the Bird Box movie" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bird-Box-tom.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bird-Box-tom.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bird-Box-tom.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bird-Box-tom.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">This is alluded to in the first book, when Tom is describing what the previous owner of the house, George, saw before he took his own life after seeing one. However, the theme returns much more heavily in <em>Malorie</em>. Without going into too much detail, the concept is that they are something we are incapable of comprehending, and that itself drives us insane.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">As Gary says in the second book, imagine growing up with no knowledge of the existence of Whales. Seeing one, so huge and daunting, would be enough to cause a crack in anyone’s idea of reality.</p>
 <h2 id="h-some-people-are-immune-to-them" data-injectable="false">Some people are immune to them</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-girl.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Olympia (the child) in Bird Box, then known as simply 'Girl'" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-girl.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-girl.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-girl.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-girl.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="528" data-injectable="true">In the second book, <em>Malorie</em>, it’s revealed that Olympia (the child) is immune to the effects of the Creatures, likely due to Olympia (the mother) seeing one while the baby was still attached to her by the umbilical cord.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">This means that, for her entire life, Olympia (the child) has been able to traverse without a blindfold, looking directly at the Creatures without any form of madness taking over. This explains the very bizarre moments in the movie which are never explained, and also alludes to a genetic component, which gives hope for the future of humanity in the story’s universe.</p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">Some people are also immune based on their level of comprehension. This would explain why people with mental illnesses who have a hallucination symptoms can view them without being driven insane – they’re already used to seeing things that they can’t explain, so why would this be any different?</p>
 <h2 id="h-they-re-capable-of-growth-and-reproduction" data-injectable="false">They’re capable of growth and reproduction</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/malorie-pregnant.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Malorie pregnant, before the Creatures arrived in Bird Box" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/malorie-pregnant.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/malorie-pregnant.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/malorie-pregnant.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/malorie-pregnant.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">Perhaps ‘reproduction’ is the wrong word. There are multiple instances in the second book where the Creatures are described as “not necessarily taller than they were before, but wider”, and we’re informed as readers that there are three times as many of them as there were during <em>Bird Box</em>.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false">With <em>Malorie </em>being set approximately 12 years after <em>Bird Box</em>, this seems to mean that the Creatures are either multiplying, or more of them are arriving from whence they came.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-despite-the-effect-they-have-on-humans-they-re-not-violent" data-injectable="false">Despite the effect they have on humans, they’re not violent</h2> <figure data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-lydia.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="The effect of the Creatures in Bird Box" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-lydia.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-lydia.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-lydia.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-lydia.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">The only cases of purposeful attacks on humans are recorded as having happened in densely populated areas that already had an abnormally high prevalence of violent crime, which says to me that the Creatures were either trying to defend themselves, or they were a scapegoat for other violent acts. As stated in <em>Malorie</em>, “There are no verifiable accounts of a Creature forcing a person to look at it”.</p>
 <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">No, rather than attacking humans, the Creatures seem to be on Earth more as observers. In the second book, after it’s revealed that Olympia can view them safely, it’s also revealed that multiple creatures have been living alongside Malorie and the kids in the lodge which became their home. Never attacking, never harming, simply watching. Often, the Creatures seem to shy away from human contact as much as we avoid contact with them.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-they-congregate-in-densely-populated-areas-such-as-indian-river" data-injectable="false">They congregate in densely populated areas, such as Indian River</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/indian-river.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Indian River, a key location in the second Bird Box novel, Malorie" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/indian-river.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/indian-river.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/indian-river.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/indian-river.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="751" data-injectable="true">The eventual destination of the second book, Indian River, is densely populated by a group of people who are trying to find a method to safely look at the creatures while avoiding madness in the hopes of returning to some form of pre-creature normalcy. While traveling on the Blind Train (yes, that’s a thing), the owner tells Malorie that there are far more Creatures surrounding Indian River than in any other location in the length of Michigan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">Perhaps this goes hand in hand with the previous fact, that the Creatures are here to observe and are drawn to bigger populations, which would also explain why cities were affected first in the first place.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-you-don-t-hear-them-move-you-hear-the-world-move-around-them" data-injectable="false">You don’t hear them move, you hear the world move around them</h2> <figure data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-greg.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Greg viewing the Creatures on CCTV in Bird Box" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-greg.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-greg.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-greg.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-greg.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="113" data-current-count="113" data-injectable="false">In the second book, <em>Malorie</em>, there is a list of things that are known about the Creatures. Here’s what it says:</p> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false">“They make noise, though not traditional sound. There is no flat-footed creak upon floorboards. Rather, it’s as if the floorboards themselves momentarily morph before returning to their natural state”.</p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">This suggests that rather than hearing the movement of the Creatures, you hear the world around them adapt to their presence. The grass crunches under their feet, if they have any, rather than the sound of that foot stepping down onto the grass.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-they-aren-t-evolving-though-people-once-thought-they-were" data-injectable="false">They aren’t evolving, though people once thought they were</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-boat.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="Malorie and the children in Bird Box" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-boat.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-boat.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-boat.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-boat.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="608" data-injectable="true">The second book begins with Malorie and the children at the School for the Blind for two years, and all hell has broken loose after a Creature has managed to get inside. But how could a Creature drive blind people insane? Well, the theory that spread was that the Creatures evolved to ‘infect’ by touch.</p>
 <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">However, this isn’t the case. It turns out that people were simply pretending to be blind in order to fit in with the actually blind people around them and not be judged or feared. This, in turn, led to hundreds of fake-blind people at the school being driven insane, killing those around them and then themselves.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">Malorie, though, believed they could infect by touch and went on to wear full body coverings any time she was outside for the next ten years. She isn’t happy when Olympia (the child) finally reveals she knew it was unnecessary the entire time.</p>

This isn’t a fact that isn’t revealed in the movie, however, there is one moment in the first book that I just have to talk about.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">Malorie, trying to save the children when they’re babies, actually considers and almost carries out the voluntary blinding of two babies by pouring paint stripper into their eyes. This is possibly the clearest display of the fear instilled in people by the presence of the Creatures.</p> <h2 id="h-animals-can-sense-them-better-than-humans" data-injectable="false">Animals can sense them better than humans</h2> <figure data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/birdbox-still.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Malorie and a bird in Bird Box" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/birdbox-still.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/birdbox-still.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/birdbox-still.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/birdbox-still.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">While we already know that birds can sense them, thanks to their use as an alarm system (which, in the books, only happens while at the house and aren’t taken down the river with them), they’re not the only animals who can sense them.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">In the first book, not only does Jules have his own dog called Victor, but he and Tom (the adult) head out in search of more dogs to act as guide dogs. Dogs, as it turns out, are much more able to sense the presence of Creatures and can help protect humans by altering them if they venture outside with blindfolds on.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-they-can-be-viewed-through-two-way-mirrors" data-injectable="false">They can be viewed through two way mirrors</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-malorie.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Malorie in Bird Box" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-malorie.png?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-malorie.png?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-malorie.png?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bird-box-malorie.png?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">Quite how it took 16 years for someone to figure this out, I’m not sure, but in <em>Malorie </em>it’s revealed that Tom (the child) has invented a visor made from a two way mirror which was once in the lodge they stayed in for 10 years. At the end of <em>Malorie</em>, he tests the visor and, as luck would have it, it works.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">The concept behind this revelation is that by forcing the Creatures to do something we can comprehend and relate to, viewing themselves in a mirror and looking within, we can therefore view them without being driven insane from the other side of said mirror. They’re not beyond comprehension, and therefore we can begin to understand them.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="300" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><strong>Gold Bullion</strong> is considered the rarest currency in <em>Fallout 76</em>. Since there is a cap to how much Gold Bullion each player can acquire per day, you must spend it wisely. Luckily, the traveling vendor <strong>Minerva</strong> makes obtaining all of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/enterprising-fallout-76-player-constructs-the-eiffel-tower-out-of-power-wires/">fun and powerful blueprints</a> with Gold Bullion a much easier process.</p> <h2 id="h-who-is-minerva-in-fallout-76" data-injectable="false">Who is Minerva in <em>Fallout 76</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">Minerva is a Gold Bullion vendor traveling across four locations in <em>Fallout 76</em>. Each week that she changes locations, she also rotates her inventory known as “sales.” Her sales contain a portion of items that other Gold Bullion vendors offer except everything is at a 25% discount.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="51" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">Here’s everything you need to know about Minerva:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true"> <li>24 different sale inventories</li> <li>Travels between four different locations: Crater, Fort Atlas, Foundation, and The Whitespring Resort</li> <li><strong>Minerva’s Emporium</strong> is her regular sale schedule found at the Crater, Fort Atlas and Foundation locations (Weeks 1-3: Monday-Wednesday)</li> <li><strong>Minerva’s Big Sale</strong> is a combination of multiple sales whenever she is at The White Spring Resort (Week 4: Thursday-Monday)</li> <li>Unlike the other Gold Bullion vendors, Minerva’s items don’t have any reputation requirements to purchase</li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has released its financial results for the 2023-24 fiscal year, and things are looking a little grim for the company in profit terms.</p>
<p>According to its <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/24q4slides.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">results presentation</a>, Square Enix's profits are down a whopping 70% on last year, with the studio bringing in 14.91 billion yen in 2023-24 compared to the previous year's 49.26 billion figure.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/24q4earnings.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ancillary document</a>, the studio chalks this loss up to "the termination of development efforts for some key pieces of content in the Digital Entertainment segment", i.e. video game cancellations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/square-enix-financials-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.jpg?itok=MP2GBwHL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/square-enix-financials-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.jpg?itok=Xhz71FkN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="44d95bc5-3633-4143-b2a2-b3904d1452c4" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/square-enix-financials-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.jpg?itok=Xhz71FkN" alt="Aerith looking on in wonder as lanterns drift upwards in Square Enix's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Square Enix's big releases last fiscal year included&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This likely includes the $140m (around 21.8 billion yen) loss <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-140m-loss-shakeup">declared by Square Enix earlier this year</a>; the company cited "content abandonment losses" in an earlier report, a cause which is also cited in today's presentation.</p>
<p>By way of explanation, Square Enix says the projects it canceled were "incompatible" with its "revised approach to the development of high-definition (HD) games", by which it means major PC and console releases as opposed to mobile or browser-based games.</p>
<p>No further information on these projects was released; it looks like the projects that were canceled hadn't been announced, so we may well never know what they were.</p>
<p>Another cause Square Enix cites for its lower profits this year is "a YoY (year-over-year) decline in MMO and Games for Smart Devices/PC browser sub-segment sales", a shortcoming the company probably hopes to rectify this summer with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-expansion-release-date-collectors-edition"><em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em></a>.</p>

<p>That plan is called "Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens", and it revolves around "consistently and regularly releasing [HD] titles that meet our customers' expectations", as well as "disruptive growth" in the mobile and browser spheres.</p>
<p>Rather sweetly (or concerningly, depending on your read), Square Enix says its new priority is "bringing smiles to our customers' faces", to which end it will "regularly releas[e] AAA titles" and "strive for a regular launch cadence".</p>
<p>The company declares its intention to "aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy" which includes not only PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, but also "Nintendo platforms", likely referencing both the Switch and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">hotly-anticipated upcoming successor</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if Square Enix's strategy pays dividends, but it's clear that the company has a long way to go if it wants to return to higher profits. Stay tuned for more.</p>

			<p><span>Another hero surrounded by scoundrels and traitors.</span></p>
		</div>
	<div>
		<p>This is probably a better topic for an episode of <em>The HOA </em>and maybe some of this will get recycled there but hey, it's my nickel so let me lead this week's email off with a grudge I'm holding.</p><p>I live in an old mill building. It's huge, the size of a city block, twelve stories tall, well over a hundred housing units contained within its thick brick walls and tar-black roof. I live near the top which, as I've mentioned before, means that it gets very hot up here even in the dead of winter.</p><p>The logic of buildings like this, which were designed before air conditioning and climate change and whose sheer scale would have made temperature control prohibitively expensive, is that in the warm months the building could be cooled by venting warm air out the upper-story windows while cool air was pulled in from the ground floor. In fact, unless the wind outside is both strong and pointing directly into the windows, it's hard to pull air <em>into </em>the upper floors from outside because there is so much air trying to get out.</p><p>Last year a neighbor and I both pooled our sets of extra window screens and opened the entire top floor up. During the few breaks we got in the heat we actually managed to make the heat break inside a little bit as well.</p><p>But the second the temperature started dropping below 45 overnight, someone decided it was too cold to have windows open and <em>stole every single window screen</em>. Now we are through the spring, the building is stifling all the time before we have had our first 80 degree day, and nobody has brought the screens back out.</p><p>The thing that I've spent the winter and spring stewing over is the mystery of <em>which </em>person in my building is the thief. Some ignoramus decided to swipe and <em>hide </em>all the stuff my neighbor and I had contributed to—why not just say it—the commonweal. The social contract? Rent to pieces! The milk of human kindness? Curdling in the tropical heat we have lived with since early March.</p><p>Who could it have been? I have my suspicions of course. There is the regrettably under-trained handyman, always put-upon by our aging building and who views the common spaces as his personal domain. There's the frail but crusty old bastard down the hall who is quick to provide a teasing but <em>extremely pointed </em>admonishment whenever he feels personally inconvenienced by another resident: "Wow that's almost enough for the freight elevator," he'll say as you maneuver a stack of cardboard on to the elevator to the basement to take to the lone recycling bin. The moment a cart or wagon squeaks in the hallway: "Sounds like someone needs some WD40." Reader, I am fain to tune this man up, except that he provided me an excellent recipe for Tom and Jerries one Christmas a couple years ago.</p><div><p>Whoever it is, their day is coming. I have most cleverly laid a trap, you see. It may take months for these seeds I plant—in the form of discreet little AirTags attached to the new screens that were just delivered—to bear their sweet fruit. But there will come a cool night when someone passing by those screens thinks, "I got away with it once, I'll do it again!" And at that moment they will be undone, for my screens will cry out for justice and lead me to the one who has done me this offense. They will find that I am Nemesis brought to their door. They will open it to find me standing before them in the night and they will hear me say:</p><p>"Hey, sorry to bother you but did you <em>by chance</em> take the screens out of the windows by the elevator? No it's not a problem, it was pretty cold! But you know I'd just love to get them back and put them into storage for the winter. No no, it's perfectly okay. Yeah see they've got my name written on them. Right there, but it is kind of small and smudged now. I can see how you missed it. Anyway: thanks, and sorry about the cold."</p></div><figure><img src="https://remapradio.com/content/images/2024/05/05-13-2024.png" alt="The schedule for Remap this week, details in the article below" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://remapradio.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/05-13-2024.png 600w, https://remapradio.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/05-13-2024.png 1000w, https://remapradio.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/05-13-2024.png 1600w, https://remapradio.com/content/images/2024/05/05-13-2024.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul>

                <p>After a few generations without them, memory cards have made a big return in the last couple of years. Specifically, Xbox Series X|S plug-and-play expansion cards that give users an instant storage capacity upgrade.

For a quick upgrade, the 2TB Seagate expansion card is down from its standard price of $270 to <strong>$240 </strong>currently.

Some say that if they've received ANY help whatsoever, then they must revoke their self-proclaimed solo title, and return to their Hobbit-hole, never to be seen or spoken of again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As someone claiming to be a solo-dev, I thought I'd delve into why (or if) this title matters, and then break down my own game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Carceri</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, as a solo-dev case study. You can judge for yourself if I'm "legit," or if I should prepare for my return trip to the Shire.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lower the Stakes"><span>Lower the Stakes</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What does an authentic "solo" distinction gain a developer? One could argue it depends on WHEN the claim is being made.</span></p><p><img data-testid="content-image" data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt14075f6327545030/663b937093aa0d0c914567ca/atari_adventure.jpg?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt14075f6327545030/663b937093aa0d0c914567ca/atari_adventure.jpg?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="atari_adventure.jpg" title="atari_adventure.jpg"></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Back in the Atari days, many games were designed and programed by one person; this was the norm. But even by the NES days, solo games were a rarity, and by the days of disk-based consoles the idea of a solo developer was completely dead. So, when indie games returned to the scene, the claim that "a single guy/gal made this game in their garage," was a total novelty.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But...indie games "returned" over a decade ago. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1942884/">Indie Game: The Movie</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> came out in 2012, documenting an already existent, albeit small, indie scene. Everything about indie games is now a regular part of the overall game industry, and they’ve flooded the market. Which means, to proclaim you're a solo-dev these days is about as novel as using a "retro pixel-art" style, or making a roguelike. That is to say, it's business as usual.</span></p><p><img data-testid="content-image" data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt52af47d0347be6b6/663b93a09dbe5c7363019a36/solo_indiesearch.jpg?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt52af47d0347be6b6/663b93a09dbe5c7363019a36/solo_indiesearch.jpg?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="solo_indiesearch.jpg" title="solo_indiesearch.jpg"></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Surely, there's more to this claim than just novelty though? After all, it's STILL super impressive that one person can whip up something as complex as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363080/">Manor Lords</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2214880/Europa/">Europa</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by themselves, games that dwarf my own. And that, I think, is the biggest benefit of claiming to be a solo-dev: setting expectations.</span></p><p><img data-testid="content-image" data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/bltdec60e76c22742d8/663b93affecc2c7d72c546dc/solo_manor.jpg?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/bltdec60e76c22742d8/663b93affecc2c7d72c546dc/solo_manor.jpg?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="solo_manor.jpg" title="solo_manor.jpg"></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Suppose we were told that Manor Lords was a first-party Microsoft game, made by a team equal to that of Halo. Hundreds of devs, infinite budget, no deadlines, etc. Players would expect everything to be perfect: bleeding edge graphics, no bugs, instant fixes, and so on. It might even get review bombed for missing a feature the community expects to be there.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Knowing, however, that Manor Lords is made by one person, the perspective shifts from, "is that it?" to "they did all THIS?" The fact that the game looks good, plays well, and has lots of features is seen as miraculous. It's far more impressive than anyone expects from a single developer, to the point that some of its minor faults are even forgiven by players, which is a rarity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On that subject, players have asked Manor Lords solo-dev, Greg Styczeń, to hire some people to help fix the game faster. Seems that as you move from "solo dev" to "small dev team" you also move into a different bracket of expectations. A team is a group, and you can add more people to a group to fix any problems (from the public's perspective. As Styczeń and other developers know, throwing bodies at a problem usually isn't the best solution).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What does this all mean? That being a solo-dev these days bestows slight novelty value to your game, and a small degree of goodwill from players. Friends and family of a solo-dev are, naturally, extremely impressed by your efforts. However, players, who don't know or care about you, ultimately still want something that is interesting, and worth their time. Players don't search the "solo-dev" tag, on Steam, when they're hungry for new games. Look again at that Manor Lords picture above, there’s no mention of solo-dev in the main marketing capsule; it’s just not that important.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To boil it all down: being a "real" solo-dev doesn't much matter these days, one way or another.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Barely Standing on the Shoulders of Giants"><span>Barely Standing on the Shoulders of Giants</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now that we know this topic isn't important, let's keep talking about it!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As I mentioned above, I'm the self-proclaimed solo-dev of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2941820/">Carceri</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a small (but hopefully interesting) game about all the prisons we throw ourselves in, and the various ways we try to escape them. Carceri is a first-person open-ish world exploration game made in Unreal 4, in which, I claim, I "made everything:" 3D art, writing, music, level design, scripting, and key art. Potentially neat, if true, but am I just blowing smoke? Let's break this down!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><img data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/bltf9aa5acf95f9d078/663b93c2e71d800954a0cf66/CarceriShot02.png?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/bltf9aa5acf95f9d078/663b93c2e71d800954a0cf66/CarceriShot02.png?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="CarceriShot02.png" title="CarceriShot02.png"></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Get with the Programs"><span>Get with the Programs</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The most obvious place to start is with something I just said: Unreal 4. The Unreal Engine has been worked on by hundreds (thousands?) of devs since the 90s! There is NO WAY, in this world, or the multiverse, that Carceri exists without the Unreal Engine. And naturally, many other programs were involved as well: Blender, Ableton, Affinity Photo/Designer, GoldWave, and the list goes on.</span></p><p><img data-testid="content-image" data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt8465f99402a81b17/663b93d1b3e984cbbe838114/solo_programs.jpg?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt8465f99402a81b17/663b93d1b3e984cbbe838114/solo_programs.jpg?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="solo_programs.jpg" title="solo_programs.jpg"></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's not to mention the primary means of distributing Carceri to the world: Steam. For my previous game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/331580/">ULTRAWORLD EXODUS</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I began by selling the game directly through my old website, which was a royal pain (also, that website's design/hosting were thanks to programs too). All of this is to say that I couldn't have made any of the tools/infrastructure-related parts of Carceri by myself. No tools, no game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Some Things are for Sale"><span>Some Things are for Sale</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Missing from my laundry list of creation claims above is sound effects. All the non-music audio in Carceri has been purchased from a variety of sources: the Unreal Marketplace, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.asoundeffect.com/">asoundeffect</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the biggest one by far, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/pm/polly/?trk=bb0b4a34-0609-448c-ac86-da48f93c0068&amp;sc_channel=ps&amp;s_kwcid=AL!4422!10!72018266416753!72018798321611&amp;ef_id=a4cacbb28cfd14f201f2ad8a52239ec9:G:s">Amazon Polly</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (the characters in Carceri are all programs, living right now in a digital world that co-exists with our own. Fictionally, THEY are the ones using Amazon Polly to generate a voice for themselves, not me). Maybe some of the SFX I could have made myself (poorly), but I certainly couldn't generate the voices, nor did I have the funds to hire human actors, (who fictionally wouldn't make sense anyhow).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that's comparatively small potatoes in light of the Unreal plugins I purchased to help construct the game. The entire </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/ultimate-main-menu-pro">menu/save system</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">! The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/chameleon">post-processing backbone</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of my Art-toy camera system! Even smaller things, like a better way to get objects to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/tweenmaker">rotate/scale in real-time</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Having built my previous game with no plugins, I knew there were certain pain-points of development that would either a) make me quit building the game or b) add months of misery. So, for $10 here, $40 there, I could skip the worst of these soul-crushing lulls.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One thing I didn’t do for Carceri is hire/contract other people, mostly because that’s expensive! But what if did? What if, instead of buying a SFX pack, I outsourced that work to a professional sound designer. Say I paid them a flat fee to make the sounds I needed, and also said “hey, feel free to release this as a sound pack for others to buy!” How is that situation different than me buying a sound pack, just with an alternate set of steps to get the same results?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, at some point this logic breaks down. Imagine if I were independently wealthy (as I do all the time), and I decided that the pain-points of development were…all points. And so, after designing my dream game, I paid contractors to build every single part. In this case, am I even a developer anymore, or just a publisher? Somewhere along this spectrum of getting outside help we must relinquish our solo-dev title, though where that line is drawn is subjective, and, as we’ve already pointed out, being a bona fide solo-dev isn’t all that important anyhow.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Some Things are Free"><span>Some Things are Free</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm an amateur Art history nerd, and I see videogames as part of that history. As such, there are several galleries in Carceri that feature real-world Art. These paintings were taken from the Open-Source collections of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search?showOnly=openAccess&amp;material=Paintings">The Met</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.clevelandart.org/art/collection/search?cc0=1&amp;type=Painting">The Cleveland Museum of Art</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://collections.lacma.org/search/site/?f%5b0%5d=bm_field_has_image%3Atrue&amp;f%5b1%5d=im_field_classification%3A22&amp;f%5b%5d=bm_field_has_unrestricted_image%3Atrue">LACMA</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nga.gov/collection-search-result.html?classification=painting">National Gallery of Art</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://artgallery.yale.edu/collection?f%5B0%5D=classification%3APaintings&amp;f%5B1%5D=open_access%3A1">Yale University Art Gallery</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

After all, this IS the Art that programs produce right now, so it's absence would be fictionally bizarre. As such, there are a handful of generated images in Carceri (all clearly marked). I mostly used prompts that reference Art History: old masters, Delacroix, Hudson Valley School, etc. Even still, who knows where these AI models took their imagery from? So, I went ahead and photo-collaged many of the results together, creating images altered beyond their raw generative output. All that said, unlike prompters, I don't think of AI art as something I created.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Some Things are Priceless"><span>Some Things are Priceless</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Carceri contains a lot of dime-store philosophy. Much of it is delivered with jokes, or by cutesy characters, but even so, it’s plentiful. As with the real-world Art of the galleries, Carceri addresses real-world philosophies, with ideas taken from the last 2000+ years of western thought. Certainly, CERTAINLY, I didn't come up with this stuff by myself. While I'd like to think Carceri provides a unique spin on these subjects, and maybe, eventually, pushes into new territory, it is absolutely standing on the shoulders of titans.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Could I have generated a wholly new system of thought for a $7 indie game most will ignore? Probably not, but even if I could, why would I do that?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><img data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt2f6e9ba51c40cf53/663b94741e6083aee999cbe0/socrates.jpg?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt2f6e9ba51c40cf53/663b94741e6083aee999cbe0/socrates.jpg?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="socrates.jpg" title="socrates.jpg"></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Power of the People"><span>Power of the People</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And let's be honest, there are always other people involved, no matter what. Everyone (who's serious about game development) has people playtest their game. Carceri would be a mess if a few people didn't sit and get hopelessly lost in my questionably designed early levels. And if the world ever hears about Carceri, it certainly wasn't from me, a social media recluse. They heard about it from some form of influencer: game website, youtuber, streamer, and so on. Without these message amplifiers, the game might as well not exist, and then who cares how many people developed this lost work of Art?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And, of course, there's the people we thank if we ever win an award: parents, family, friends, teachers, and colleagues.

Of course, designers know that the choices given to players are PART of the authorial process, as we decide which actions are/aren’t available to them, and what those actions mean to the game’s narrative.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That aside, perhaps when we talk of solo-devs, we're talking about this fabled Author? After all, to the claims that Manor Lords wasn't a solo-dev game, Styczeń responded saying something to the effect of "fire me and the game dies. I am the game." And he's right. It was his vision, his design, his hard work that made it into the smash success it is today. Yes, they could fire him (not sure who "they" are), and simply maintain what's already there, but anything added after his departure would clearly be the work of a new author.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Think of how Star Wars has drifted since Lucas stepped away. Or, to bring it back to videogames, think of how stagnant Metal Gear has become since Hideo Kojima was rudely ejected. Even before Konami's intervention, Kojima kept trying to retire from Metal Gear, claiming each was his last. Yet he always returned, conceding that other directors simply didn't understand. And how could they? Metal Gear is Kojima's wild story to tell, much like Star Wars is Lucas's. Metal Gear Survive basically had no story, and now the Snake Eater remake is using the exact words of it's original; neither game daring to be the next chapter of what should, from a business perspective, be something you'd think Konami would milk to death. Guess they’re stranded.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><img data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blta73766b2b19adf86/663b94b338475cad7f9befc2/metalgear_chicken.jpg?width=NaN&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blta73766b2b19adf86/663b94b338475cad7f9befc2/metalgear_chicken.jpg?width=NaN&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="metalgear_chicken.jpg" title="metalgear_chicken.jpg"></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But now we've run into a curious problem: neither Star Wars, nor Metal Gear, were solo endeavors. Both were made with HUGE teams. Of course, Ebert recognized Star Wars as a work of art and authorship, but not Metal Gear (because, y’know, chicken hats in cutscenes, undermining the author; as if that option found its way into the game by accident). Maybe one of the benefits of claiming to be a solo-dev is to insinuate that your game is, by default, a work of authorship. Granted the author might suck (hi), but, in a way, "solo-dev" is making a promise to players that this game/work of Art hasn't been diluted, or compromised. For better or worse, it's the result of a single vision.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, authorship doesn't have to come from a sole person, which is why most games are rightly attributed to an entire team. Ultimately, whether authorship matters or not, for games, is a separate debate (though one would assume an "authorless" game to be a hollow shell with no identity). For now, this sole author talk is simply my way of feeling a bit justified for all my dev effort when I probably should have just become a lawyer. Or asked someone for help.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">[CarceriShot03 picture here]</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="So..."><span>So...</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">...did I make my game myself? Yes, in that I did all the author-related labor. No, in that it's merely the product of the times/culture I live in, one using the freely available technology/imagery/ideas of the day, just as it has been with all Art throughout history. But I did buy some stuff, so I guess I’ll leave it for you to decide.

Notably, the company is also going all-in on multi-platform development to expand its consumer base.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Japanese publisher has ditched its previous medium-term plan after acknowledging that many titles, including some outsourced projects and triple-A releases, failed to live up to profit expectations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It cited other issues with its old plan, including the cannibalisation of newer releases due to a crowded launch schedule, gaps in management infrastructure, and aging legacy titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Broadly speaking, the company had previously hoped to find success by rebuilding its HD Game and Smart Devices/PC Browser portfolio, expanding its MMO business, and stabilizing its publishing business. It now feels that approach is no longer viable due to an "incomplete journey to better profitability in HD game development."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a result, the company's new corporate philosophy structure will focus on the creation of "unforgettable experiences." What does that mean in real terms? Square Enix has provided some semblance of an answer that may, or may not, provide clarity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The power of content is that of moving people's heart," wrote the company. "The experience that people are impressed is etched in my mind as 'unforgettable experiences' over time." It claimed those experiences will deliver "moral support" and "enrich" lives.

In doing so, the company will retire its business unit-based organizational design to establish an "operationally integrated organization" with a focus on in-house development. It will also transition to a project management structure that keeps the balance between the "creativity of individual employees and the management centred on the organization."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To bolster the reach and performance of its triple-A slate, Square will now "aggressively pursue" a multiplatform strategy by extending more support to Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. "[We intend to] build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles in regards to major franchises and AAA titles including catalog titles," wrote the company. It will also device a platform strategy for smart device (SD) titles that includes platforms beyond the iOS and Android ecosystem."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Accelerating digital sales is another key focus area for the company, which believes attracting PC users could be a huge growth driver. Transmedia initiatives are expected to become another cornerstone of the business, with Square hoping to become an organization that makes "more active use of its IP by offing it across all media formats."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Square's overseas divisions will be rebuilt in line with the company's Japanese divisions, while the company is also hoping to better leverage its own internal talent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mergers and acquisitions are on the table, as well. Square explained it has earmarked a maximum of 100 billion yen ($640 million) for "total strategic investments" over the next three years, but said it must "exercise strict financial discipline" in deciding where to invest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can check out the pitch for yourself on the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20240513_01_en.pdf">Square Enix investor relations website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p><a data-testid="contributor-summary-img-link" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/author/chris-kerr"><img data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt1c7a117d71555292/650efbcad3423169a8871059/chris_kerr_headshot.jpg?width=400&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt1c7a117d71555292/650efbcad3423169a8871059/chris_kerr_headshot.jpg?width=400&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="Chris Kerr" title="Chris Kerr"></a></p><div><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<p data-characters="251" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">For more than a decade, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe</a></em> has received a steady stream of updates. Now, developer Digital Extremes has settled into a fairly consistent schedule. The best part is that you can follow along with that schedule to keep up to date with everything. </p> <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="442" data-injectable="true">Digital Extremes holds regular <em>Warframe</em> Devstreams to keep fans up to date with what’s coming to the game, what the team is working on, the next major expansion, and any news around the game that might be pertinent. This includes TennoCon, the annual <em>Warframe</em> convention. While these Devstreams aren’t reliably regular at the time of writing, there is a vague pattern the developer tries to stick to so you don’t miss them. </p>
 <h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-warframe-devstream" data-injectable="false">When is the next <em>Warframe</em> Devstream?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Aoi.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="All platform releases of Warframe" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Aoi.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Aoi.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Aoi.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Aoi.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Digital Extremes</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">The next <em>Warframe</em> Devstream, which should be #180, should occur between <strong>May 13 to 19, 2024</strong>. The last one covered the upcoming <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warframe-jade-shadows-new-warframe-and-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jade Shadows update</a>, gave us a little glimpse at <em>Warframe: 1999</em>, and doled out some new details about TennoCon 2024. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Warframe Devstream 179: Jade Shadows Details, Status Reworks, New TennoGen, Nightwave &amp; More" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TexQjt_lUY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="739" data-injectable="true"><em>Warframe</em> Devstream #180 should look deeper into <em>Jade Shadows</em> because it’s due out in June 2024. When we have a date for it, I’ll add it to this article. I’d also expect to hear more about TennoCon 2024 or the update that’ll follow <em>Jade Shadows</em>, too. Considering how close we are to this update dropping, Digital Extremes will likely want to share other news, even if it’s only the next Prime Access Warframe. </p>
 <p data-characters="127" data-current-count="127" data-injectable="false">To ensure you don’t miss it, you should subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Warframe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Warframe</em> YouTube channel</a> to catch every new video posted on it. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">All <em>Warframe</em> Devstreams for 2024</h2> <figure data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Screen.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="When did Warframe come out?" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Screen.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Screen.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Screen.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Screen.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Digital Extremes</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="315" data-injectable="false">Below, I’ve listed every <em>Warframe</em> Devstream for 2024 so far. This should give you an idea of everything that’s been shared to date. This year’s big focus is definitely <em>Warframe: 1999</em>, but there are always a few surprises, like <em>Whispers in the Walls</em>, lurking in the shadows to keep us on our toes. </p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="515" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gb0NnIQSk4&amp;t=0s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe Devstream #175 – Whispers in the Walls</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJbYyAMTTU0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe Devstream </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJbYyAMTTU0">#176 – Dante Unbound</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy_vtGx8vq8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe Devstream #177 – Dante gameplay reveal and more</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMTym46pDns&amp;t=6s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe Devstream #178 – Live from PAX East</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TexQjt_lUY&amp;t=5s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe Devstream #179 – Jade Shadows details</a></strong></li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">So far, Digital Extremes has followed a pattern of roughly two Devstreams between updates. This allows the developer time to finalize what it’s working on and show off just a hint of what’s to come. The Devstream following an update also usually contains information about post-launch updates that sweeten the deal by adding something extra to whatever was just added to the game. </p>

            <p>What if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/scorn">Scorn</a>, but it's one that your mum got you for Christmas? That's easy, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/necrophosis">Necrophosis</a>, baby. Much like Scorn, Necrophosis is also part-inspired by the dystopian surrealist works of Zdzisław Beksiński, which means lots of plucking brains out of sinewy bodies and plopping them into fleshy receptacles. There's a demo out now and while it's not outstanding, it tickled my curiosity more than I thought it would.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Developed by Dragonis Ares and Adonis Brosteanu, Necrophosis is a first-person horror adventure whose demo kicks off in a similar way to Scorn, but sillier. You, a sundried anatomy model, awaken in a messed up desert following a recitation of William Blake's Auguries Of Innocence. "Blah blah, eternity in the palm of your nan", yeah cool cool - it definitely wants you to know it's very smart and reads lots of books.</p>
<p>Still, visually it's quite magnificent. Flayed corpses and ribs and towering statues that pray to fleshy sacks. One of the first things you've got to do in the demo is run around this arena and figure out what tendril or eyeball goes into what meat pocket, but it's not outrageously difficult - which is good. That was one of my gripes with Scorn, in that its puzzling was sometimes <em>very</em> obtuse. I know I've only played a bit of Necrophosis, but it seems far less intimidating off the bat.</p>
<p>And while I'm no sucker for these sorts of puzzles games, I found myself pressing on with the demo. Besides a bit too much of monsters speaking in riddles, I liked seeing the outcomes of my weird deeds. Like when I fired a bone cannon at a crucifix, then plugged the brain of the corpse into a bone crab. Or when I plucked eyes out of some walls, then granted the gift of life to an abnormal pelvis.</p>
<p>There's no release date on Necrophosis yet, but you can give its demo a go on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2019760/Necrophosis/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>Australia-based developer Mighty Kingdom has laid off 28% of its workforce, affecting at least 14 people.</p>
<p>The studio informed staff last week and posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/MightyKingdom/status/1789819762052116621/photo/1">statement</a> from CEO David Yin on social media this morning. Yin explained that the move had come as the company undergoes a "strategic rightsizing to streamline our operations" and restructure some roles.</p>
<p>"This decision is made with heavy hearts and we never wanted to find ourselves in this position," Yin continued. "We have exhausted all possible avenues to avert these changes."</p>
<p>The CEO described the layoffs as "the toughest chapter in our story."</p>
<p>Mighty Kingdom has <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-dITKRP_JpZr1THjsyGAJJZ7_lkQUbpMKMu1tScG370/edit#gid=0">shared a spreadsheet online</a> giving details for all the affected staff that were willing to be included, and the studio is calling on potential employers to bring those who have been laid off on board. At the time of writing, 14 people are listed in the document.</p>
<p>"We highly recommend each of the incredible professionals we've had to part ways with," Yin wrote. "They have contributed significantly to our success over the years. If you can assist or hire, please consider reaching out to them."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="251" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Warzone </em>players are always looking for the fastest ways to take down enemies, which is where this WSP Stinger loadout comes into its own. This pistol shreds players faster than anything else, but one specific attachment makes it difficult to control. </p> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">It’s rare to see players running pistols in <em>Warzone</em> these days, with most players opting to run two primary weapons in their loadout instead. Of course, there are always exceptions, like when the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-devs-confirm-nerf-for-overpowered-renetti/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Renetti was frying everyone</a>, but generally, they are a rare sight. </p> <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">That may be about to change, however, as <em>Warzone</em> expert WhosImmortal just revealed that the WPS Stinger has the fastest time-to-kill in the game right now, but only if you use it as an akimbo weapon. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="WARZONE: Top 5 BEST TTK META LOADOUTS After Update! (WARZONE 3 Fastest TTK Weapons)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WPiJZD8o-SE?start=452&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true">“On paper, it’s crazy, crazy busted,” the YouTuber explained. “Akimbo obviously means hipfire and that’s not 100% accurate. The TTK is going to vary here but up close this thing is nuts. At 11 meters, it’s got a 520 millisecond TTK which is the best available—pistols, SMGs, you name it.”</p>
 <p data-characters="82" data-current-count="82" data-injectable="false">If you want to try out WhosImmortals loadout, we’ve listed it for you below:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Breacher Device</li> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>HISS Short Light Barrel</li> <li><strong>Laser: </strong>XTEN Sidearm-L400</li> <li><strong>Magazine: </strong>32-Round Mag</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Akimbo WSP Stinger</li> </ul> <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="726" data-injectable="true">After seeing this, I tried putting the loadout together myself to see how it felt, and I have to say, he’s right about it shredding in close-quarters combat. When I ran into people inside buildings, I felt like I was melting them, and I didn’t find the hip fire too difficult to control. Obviously, it’s not going to be as accurate as aiming down a sight, but it’s useable and I didn’t feel like I was struggling. </p>
 <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">With any hip-fire weapon though, at distance, it is almost impossible to be accurate, so I would recommend running an assault rifle alongside it to give you a chance at longer ranges. </p>

            <p>Cheese and loyal pets (two important items on Maslow's hierarchy of needs) have been added to the co-op survival crafting game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a>. The dairy product manifests as various suspiciously coloured cheese wheels which you can cook and eat, while loyalty comes in the form of freakish pets that can now follow your every move. The pets themselves are technically not new to Abiotic Factor, but their player-tracking behaviour is. "There is, as far as we know, no limit to how many pets can follow you at once," say the devs. Hmmm. I wonder if any scientifically minded folks will test such a hypothesis. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>I say "headcrabs" in the headline because the game has a lot of Half-Life vibes. But really the pets are <a href="https://abioticfactor.wiki.gg/wiki/Pest">these creepy hedgehog critters</a> normally considered pests. You can tame them and enjoy them as companions for as long as they survive the hostile lab environment. The pets have "very small, adventurous brains," we are told. </p><p> A bunch of other small things have been added or altered, according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4170973472349895596">the recent update from developers Deep Field Games</a>, including some useful walkie talkies.

</figure>
<p>These walkie talkies will let players chat over greater distances, whereas before in-game chittering was limited to proximity chat. Not a huge change for anyone simply opting for Discord. But in co-op chaos like this it's often more fun to opt-in to the built-in communication of the game world. "For now, Walkie-Talkies will allow players to hear you all over the Facility -- and even beyond," say the creators. "Later on we have some more plans with these cool little communicators, and we may impose a few more sensible restrictions." Sounds ominous.</p>
<p>Abiotic Factor is basically "Half-Life but funnier and with friends" - a co-op survive-em-up with poo jokes and the ability to make "weird soup" from inedible items. It's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-lifey-survival-game-abiotic-factor-is-out-now-in-early-access">in early access for the moment</a>, with staggered updates planned to bring jetpacks and new sectors of the lab to explore, all before the 1.0 version comes out sometime in winter. You can check the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/427410/discussions/7/4358998952353776588/?snr=1_2108_9__2107">full changelog for this update</a> but here are some highlights plucked out for you, because my hobby is reading patch notes freed from context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed Fatigue gain from pie slices</li>
<li>Food decay can no longer be repaired at the Repair Bench</li>
<li>Fixed an issue were Trams would destroy furniture above or below them, violating several laws of physics</li>
<li>Fixed Antepasta turning soup toxic</li>
<li>CAUTION: Security Robots are no longer intimidated by the presence of a Crafting Bench when attempting to exit their pod</li>
<li>Potatoes can now be planted</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't played Abiotic Factor yet but I have been looking at various YouTube japes longingly. I'm writing this news post as a way to get myself psyched up to actually try it. It certainly looks like my cup of bubbling radioactive ooze. </p>

            <p>There aren't many ways left to put a twist on Stardew Valley, but suffixing it with "in space!" oughta do it. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-known-galaxy/">Little-Known Galaxy</a> is out in a week, and currently has a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521600/LittleKnown_Galaxy/">Steam</a>, where you can sample many of the delights that you're used to from a Stardewlike when you're new in town: meeting the locals, growing potatoes, and tidying up the place. Also, raising alien pets, seeking out new life, and new civilisations... It all takes place on a spaceship, you see, and this has some ramifications to playing the game beyond reskinning everything to be shiny metal instead of picturesque mud. It's an intriguing proposition.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There is a reskin, though, and it's surprising how refreshing it is to the formula. The town is arranged on different decks of the ship, making it much easier to navigate than I had feared, and there are a couple of sweet plant aliens and characterful little robots running around. The schoolteacher is a well groomed robot named Max. A lot of people go to the plaza deck at dinner time to hang out at the restaurant, and the ship has seen a lot of captains come and go, so several crewmembers are quite curmudgeonly toward you, the new trainee captain. Generally, though, this seems to be the utopian ideal of Starfleet, with everyone getting along and doing their assigned jobs. It's sort of like if Picard got really into gardening <em>before</em> he retired.</p>
<p>But the space thing does shake up how you play. One small but impactful change is that you can't just till a convenient square of dirt outside your front door. To grow crops you need to craft a planter, and they run on power - so you also need to craft solar panels and whack them on the outside of your ship. If you don't have enough solar panels, your new planters will be useless lumps of showy metal, making Little-Known Galaxy the first Cybertrunk Owner Simulator (*snare*). This changes the whole loop of your crafting cycle! You need to gather soil samples and scrap metal as a priority, rather than the basis of your economy early on being quick-growing plants to turn a fast profit. </p>
<p>And yes, you visit planet surfaces (you start in orbit around a grey planet with a mysterious monolith on it) and can travel to <em>other</em> planets, too. There's a lot more going on with Little-Known Galaxy than I had anticipated.

Now, one mod team has gone ahead and built just that.</p><p>Prolific mod content creator Toasted tasked his mod team with creating a Star Wars Clone Wars mod pack for Helldivers 2, and has published the results in video form with the help of <a href="https://twitter.com/SWBFUpdates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SWBFUpdates</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/StayBombastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@StayBombastic</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/OzzyOVLD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@OzzyOVLD</a>.</p><p>The mod pack, built by modders Kboy and @irastris, swaps out Hellidvers for playable Clone Troopers from the 501st Legion, including Captain Rex, Commander Cody, and Sergeant Hunter, with Automaton enemies redesigned as Separatist Droids. There are B1-series battle droids, B2-series super battle droids, Droidekas, and more. Even the extraction shuttle is made to look like a Low Altitude Assault Transport.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We modded Star Wars into Helldivers!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Most of us know playing the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a> with friends and family can be a great way to spend your free time. But what about turning to board games when you find yourself alone and looking for something to pass the time? It's not as strange as it may sound, because many board games these days are designed to be played solo, or at least have a fun solitaire mode. From <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy games</a> to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-roll-and-write-board-games">roll-and-write board games</a> and everything in between, there are many options available for solo play. Below, we'll take a look at some of the best board games that can be played alone, giving you a chance to relax and unwind while still engaging your mind.</p><h2>TL;DR: The Best Solo Board Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/x3bRY" target="_blank">Final Girl</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/qV657" target="_blank">Dune: Imperium</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/wKvrN" target="_blank">Hadrian's Wall</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/5qROV" target="_blank">Imperium: Horizons</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/RVgAV" target="_blank">Frosthaven</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/6wMEq" target="_blank">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/AMZKw" target="_blank">Mage Knight</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/w2lqq" target="_blank">Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/mmDjN" target="_blank">Under Falling Skies</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/E34A2" target="_blank">Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/pPwYR" target="_blank">Dinosaur Island: Rawr 'n Write</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3qAxM" target="_blank">Arkham Horror: The Card Game</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/lngrR" target="_blank">Cascadia</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/kPNb5" target="_blank">Cartographers Heroes</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/YlPex" target="_blank">Terraforming Mars</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/KjPv3" target="_blank">Spirit Island</a></li></ul><h2>Final Girl</h2><div id="196835"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Final Girl" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/28/final-girl-1709150748483.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Final Girl</h3></p></div><p>If there’s a particular theme that excels for solo gaming, it’s horror. When it’s just you and the dice in a darkened room, board gaming gets the closest it can realistically manage to feeling unsettling. And whatever your particular fear is, one of Final Girl’s many, <a href="https://zdcs.link/bPgDJ" target="_blank">many expansion sets</a> will have you covered. It’s a modular game in which you play as the titular survivor at the end of a horror story, splitting time allocations between taking actions, playing cards and getting more cards, a split that gives the game its tension and strategic edge. But the core box isn’t enough to play on its own: you also need a <a href="https://zdcs.link/bPgDJ" target="_blank">Film Box</a>, which comes with two scenarios based on classic horror movies, so you can pick and choose between your favorite flicks and your worst fears. Whatever you choose, you’re guaranteed a thrill ride in this horribly unfair but narratively brilliant game.</p><h2>Dune: Imperium</h2><div id="155275"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Dune Imperium" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/10/19/dune-imperium-box-1634675346852.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Dune Imperium</h3></p></div><p>Despite it being one of the best strategy games of recent years, you might be surprised to find Dune: Imperium on this list since really it needs three or four players to shine. However, the need to also cater for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player board games</a> led the designer to include an automated opponent, House Hagal. Despite this being a fairly interactive game, House Hagal is simple to administer yet still manages to block out board space, steal resources and send in troops to contest territory, just like a real player. Solitaire you face two of them, with varying difficulty levels, which feels a lot more satisfying than just playing for a high score, as well as letting you experience this excellent game without roping in your friends. Read our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review">Dune: Imperium review</a> for more info.</p><h2>Hadrian’s Wall</h2><div id="196836"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Hadrian's Wall" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/28/hadrians-wall-1709150823933.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Hadrian's Wall</h3></p></div><p>Hadrian’s Wall is a flip-and-write, where cards are flipped off the top of a deck and then the players - here representing Roman generals - use the depicted resources as they see fit on their own individual player sheets. It’s always been a solo-friendly genre, but this game really excels when played solitaire, not least because there’s now a <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/content/File%20Storage%20for%20site/HadriansWall-SoloCampaign.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">downloadable campaign</a> for it. Your task is to construct walls and fortresses in Roman Britain to repel Pictish invasions at the end of each round. That sense of dynamism is one of the things that sets the game apart from its peers. The others are a satisfying array of crunchy combos to cross off on your sheet, for plenty of strategic depth, and a long-term commitment to resource management with actual tokens rather than box-checks. Between them, these three things push Hadrian’s Wall away from the abstract conventions of its genre and into the living, breathing realm of history.</p><h2>Imperium: Horizons</h2><div id="196837"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Imperium: Horizons" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/28/imperium-1709150914212.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Imperium: Horizons</h3></p></div><p>Civilization games have a long and storied history, but they’re not, on the whole, very solo-friendly. The Imperium series from Osprey games, of which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/imperium-horizons-board-game-review">Imperium: Horizons</a> is the latest and greatest entry, is a notable exception. It’s also a fascinating exercise in bringing the deck-building mechanic to the genre. Each player selects a civilization, which comes with a unique starting deck and set of cards they can add as the game progresses, and it’s this granting of a specific deck that makes it suitable for solo play. It’s on you to leverage the game’s complex mechanisms, which newly includes trading and economics, to build your civilization from scratch, without overextending yourself and collapsing into the ever-present threat of revolt. It’s a significant challenge with any one of the fourteen included civilizations, but when you realise each one requires a unique strategic approach, you’ll understand you’ve got a solitaire game of colossal replay value and depth.</p><h2>Gloomhaven / Frosthaven</h2><div><div id="155276"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Frosthaven" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/15/frosthaven-1686077923971-1708012440033.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Frosthaven</h3></p></div><div id="155277"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/02/10/gloomhaven-jaws-lion-1644509043015.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h3></p><div><p>Playable as a standalone game, or as an expansion to Gloomhaven.</p></div></div></div><p>Perhaps the largest and most involved game on this list, Frosthaven is ideal for those pining for a grand fantasy adventure on the tabletop. In this legacy-style undertaking, you’ll guide an adventurer across a sprawling fantasy world teeming with dungeons and monsters. Card-driven tactical combat is at the name of the game, and each turn you’ll have to carefully consider what to play from your hand. The fact that you can lose cards permanently gives each decision significant weight, and the persistent world makes your experience vastly different from others’. Frosthaven is a vast yet personal game that is just begging to be explored over several sessions. If the scale and price are too much for you to play alone, consider the cut-down but still excellent Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion. You can check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion review</a> for details on that standalone game.</p><h2>Mage Knight</h2><div id="158406"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Mage Knight: Ultimate Edition" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/28/mageknight-1709151453718.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Mage Knight: Ultimate Edition</h3></p></div><p>In the years since its 2011 release, Mage Knight has become synonymous with solo gaming. A sprawling fantasy epic from famed designer Vlaada Chvátil, Mage Knight was designed for 1-4 players, but it shines particularly well as a solitary experience. It’s a great choice when you’re in the mood for fighting monsters, upgrading your character, and exploring a fantasy setting. Make sure to set aside a large chunk of time, though, because games can last upwards of three hours, and each turn presents you with a puzzle-like series of actions that require a great deal of optimization.</p><h2>Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</h2><div id="157800"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/30/sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective-1648659069333.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</h3></p></div><p>Step into the shoes of literature’s greatest detective in this board game equivalent of a mystery novel. Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective includes a number of scenarios and fun props that really sell the experience. There’s a map of London, an address directory and a newspaper, each offering clues to hunt down and suspects to interview. Be warned, however, that this game does not hold your hand; each adventure presents a small amount of setup and exposition, and then sends you out into the city without much direction, leaving you to decide what locations to visit and who to accuse. This game gives you the chance to live up to Holmes’ reputation, which is a tall order given how though the mysteries can be.</p><p>You can check out more of our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-murder-mystery-board-games">best mystery board games</a> if you like this one.</p><h2>Under Falling Skies</h2><div id="158414"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Under Falling Skies" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/04/05/under-falling-skies-1649182830734.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Under Falling Skies</h3></p></div><p>While solo options are fairly standard on most games nowadays, they can’t quite match those rare titles that venture to be solo only, such as Under Falling Skies. It’s a riff on Space Invaders as alien ships descent ever closer to the base you’re trying to protect. Under the pressure of their advance, you’ll have to balance a limited pool of dice between shooting them down, building your base and researching a final end to the alien menace. But there’s a beautiful catch: the higher the dice you use, the better the effect and the faster the alien above descends. With a variety of scenarios that can be recombined into a campaign, like those of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">best campaign board games</a>, this is a simple concept that will keep you gaming for a very long time. </p><h2>Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island</h2><div id="157792"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Robinson Crusoe Adventures on the Cursed Island" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/30/robinson-1648658698630.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Robinson Crusoe Adventures on the Cursed Island</h3></p></div><p>Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island casts players as shipwreck survivors on an island that is actively trying to kill them. There are several different characters to play as, each with various strengths and weaknesses. You will find yourself scavenging for food, building and upgrading shelters, and exploring perilous locations on the island. The game includes rules for a solo variant, but the general consensus is that it’s easier for a single player to simply take on the role of more than one character. There is a lot going on in Robinson Crusoe and the ample iconography can be a bit overwhelming, but those that stick it out will find a rewarding adventure that begs for return trips.</p><h2>Dinosaur Island: Rawr N’ Write</h2><div id="158416"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Dinosaur Island: Rawr ‘n Write" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/04/05/dinosaur-island-rawr-1649183090562.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Dinosaur Island: Rawr ‘n Write</h3></p></div><p>Roll and write games, like co-op board games, often make very good solo fare because even multiplayer you’re all competing to make the best use of the same set of dice. Most, however, are too fast and simple for a compelling solitaire experience. Dinosaur Island: Rawr N’ Write is longer and more complex than its peers, but it pays off in a deeper, more satisfying game. Your dice rolls generate a wide variety of resources that you’ll need to balance carefully to build and run your Jurassic World style theme park. You even draw out the buildings on a grid and run tours through it but beware: if your security isn’t up to scratch, you may end up with fewer tourists than you started with.

The base game comes with a small handful of scenarios that send you directly into the jaws of cosmic mystery. You can use the suggested starter decks, or build a custom one centered around your chosen investigator’s special abilities. Gameplay sees you hopping from location to location to search for clues in order to advance the story while attempting to impede the deadly Mythos deck. Your investigator will inevitably take damage and acquire weaknesses over time that can affect future games in the campaign, making Arkham Horror: The Card Game one of the most thematic games on this list and one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">best horror board games</a> in general</p><h2>Cascadia</h2><div id="157128"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Cascadia" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/23/cascadia-1648059770674.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Cascadia</h3></p></div><p>While Cascadia is one of the very best <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board games</a>, at first glance it doesn’t seem to offer much to a lone player. Sure the wildlife theme is appealing. And the simple yet addictive gameplay, where you choose pairs of random terrain tiles and animal tokens to add to your nature reserve to satisfy a range of scoring patterns, is fun enough. But what elevates it as a solitaire game is the list of achievements in the back of the rulebook. These task you to approach the game with different setups and rule tweaks, trying to reach particular score thresholds. Easy at first, the difficulty soon ramps up, giving you lots of varied challenges that are supremely satisfying to tick off, one by one.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cascadia-board-game-review"><em>review of Cascadia</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>Cartographers: Heroes</h2><div id="196838"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Cartographers: Heroes" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/28/cartographers-heroes-1709151138970.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Cartographers: Heroes</h3></p></div><p>A roll-and-write where the dice are replaced by cards, Cartographers: Heroes casts you as a royal surveyor seeking to map unexplored land in the name of your queen. Each turn, you’ll flip over a card that depicts both a terrain type and a Tetris-esque shape. You have to draw that shape and its terrain onto your grid map in a way that meets the random scoring conditions. The 16 possible goals include building a large contiguous village, completely filling out rows and columns of your grid, and drawing forest spaces on the edge of the map. Beware, though, because you may get ambushed by monsters at any time, and be forced to draw an inconvenient shape onto the map, forcing you to improvise in the future.</p><h2>Terraforming Mars</h2><div id="155280"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Terraforming Mars" src="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/10/09/terraforming-mars1570648127955.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Terraforming Mars</h3></p></div><p>In this heavy Euro-style game, you’ll help make the Martian surface hospitable to human life by increasing the oxygen levels in the atmosphere, raising the temperature from below freezing, and by building man-made oceans to sustain life. This is done through a combination of resource management and tableau building. You’ll take on the role of a mega corporation looking to profit off of humanity’s foray onto the red planet. add In the solo game, you’ll race against the clock to maximize each of the three end game parameters. Every turn, you play new cards from your hand, meaning your list of available actions will grow until you’ve assembled a sprawling tableau of action cards that can combo off of each other. It’s a very crunchy game experience, which is perfect for those who appreciate a good optimization puzzle. There are also a number of expansion scenarios available, making Terraforming Mars one of the best solo experiences available, as well as one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults">best board games for adults</a>, too.</p><h2>Spirit Island</h2><div id="155274"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Spirit Island" src="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/12/12/spirit-island1576180843140.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Spirit Island</h3></p></div><p>By their nature, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board games</a> make for great solo experiences. Because of the players-versus-the-board structure, co-ops easily allow one person to control two or more players. One of the best co-op games in recent years is Spirit Island, a game about protecting your land from waves of vicious colonizers. You control island spirits, each with their own deck of power cards that help destroy settlements and repair land that’s been ravaged by agriculture. The strong theme and combo-heavy card play combine into one of the most robust cooperative experiences we’ve played. It just so happens to make an ideal solo game as well.</p><h2>Solitatire Board Game FAQS</h2><h2>Is it weird to play board games alone?</h2><p>Not at all! It's probably something that people have been doing for hundreds, maybe thousands of years. There's a 1697 French engraving that shows a woman at the King's court playing peg solitaire, and if it had reached the highest circles of nobility at that time, chances are it's a lot older. The solitaire card game that you've likely played on your computer at some point can be dated back to the late 1700s in northern Europe. Speaking of which, it's generally not thought odd for people to play video games like solitaire or far more complex fare alone, even in these internet-enabled times, so why should playing a board game by yourself be any different? In both cases, the enjoyment comes from trying to beat the challenge set by the game, and then trying again to see if you can better your own performance. Solo board games, much like their video counterparts, can also be enjoyed in part for the visual and tactile pleasures that they provide.

            <p>Despite the many difficulties the games industry faces around the world, Swedish developers are feeling somewhat optimistic as the local development scene continues to experience rapid growth.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, Dataspelsbranschen spokesperson Per Strömbäck says the general state of the Swedish games industry is "good", with the number of people working in the industry having grown from 2,500 to 8,500 people in the last decade.</p>
<p>He notes that while there are fewer vacancies at the moment due to the current global economic turmoil, there "aren't as many layoffs as in some other places, and the industry here is still growing."</p>
<p>Strömbäck says the current greatest strength in the Swedish games industry is the diversity in its titles, while the challenge will be to "ride out the economic downturn and retain investments."</p>
<p>"It is harder now for new studios to find funding and to rely on external investment," he explains. "But we have already seen a couple of really great releases such as Helldivers 2, and plenty of other titles still going strong. So we keep making great games, which is what we do best."</p>
<p>Strömbäck also expressed surprise at how quickly the Swedish games industry has "matured" within the last decade, and that it has struck the right balance between AAA, indie, and mobile studios in its ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The innovation and creative hunger is unmatched in such a small and concentrated location"</p>
<cite>Oskar Wolontis, Hazelight Studios</cite></blockquote>
<p>Two of its most successful developers include Hazelight Studios and Midjiwan, the creators of It Takes Two and The Battle of Polytopia respectively.</p>
<p>Hazelight Studios COO Oskar Wolontis agrees with Strömback's assessment of the Swedish games industry, adding that its rich history in gaming has solidified Sweden's place on the games industry radar – especially when it comes to talent.</p>
<p>"All this combined ensures Sweden has one of the best game development talent pools in the world," says Wolontis. "The experience, the innovation and creative hunger is unmatched in such a small and concentrated geographic location."</p>
<p>Midjiwan general manager Christian Lövstedt credits the culture that the industry has fostered over the years, as well as its ability to retain talent.</p>
<p>"The collaborative approach within [Swedish] studios has also proven effective in crafting innovative game titles," explains Lövstedt. "Moreover, Sweden's longstanding tradition of engineering has fostered an exceptionally high level of technical expertise within its game development community."</p>
<blockquote><p>"There is clear confidence from outside investors - we've collectively shown Sweden can release hit after hit on a global scale"</p>
<cite>Christian Lövstedt, Midjiwan</cite></blockquote>
<p>Lövstedt also notes the media attention from "major successes" such as Minecraft, which have contributed to the growth of the industry and have helped change perceptions and boost attention for smaller studios such as Midjiwan.</p>
<p>This growth has helped studios like Hazelight, which has utilised the local talent pool to expand its development team.</p>
<p>"The amount of raw talent in both the experienced developers but also the new graduates each year is mighty impressive," says Wolontis. "There is also clear confidence in the Swedish game development industry from outside investors – we’ve collectively shown we can release hit after hit on a global scale. This confidence in the local talent pool lowers the risk of investment and in turn fuels our ability to keep those hits coming."</p>
<p>He adds that developers from around the world have moved to Sweden, noting that the talent pool has become "much more diversified" and that for Hazelight, 10% of its studio is made up of game creators from other nationalities.</p>
<p>For Midjiwan, recruiting locally has been challenging because "the demand for talented game developers far exceeds supply," according to Lövstedt. The studio has a core team of Swedish developers based in Stockholm, with its community manager in California.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/polytopia.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
<img alt="" height="371" loading="lazy" src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/polytopia.jpg?width=720&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/polytopia.jpg?width=720&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/polytopia.jpg?width=720&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;dpr=2&amp;auto=webp 2x" width="720"> </a>
<figcaption>Midjiwan’s The Battle of Polytopia is in its ninth year, and shows no signs of slowing down</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Wolontis agrees with this. Despite having made use of local talent to help grow Hazelight, it was a challenge for the studio to get to that point.</p>
<p>"The interest in investing in the Swedish game development industry in recent years has been higher than the local talent pool can reasonably support," he explains. 

</p><p>"Granted, the surge of remote work during the pandemic and afterwards have somewhat been able to mitigate this. Yet talent is still in high demand regardless."</p>
<p>And as a smaller studio, Midjiwan is facing similar issues, as Lövstedt adds: "As a smaller studio, we face extra difficulties in attracting the best local talent since people tend to gravitate towards the bigger studios, believing it's safer (which is incorrect in our case)."</p>
<p>Another challenge faced by Swedish studios is a lack of support from the government. Strömbäck explains there's no dedicated policy for the games industry there, such as tax breaks or subsidies.</p>
<p>"The general tax incentive programs on research and development and such are available also to the games companies, but are difficult to use," he says. "There are some very successful incubators, but they are funded and operated on the local or regional level.</p>
<p>"So in terms of public support, Sweden actually has very little compared to some other prominent countries such as Finland, Canada, and the UK. However, higher education is public funded and we have some world class game education here."</p>
<p>Lövstedt also highlights the government facilitating education for games development, but notes there are "too few graduate students to fill the industry's needs" and because there are little to no incentives provided – especially when it comes to employment –  it can be hard for small studios to find footing.</p>
<p>"If you are a new studio, it can be very tough to get the business to work," he explains. "There are no government financial instruments or subsidies for employing people to help you out in the beginning. Many smaller companies address this by taking on external consultancy work, which results in less time to work on your own game title, which can itself become a vicious circle."</p>
<p>So what needs to change? Wolontis says the Swedish government needs to recognise the contributions that the "economic behemoth of an industry" can provide.</p>
<p>"When that happens, it will hopefully open the doors for more productive talks with the powers that be. Any new support systems focusing on ease of business and talent pool growth would be most welcome."</p>
<p>One way for the government to take note is by looking at the success of homegrown games. Midjiwan's turn-based strategy title The Battle of Polytopia is currently in its ninth year, having launched in February 2016, and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.</p>
<p>"Our goal is for the game to remain popular for many years to come," said Lövstedt.</p>
<p>"We can't say too much about our pipeline, but we continuously make improvements, introduce new features, and create content so that players will continue to play it and new players will discover it."</p>
<p>Another success for the Swedish games industry is Hazelight's co-op platformer It Takes Two, which released in 2021. The title <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/it-takes-two-picks-up-game-of-the-year-at-2022-dice-awards">picked up Game of the Year at the 2022 DICE Awards</a> among dozens of other awards, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/it-takes-two-moves-16m-units-news-in-brief">surpassed 16 million sales this March</a>.</p>
<p>"We've shown the world that Sweden can still produce games with a whole new level of innovation never seen before – I want to say a completely new genre, even," Wolontis adds.</p>
<p>"It shows how creatively diverse the talent can be here with the right creative guidance. It Takes Two also happened to become our country's first global Game of the Year winner – that must count for something, right?"</p>

            <p>
Fans of EA Sports FC have responded angrily after EA altered a perceived issue with FUT rewards providing "unintended results".
</p>
<p>
As part of the game's Weekend League, players have a chance to win special versions of certain players, which this past weekend included Kylian Mbappe who's considered the best player in the game.
</p>
<p>
EA doesn't release the odds of receiving specific players, but Mbappe and other top players appeared to be cropping up more often than usual at the start of the weekend.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>

The company then shared a message on Saturday stating it had "identified an issue where the Champions Player Pick rewards were providing unintended results", which was then "corrected in-game".
</p>
<p>
Following the change, players believe EA nerfed the likelihood of the best footballers appearing to force more in-game purchases.
</p>
<p>
A community note on EA's X (formerly Twitter) post reads: "There may have been a probability issue, but there is no evidence of 'unintended rewards' being given out. Mbappe and Dembele are part of Ligue 1 TOTS, so they fit the reward description. EA lowered their chance because it will force players to open packs with real currency."
</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We have identified an issue where the Champions Player Pick rewards were providing unintended results. This has been corrected in-game.</p>— EA SPORTS FC Direct Communication (@EASFCDirect) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASFCDirect/status/1789111173847396598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Many angry replies to the post are requesting EA change it back, as early players receiving the top rewards before the change are now dominating online.
</p>
<p>
"Leave it as it was, everyone was happy. Mad, legit mad that you 'intend' to shaft people for playing your competitive game mode," reads one response.
</p>
<p>
"Leave it as it was. Don't fix it so half the community that weren't busy on Friday night get Red Dembele/Mbappe and we get shafted," reads another. "Most out of touch company on this planet."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted EA for further information.
</p>
<p>
EA has long had issues with controversial implementing of loot boxes, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-denies-its-pushing-fifa-players-to-spend-on-loot-boxes-after-insider-leaks-marketing-documents">company denying in 2021 it was "pushing" FIFA players to spend money in-game</a>.

</p>
<p>
Last week, EA's latest financial report revealed plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-has-teams-looking-at-thoughtful-implementations-of-ads-inside-its-game-experiences">potentially use in-game advertising to drive profits</a>.

            <p>The release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2</a> in early access last week has given the original game a nice little player boost.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the first Hades game managed to beat its own concurrent player record on Steam, with 54,240 taking on the mythological rogue-like dungeon crawler over the last 24 hours. </p>
<p>That's 16,491 more concurrent players than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-launch-on-steam-reaches-over-100k-concurrent-players-24-hours-after-launch">Hades' previous record of 37,749</a>, which it set four years ago.</p>

<p>Despite this boost, Hades is still a way off surpassing the sequel's player numbers, with Hades 2 currently holding a concurrent player record of 103,567. But, regardless, it is great to see Supergiant's original game getting more attention. </p>
<p>We here at Eurogamer are rather fond of Hades, and named it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamers-game-of-the-year-is-hades-and-now-we-chat">our Game of the Year in 2020</a>. More specifically, our Christian Donlan was especially enamoured with the whole thing, calling it a "glittering headlong pelt through the underworld".</p>
<p>"Hades is a proper lark. I love it," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-review-of-myth-and-mayhem">Eurogamer's Hades review</a>. "This game comes from Hell, and it takes you back there, and it's <em>brilliant</em>. Get in."</p>
<p>It definitely isn't a game to be mythed!</p>

<p data-characters="378" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Whereas Capcom had a fantastic 2024 fiscal year <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/capcom-celebrates-record-high-profits-and-sales-for-seventh-year-in-a-row/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with record-high profits</a>, Square Enix has not enjoyed the same level of success. In fact, it’s reported its profits are down by nearly 70% (69.7% to be exact) compared to the previous fiscal year. As such, Square Enix is committing itself to a new business strategy, which includes a greater focus on multiplatform releases.</p> <p data-characters="661" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true">In <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592661.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a presentation shared on May 13</a>, Square Enix outlined a plan it’s calling ‘Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens,’ with the goal of achieving long-term growth over the course of three years. Among its key pillars, it highlights shifting to a multiplatform strategy, something the company intends to “aggressively pursue” and will cover PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, and PC platforms. While Square Enix has launched plenty of multiplatform games in the past, it is known for limiting certain titles to specific platforms. In just the past 12 months, it launched <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-xvi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 16</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a></em> as PlayStation 5 exclusives.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="793" data-injectable="true">It sounds like Square Enix has decided this approach isn’t in its best interests any more, and it would now rather get its games on as many platforms as it can. Some of its former platform exclusives have made the jump to other platforms after launch (for example, the first <em>Octopath Traveler</em> was a Nintendo Switch exclusive but was later ported to PC and Xbox), but Square Enix’s new strategy could also mean more simultaneous releases. So, no more time-limited exclusives either.</p>
 <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true">Square Enix may also be considering bringing older titles to other platforms since it wants to “build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles in regards to major franchises and AAA titles including catalog titles.” It doesn’t provide any specific examples, but it’d be nice if this means the likes of <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em> and its predecessor, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-vii-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a></em>, can make the jump to Xbox.</p>
 <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">Making games more widely available seems like a fairly obvious solution to making more money. However, Square Enix also mentions wanting to focus on quality over quantity, which suggests it’ll reduce its output. So, Square Enix games will come out less frequently, but they’ll ideally be of high quality and more readily available to a wide audience.</p> <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="789" data-injectable="true">Square Enix certainly needs to do something different if its HD games division isn’t turning a profit. Net sales were overall up compared to the 2023 fiscal year thanks to <em>FF16</em> and <em>FF7 Rebirth</em>, as well as <em>Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince</em> and continued sales of the <em>Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</em> collection, but operating losses grew due to “higher development cost amortization and advertising expenses.”</p>
 <p data-characters="550" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="false">In its <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fiscal report</a>, Square Enix also reconfirmed it <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sounds-like-square-enix-has-scrapped-140-million-worth-of-console-and-pc-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost nearly $141 million in cancelled projects</a>. It had said it expected this back in April, but Square Enix has now explained precisely why these projects were scrapped. Essentially, it found them to be “incompatible” with its new strategy for growth and how it intends to develop HD games going forward. Again, it didn’t name any of the cancelled projects, but it’s likely these were unannounced titles rather than anything Square Enix has listed on its release schedule.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="315" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Every season, <em>Fortnite</em> players can spend their time playing matches and grinding Quests to earn enough XP to unlock every cosmetic in the Battle Pass. This season, however, players claim it’s “almost impossible” to do it without spending real money on Tier Skips, and they’re not impressed. </p> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">With <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-does-the-new-fortnite-season-come-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 5, Season 3</a> now firmly on the horizon, players only have a couple of weeks to complete their Battle Pass before the new one launches, but as Awesomedogman3 stated on Reddit, it’s proving to be an extremely difficult task to accomplish. </p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true">“XP this season is just downright awful,” they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1cq9jwi/xp_this_season_is_downright_awful_and_epic_made/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>. “For starters, doing the three daily match quests doesn’t even give you a full level. In fact, it only gives you 60,000 XP for doing them. Weekly Quests only give you 10,000 XP each… Last season they [were] 10,000 XP [too], but there was also a 30,000 XP one thrown in.”</p>
 <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">“Epic’s idea to give players more XP [is to] force them to play the other garbage modes, and even then they are as bad, if not worse, than [Battle Royale]’s Quests. They also nerfed playtime XP for all those modes. I am almost certain it is almost impossible to get to level 151 without having to buy levels.”</p> <figure data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fortnite-fans-name-one-classic-feature-they-want-back-more-than-anything.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Fortnite characters running towards the camera holding guns." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fortnite-fans-name-one-classic-feature-they-want-back-more-than-anything.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fortnite-fans-name-one-classic-feature-they-want-back-more-than-anything.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fortnite-fans-name-one-classic-feature-they-want-back-more-than-anything.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fortnite-fans-name-one-classic-feature-they-want-back-more-than-anything.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Getting XP these days is tough. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">This sentiment was echoed throughout the community, with 2tan2tame saying that “the inclusion of all the other game modes and the XP drop has made me just stop playing,” while Jimlad116 said that after having a baby with his wife, they had previously been able to get through the season pass together but are “not even close to finishing the base Battle Pass this season” and is “honestly considering just quitting the game altogether.”</p>
 <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">I personally have felt like the Battle Pass has made the game too grindy for a long time, and haven’t purchased one in a long time. Back in the days of Chapter 1 I could easily finish a Battle Pass in a season, but with more frequent seasonal updates, and the additional XP requirements, there’s just no way I’m going to get close. I already have a full-time job, and I can’t commit to playing four hours of <em>Fortnite</em> on top of that just to unlock some cosmetics. </p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">I understand that the idea of Battle Passes is to keep players hooked and coming back to your game, but there has to be a limit to this, otherwise, people will just give up and stop playing the game. It seems like <em>Fortnite</em> is about to reach that cliff edge, and they may need to pull back before it’s too late. </p>

            <p>Brass-blasting rhythm game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trombone-champ">Trombone Champ</a> honked its way <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trombone-champ-deserves-to-toot-its-own-horn">into our hearts </a>when it released in 2022. Since then, it's garnered a dedicated fanbase that have kept its spit-valve full to bursting with creations like this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-final-fantasy-7-trombone-champ-mod-is-pitch-perfect">Final Fantasy 7 mod</a>. Trombone Champ mods are special among rhythm games for consisting of two elements: the button-tapping composition of the song itself, and the background visuals. You honk-tap away while unicorns or giant close-ups of full English breakfasts cavort in the background. Although, if your breakfast is cavorting, you probably want to cook it a bit longer.</p>

			<p>A second remake of the original Resident Evil is apparently in the works, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1cqllq0/danielrpk_a_resident_evil_1_remake_is_in/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, DanielRPK, who proved to be somewhat reliable in the past, revealed on their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/resident-evil-104124284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> that a new remake of the first entry in the survival-horror series by CAPCOM powered by the RE Engine is now in development.</p>
<p>While DanielRPK did not reveal any additional information on the new Resident Evil remake, @PRE_Atarabiya revealed on X/Twitter that the game will be released in 2026 to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary. Additionally, the user revealed some additional information on the yet-to-be-revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-delayed/">ninth entry in the series</a>, saying that Leon Kennedy will be the main character in the game's introduction and will be 48 years old, as the game will be set in the Summer of 2025.</p>

            <link>https://www.resetera.com/threads/square-enix-games-will-be-multiplatform-moving-forward.868965/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/square-enix-games-will-be-multiplatform-moving-forward.868965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Square Enix has announced in its financial earnings call that it will be releasing its games as multiplatform moving forward rather than releasing exclusively on one console.</p>



<p>The move to multiplatform is a part of Enix’ new strategy, <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">which states</a>, “the Group will aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs. Especially in regards to major franchises and AAA titles, including catalog titles, it will build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles.”</p>



<p>Under the same changes to strategy, also outlined is the publisher’s shift from “quantity to quality”.</p>



<p>“The Group will pursue a shift from quantity to quality as its medium- to long-term philosophy regarding the DE segment’s portfolio. To that end, it will first work to establish the optimal portfolio, striking a balance between a “product-out” approach that reflects the imaginations of its employees to the utmost, and a “market-in” approach that leverages customers’ voices and data to inform development efforts. It will strive for a regular launch cadence, focusing its development efforts and investments on titles with substantial potential to be loved by customers for years.”</p>



<p>The change in strategy has already seen several of its games canceled, which did not align with Square Enix’s new approach.</p>



<p>As the industry continues to consolidate and games become increasingly expensive, it isn’t hard to see why Square Enix would like to broaden the number of platforms it releases its games on. With consoles like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> expected to launch in Spring 2025, too, it isn’t difficult to see where Square is going with its new strategy—and it’s a strategy that is likely to be followed across the industry.</p>
