<p>Use these Roblox Doom By Fate monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards and get ahead of the competition.</p>



<p>If you’re afraid of the dark, then this game is definitely not for you. Quite clearly inspired by Dead By Daylight, Doom By Fate is a popular survival horror <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monsterverze-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game where players are thrown into short rounds in a dark place with a deadly killer on the loose. The main objective of the game is to survive through the night without getting killed, but that’s easier said than done. Although players have the option to jump and sprint, getting away from the killer is no easy task.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Surviving in a limited space when there’s a murderous killer on the loose is hard enough, but throw in the fact that you also have to complete objectives, and you have quite the challenge on your hands. Considering this, it’s essential for the players to try and coordinate to have the higest chance of surviving through the round. As expected, the killer’s job is simply to eliminate all of the players before the timer runs out. With a variety of playable survivor characters to unlock, Doom By Fate encourages grinding, as a lot of cash is required to make most purchases. This is where Doom By Fate codes can come to your rescue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-expired-doom-by-fate-codes">Expired Doom By Fate Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Doom By Fate, as the game only came out recently. It’s currently in Alpha, so more codes and content updates are likely on the horizon. The moment any of the active codes expire, they will promptly be moved to this section of the page. Moreover, players are urged to use the active codes and reap the rewards before they eventually expire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many Roblox games nowadays demand that players join the game’s <a href="https://www.roblox.com/communities/35983705/what-is-what-is#!/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Roblox developer group</a> and like the game before unlocking the code redemption feature for them, and Doom By Fate falls into that category too. Once that’s done, however, redeeming codes is a simple process that requires next to no effort. Here’s a step-by-step guide:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Doom By Fate.</li>



<li>Click on the Settings button at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.</li>



<li>Hit the Enter key to claim your rewards.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-doom-by-fate-codes">How To Get More Doom By Fate Codes</h2>



<p>Considering that the game is still in alpha, it’s not surprising that there’s only one active code at the moment. However, the sheer amount of popularity that game has received means that more codes are surely on the horizon. New codes are released through the game’s socials and Discord server, so tracking both of those might be a good idea. A better idea though, would be to simply bookmark this page and check in every so often, as we update this article with new codes as soon as they drop.&nbsp;</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Quentin Tarantino's fourth film, Kill Bill, was famously so long that it was split into two separate movies: Kill Bill Volume 1 and its sequel, Volume 2, released about half a year apart back in the early aughts. Soon, it'll celebrate a re-release, Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair, which stitches the movies back together and adds new scenes, too. But even a movie of its length has scenes left on the cutting room floor. Using Epic's Unreal Engine, Tarantino is closing a chapter of his career that's been more than 20 years in the making.</p><p dir="ltr">Totally separate from the new scenes found within The Whole Bloody Affair, The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge is a roughly 10-minute scene built in Unreal Engine that brings together the Kill Bill series and, unexpectedly--or perhaps not--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>. I recently attended the premiere of Yuki's Revenge at the packed Vista Theater in Los Angeles, alongside Tarantino and "The Bride" herself, Uma Thurman, who were on hand to debut this long-lost scene now that it's found its surprising home.</p><p dir="ltr">The scene, Tarantino explained after the showing, was always considered by him to have happened in the canon of the Kill Bill story. "The audience just didn't see it," he explained, as it wasn't feasible at that time for the cast and crew to film what is essentially another bloody fight scene in a movie already full of them. Its absence was known to film buffs and fans of the director <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/jvv8n/the_missing_chapter_of_kill_bill_yukis_revenge/" rel="nofollow ">going back years</a>, with many wishing it had made it into the movie originally.</p><p dir="ltr">Tarantino explained how Epic approached him ahead of Fortnite Chapter 7, interested to learn if he had any story ideas that they could produce together for the West Coast- and Hollywood-themed season, Pacific Break. Always looking to make a splash--for last year's big beat, Snoop Dogg and Ice Spice played a surprise concert in Times Square--Epic wanted to roll out something from the famous director to promote Fortnite's new chapter, which will presumably span the next year if tradition holds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4612472-thelostchapter_yuki%27srevengeposter-1920x1080_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612472" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4612472-thelostchapter_yuki%27srevengeposter-1920x1080_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612472"></a><figcaption>Yuki's Revenge was once assumed lost to history. Instead, it lives on in Fortnite.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4612472-thelostchapter_yuki%27srevengeposter-1920x1080_en.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As it so happens, Tarantino revealed to the developer-publisher that he'd been sitting on a scene he'd dearly missed for 20+ years. The timing seemed impeccable. Epic would get its next big thing. Tarantino would close the book on something that he'd probably given up on making years ago. And so, somehow, Fortnite--where nothing really feels impossible anymore--is now home to a never-before-seen lost chapter from Quentin Tarantino's filmography.</p><p dir="ltr">Uma Thurman returned to provide voice and face capture for her starring role, and the vignette plays out much like the rest of the movie, but it's where it's not so faithful that I find it most interesting. Fortnite doesn't depict blood, so neither does Yuki's Revenge. There's also, naturally, a distinct lack of swear words that comes off as uncanny in a Tarantino-involved production. In the chapter's funniest recurring bit, characters other than The Bride and Yuki are depicted by Fortnite originals, like Peely, the bipedal banana and Skull Trooper, who spectates with a big bucket of popcorn in his lap while Kill Bill's violent femmes kick up dust in the streets.</p><p dir="ltr">The end result makes for a peculiar crossover, but one that illustrates Fortnite's unprecedented staying power. Epic has plans to grow Fortnite well beyond being the "battle royale" game, and we see these plans come to fruition on the perpetual treadmill of updates in the game, as the studio continues to rebuild Fortnite like the Ship of Theseus.</p><p dir="ltr">Things like Fortnite Festival and Creative mode illustrate this to a certain audience--those already logging in to play video games. But as the studio continues exploring what "Fortnite" even means, not just today, but 10 years from now, this lost chapter from Kill Bill provides another vantage point into that future. Fortnite can be a battle royale game. It can be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-5v5-first-person-ballistic-mode-is-now-live/1100-6528379/" data-ref-id="1100-6528379">Counter-Strike</a>. It can be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-wont-call-this-fortnite-2-but-it-feels-that-way-to-me/1100-6519829/" data-ref-id="1100-6519829">Rock Band, or Minecraft, or Mario Kart</a>. It can be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ariana-grande-rift-tour-watch-it-here/1100-6494920/" data-ref-id="1100-6494920">an Ariana Grande concert</a>. It can be a 20-year-in-the-making lost chapter from Kill Bill, too. What is Fortnite? Increasingly, Fortnite is whatever it wants to be.</p><p dir="ltr">Yuki's Revenge debuts in Fortnite on November 30.</p>

            <p>
When I first caught a very quick glimpse at Into the Fire, the kind of glimpse where you more just see a character design amidst a bunch of fire, I thought it was a new simulation game. A fireman <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a>, that kind of thing, the kind of game I'm sure exists already without needing to Google it. Into the Fire is not that at all. There is fire, and there is rescue, but there are also ancient mysteries amongst natural disasters, fiery, destructive jellyfish-esque spirits, and a tantalizing mix of science-fiction, folklore, and the supernatural.
</p>
<p>
Remember The Invincible? Well, Into the Fire is from the same devs, and while our newly anointed editorial director Julian had some misgivings about The Invincible in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-invincible-review">review</a> at the time, my curiosity with Starward Industries' next has still been piqued. Details are quite light on who you are in Into the Fire, apart from the fact that you're a "bold explorer struggling to survive during a volcanic eruption on Dante’s Archipelago." Hang on… have we got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hell-maiden-makes-a-compelling-case-for-mixing-hades-vampire-survivors-anime-and-uh-dantes-divine-comedy">yet another</a> Divine Comedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dantes-epic-poem-la-divina-commedia-is-getting-turned-into-a-videogame-again">adaptation</a> on our hands here? I suppose time will tell.
</p>
<p>
The core loop appears to be this: there is a hub, seemingly nearish to said volcano, where you can do bits of crafting and upgrading, rest a bit, find some lore, and choose your equipment before heading out on missions. Your equipment looks like quite standard firefighting stuff, like a big ole axe, and a fire extinguisher attached to your back that you spray across fires to put them out.
</p>
<p>
For the missions themselves, things look tricky, based on the game's latest trailer (as seen above). There's those aforementioned sort of jellyfish fire spirits you have to fend off, amongst others for one. But there's also the rescuing people. This isn't like, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, where you can foist them on your backpack, you actually have to carry them, and that might mean across thin planks of wood above a burning pit. Amongst the action it looks like there is a borderline puzzley navigational element that'll put your quick mapping skills and reflexes to the test.
</p><p>
As it stands, there's no release date for this game other than sometime in 2026, but whenever it does launch it'll do so in early access. In the meantime, you can wishlist Into the Fire here if it takes your fancy.

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Servers Down For Chapter 7 Launch]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortner servers are down ahead of the launch of Chapter 7, following the huge end-of-chapter event that marked an end to the previous chapter.</p>



<p>The Zero Point live event was stacked with collabs, including the likes of Godzilla, Hatsune Miku, and Homer Simpson, and servers immediately went offline after the conclusion of the event in preparation for Chapter 7’s launch.</p>



<p>Taking the Fortnite servers down immediately was an unexpected move by many, considering the usual start time of downtime for new content is at 2 AM ET, but Epic Games announced the downtime in advance of the event to give players a heads up.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-downtime-end">When Will Fortnite Downtime End?</h2>

<p>Posting on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1994771674793996483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a> ahead of the event, Epic Games stated that downtime would commence immediately after the event’s conclusion, and in-game, a precise countdown was shared.</p>



<p>Fittingly for Chapter 7, downtime will last four seven hours, and there is a live countdown available in-game. That downtime is a similar length to what was witnessed prior to the launch of Chapter 6, though there could still be server issues when the season commences.</p>



<p>A host of players complained on social media of being disconnected during the live event, which had over 10 million active players watching the action, and server instability may be present when Chapter 7 first kicks off.</p>



<p>It will be late in the evening in the United States, however, and the middle of the night for Europe, which may reduce the flood of players heading into the game immediately when servers return.</p>



<p>During downtime, several prominent content creators will be publishing footage from an early access Chapter 7 launch event, similar to what was seen ahead of The Simpsons mini-season.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s biggest day of the year started off with a massive live event that wrapped up Chapter 6, and if all goes well, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-7/2900-7289/" data-ref-id="2900-7289">Chapter 7</a> will begin very soon. In the meantime, though, Fortnite's servers are offline for maintenance and to deploy the Chapter 7 update. There's no bug here--Fortnite is offline on purpose. But it shouldn't be down for long.</p><h2>When will Fortnite Chapter 7 start?</h2><p>In the past, the start of a new chapter came with longer periods of downtime--like a day or more--but these days Epic tends to treat new season and new chapter updates the same as it would a regular mid-month patch. That means you can expect Fortnite to be offline for between 4 and 7 hours, with Chapter 7 likely launching <strong>in the evening on Saturday, November 29, likely around 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET</strong>--primetime, in other words.</p><p>We guarantee nothing, however, as these launches don't always go smoothly. Just a month ago, when the Simpsons season began, all seemed well when Fortnite returned from maintenance--but after an hour, the servers crashed and the game went back offline for a while. And there was another update earlier this year that ended up taking Fortnite offline for an entire additional day. But such incidents are rare, and most updates go off without major hitches.</p><p>When Chapter 7 launches, it'll come with a pretty loaded battle pass, teased by Epic to feature Marty McFly from Back to the Future and Beatrix "The Bride" Kiddo from Kill Bill.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-zero-profit-on-beats-solo-4-50-hour-wireless-headphones-at-cyber-monday-low-2000648763</link>
            <guid>1368232</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In the premium headphone market, big names like Apple, Sonos, Bose, Sony, and Beats compete with each other by offering different features and prices to different types of listeners. The <strong>Beats Solo 4 is the perfect choice if you want great sound quality, spatial head tracking, and modern connectivity features</strong> without having to pay extra for active noise cancellation.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday weekend, Amazon has the lowest price ever on this model which competes directly with models that cost a lot more: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/">The regular price is $199, but it’s now only $129</a>. Instead of cramming in every possible tech feature, they focused on battery life, comfort, and sound quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Long battery life and compatibility with all devices</h2>
<p>Beats designed the <strong>Solo 4 to last up to 50 hours on a single charge</strong> which changes the way you use wireless headphones all week long. You can fly across the country several times, go to work every day for two weeks or binge-watch entire TV shows without having to look for a charging cable. The USB-C charging port has fast fuel technology that lets you <strong>play for 5 hours on a 10-minute charge</strong> when you’re running late. The <strong>Solo 4 connects to both iOS and Android devices</strong> via Bluetooth so you don’t have to worry about being stuck in one ecosystem if you switch between platforms for work and play.</p>



<p>The<strong> 40mm drivers in each ear cup make Beats’ “custom acoustic platform,”</strong> which adjusts the frequency response to give you strong bass without drowning out vocals and instruments in the mid and high ranges. You will be able to hear the thump of kick drums and bass lines clearly while still being able to understand every word in podcasts or other content with a lot of dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic head tracking and spatial audio</strong> make listening more immersive by tying sound to your device instead of your head movements. When you turn your head while watching a movie, the sound stays in the same place on the screen, just like it does in a real theater. This feature turns on automatically when you play content that works with it on Apple devices and some Android phones.</p>
<p>To fix the comfort issues that plagued earlier Solo models during long wear sessions, Beats changed the headband and ear cushions: The very light construction spreads pressure more evenly over your head, and the soft foam cushions make a tight seal without the vice-grip feeling that gives you headaches after an hour. The on-ear design folds flat into a small shape that fits easily into backpacks or carry-on bags.</p>



<p>The matte black finish doesn’t show fingerprints and scratches as easily as glossy finishes, which show every smudge within hours of opening the box. <strong>Beats comes with a 3.5mm audio cable</strong> so you can connect to older devices that don’t have Bluetooth or keep listening when the battery dies after a long time of use.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday deal brings the price of the Solo 4 down from $199 to $129 and puts it in direct competition with budget models that give up battery life, build quality, or platform compatibility. You’re getting a high-end Beats product for less than what many mid-range brands charge, plus the brand recognition and customer service that come with owning an Apple product.</p>

All that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-warn-that-monster-hunter-rise-world-and-wilds-might-not-run-on-windows-10-pcs-after-october-14th">trouble going on with Monster Hunter Wilds</a> aside, for a good long while now Capcom has been doing quite well for itself. Multiple quite well liked Resident Evil games, fresh new bits like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, and even a few remasters, namely for the Ace Attorney games (throw a dog a bone and give us a new one of those, though Capcom), but also for series like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Dead Rising</a> that also haven't had a new entry in a while. Well, for now at least, as a new report suggests a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-rising">Dead Rising</a> might be in our future.
</p>
<p>
This comes from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-dead-rising-game-development-set-in-hollywood">MP1ST</a>, whose sources have informed them of a new Dead Rising game that's supposedly been in the works since at least 2024 with the codename Rec. According to the report, protagonist of the first game Frank West will be making a return, with the belief being that it's a direct sequel to the first entry - MP1ST notes they couldn't completely confirm this part, however, so it could still be a completely new game.
</p>
<p>
In terms of other details MP1St are more confident in, the game will apparently be set in Hollywood, specifically on a big, enclosed movie studio lot. The villain of the game is supposedly a film director that forces Frank, amongst others, into completing different trials for the purpose of making his "perfect movie."
</p>
<p>
There wasn't any word on a release date, it's worth noting, so you should probably still expect it to be a while away. And, with all rumours, take it with a good pinch of salt. If Capcom are working on a new Dead Rising, though, I'll be curious to see how it lands. The original series was self-indulgent in a way that felt very of its time - the remaster of the first one, for instance, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dead-rising-remaster-no-longer-gives-you-points-for-erotica-creepshots-because-its-not-required-or-appropriate">doesn't give you points for "Erotica" creepshots</a> on the grounds of not being "required" or "appropriate", a clear sign of different times. Perhaps we need to think more deeply about the unceremonious slaughtering of zombies more too! For now, time will tell whether this rumour comes true.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-beam-with-dolby-atmos-hits-record-low-on-amazon-black-soundbar-for-cyber-monday-at-zero-margin-2000648759</link>
            <guid>1368214</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sonos is known for making high-quality audio products and the Beam (Gen 2) shows why <strong>the company is still the best in the soundbar business</strong>. TVs these days are getting thinner and more stylish but that slim design comes with a trade-off: the built-in speakers don’t have enough room to make good sound. This makes a frustrating gap between beautiful 4K visuals and disappointing audio that ruins movies, shows, and music.</p>
<p>The Sonos Beam fixes this by turning your living room into a mini theater with Dolby Atmos support and smart home integration. For Cyber Monday weekend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">you can get it for $349, which is $150 less than its normal price of $499</a>. This is the lowest price ever and makes premium sound more affordable than ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>High-Quality Sound Technology in a Small Package</h2>
<p>The Beam has great hardware in a surprisingly small frame that won’t take over your entertainment center. The <strong>speaker array has one center tweeter, four full-range woofers, and three passive radiators</strong> that work together to make 200 watts of total output power. Five Class-D digital amplifiers power the array. With this setup, the soundbar can handle frequencies as low as 50.4 Hz and gives it deep bass without needing a separate subwoofer for most people. <strong>Dolby Atmos</strong> processing is what really makes the magic happen: It makes virtual height channels that bounce sound off your ceiling to make it sound like it’s coming from above.</p>



<p>The Beam from Sonos is more than just a TV and movie player: When your screen is off, <strong>the soundbar becomes a high-tech music streaming device</strong> that connects to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and many other services through built-in Wi-Fi. The <em>Trueplay</em> tuning technology uses the microphone on your iPhone to figure out how sound travels in your room and automatically changes the sound profile to make up for furniture, wall materials, and the shape of the room.</p>
<p>You can use the Sonos app, your current TV remote through HDMI-ARC, Apple AirPlay 2 for iOS users, or voice commands through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant to control everything. It only takes a few minutes to set up because you only need two cables: one HDMI cable to connect to your TV and one power cord. This means you won’t have to deal with the mess of wires that come with most surround sound systems.</p>



<p>Sonos is better than its competitors because you can add more devices to it while their ecosystems are closed and don’t allow for many upgrades. You can start with just the Beam and then add a Sonos Sub for deeper bass or pair two Sonos One speakers as rear channels to get real 5.1 surround sound. You can play music in different rooms or make a whole-home audio system that plays the same content in all of them because every Sonos speaker connects wirelessly to your home network.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday deal is a great deal for anyone who takes their home entertainment seriously because it’s only $349 instead of the usual $499. Soundbars that work with Dolby Atmos usually cost $600 or more. Cheaper options, on the other hand, may not be as well built, may not support apps, or may not be able to be expanded in the future.</p>

<p>The 10.1-inch frame from <em>Euphro</em> makes everything easier with a touchscreen interface that anyone can use, even if they’ve never owned a smartphone or tablet. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6098/">Cyber Monday sale brought the price down from the usual $99 to $45</a> which is the lowest price ever on Amazon. That discount makes sense for a frame that has a lot of storage, a clear display, and easy photo sharing, all in a package that anyone can use without any technical knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6098/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>WiFi Sharing That Works and Isn’t Confusing</h2>
<p>The <strong>frame connects to your home’s Wi-Fi network</strong> through a simple setup process that shows you how to do it on the touchscreen. Once it’s connected, anyone you give permission to can send photos through the free <em>Uhale</em> app which is available for both iPhone and Android devices. Family members can easily get to your frame by downloading the app, making an account and asking for access with a unique code and you can then approve their request with just one tap. When you send photos through the app, they show up on the frame right away: This is the magical moment when grandma sees her grandson’s first day of school photos pop up in real time from hundreds of miles away.</p>



<p>The <strong>10.1-inch IPS touchscreen has a resolution of 1280×800</strong> which is enough to show photos clearly without the blurry, pixelated look that cheaper frames give. IPS technology keeps the colors true and bright even when you look at the screen from the side. Older LCD panels would wash out if you weren’t standing right in front of them. You can pause the slideshow to look at a favorite photo or skip over pictures you’ve seen recently with the touch interface, which responds smoothly to swipes and taps. Depending on how you set it up, you can turn the frame from portrait to landscape mode.</p>
<p>The <strong>internal storage can hold up to 32GB, which is enough for about 60,000 photos</strong> at the resolution of a typical smartphone so you’ll run out of wall space before you run out of memory. The <strong>frame can also take microSD cards</strong>&nbsp;but most people never get close to filling up the internal storage, even after years of regular photo uploads. You can send files directly from cameras, phones, or computers without having to worry about compatibility issues because JPEG, PNG, and MP4 files are just a few of the many image and video formats that work without conversion.</p>



<p>You can change how photos look by changing the order they show up in, the speed of the slideshow, and the transition effects between images. If some photos don’t fit the season or mood, you can hide them from the rotation. The frame will remember these settings until you change them. You can set the display order to show the newest photos first, shuffle them randomly, or play them in order of when they were taken.</p>
<p>Cutting the price by $54 makes this frame cheap enough to buy on a whim, and it has features that frames that cost twice as much have a hard time matching.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[JBL Loses All Margin This Black Friday Week, 5.1-Channel Soundbar Crashes to an All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-soundbar-and-subwoofer-for-150-off-2000638894</link>
            <guid>1368199</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You should want the best out of your home entertainment setup. And that doesn’t just mean investing in a good TV for video quality. You’ve got to give audio some love too. Sure, a fancy 85-kinch OLED smart TV is going to look awesome in your living room, and while built-in TV speaker have gotten better over the years, they still don’t hold a candle to a dedicated surround sound system. This JBL soundbar and subwoofer combo offer a great improvement to your home entertainment soundscape without you needing to empty your bank account. And best of all, it’s on sale right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6095/">Normally the JBL Bar 500 goes for $650, but for a limited time deal for Black Friday week, you can get it for just $400.</a></p>
<p>This JBL soundbar measures across at exactly 101.7 centimeters. That can comfortably fit atop your media center right in front of your TV. The subwoofer works wirelessly, which means you don’t need to hide cables running from one side of the room to the other. That measures 10 inches high and will be the difference between a bass that booms and a bass that&nbsp;<strong>BOOMS</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6095/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With support for both Dolby Atmos and MultiBeam surround sound, you can bring theater-like quality sound and feels like it’s coming from all directions in a 3D space, fully immersing your in the audio. And it does so without actually needing any additional surround sound speakers — just the 5.1-channnel&nbsp; system.</p>
<h2>Enhanced Dialogue</h2>
<p>Now one of the main reasons to upgrade to a soundbar over your TV’s built-in speakers is dialogue. TV shows and movies nowadays have a tendency to be mixed with more robust audio setups in mind. This is why when playing off just your TV speakers, you might sometimes find it hard to actually make out what anyone is saying. However, if you go to increase the volume, suddenly the next scene has erratically loud sound effects like explosions, gun fire, or even just background music.</p>



<p>The JBL 500 sound bar gives you the option to enhance dialogue separately from the rest of the audio. PureVoice Dialogue Enhancements algorithmically isolates and amplifies vocal clarity so that you don’t feel forced to always watch with the subtitles turned on.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6095/">Tons of other smart features are packed into the JBL Bar 500 soundbar and subwoofer.</a> With Wi-Fi support, you can connect to your sound system from other devices on your network. Stream music to them over AirPlay from an iPhone or MacBook. You can even pair the soundbar with an Alexa smart home hub can control the speaker with voice commands.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> developer Team Cherry has revealed it won't be making the trip to The Game Awards next month, as the team believes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> will sweep the Game of the Year award.</p>
<p>Asked by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet">Bloomberg</a> if the studio was prepping for a visit to LA, co-founder William Pellen diplomatically said: "Maybe not. We’re pretty busy."</p>

<p>"This year I think we're safe. I think Expedition 33 [will win]," Pellen explained. "It's exceptional and broadly palatable. Whereas we're on that knife's edge, where it appeals to some and infuriates others."</p>
<p>In the same interview, Team Cherry also commented on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modding-hollow-knight-silksong-is-totally-fine-say-team-cherry-but-studio-is-largely-happy-with-difficulty-balance">the use of mods following heated debates over the game's imposing challenge</a>.</p>
<p>Silksong's difficulty level has been an ongoing discussion since the game finally released back in September. Developer Ari Gibson previously said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-admit-it-has-moments-of-steep-difficulty-but-also-a-higher-level-of-freedom-to-avoid-getting-stonewalled">players "have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled</a>", though this wasn't enough for some. Soon after Silksong came out, several mods were released for the game, which added certain adjustable variables like damage and health.</p>
<p>On its release, we awarded Silksong five stars. "Pretty and charmingly mean-spirited, this is a game filled with revelations and genuine personality," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Eurogamer's Silksong review</a>.</p>

            <p>
Right now, Team Cherry's future is pretty unclear. There is some kind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> DLC that'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-will-get-dlc-for-years-some-of-the-plans-for-that-stuff-are-kind-of-ambitious-as-well">coming somewhere along the line</a>, but understandably the developer is keeping their cards close to their chest in terms of what's actually next. They certainly do have some ideas on how they would expand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, i.e. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-knows-if-well-ever-get-another-hollow-knight-but-if-we-do-you-can-expect-them-to-be-as-standalone-as-silksong">by not making any direct sequels</a>, much like how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> isn't one. But in a recent interview, Team Cherry spoke (ever so slightly) more openly about their own future and how the thing that might get in their way most is, well, death.
</p>
<p>
Lead dev's Ari Gibson and William Pellen were asked about, unsurprisingly, all things Hollow Knight in an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM0NzQzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTUyMjM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNkczNjFLR0NUSDAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.nHDv04b3quPAcWKT5nBOeCqr1KCS01wBn_nMscKzzng&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, notably how they're planning to allocate their time post Silksong. "We do have other games that we plan to make. The only time concern really is - and we’ve talked about this before - death," Gibson explained. "It’s not that far off if you spend seven years per project, and potentially add another two. So it’d be nice to do a few more games. Apparently our timeframe still allows us to fit a few more in. Short of an unexpected tragedy."
</p>
<p>
Obviously quite a morbid sentiment, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-a-morbid-one-kojima-has-a-usb-stick-full-of-ideas-for-kojima-productions-to-use-after-he-dies">one a number of devs seem to be thinking about as they get older</a>, although it's what Gibson says about future, hypothetical, non-Hollow Knight games that interests me: "We have said we’ll go elsewhere as well. Although we’ve also said those experiences will still be about exploring big worlds full of weird characters and giant bosses and whatnot. So there would be a through line there that people will be familiar with."
</p>
<p>
I find that particular thought process about Team Cherry's work curious, as it's very much the framework of an auteur. You can see this kind of thing in Hidetaka Miyazaki's games at FromSoftware, there are obvious, thematic connections between his games, even if staff may change between them, and it's those thematic connections that I'd be more curious to see in a future, non-Hollow Knight Team Cherry game.
</p><p>
When asked if they're sick of working on Hollow Knight, Gibson said that wasn't the case "at all," and they'd be happy to work on another one if forced to. On the other side, they'd also be interested in exploring their usual tastes but in a "slightly different genre, slightly different theme, and how that affects the stories we come up with."
</p>
<p>
I'm always quite a fan of new attempts at relaying the same message but in different ways, it's something Guillermo del Toro does in his work, often looking at "the other," through different lenses. To me, the Hollow Knight games are very much about systems of power, and how power is distributed or withheld, so I hope if we do get something different from Team Cherry, it's at least as interesting as that.

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Quietly Moves Its Remaining 15.6″ Portable Gaming Monitor Stock Into Record-Low Clearance After 10K+ Black Friday Sales]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/15-6-inch-kyy-portable-gaming-monitor-2000644924</link>
            <guid>1368178</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A single screen can often feel limited, especially if you’re someone who needs to work with multiple applications at the same time. Those who use a laptop as their main work or play device can benefit from adding a second, portable display to their setup, and today is a great time to bring one home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6084/">Amazon is currently offering quite a few impressive Cyber Monday deals, which also drops the price of the 15.6-inch KYY portable monitor to just $66.</a> That’s after a 34% discount on its $100 price tag, and the offer is open to all shoppers. Both Prime and non-Prime members can take advantage of it. Though it’s best to get your orders in fast, as we’re expecting the discount to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6084/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Display Modes for All Your Needs</h2>
<p>In a sleek, lightweight build, you’re getting a nice 15.6-inch screen. The size is similar to what most standard laptops offer, so you won’t feel a drastic difference when switching between both. The same goes for the visuals. The portable monitor offers a 1920×1080 resolution, which translates into brighter colors and sharper details. The advanced IPS matte screen supports a 178-degree full viewing angle, meaning you can enjoy consistent visuals from all directions. Basically, you don’t have to sit directly in front of the screen to view the content. This is great for when you have multiple people around; those at the back or on the side will be able to see just as clearly.</p>



<p>You can choose between multiple display modes (including mirror, extend, second screen only, and portrait mode), depending on what you need. Need to run two programs side by side? The extended mode gives you access to both. Reading through long documents? Portrait mode should work best!</p>
<p>The monitor includes two fully functional USB-C ports, which means you can connect it with just a single cable for both power and display, as long as your device supports Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode. The setup is plug-and-play, so you don’t need to worry about installing any complicated drivers to get started.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6084/">Even better, it comes with a smart cover that not just protects it from everyday wear and tear, but also doubles as a stand you can use to prop the monitor up</a>. In short, if you have been wanting to expand your work or play setup with something that’s easy to carry around, this portable monitor can be a valuable addition.</p>

              <p>Dyson comes out with a new vacuum model almost every year, and the V11 is a big step up in the brand’s cordless line with 185 air watts of suction that makes a real difference on both carpets and hard floors.</p>
<p>On Cyber Monday weekend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">the price dropped from $629 to $399 which is a new all-time low</a> for a model that still competes with Dyson’s newest models. That discount is important because you’re getting tech that was top-of-the-line just a few years ago, but now it’s priced more like mid-range competitors that can’t match its suction power, autonomy or build quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Power Modes</h2>
<p>You can switch between three different power settings on the V11 using a button on the handle and it lets you control how much battery life you give up for cleaning power.<em> Auto mode</em> uses sensors in the cleaner head to figure out what kind of floor it is and changes the suction automatically. It increases suction on carpets and decreases it on hard floors to save battery life while still cleaning well. <strong>Eco mode extends runtime by up to 60 minutes</strong> by lowering suction to its lowest effective level. This is great for quick daily cleaning of hard surfaces that don’t need maximum power. When you turn on <em>boost mode</em>, it gives you the full 185 air watts for a few minutes of deep cleaning.</p>



<p>The <strong>LCD screen on top of the vacuum shows you what power mode you’re in</strong>, how much time is left until it runs out, and maintenance alerts when the filters need to be cleaned or there are blockages. This real-time feedback takes away the guesswork that comes with other cordless vacuums. You won’t have to wonder if you have enough power to finish the room or if the loss of suction means a clog or just a full bin.</p>
<p>The Motorbar cleaner head has a <strong>brush bar that spins and has technology that keeps long hair and pet fur from getting stuck</strong> in the bristles: This means you don’t have to spend as much time cutting up tangles off the roller with scissors. The brush bar works on all kinds of floors without needing to be adjusted by hand and it moves smoothly from area rugs to tile to hardwood while still cleaning well.</p>



<p>It only takes a <strong>few seconds to switch the vacuum to handheld mode</strong> by removing the wand and connecting tools directly to the motor body. This makes it a powerful tool for cleaning furniture, stairs, and car interiors. The mini soft dusting brush can clean delicate surfaces and electronics without scratching them, and the crevice tool can get into baseboards and tight corners that regular vacuum heads can’t reach.</p>
<p>Advanced <strong>HEPA filtration catches 99.99% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong> which includes common allergens like dust mites, pollen, and pet dander that can make people allergic. The sealed filtration system makes sure that the air that comes out of the vacuum cleaner is cleaner than the air that goes in and it is a big help for people with asthma or allergies.</p>
<p>Dyson offers a<strong> two-year warranty on the V11</strong> and <strong>lifetime support through their app</strong> which has maintenance guides and troubleshooting help when problems come up. The vacuum is only 6.6 pounds when fully assembled, which makes it light enough to carry up the stairs without any trouble but heavy enough to handle daily use. The docking station that hangs on the wall charges the battery and keeps the vacuum and tools in one neat place so you don’t have to search through closets to find them.</p>
<p>Taking $230 off the price of a Dyson vacuum is a great deal, especially for a model that still works as well as vacuums that cost a lot more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars Outlaws (Gold Edition) for Nintendo Switch 2 at 50% Off Could Sell Out Before Cyber Monday Even Arrives]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-gold-edition-for-nintendo-switch-2-already-half-price-for-black-friday-2000648499</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game prices have been a hot topic of conversation surrounding the Nintendo Switch 2. <em>Mario Kart World</em>, the first launch title for the console, comes with an outlandish $80 price tag. Nintendo’s favorite ape has taken centerstage once more in <em>Donkey Kong: Bananza</em>, priced at $70. Third party titles seem to be sticking with the standard $60 for the time being. Those also tend to actually go on sale unlike first party Nintendo titles (which do, but far less frequently and with far less substantial discounts). <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6083/">So right now during Black Friday weekend, it’s pretty expected to find these Nintendo games are still full price while an awesome title like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>has come down by 50%.</a></p>
<p>Previously unavailable on Nintendo consoles, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> first arrived in 2024 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. With the launch of the Switch 2, Nintendo is now able to supports a lot more graphically-demanding third party titles. We’ve seen Nintendo Switch 2 releases for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, and now <em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6083/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>came to the Nintendo Switch 2 back in the beginning of September, selling at a full retail price of $60. Now, just a couple short months later, it’s down to just $30—for a limited time at least. Through Black Friday, you come discover this galaxy of opportunities and experience Star Wars from the scoundrel’s perspective for just $30.</p>
<h2>Gold Edition: Base Game &amp; More</h2>
<p>This is the Gold Edition of the game. That means comes with the Star Wars Outlaws season pass including, not one, but two story DLCs. The pack includes the base game along with the Wild Card story pack, A Pirate’s Fortune story pack, Jabba’s Gambit exclusive Day 1 mission, The Kessel Runner character pack, The Hunter’s Legacy bundle, and The Cartel Ronin bundle.</p>



<p>In <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, you live the high-stake life of an outlaw in Star Wars’ first-ever open world action-adventure. Play as scoundrel Kay Vess and you seek freedom and a new life for yourself. Overcome enemies through stealth, gadgets, and your trusty blaster. Pilot a ship—the Trailblazer—as you embark in thrilling dogfights with the Empire and other foes you’ll make along the way.</p>
<p>Cities are bustling with interesting characters and cantinas to explore. In each location, you’ll find new challenges with exciting rewards waiting for the taking.&nbsp;Every choice you make effects your in-game reputation, which can have consequences for your story and your character down the line.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6083/"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> for the Nintendo Switch 2 supports all modes of play—TV mode, tabletop mode, and handheld mode.</a> This version of the game clocks in at about 20GB which is about a third the size it is one other consoles. It runs in 720p in handheld mode and 1440p when docked at 60fps.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Seagate Goes Zero-Profit on 2TB External Hard Drive, 500,000 Photo Storage at New Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-goes-zero-profit-on-2tb-external-hard-drive-500000-photo-storage-at-new-record-low-2000648741</link>
            <guid>1368145</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cloud storage sounds great until you realize you’ll have to pay monthly fees forever and hope your internet connection stays strong when you need to get to something important. External hard drives solve both problems by letting you physically control your files without having to pay for them over and over again. Plus,<strong> with 2TB of space, you can store about 500,000 photos or hundreds of hours of video</strong> before you even think about running out of space.</p>
<p>Because it works right away with almost any device you own and only needs a USB cable to start transferring files, Seagate’s portable drive has become one of Amazon’s most popular storage options. This Black Friday weekend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/">the price of the 2TB model dropped from $79 to $64, which is the lowest it’s ever been</a> for a drive that is always one of the best-selling in its category.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Storage That Works Everywhere</h2>
<p>The drive connects through USB 3.0 which in <strong>real-world tests speeds up transfers to 120MB per second</strong>&nbsp;which means that moving a full movie file takes less than a minute instead of the slow speed you’d have to deal with with older USB 2.0 connections.</p>
<p>You can also plug it<strong> right into Windows PCs, Macs, PlayStation consoles, or Xbox systems</strong> without having to install drivers or reformat it in most cases because is because Seagate ships the drive with broad compatibility already set up. People who use Macs may need to reformat their drives for Time Machine backups, but this only takes a few clicks, and once you set it up, the drive does backups automatically without any problems.</p>



<p>The <strong>metal case protects the device well from small drops and bumps</strong>&nbsp;but if you’re putting it in a backpack with other gear, you should get a padded case. Seagate offers a <strong>one-year rescue service</strong> that includes data recovery in case the drive fails which gives you peace of mind because professional recovery services usually cost hundreds of dollars and can’t always guarantee results.</p>
<p>The<strong> USB connection provides power directly so you don’t need a separate power adapter</strong> that could get lost in a drawer or make your desk look messy. You can use this drive anywhere there is a USB port like in coffee shops or airport lounges, without having to look for an outlet. The drive spins at 5400 RPM which is a good balance between speed and reliability and it also uses very little power so it can be used with laptops without draining the battery.</p>



<p>This drive can be used as <strong>extra storage for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X systems</strong> that fill up their internal storage faster than you can delete old games. You can store PS4 and Xbox One games on the drive and play them right away without having to copy them back to the console’s internal storage. However, you have to transfer PS5 and Series X games back to the console’s SSD before you can play them.</p>
<p>For $64, you can get 2TB of reliable storage that is $20 to $50 less than most other drives. Plus, you get Seagate’s reputation for durability and a rescue service, so you don’t have to worry about buying an unknown brand. The price works out to about 3 cents per gigabyte, which is better than cloud storage subscriptions after just a few months of use.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Goes Zero-Margin Beyond Its Star Wars Line, Jurassic World Dinosaur Falls to Year-End Clearance Pricing After Black Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/black-friday-drops-legos-jurassic-world-dinosaur-fossils-t-rex-skull-by-38-2000648149</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Have little ones who can’t get enough of dinosaurs? Surprising them with a buildable T. rex skull is going to light them up instantly, and today is a great time to pick one up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6082/">LEGO’s Jurassic World Dinosaur Fossils: T Rex Skull building set, which gets you a posable T. rex skull, plus a fossilized footprint with a plaque, is currently sitting at just $25 on Amazon.</a> That’s after a 38% discount on its retail price of $40, and the price is the lowest we have seen in quite some time. It’s a Cyber Monday deal, and the holiday rush is going to set in quickly. We recommend grabbing it fast, as the offer (or the stock) is likely going to end soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6082/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Display Worthy</h2>
<p>This fun set is made for ages 9 and up, and gets you a total of 577 pieces. It’s not going to be one of those massive projects that require week-long dedication, and won’t be a super quick job either. Think of it as a fun little weekend activity that your kids can begin on a Saturday and be done with by Sunday.</p>
<p>Attention to detail is truly impressive. You’ll be building a fairly realistic dino toy; a T. rex skull with dinosaur bones that sits on a display stand. You can choose to keep the jaws open for a scary look or close them when letting the beast rest. The skull is paired with the fossilized footprint, plus a plaque that displays some cool facts about the Tyrannosaurus. Kids can learn about the height of the giant, its weight, dietary preferences, and more as they build. There’s a hidden amber piece added somewhere in there to add a little mystery for the curious minds, too. Finish off by adding some LEGO plants around for a foresty feel.</p>



<p>Once made, the set measures over 8 in. (21 cm) high. Place it on a shelf in the living room, or in the kids’ play area; it’s going to look stunning everywhere. You can display the skull, amber, and footprint in different ways. It’s going to look great on its own, and even pair it with other Jurassic World kits for a fuller setup.</p>
<p>Like all LEGO sets, this too comes with a detailed instruction manual. The guidebook takes you through each step, and is pretty easy to follow. But for additional assistance, you can install the LEGO Builder app, as well. The platform offers 3D instructions, plus lets you zoom in on the blocks from each angle to get a better understanding. Kids can save all their sets, track progress, and even build with friends!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6082/">This deal lets you grab it for just $25, which is basically nothing for the experience the set offers</a>. Now is a great time to bring one, or even two of these home for the little dino lovers in your life without blowing your budget. That said, there’s plenty more going at a discount right now. Black Friday is over, but you can still pick everything from kitchen essentials to high-ticket items like TVs, smart home devices, tech gadgets, and more without paying the full price. Just note that most discounts are short-lived. If you see something you like, don’t wait too long to grab it.</p>

		<p>It’s felt like a pretty subdued week, with the US focussing on its holiday, and Black Friday sales not being terribly interesting or exciting this time around, to my mind at least. Some good indie game sales, but when the price for a game is only coming down to £35+, it’s harder to get worked up about that. But did you manage to grab any bargains?</p>
<p>Outside of that, I guess we have to give in and accept that it’s Christmas. You could be strict and hold out until Monday, but I’ll be putting up a tree and decorations this weekend.</p>

              <p>If you want to modernize your home without getting rid of all your old appliances, traditional stores can be very frustrating. A <strong>smart plug is great because it turns any regular appliance into a connected device</strong> without you having to buy expensive smart versions of everything: You don’t need to spend $200 on a smart lamp when you can use a simple plug to make your $30 lamp respond to voice commands and set routines. But the good news is that during Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5877/">Amazon’s smart plug goes down to $12 for Black Friday, which is less than its usual price of $24</a>. This looks like a move by Amazon to<strong> get more homes connected to Alexa</strong> without making any money.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5877/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Voice Control at a Reasonable Price</h2>
<p>The Amazon smart plug controls the flow of electricity to whatever you plug into it: This means that <strong>any device that has a physical on/off switch can be controlled by Alexa</strong>: Your coffee maker can start brewing before you get out of bed, your lamp in the living room can turn on when you say <em>“Alexa, good morning,”</em> and the box fan in your bedroom can turn off by itself when you fall asleep. The<strong> plug connects directly to your Wi-Fi network</strong> so you don’t need to buy a separate smart home hub and it only takes a few minutes to set up through the Alexa app. Once it’s connected, the plug will automatically reconnect after a power outage or Wi-Fi problem.</p>



<p>The small size of 2.2 inches deep by 3.2 inches wide by 1.5 inches high k<strong>eeps your second outlet free</strong> for another plug or device. This is more important than you might think because a lot of smart plugs are too big to fit in both outlets so you have to choose which device to use. The plug works with any household item that runs on 120 volts, from table lamps and fans to coffee makers and holiday lights. You can also<strong> use the Alexa app to set up routines</strong> that link together different tasks: For example, when you say <em>“Alexa, I’m home,”</em> your entryway lights will turn on and your coffee maker will start.</p>
<p>You can control devices from anywhere in your home <strong>without getting up because the plug works with Alexa’s voice control system</strong>, and you can also control <strong>everything from the Alexa app when you’re not home</strong>. This lets you turn off devices you forgot about or make it look like someone is home while you’re away. You can set your lights to turn on at sunset or your fan to turn off after two hours without having to remember.</p>
<p>For $12, this is a great deal for making your current devices smart instead of buying expensive new ones that are already connected. A smart lamp usually costs $50 to $100 more than a regular lamp: With this plug, you can add the same features to any lamp you already own for a lot less money. Black Friday is the best time to buy them if you want to automate several outlets in your home without spending hundreds of dollars on separate smart devices.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-popular-bose-quietcomfort-noise-cancelling-headphones-are-back-to-its-lowest-price-ever-for-black-friday-2000648466</link>
            <guid>1368127</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="146" data-end="748">The holiday season is in full swing, with city streets glowing under festive winter lights and all of us eagerly searching for the perfect gifts for friends, family, and loved ones. Black Friday weekend has officially arrived, too, bringing some of the year’s most attractive deals on popular tech products. One standout offer on Amazon features a major discount on a top-rated pair of Bose headphones. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6081/">For a limited time, the Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones are available at an impressive 43% off</a>. The price has dropped from the usual $349 to just $199, giving you a substantial $150 in savings.</p>
<p data-start="750" data-end="1214">People who spend lots of time on public transportation or endure frequent flights can really benefit tremendously from a solid pair of noise-canceling headphones. The Bose QuietComfort headphones can help you create a calm, focused soundscape by removing unwanted background noises. Enjoy you music, podcasts, audiobooks, or any other audio without being interrupted by the bustle of everyday life.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6081/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="750" data-end="1214">How Does Noise Cancellation Work?</h2>
<p data-start="1216" data-end="1714">The underlying technology of noise cancellation is pretty ingenious. Built-in microphones positioned on the outside of the headphones listen to the sounds around you. The headphones then generate soundwaves that mirror incoming noise but invert those waves. When the original noise and the inverted signal meet, they effectively cancel each other out. This process reduces these distracting background noises significantly, leaving only the audio coming from your connected device.</p>
<p data-start="1716" data-end="2199">The Bose QuietComfort headphones offer two distinct listening modes: Quiet and Aware. Quiet mode engages full noise cancellation, ideal for situations where total focus is desired. Aware mode, on the other hand, allows outside sounds to flow through naturally. This option is good for when staying alert to one’s surroundings is important, like working in an office and someone might need to get your attention or when navigating busy areas where hearing traffic and other activity is key for your own safety.</p>


<p data-start="1716" data-end="2199">The plush padding of the over-ear cushions and headband are designed for all-day comfort—and you might even be finding yourself wearing them all day with the exceptional battery life.</p>
<p data-start="1716" data-end="2199">The headphones can provide a full 24 hours of listening time on a single charge. This will keep you able to listen to your favorite turns through your whole commute, entire work day, and commute home. If you every find yourself having forgotten to charge the headphones, no sweat. Plugging in the Bose QuietComfort headphones for just 15 minutes will grant you up to two and a half additional hours of playtime. The headphones charge over USB-C.</p>
<p data-start="2201" data-end="2672">The QuietComfort headphones come in a wide assortment of colors, so you can choose a style that suits your preference. Options include cypress green, chilled lilac, petal pink, twilight blue, sandstone, moonlight gray, white smoke, and a classic black. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6081/">All of these colors are priced at the discounted $199 level for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Linus Tech Tips Thinks the Steam Machine Price Will be Around $700]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-machine-price-analysis/</link>
            <guid>1368124</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new video posted to their YouTube channel, Linus Tech Tips has broken down the cost of the hardware that will be added to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-machine-everything-to-know-about-valves-new-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a> to get a sense of how much the console be priced. Spoiler alert… It’s likely to be much more than people thought online.</p>



<p>According to Linus Tech Tips, the parts at their historical low price will cost around $602, but that number has increased significantly in recent months by a whopping 50%, bringing the price to around $900.</p>



<p>As Linus Tech Tips rightfully pointed out, though, these prices are for name brands, and they think the cost can be reduced to around $813 at retail. However, Valve does have a direct-to-consumer model, meaning that it doesn’t need the traditional retailer margins of around 10%.</p>



<p>The question is then, how much profit does Valve want per console? Traditionally, console manufacturers have subsidised or even taken a loss on their consoles, while subscription models and software are their profit centres. </p>



<h2 id="h-steam-machine-will-cost-700">Steam Machine Will Cost $700?</h2>



<p>The conclusions led Linus Tech Tips to believe that the Steam Machine will cost approximately $699, if the hardware prices remain at the prices they do today. Linus Tech Tips then went on to say $800 at most if the hardware market continues to climb at the unprecedented rate it has been going. That could be a hard sell when the <a href="https://amzn.to/48iMmlb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5 is only $399</a> at the moment.</p>



<p>And remember… This is for a model with a 500GB SSD… Not 1TB / 2TB.</p>



<p>You can watch Linus Tech Tips’ full analysis and breakdown below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Personally, though, I think that the Steam Machine might be a little pricier. I would think that $799-849 would be the 512GB version, with a 2TB costing $999. But then and again, maybe I am just a little loopy when it comes to pricing. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[The 10 Best Metroid Games]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-metroid-games</link>
            <guid>1368121</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Since 1986 the Metroid series has gone from 2D to 3D (and back to 2D) and to consoles and portables, with plenty of Samus appearances and cameos in other games along the way. It’s responsible for co-creating the Metroidvania genre, leading to games like Hollow Knight and Ori and the Blind Forest and dozens more. And hey, it's even dabbled in pinball and soccer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on the way, it’s the perfect time to look back on this incredible series. Here are what we consider the top 10 Metroid games, judged by the all-important factors of level and map design, progression, innovation, and lasting legacy. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Metroid 2: Return of Samus</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/metroid-2-1763025727531.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">These days, one of the most basic functions expected of a Metroidvania game is map screen that slowly reveals itself as you explore its maze-like network of corridors and hidden rooms. But back in 1991, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-ii-return-of-samus">Metroid 2: Return of Samus</a> arrived on the Nintendo Game Boy, that wasn’t exactly standard practice yet. That makes Metroid 2 feel a bit on the obtuse side, especially since its main focus is sending Samus to SR388 on a planet-wide quest to hunt down every last Metroid left with no real way to track their locations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you persevered and played along with your own hand drawn map (or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/oopo2z/metroid_2_return_of_samus_guide_from_nintendo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one tucked inside an issue of Nintendo Power</a>) you were rewarded with a pocket-sized Metroid game complete with all of Samus’ signature moves and weapons from the NES game, even if the benefits of portability also meant playing on a fuzzy little puke-green Game Boy screen. Still, from its big character sprites, tense chiptune music, and lonely, claustrophobic setting, there’s something really special about Metroid 2. And for people wishing Metroid 2 had a few more modern features, 2017’s excellent 3DS remake from MercurySteam totally delivers on that front, but hey, we’ll talk about that one more in a bit.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Metroid</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/metroid-1763025831686.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Inspired by the 1979 sci-fi film Alien as well as previous Nintendo hits like Super Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda, the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid">Metroid</a> game was unlike anything else at the time. Sure there had been tons of space shooters and platforming games released by the time Metroid arrived in 1986, but none of them had ever brought so many elements of those genres together in the same place, complete with a huge map with horizontally and vertically scrolling screens. What made Metroid especially unique at the time was the way its protagonist Samus controlled and explored through unique power-ups, like the ability to turn into a ball and explore hidden tunnels, or the “screw attack” jump that allowed you to rapidly flip up walls and corridors, tearing through ugly space monsters along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also established grotesque creature villains like Kraid, Ridley, and Mother Brain, all of whom continued to show up in Metroid games for decades to come. And it concluded with one of the most clever NES game ending sequences ever: a frantic escape from a ticking time bomb after defeating the game’s main boss. And perhaps one of the coolest surprises was its multiple endings, several of which revealed that bounty hunter Samus Aran was a woman the entire time, a concept that was pretty uncommon for video games in the mid ‘80s. So much of what makes modern Metroid games so incredible can be traced back to the revolutionary original NES game, and the same can be said for the entire Metroidvania genre as a whole.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Metroid: Samus Returns</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/samus-returns-1763025916151.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-samus-returns">Metroid: Samus Returns</a> took all of the promise of the original Game Boy game Metroid: Return of Samus and completely rebuilt it from the ground up and presented it in full color, glasses-free 3D, complete with totally overhauled graphics, newly remade music, and a much improved combat system that gave Samus an uppercut style melee attack to knock back enemies between bursts of arm cannon blasts and morph ball bombs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s still ultimately a remake of a fairly one-note Metroid game, but finally having a map (viewable at all times thanks to the 3DS’ second screen,) snappy, fluid player movement, and offensive options against adversaries makes Samus Returns feel distinctly like its own thing. After Team Ninja’s wobbly and unsatisfying Metroid: Other M in 2010, fans were justified in worrying that another outside developer handling the Metroid franchise wouldn’t exactly lead to the best results, but MercurySteam proved it had what it takes to make a very good Metroid game. And, eventually, it would even make a great one. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/metroid-prime-2-1763026042183.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While nowhere near as revolutionary as its predecessor, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-2-echoes">Metroid Prime 2</a> is a rock solid sequel that introduces a really cool light and dark parallel dimension mechanic; a classic Nintendo gameplay trope established in The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past’s light and dark worlds that allows you to explore alternate versions of the same levels to hunt for power-ups and suit upgrades that help you better survive in each one. With that concept Prime 2 also introduced Dark Samus, a character that sounds exactly like what you’d expect: a dark, evil version of Samus, which unsurprisingly turned out to be really cool. So cool, in fact, that Dark Samus went on to become an assist trophy and eventually a fully playable character in the Smash Bros. games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime 2 also introduced a pretty barebones Metroid multiplayer mode that felt like a response to the success of games like Halo at the time, and while four different colored versions of Samus strafing in circles while they shoot at each other might not seem like the most interesting thing to do in a Metroid game, it was somehow entertaining enough to work in short bursts between trying to one hundred percent the main campaign.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Metroid Fusion</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/metroid-fusion-1763026186885.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After an eight year hiatus from Metroid games (the series skipped over the entire Nintendo 64 generation, after all) the year 2002 brought us two new entries in the series across the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance, the latter of which was a classic 2D sidescrolling Metroid game with gorgeous pixel art and an endlessly replayable campaign. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-fusion">Metroid Fusion</a> built on all of the excellent gameplay established in the SNES classic Super Metroid, and although it didn’t quite hit the same highs, it’s still a very awesome game on its own, held back only by its slightly more linear exploration and overly talky commanding officer character, Adam Malkovich. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Metroid Fusion immediately stood on its own as a tight, briskly paced Metroid game that instantly became a huge hit with the speedrunning community thanks largely to its multiple ending unlocks that appear depending on completion time and percentage finished. Samus came back in a big way in 2002 and reminded people that Metroid was here to stay as one of the best video game franchises ever created.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/metroid-prime-3-1763026349284.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">By 2007, the Metroid series had gone 2D, 3D, had touch screen controls, and had become a rumble pack-infused pinball game, so obviously the natural next step was a Nintendo Wii motion and pointer controlled game, as was tradition at the time. Luckily, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-3-corruption">Metroid Prime 3</a> largely avoided many of the frustrations and pratfalls that several other franchise sequels stumbled on during the awkward "waggle era" of gaming that we’ve largely moved on from as a species. And while some of the motion control implementation in Prime 3 felt a little finicky at times, pointing a Wii remote at the screen to blast away at enemies was immensely satisfying. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Better than that, though, Prime 3 also capped off the excellent Prime trilogy with a more beautiful and breathtaking world that added more verticality and cool new traversal methods, along with “hyper mode” which gave Samus the option to go full on attack frenzy at the expense of her health. Metroid Prime 3 was a fantastic send off for the Prime franchise at the time when none of us had any idea it wouldn’t get a sequel for eighteen years. Unless, of course, you count the 3DS game Metroid Prime: Federation Force... which we definitely won’t, even if it did tease Metroid Prime 4 in its secret ending. True story.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Metroid: Zero Mission</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/metroid-zero-mission-1763026399657.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The second Metroid game on the Game Boy Advance is also a remake of the first Metroid game ever released, with a stunning new 16-bit pixel art overhaul, taking notes from Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion to improve the original NES game in just about every conceivable way. Every boss fight feels bigger and better, the improved soundtrack rocks, and hey, there’s even an actual map now! And if you ever get nostalgic for the original, it’s unlockable here, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, multiple difficulty options made their way to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-zero-mission">Zero Mission</a>, along with new cutscenes, a time attack mode, and a gallery of images that you can uncover by performing specific criteria. While the original NES game was revolutionary at the time and still has its charm today, Zero Mission is truly the best way to experience the game that started it all for the Metroid series. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Metroid Dread</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/metroid-dread-1763026521682.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While the remake Samus Returns for the 3DS was MercurySteam’s first effort at a Metroid game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-dread">Metroid Dread</a> was a totally original adventure that added a whole new twist, creating one of the most tense and exhilarating Metroid experiences to date. Being constantly hunted by E.M.M.I, the fast, hulking, and intelligent killer robots ready to end Samus’ mission in seconds, meant that the typical explore-at-your-own-pace gameplay of the traditional Metroid mission was frequently replaced with tense and dangerous urgency.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MercurySteam also took the melee combat and parrying system from Samus Returns and improved it, making close quarters fights feel better than ever, which, with the snappier controls and increased player speed, allows Metroid Dread to go pound-for-pound with the best modern Metroidvanias. Dread is also the toughest game in the series since the original NES Metroid, but manages to never feel cheap or padded thanks to its brilliant map design and liberal checkpoint system. In an ideal world, MercurySteam is giving us a new 2D Metroid every few years while Retro Studios continues to make 3D Prime games, giving us the best of both worlds for this legendary series.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Metroid Prime</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/metroid-prime-1763026689679.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">On the N64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, and Donkey Kong 64 all proved that once 2D Nintendo franchises could successfully make the jump to 3D, but unfortunately, this era didn’t involve a brand new 3D Metroid game, or really, any new Metroid game at all. But in 2002, Retro Studios did the unthinkable: it successfully transformed the classic feel of Super Metroid into a stunning, atmospheric, and revolutionary first-person action platforming game with fantastic shooting mechanics and an incredible world to explore. From seeing small drops of condensation build around Samus’ visor to the first time we stepped into the icy Phendrana Drifts as the camera panned out and the piano music swelled, we knew we were experiencing something magical. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything from morph ball exploration to suit upgrades and an ever evolving arsenal of weaponry and traversal tools made their way into our hands in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> after the franchise had been largely dormant for eight years. Boss fights and explosive set pieces brought the series to epic new heights, setting the stage for future Metroid Prime games for years to come. At the time, standard first person shooters were a dime a dozen, but there was really nothing like Metroid Prime. Not only that, but twenty years later, Prime still holds up well, as proven by the Nintendo Switch release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-review">Metroid Prime Remastered.</a></p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Super Metroid</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/super-metroid-1763026798566.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Almost three decades later and after a wide variety of experimentation across various genres, perspectives, and control methods, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-metroid">Super Metroid</a> still remains the greatest Metroid game of all time. In fact, Super Metroid set the bar so high that the team behind it couldn’t figure out how to top it during the entire Nintendo 64 era, so the Metroid series just took that generation off like it was a victory lap. Super Metroid still feels amazing and is still enjoyed by new players and hardcore speedrunning obsessives alike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But why? Well, it's perfectly paced and has some of the most rewarding exploration, meticulously crafted level design, pulse pounding music, and some of the best looking pixel art of all time. Like several of its most successful Super Nintendo contemporaries, it took everything that worked in the previous NES installment and improved it, making one of the greatest and most iconic sidescrolling action games ever made. Super Metroid helped define both the future of the series and the genre as a whole. It’s a master class in game design and one that both indie and triple-A game developers have been citing as an inspiration for nearly thirty years now. It’s not only the best Metroid game, it’s one of the best video games ever made. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there you have it, the top 10 Metroid games leading up to the launch of the highly anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. Once the new instalment releases it will join a lineup of fifteen games with Metroid in the title, all of which I made sure to give a nod to in this article, even if only ten of them made the list. So what’s your favorite Metroid game ever made? Which game do you wish made the list or got bumped higher or lower? Are you a diehard defender of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-other-m">Metroid: Other M</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-federation-force">Federation Force</a>? Did you play hundreds of hours of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-hunters-first-hunt">Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt</a> demo when the Nintendo DS launched like I did? Morph ball bomb into the comments below and tell me all about it. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-metroid-games]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Govee Speaker Lamp (Sound by JBL) Is Still Alive at Its Black Friday Price, Listen to ‘Golden’ With Music-Light Sync This Holiday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-table-lamp-2-pro-x-sound-by-jbl-2000648503</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="56" data-end="537">With Black Friday weekend finally here, you can save big across essentially every category of products. Whether you’re looking for a new espresso machine to treat yourself to barista-level lattes in the morning or if you’re hoping to snag a new 4K monitor for your gaming PC, now is the weekend to find what you’re looking for. If you’re just perusing the web this weekend for something you maybe don’t “need” but seems like a cool thing to have, this could be just the thing. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6080/">The Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro x Sound by JBL has come down by 25%.</a> This Bluetooth speaker and lightshow in one normally goes for $180, but Black Friday has it down to just $135. You end up saving yourself $45.</p>
<p data-start="56" data-end="537">Govee’s smart table lamp offers a fun way to mix both sound and light at your next party, synchronizing the light and color to the music playing through its speaker. The lamp’s integrated chipset and advanced algorithm allow it to respond to music in real-time with a 32ms response time. This ensures the lights stay in perfect sync with every beat, making your music come alive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6080/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="56" data-end="537">Set the Perfect Atmosphere</h2>
<p data-start="539" data-end="902">The lamp features 16 different music modes that adjust the lighting based on the rhythm of your music. You can switch between modes to match the mood, whether you’re hosting a lively party or trying to create a more relaxing vibe to wind down to.</p>
<p data-start="904" data-end="1318">This lamp is equipped with 210 high-density LED beads—20% more than previous versions—ensuring sharper, more vibrant colors. You can individually adjust each bead’s color, allowing you to create a personalized lighting scheme. Experiment with the colors as you turn your room into a unique light show.</p>
<p data-start="1320" data-end="1743">Sound quality is just as impressive as the lighting as the Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro is made in collaboration with JBL. Powered by a compact 2.5-inch, 500cc full-range speaker and backed by JBL’s equalizer algorithm, the audio is crisp and full of depth. For a more immersive experience, you can even pair two lamps together for stereo sound, with synchronized light effects to match.</p>


<p data-start="1320" data-end="1743">For those who want to take it even further, the Music DreamView feature allows you to synchronize the lamp with up to 10 other Govee lights. This turns your entire room into a synchronized light and sound experience, heightening the atmosphere (or perhaps causing sensory overload) for any occasion.</p>
<p data-start="1745" data-end="2034">This smart lamp offers up to 4.5 hours of continuous light and sound on a single charge. Note that that’s with volume and brightness set at 50%. The lamp has adjustable brightness (600lm) and a wide color temperature range (2700K–6500K). Fine tune it to your needs.</p>
<p data-start="2274" data-end="2533">The Govee Home app unlocks more personalization options, giving you full control over the lighting in your space. Voice control is possible with compatibility for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Matter, allowing you to adjust the settings or switch modes just by asking. Even set custom routines. You can make it so when you say, “Alexa, I’m going up, up, up,” the Govee lamp automatically shifts to a bright, golden hue and starts blasting “Golden” by Huntrix from <em>K-Pop Demon Hunters</em>.</p>
