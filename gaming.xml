			<p>Starfield could be getting a highly requested feature in <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-beta-update-bethesda-reiterates-exciting-things/">future patches</a>, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>As reported on the game's subreddit, plenty of evidence has been found in the code of the latest two updates which suggests that an <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-mod-interplanetary-engines-adds-in-system-travel-without-using-the-console/">interplanetary travel mechanic</a> that would allow players to travel between two different planets in the same system, which is a feature many have been asking for since the game's release, could be in the works. Sadly, seamless space to planet surface landing doesn't seem to be in the works, at least going by the game's current code, so we shouldn't expect the game by Bethesda to suddenly turn into Elite Dangerous or No Man's Sky anytime soon, if ever.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although there's the chance that this feature will never make it into the game for any reason, the fact that a new big feature is seemingly in the works aligns with other rumors that have been circulating on Starfield these past few weeks. Reportedly, new quality-of-life improvements are coming to the game, alongside a second expansion, when the game will debut on PlayStation 5 during <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-2026-poor-sales/">Spring 2026</a>. The PlayStation 5 release was originally planned for <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-announced-playstation-5/">this year</a>, but a decision to delay this new version of the game to 2026 was made folliwing the low sales of the first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">Shattered Space</a>.</p>



<p>Although&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">I did enjoy Starfield</a>&nbsp;when it launched in 2023, my opinion of the game soured rather quickly as I returned to it before the launch of the Shattered Space expansion, which did little to alleviate the base game's most critical issues. Hopefully, the rumored new quality of life improvements and the new expansion will breathe new life into a game that has yet to achieve the full potential its solid foundation offers.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending-next-year.1263222/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced that&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>PS4 support will be ending next year, and that various functions relating to the game's PS4 version will be winding down over the next few months as well.</p>

<p>As revealed in an <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408849" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a> on the HoYoverse website, support for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>on PS4 will end on April 10th next year, at which point you'll no longer be able to log into the game on Sony's last-gen machine.</p>

<p>Additionally, from September 10th this year, if you've never downloaded&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>on PS4 before, you'll no longer be able to do so. If, however, you have downloaded the game on your PS4 prior to that date, you'll still be able to download it again if you wish (until April, anyway).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending-characters.jpg?itok=d6YKi40B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending-characters.jpg?itok=x-84fIr6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Genshin Impact</em>'s PS4 support is ending next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Following the PS4 version's delisting in September, in-game purchases will be removed from this version of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>on February 25th next year, but if you've bought anything and have yet to claim it, you can do so until April.</p>

<p>Naturally, this delisting won't affect the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, nor will it have any impact (ahem) on other platforms like PC or mobile, so you'll still be able to play it everywhere else it's currently available.</p>

<p>As for why the game is being removed from PS4, HoYoverse says it's "due to limitations related to hardware performance and platform application size".</p>

<p>On what is almost certainly a related note, the studio also <a href="https://x.com/GenshinImpact/status/1952942713046774172" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed earlier today</a> that device specs for other versions of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>will be raised following the next version update (which doesn't have a release date yet). It's likely the PS4 wouldn't be able to handle what HoYoverse has planned for the game in future.</p>




<p>This news follows the release of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-58-july" rel="nofollow">Version 5.8 last month</a>, which is likely to be the last 5.x update before Version 6.0, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-us-age-verification-to-kick-in-later-this-month" rel="nofollow">introduction of age verification</a> for players in the US earlier this year.</p>

<p>For the time being,&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is still available on PS4, and you can also download and play it for free across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and mobile devices. Stay tuned for more.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hell is Us | Investigation Gameplay Walkthrough</p>
      </div>
<p>This game puts players in the role of Remi, a United Nations peacekeeper who is accompanied by a drone as he goes AWOL into his homeland, Hadea, to find his missing parents. What he discovers is that supernatural creatures called Hollow Walkers have infested the country. Although the drone can help Remi defend himself, he'll primarily use melee weapons, including swords, polearms, and axes.</p><p>GameSpot had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hell-is-us-intriguingly-bold-design-decisions-refuse-to-give-you-a-hint/1100-6531798/" data-ref-id="1100-6531798">a hands-on experience with Hell is Us</a> in May, which demonstrated the developers' unwillingness to hold the player's hand. Instead of using traditional means to tell players what to do and where to go, Hell is Us requires them to figure it out themselves without much in the way of hints. Players will have to pay close attention to in-game conversations with NPCs to get enough information to move forward, in the souls-like tradition.</p><p>Hell is Us will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on September 4. However, fans who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/preorders-for-exploration-focused-action-rpg-hell-is-us-are-now-live/1100-6533334/" data-ref-id="1100-6533334">preorder Hell is Us: Deluxe Edition</a> will get three days of early access starting on September 1.</p>

Well, it looks about as elegant as you could reasonably expect.</p>
<p>The vehicle is aided by the Honda Riding Assist system, which means it's able to operate and move independently. You can check this out in the video below, but don't expect blistering speeds out of this one. The bike is equipped with stabilisers, presumably to simply keep it upright, but it's moving at an almost laughably slow speed.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-mwkAYKvypQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0a5hsqvrp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mwkAYKvypQ" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Granted, we were never expecting the Koraidon bike to achieve record-breaking speeds, but we definitely had something a <em>little</em> more impressive in mind.</p>
<p>Still, the actual design is pretty cool, but we can't imagine Honda actually making proper production models of the bike anytime soon. It seems this is definitely a one-off to promote <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> for the Switch.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Horror game Vile: Exhumed, which sees you delving into a 90s computer to uncover a man's obsession with an adult film actress, has launched as a free download after being "wrongly banned" from Steam over sexual content, according to developer Cara Cadaver of Final Girl Games.</p>
<p>Initially released via <a href="https://final-girl-games.itch.io/vile">Itch.io</a> (where that version remains live), the game was set to to debut on Steam on July 22, but had its page on Valve's platform pulled down. Cadaver and publisher DreadXP say "sexual content with depictions of real people" was the reasoning given for this by Valve, despit the game featuring "no uncensored nudity, no depictions of sex acts, and no pornography".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, Cadaver's now elected to release the game as a free download under a Creative Commons lisence, via <a href="https://dreadxp.com/vile-is-banned/">vileisbanned.com</a>. "This felt like the best option to make the game available to as many people as possible," the developer wrote. "Trying to release on a different storefront would only open us up to the same problem we ran into with Steam."</p>
<p>There's still the option to pay Cadaver and DreadXP for the game if you wish, with the two parties set to donate 50% of the profits to Canadian charity the <a href="https://www.reddoorshelter.ca/">Red Door Family Shelter</a>, which provides "emergency shelter and support for women and children affected by domestic abuse, families experiencing a housing crisis, and refugee claimants with nowhere else to turn."</p>

<p>"The game covers topics of assault, abuse, and entitlement, and uses a combination of FMV and practical effects to create images as horrifying as the themes. This was never a secret," the developer wrote. "This censorship of my work is a direct attack on creative expression and artistic freedom, and it will not stop with false accusations of sexual content. They will come for anything that speaks more loudly than they do."</p>
<p>We've asked Valve for comment. The context here is that both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-point-to-mastercard-restrictions-as-the-payment-firm-deny-influencing-adult-game-removals">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing">Itch.io</a> have recently changed their policies to give payment processors control over what constitutes adult content, as a knock-on effect of Australian anti-porn activists <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">Collective Shout</a> putting pressure on those processors to do something about adult games which the group view as "sexually violent" or which they feel otherwise sexualise or objectify women.</p>
<p>The question is who gets to decide what's dodgy smut and what's a serious work digging into issues like misogyny and parasocial obsession. Both kinds of game might end up depicting or alluding to similar things, after all, and it's impossible to have important conversations about such problems if you're not even allowed to bring them up. If it <em>was</em> pulled as part of the storefront's recent changes to how it handles NSFW content, Vile: Exhumed would be an example of the sort of game folks feared might be put at risk by giving banks and credit card firms extra power over what gets the thumbs up. </p>
<p>It's possible Vile: Exhumed might not have been pulled as a direct result of these recent changes, mind. Our game of the year 2024 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mouthwashing">Mouthwashing</a> was assumed to have been nixed from Itch.io as a part of that platform's mass de-adulting, but was subsequently revealed to have been delisted due to an older change. Either way, if you want to give Cadaver's work a go, you're now free to do so.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-being-wrongly-banned-from-steam-over-sexual-content-rules-horror-game-vile-exhumed-launches-for-free]]></content:encoded>

              <p>HoYoverse, the studio behind the mega-hit&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, has announced that the game will no longer be supported on the PS4. Not only will the game no longer receive updates on the older console by next spring, but it’s due to be removed from the PlayStation store next month, and will lose all its in-game purchases by February 2026. By the end of this process, you won’t be able to play the game on PS4 at all.</p> <p>“Due to limitations related to hardware performance and platform application size,” <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408849">a statement from HoYoverse begins</a>, “we will be discontinuing our support and updates for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em> on PS4 in future versions.” This process will begin on September 9, 2025, when the open-world RPG will be removed from the PlayStation Store. That means, if you haven’t added the game to your PS4 before that date, it’ll disappear from search results and no longer be listed as available to download.</p> <p>Following this, after February 25, 2026, all of <em>Genshin Impact</em>‘s in-game purchases will be removed as well, both from the PS Store and from the game itself. That means if you’ve bought anything from the store but have yet to claim it in-game, you’ll need to do that before February or risk losing it entirely.</p>

 <p>Finally, on March 8, 2026, the game will lose all PS4 support and will no longer allow players to log in, and that’s that. Of course, people can use their accounts to continue playing the game on other systems, including the Xbox Series, PS5 and PC. Or even mobile.</p> <p>And it’s this last part that makes the decision somewhat confusing. No one can argue that HoYoverse isn’t given plenty of warning to PS4 players–it’s eight months until the game will become inaccessible–but the reasons given seem a little strange when the game runs fine on mobile devices. The PlayStation 4 released in 2013, so is clearly pretty old tech, but it does seem odd that the stated issues regarding hardware and install size wouldn’t also affect cellphones. The game’s listed requirements for Android are 8GB of storage and 3GB of memory, working on anything from an Arm v8a 64-bit chip or higher–an architecture that’s been around since 2011. It’s a bit more needy on iOS, wanting anything from 2017’s iPhone 8 onward. Meanwhile, the PS4 launched with 8GB of RAM and 500GB storage, which would therefore seem plenty. Of course, it could be far more complicated than this, and we’ve reached out to HoYoverse to ask for more information about what’s caused the issues.</p> <p>Either way, this still sucks for PS4 owners, and speaks to the impermanence of modern games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sniping looks incredible in Battlefield 6, but there has been a consistent complaint: Sniper Glint. A Battlefield 6 dev has addressed this via social media and promises big changes coming to the game mechanic.</p>



<p>Nearly everything about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-phantom-edition-contents-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has looked impressive. Battlefield Labs has been an eye-opening experience, with hundreds and thousands of matches taking place. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-peaks-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BF6 beta</a> opens up the player pool significantly, and we can see for ourselves what it looks and feels like.</p>



<p>But gameplay leaks and official footage have already shown how extreme Sniper Glint is.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-sniper-glint-will-be-toned-down">Battlefield 6 Sniper Glint Will be “Toned Down”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I’m blind. Image via Battlefield Studios </figcaption></figure>



<p>Being a sniper is all about stealth and secrecy. Ensuring your position isn’t compromised so the enemy can be neutralized without a fuss. A social media post from <a href="https://x.com/TheBFWire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Wire</a> shows how exposed snipers are when aiming down their scopes.</p>



<p>It’s so distinct that the page even asked: “Do you think that Battlefield 6 should have Sniper Glint?”</p>







<p>Well, it caught the attention of Florian Le Bihan AKA DRUNKKZ3—a former player turned Principal Game Designer for DICE. They replied: “Yes. It’ll get toned down in scale a bit but it’s here to stay.”</p>



<p>Sniper Glint isn’t going anywhere. This is a good thing, as no Sniper Glint would be unfair. With no killcams and expansive maps, while snipers could do what the role asks of them very well, it could be too OP.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Yes 🙂 It’ll get toned down in scale a bit but it’s here to stay</span></p></article></div>



<p>We don’t know the scale of the Sniper Glint nerfs. It’s likely DICE will tweak the glint until the developer and player base are happy with the changes. How problematic do you think Sniper Glint is in its current state? How much is too much? Let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/you-asked-they-listened-phasmophobias-newest-map-will-be-a-small-one-based-on-a-classic-american-diner</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-asked-they-listened-phasmophobias-newest-map-will-be-a-small-one-based-on-a-classic-american-diner.1263186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Kinetic Games has laid out some of its future plans for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>, including a new map coming to the ghost hunting jump-fest.</p>
<p>The upcoming map is known as Nell's Diner, and has been inspired by those classic American diners that often pop up in films when impossibly slim actors eat a plate of bacon loaded waffles with a side of pie, a coffee and a milkshake (why no, I haven't had breakfast yet, why do you ask?). </p>
<p>According to the developer, in terms of size Nell's Diner will be a tad larger than 6 Tanglewood Drive. The team said it recognised that Phasmophobia's smaller maps tend to be more popular, as they allow for "quicker but intense investigations full of memorable moments", and Nell's Diner will accommodate that.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The diner itself is a work in progress right now, and doesn't have a release date, but the current plan is for it to have 13 unique rooms. Of those 13, 11 will be possible ghost rooms, and one is a freezer which will make it harder to use that trusty thermometer to seek out a ghost in there. As is standard, Nell's Diner will also include places to hide during a ghost hunt, which I often forget to seek out whenever the time actually comes to it, and so I do tend to die quite a lot when I play Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>Kinetic Games also shared some concept art for Nell's Diner, which you can see in the header image and below. The developer explained that the diner can be found on its own on a "winding desert highway", and immediately serves up "Phasmophobia's trademark sense of dread and curiosity".</p>
<p>There will also be some environmental story telling with this map when it goes live. "As seen by both the scene outside, as well as the recently abandoned Diner itself - where food still sits warm and tables are cluttered with plates and cutlery - something awful has taken place," the developer teased.</p>
<p>"What exactly has happened is of course up to you as a community to piece together. We're excited to hear your theories!"</p>
<p>Kinetic Games is keeping further details for now under wraps, but has said it will share more closer to the release of Nell's Diner. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Ahead of all that, though, fellow ghost hunters can look forward to the reworked Grafton Farmhouse, which will be launching on 12th August, across platforms. The Phasmophobia team has promised this will offer a "completely different experience" to its sister farmhouse (and recently reworked) Bleasdale.</p>
<p>"Now home to the aftermath of something truly harrowing, Grafton Farmhouse has seen better days," the developer teased. "Players conducting investigations will encounter a layout that, while feeling wholly familiar, offers a ton of new experiences as well as a brand new attic space, new interactions and much more."</p>

			<p>Battlefield 6's unique destruction mechanics are not possible on a generic engine like Unreal Engine 5, but this is only one reason why the series will hardly leave the Frostbite Engine behind.</p>



<p>Speaking with Spanish publication <a href="https://www.3djuegos.com/juegos/battlefield-2025/noticias/que-hacemos-no-posible-motor-generico-padres-battlefield-6-dicen-no-a-hacer-maletas-seguir-moda-industria">3DJuegos</a>, Senior Producer David Sirland commented on the possibility of the series ever switching to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine</a>, saying that the destruction mechanics seen in Battlefield 6 are not possible on a generic engine, as the Frostbite Engine is tailor-made for the new entry in the series and its features as much as the studio is tailoring the game itself for the engine. Achieving similar results on a generic game engine, pushing it to the limit, is achievable, Sirland added, but the developers are specialists with the engine, and he thinks this shows in the game. The Frostbite Engine being tailor-made for Battlefield 6 and the game itself being tailored for the engine isn't the only reason why the franchise is unlikely to leave its current engine behind, as the development studios are used to Frostbite and have engineers knowledgeable about the engine, which allows them to work in harmony, according to Producer Alexia Christofi, something that would likely require a lot of time to achieve with an engine switch.</p>



<p>Soon enough, players worldwide will be able to get a first, proper taste of Battlefield 6 ahead of its launch this October. The open beta, which is now available for <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-preload-now-available-matchmaking-skill/">pre-load</a>, will allow players to test out the game this weekend from August 9 to August 10 and from August 14 to August 17. The open beta includes, for the first weekend, the Iberian Offense, Liberation Peak, and Siege of Cairo maps, and a selection of play modes, including Conquest, Breakthrough, Domination, and King of the Hill.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 10. You can tide yourself over while waiting for the open beta to go live by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">first impressions</a> on the game.</p>

<figure><a title="RTA Japan - DK" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c519742fe14b6/rta-japan-dk.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Japan's largest speedrunning event, <a href="https://rtain.jp/">RTA</a>, is set to kick off later this week on 9th August, and will see some of the speediest gamers in the biz ploughing through the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cuphead">Cuphead</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">Nier: Automata</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim">Skyrim</a>, all in aid of Doctors Without Borders. We learnt a few months ago that Nintendo games would not be included in the lineup, and now the RTA group has explained why (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japans-biggest-charity-speedrunning-event-wont-have-nintendo-games-because-nintendo-couldnt-help-but-nintendo">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>In a new post shared on the <a href="https://rtain.jp/rtaij/nintendo/">RTA website</a> (and translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-owned-titles-excluded-from-japans-biggest-speedrunning-event-after-organizers-were-told-they-had-to-apply-for-permission-for-each-game/">Automaton</a>), the event organisers explain that they were contacted by Nintendo back in June, informing them that "as a legal entity, they would have to ask for permission in advance" if they wanted to feature any Nintendo game in the event. What's more, the Big N apparently stated that all previous instances of Nintendo games being streamed from the event are now considered "unauthorised use".</p>
<p>RTA has long featured Nintendo games in its lineup — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> is a staple, natch — but the Big N's interest this year seems to stem from the event's relatively recent (2020) transition into an official legal entity. The event remains non-profit, with all proceeds going to charity.</p>
<p>To be clear, this isn't necessarily the end of Nintendo's RTA appearances completely — the organisers state that they are working with Nintendo to get game permission for future events — but the proximity to the Summer 2025 event meant that the team couldn't possibly get all permissions through and approved in time.</p>
<p>It's disappointing to hear that RTA speedrunners won't get to take a pop at Mario &amp; co. this year, though it's hardly surprising. Let's not forget that Nintendo has historically been <em>very</em> cagey about which events can and cannot feature its titles. It <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/nintendo-releases-full-statement-after-cancellation-of-smash-world-tour">cancelled the Smash World Tour</a> back in 2022, and we regularly hear reports of streamers and other events that have been similarly hit by the ninjas.</p>
<p>Let's hope the permission-giving goes smoothly for RTA next year.</p>

			<p>Genshin Impact will drop PlayStation 4 support due to hardware limitations and platform application size, developer HoYoverse confirmed today.</p>



<p>The game's PlayStation 4 support will be phased out gradually, starting with the game's removal from the PlayStation Store on September 10. All those who have already downloaded the game will be able to continue playing until April 8, 2026, when service will officially end. From February 25, however, the experience will be somewhat limited with the removal of all in-game purchases, but everything that's been purchased but not yet claimed can still be obtained until the end of service in early April.</p>



<p>As technical reasons are behind the termination of PlayStation 4 support, it's unsurprising that the system requirements for the PC and mobile versions have increased. Devices below the system requirements will still be able to run the game after the Song of the Welkin Moon update launches, but users playing on devices with specs lower than the minimum may experience performance and stability issues. Still, the <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408846">increased requirements</a> are not particularly high, especially the PC requirements, so most players should have no trouble playing the game even after the Song of the Welkin Moon.</p>



<p>Genshin Impact is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-age-assurance-security-settings-leaks-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-age-assurance-security-settings-leak-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1263150/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Reports of GTA Online adding new age verification measures were recently leaked. Now, a new claim has shown the GTA age assurance settings with preview screens that aren’t live in Grant Theft Auto just yet.</p>



<p>Age verification has gone from being a concept to a full-blown enforcement of the practice. The UK has seen a huge clampdown on certain content—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/uk-age-verification-laws-online-safety-act-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including gaming websites</a>—and it could be spreading to gaming. It was recently claimed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-will-soon-require-age-verification-to-play-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online was gearing up to add age verification</a> to the game.</p>



<p>A new development shows it’s more than likely happening.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-online-age-assurance-preview-leaks">GTA Online Age Assurance Preview Leaks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What does this mean for the future of GTA? Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Trusted source <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tez2</a> was the one to break the initial age assurance story. Now, the leaker has shared “A preview of age assurance in-game,” but said, “This is not active yet.”</p>



<p>The first screenshot shows a new screen for GTA Online saying: “Verify Age – Please verify your age to access online features.”</p>



<p>Whereas the second screenshot shows ‘Additional Settings,’ which include the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Verify Age</li>



<li>Online Access (On/Off)</li>



<li>Store Access (On/Off)</li>



<li>Snapmatic Upload (On/Off)</li>
</ul>



<p>This information should be taken with a pinch of salt as it is a leak. Until Rockstar Games officially announces the introduction of age assurance and verification methods, it’s not absolute. However, Tez2 is rarely wrong, and we’ve already seen the code in the game files.</p>



<p>Plans could always change, so stay tuned.</p>

</span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTAOnline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GTAOnline</a></p></article></div>



<p>I think this is only the beginning of age verification across the UK and the rest of the world. Many apps, games, sites, and pieces of content won’t be safe from these new rules and regulations. Will age assurance stop you from enjoying the content you like? Or will you go ahead and do it anyway? We’re keen to hear your thoughts over at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="ludocene launch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bffa8d29ec6cc/ludocene-launch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ludocene</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/new-dating-app-for-games-tool-looks-to-leverage-human-expertise-over-ai">We reported on Ludocene</a> back in February, when the new search tool for video games was looking for backers for its Kickstarter campaign, which then went on to find enough supporters that it's launching a whole month early. Hooray! In fact, it's launching <em>today</em>, which is <a href="https://www.playday.org.uk/">National Playday</a> here in the UK. What are the chances?!</p>
<p>We've been very impressed with what we've seen from <a href="https://www.ludocene.com/">Ludocene</a> thus far; it all looks very nice and swishy, like a fancy Apple-designed Tinder but for finding games to love. Y'know the vibe.</p>
<p>And we're not just saying that because founder Andy Robertson is also behind <a href="https://www.familygamingdatabase.com/home">Family Gaming Database</a>, whose family-friendly ratings you can find in some of our reviews here at Nintendo Life. No, this genuinely seems really cool and useful, actually.</p>
<p>Essentially, what the app does is take your game-related initial search and construct a deck of suitable games around it. But rather than just being a simple filter affair, there's lots of effort been put in here to get the guidance of a bunch of gaming industry professionals. So you can have bespoke decks of games to check out, enhanced by pointers from folk who've proper melted their minds playing stuff.</p>
<p>Here's some more deets about the launch from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What Ludocene does:</strong></p>
<p>Presents a stream of Game cards<br>
You swipe to Love/Discard and build your deck.<br>
We suggest matching games for you to Pin.<br>
Add Expert cards for specific gaming taste.<br>
<strong><br>
Ludocene has been built to solve the challenge of finding what to play when over 1000 games launch every month. It does this not with AI or heavy algorithms but meticulously researched data built over the last five years:</strong></p>
<p>Free and ad-free to use, including all game cards.<br>
All human-researched data, rather than heavy algorithms or AI.<br>
Mobile and Desktop web-app.<br>
Save your runs and suggestions across both.<br>
Supported by a subscription tier (£3.99/month) that grants Discord access, more experts and monthly digest emails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One thing that's got this writer particularly interested in this, even as someone who considers themselves fairly well-read on games, is the idea that you have a sort of game built into the thing itself, with all of the experts to choose from and, as the press release puts it " the ability to create as many game-finding runs as you need." As the sorts of people who sit browsing game stores for absolutely no reason a lot of the time, this sounds like it's threatening us with a good time.</p>
<p>Right, we're off to type "games for when you need coffee really badly" into this thing. Let's see what these boffins come up with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Publisher Nacon and developer Rogue Factor have announced demos across both PC and consoles for upcoming slasher Hell is Us.</p>
<p>Hell is Us - which stars <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-lands-september-release-date-as-well-deus-exs-elias-toufexis">Elias Toufexis, aka Adam Jensen from the Deus Ex series, as the game's protagonist Rémi</a> - is set to release later this year, on 4th September. Ahead of this, the team is releasing a demo across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>The demo will be available on 12th August. So, that's just under one week's time.</p>

Not sure yet what Hell is Us is all about? "If war is the closest we get to hell on earth, it's because Earth harbours the worst of demons: humankind," reads the official blurb. "In an isolated country ravaged by infighting, discover the secrets of your past and deal with the repercussions of a mysterious calamity."

</p><p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sci-fi-action-rpg-hell-is-us-gets-pc-demo-out-today-on-steam">Hell is Us team previously released a demo on PC</a>, which plopped players into the start of the game. At this time, the studio said the demo wasn't going to be available on consoles due to "technical constraints". Those constraints have clearly been resolved for next week's demo.</p>
<p>As for what you can expect from the upcoming demo, it <em>sounds</em> like it will be the same as the earlier PC demo. In a <a href="https://x.com/HellisUsGame/status/1952756941345747256">post on social media</a>, the studio said: "Oh yes, PC is coming back too!" I have emailed Nacon to ask for clarification on what the demo will include.</p>
<p>The team has promised, though, that this version of the demo on PC will be "even better" than the one that came before. "4k can actually run at 60fps now," the Hell is Us studio said. "Isn't that great? We got you."</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/HellisUsGame/status/1952848364900692225">subsequent reply</a>, Rogue Factor confirmed that PS5 will also support 60fps.</p>

<p>"The narrative already has me hooked - the human story of a country drowned in war, its people barely surviving, running alongside a supernatural mystery of unknown horrors emerging from the dark - while combat mechanics show excellent promise for when Hell is Us is released," she wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-abandons-maps-and-quest-markers-and-channels-brilliant-immersion-in-return">Eurogamer's Hell is Us Gamescom preview</a>.</p>

EA's not alone either, with the likes of Riot having <a href="https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/22291331362067-Vanguard-Restrictions">already done the same</a> with fellow online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a>. You see, the real war isn't about nations, resources, or petty rulers' personal grievances - it's to ensure you don't get sniped by a Terminator with permanent x-ray vision or auto-aim.</p>

<p>"To play on PC, you must have Secure Boot turned on," the EA Help account announced on the socials last night, "It’s a system setting that’s on by default on most PCs and keeps gameplay fair." Basically, it's being used as an extra measure alongside EA's Javelin anticheat software, stopping your machine from loading up any software not flagged as 'safe' when you start it up.</p>
<p>The company has at least provided both <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/technical-issues/secure-boot/">written</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHFSelMXXX8&amp;t=3s">video</a> instructions to follow if you need to delve into your BIOS settings and either check whether you've got secure boot enabled already, or turn it on.</p> <div>

<p>As with a lot of anti-cheat related debates, the question is whether the potential elimination of some hacking or other exploitation you might run into in a game that's aiming for fair fights is worth the extra palavaer and publisher-exerted control over what you do with your hardware.</p>
<p>For folks running Windows 10 and 11, it hopefully shouldn't be too much of a practical inconvenience if you follow the instructions, but other setups might be in for a more complicated time.</p>
<p>If you've yet to double-check which modes, maps and changes from previous Battlefield Labs testing you'll be in for if you do jump into the open beta when it opens its doors from August 7th (early access) or August 9th (general), EA's also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-maps-and-modes-shared-as-ea-write-an-essay-about-tweaks-based-on-labs-feedback">shared all of that info this week</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-won%E2%80%99t-have-%E2%80%9Ccomplete-destruction-%E2%80%9D-says-devs.1263123/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Destruction has always been a big selling point in Battlefield. With EA, DICE, and Battlefield Studios as a whole working hard to develop and market Battlefield 6, we know there’s a huge helping of destruction in the game, but you should temper your expectations.</p>



<p>My life changed the day I properly got into Battlefield: Bad Company, being my introduction. I’d only ever known using doors to enter a room, not grabbing a grenade launcher and blowing a gaping crater into the side of a house. Whereas Battlefield 4’s Levelution is still some of the most visually impressive gaming I’ve ever seen.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-took-huge-inspiration-from-bad-company-2s-destruction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 takes inspiration from Bad Company 2’s destruction</a>, that’s a fact. It’s been confirmed BF6 won’t let you flatten maps, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-dice-wants-interesting-scene-changes-in-battlefield-6">DICE Wants “Interesting Scene Changes” in Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Automated wrecking balls. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GNN</a> (through <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1952869411125100656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Bulletin</a>) learned many new details about Battlefield 6 through a special multiplayer event.</p>



<p>The game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-time-to-kill-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time-to-kill system</a> was covered in great detail—an ever-controversial topic in the community. But additional details about the game’s destruction were discussed.</p>



<p>GNN managed to grab an interesting quote on BF6 destruction: “We’re not aiming for complete destruction of entire areas, like turning a battlefield into a parking lot with nothing left. Instead, we aim to create interesting, environmentally stimulating effects through destruction – primarily creating interesting scene changes.”</p>



<p>If you have a village of houses, for example, I think it’s fair to assume you won’t be able to destroy them all until they resemble nothing but rubble. Certain houses might have scripted destruction or limitations—one house will only let you blow holes through the floors and walls, maybe?</p>



<p>Either way, we’ve seen from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-reveal-will-contain-3-hours-of-multiplayer-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer reveal event</a> and other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leak-shows-battle-royale-map-poi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay leaks</a> that Battlefield 6 doesn’t skimp on the level of chaos and anarchy you can inject into every match.</p>



<p>Is it a good thing that you can’t fully destroy entire maps? Or should it have specific maps and modes where this is possible? Let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. Worst case, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-upgrade-players-build-own-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Portal</a> should have something along these lines.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In an interview <a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Taiwanese website GNN</a> at the Hong Kong Battlefield 6 reveal event, Development Director Anna Narrevik shared some juicy details about the upcoming first-person shooter game.</p>



<p>The first one is that the game will support bots, automatically adding them to a multiplayer match whenever a server is not full of regular players.</p>



<p><em>The way the game uses AI is that when the server is not full, AI will be added to fill the gap.</em></p>



<p>Of course, players could join at any time to take over from bots. Still, this is a somewhat controversial design choice that is sure to leave at least a few disgruntled fans. At the same time, it's probably for the best, as Battlefield matches need to be filled at all times to feel truly as epic as they are meant to be.</p>



<p>Narrevik also commented on the addition of further classic maps post-launch:</p>



<p><em>It won't be available in today's event, but there will be a Firestorm map in Battlefield 6 in the future . It's a classic map. We'll introduce classic versions or maps based on fan or player requests. Of course, we have so many options, and we want to choose the best possible one to bring back the good old days of playing Battlefield.</em></p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Development Director confirmed that fans can expect regular quarterly updates. Additionally, she expressed her preference for the improved tactical destruction as the game's best feature:</p>



<p><em>For me, it's really about tactical destruction, because it can suddenly change the battlefield. For example, if you see a building suddenly collapse, it gives you new ways to play and new opportunities to face the enemy. Not only does it look good, but it also gives you more combat options and more control.</em></p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta officially starts on Saturday, August 9, but early access begins tomorrow. Preload <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-preload-now-available-matchmaking-skill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is already available</a> on all platforms. The game will be released on October 10.</p>

<p>The PS4 version of Genshin Impact will be removed from the PlayStation Store later this year, on 10th September. Then, on 25th February next year, all of the in-game purchases will be removed from both the PlayStation Store and the in-game shop.</p>
<p>"Before Genshin Impact's update discontinuation on PS4, any items purchased from the PlayStation Store but not yet claimed in-game can still be obtained by logging into Genshin Impact on PS4," the team assured.</p>
<p>Service for those playing Genshin Impact on PS4 will then officially end on 8th April, 2026. "Any items purchased from the PlayStation Store but not yet claimed in-game can only be claimed by logging into Genshin Impact on PS5 after this date," the developer said.</p>
<p>HoYoverse noted that those on PS5 will not be impacted by these changes, and the game will "continue to operate normally" on the console, as well as other available platforms. It has advised anyone playing on PS4 to transition over to either PlayStation 5 or other supported platforms. "Your game progress will not be affected," it said.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic%E2%80%99s-tim-sweeney-denies-report-on-%E2%80%98slow%E2%80%99-collaboration-with-disney.1263090/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In February 2024, Disney <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-a-persistent-universe-in-fortnite-based-on-its-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a $1.5 billion investment in Epic Games to create a persistent universe within Fortnite based on its own franchises: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar, and more.</p>



<p>We later <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-talks-about-disneys-persistent-universe-in-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> a bit about that project from Epic Games Executive Vice President Saxs Persson:</p>



<p><em>Disney wants a persistent place where all things Disney can be there, but they want to be part of an ecosystem we’ve built. We see the power of ecosystems interoperating as being really the magic here. From a player perspective, you want to flow between a Fortnite experience, a Disney experience, or any experience. We see the power of ecosystems interoperating as being really the magic here. From a player perspective, you want to be able to flow between a Fortnite experience, a Disney experience, or any experience really.</em></p>



<p>Now, though, the Wall Street Journal has <a href="https://www.tovima.com/wsj/is-it-still-disney-magic-if-its-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a report</a> that cites anonymous sources within Epic who allegedly are disgruntled with the speed of the collaboration. According to the report, the project is codenamed Bulldog, but it is being slowed down by Disney's requirement for signoffs 'from so many divisions' before proceeding. </p>



<p>However, Epic founder and president Tim Sweeney has countered this claim. Posting on X, he set the record straight on the matter:</p>



<p><em>The anonymous quote is BS. The speed of Disney and Epic collaborations like Darth Vader has been awesome and is around 10x the ordinary speed of media company dealings in this business. We even provided a statement to the writer of this article saying so, but they chose not to print it.</em></p>



<p>Sweeney did not, however, appear to counter the report's claim that the Fortnite x Disney project is targeting a Fall 2026 release window 'at the earliest'. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The HoYoverse team has announced that support for Genshin Impact on PS4 is being <strong>shut down</strong> and that the game will receive no further updates after April 8th, 2026. It was stressed that this decision was made due to hardware limitations and ‘platform application size’, and that PlayStation 5 support will continue as normal.</p>



<p>From September 10th, 2025, you won’t be able to search for or download Genshin Impact on PlayStation 4.</p>



<p>This decision garnered immediate backlash from the Genshin Impact fanbase still playing on the platform, which launched way back in 2013.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impactful-decision">Impactful Decision</h2>



<p>In a post on the HoYoLab page, the decision to shut down Genshin Impact on PlayStation 4 was unveiled:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your continued support and love for Genshin Impact on PS4! Due to limitations related to hardware performance and platform application size, we will be discontinuing support and updates for Genshin Impact on PS4 in future versions.</p>



<p>Genshin Impact on PS5 will continue to operate normally and is not affected by the removal and update discontinuation on PS4. Traveler will still be able to enjoy the latest content updates on PS5 and other supported platforms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was then stressed that the removal of Genshin Impact will unravel across three phases on PS4:</p>



<ul>
<li>Game Removal (September 10th, 2025) – You will no longer be able to search for or download Genshin Impact on PS4</li>



<li>In-Game Purchases Delisting (February 25th, 2026) – Store purchases for Genshin Impact will be removed from the in-game shop and the PS Store</li>



<li>End of Update Support (April 8th, 2026) – No more updates will be rolled out across Genshin Impact’s PS4 version</li>
</ul>



<p>The article from the HoYoverse team <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained how users</a> can port their progress to other platforms.</p>



<p>In the comment section under the article, the backlash was fairly instant and aggressive, with users branding the decision ‘disgusting’, ‘the biggest middle finger’, and ‘gross and dumb’.</p>



<p>Let me know in the comments if this move will impact you as a Genshin Impact fan.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent weeks, few topics in the gaming space have earned as much attention as the ‘adult games debate’. It was recently revealed that payment processors for certain gaming outlets are cracking down on adult and NSFW games, targeting some of the smuttier titles that sit on storefronts like Steam.</p>



<p>It has brought about the rise of some activist actions from the likes of GOG, a storefront that made a bundle of NSFW games free to claim for a short time to protest the ‘financial censorship’ being pushed by some payment providers and processors.</p>



<p>However, it has now been claimed that games such as Grand Theft Auto, Saints Row, and Duke Nukem could be targeted by payment processors, potentially resulting in them being delisted.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-potentially-at-risk">‘Potentially at Risk’</h2>



<p>In an article penned by GamingOnLinux, it was highlighted that a digital retro storefront had been ‘targeted’ by payment processors looking to clamp down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/itch-io-latest-site-strike-down-adult-games-payment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on adult games</a>. The storefront, ZOOM Platform, <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/news/preserving-and-protecting-artistic-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained in a statement</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As you are likely aware, there have been a number of adult title de-listings across the industry. One of our payment processors made us aware that a “fellow member of the industry” was concerned about our content.</p>



<p>We have no plans to remove any titles, and will do absolutely everything in our power to prevent such de-listings. We are fervent supporters of artistic freedom and always will be.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/zoom-platform-also-had-payment-processor-issues-say-they-have-no-plans-to-remove-any-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingOnLinux</a> reportedly received an email from the ZOOM Platform team, explaining that ‘they expect the de-listing situation to expand further.’ It was specifically said that games like ‘Grand Theft Auto, Duke Nukem, and Saints Row were described as <strong>potentially at risk.</strong>‘</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto has long been one of the most controversial franchises in gaming, but the ‘NSFW elements’ of the game only make up a small part of what’s on offer. It’s not one of these smut titles that are hidden in the libraries of some questionable gamers on Steam, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>That being said, the violence, behaviors, and destructive potential of franchises like Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row could be described as gratuitous and harmful to the wrong people, like minors.</p>



<p>Is the answer taking them off the shelves and preventing people from buying them? <strong>Absolutely not.</strong></p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that ZOOM Platform is a retro-focused site, and these claims could be angled towards more classic titles, especially where the likes of Duke Nukem are concerned.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>It's been another solid year for arcade racing fans on Nintendo platforms so far, and there's even more to come...</p>
<p>The independent studio 3DCloud has announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/formula_legends">Formula Legends</a> will be racing onto the original Switch later this year on <strong>18th September 2025</strong> for <strong>£19.99 / $19.99 / €19.99</strong>.</p>
<p>This new title, offering a "mixture of arcade and sim-focused racing gameplay" which "emulates the last seventy years" of the world's premier motorsport - including the tracks, drivers, teams, and cars, which are all "playfully inspired by racing's past and present".</p>
<p>There's also a Switch eShop demo "coming later this month", so be on the lookout for that. This demo includes two game modes (custom and time attack), two tracks (Belgium and Hungary), three iconic racing eras, new extreme weather, fully customisable gameplay and new camera modes.</p>
<p>Apart from a Switch release, this title is also coming to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. If we hear anything about a Switch 2 version, we'll let you know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Whether you are on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC, here is everything you need to know about whether Madden 26 is available on your preferred platform or console.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-madden-26-release-exact-release-date-time/#:~:text=Madden%2026%20Release%20Date&amp;text=Madden%2026%20officially%20releases%20on,game%2C%20starting%20on%20August%207." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a> pushes the series forward in new and exciting ways. For <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-gets-gameplay-deep-dive-showcasing-on-field-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay</a>, EA brought over the wear and tear system from College Football 25, and also introduced the Coach DNA system, which mimics real-life playstyle tendancies. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-franchise-deep-dive-shows-new-coaching-updates-gameplan-changes-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Franchise</a>, some of the big new changes include coach archetypes, weekly playsheet updates, a new weekly highlights show, and more. As for&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-presentation-updates-include-updated-gameday-experience-new-mascots-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">presentation</a>, Madden 26 features former NFL legends in stadium pre-game rituals, has licensed more than 40 songs for stadium music, and includes official team mascots. With that all in mind, let’s take a look at which platforms the upcoming game is coming to. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Madden 26 on Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Madden 26 ends a 13 year drought for Nintendo fans. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Madden 26 is available on the Switch 2</strong>, making it the first game in the series available on a Nintendo console since Madden 13 on the Wii and Wii U in 2012. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/gridiron-notes-madden-26-pre-order-details" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA</a> confirmed that Madden 26 on Switch 2 will have all of the same features as other platforms, meaning this isn’t a “lite” version of the game, as we have seen from other stripped down versions of other sports games on the Switch. </p>



<p>That being said, there is a slight visual downgrade compared to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-madden-26-on-switch-2-and-it-didnt-suck/1100-6532037/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamespot</a> reported that the game feels smooth in handheld mode, however it is reported to perform at around 40 frames per-second on the Switch 2 and the menus load slowly. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-playstation-4-and-5">Can You Play Madden 26 on PlayStation 4 and 5?</h2>



<p><strong>Madden 26 is available on PlayStation 5, but is not on PlayStation 4</strong>. This is the first time that a Madden game won’t be on last-gen consoles. </p>



<p>It’s odd that Madden 26 won’t be available on PlayStation 4, because EA is still developing EA FC 26 for PS4. Regardless of the reason, it’s time for previous generation console owners to make the upgrade. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-xbox-one-and-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Madden 26 on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>Like PlayStation, <strong>Madden 26 will be on Xbox Series X|S but not Xbox One</strong>. </p>



<p>On the Xbox Series X, Madden 26 supports 4k Ultra HD, HDR 10, ray tracing, spatial sound, and performs at 60 frames per second or better. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-pc">Can You Play Madden 26 on PC?</h2>



<p>Yes, <strong>PC users can download Madden 26 on Steam or Epic Games</strong>. </p>



<p>EA recommends playing Madden 26 on PC with a controller, and Xbox and DualShock controllers are both supported. It’s unclear if the game will be able to run on a Steam Deck. </p>



<p>Which platform do you plan on playing on? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/is-madden-26-on-nintendo-switch-2-all-platforms-consoles-explained.3201/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>. </p>



<hr>



<p>For more on Madden 26, there was a change to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/change-made-to-madden-26-broadcast-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broadcast team</a>, and all of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-rookie-ratings-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rookie ratings</a> were revealed. </p>
