			<p>Alkimia Interactive has announced that an updated version of the Gothic Remake demo is now available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3448280/Gothic_1_Remake__Demo_Nyras_Prologue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. The demo wasn't very well-received when it first became available during February's Steam Next Fest, but the developers have improved it based on the community's feedback. For example, Alkimia was originally inspired by the slow movement of a game like Red Dead Redemption 2, but players communicated that they'd prefer something more reactive.</p>
<p><em>We see a lot of things we didn't have so much on the radar, for example, like the movement in the game. Our main reference really was Red Dead Redemption 2, which is a game that has a very slow pacing in terms of movement. The clear feedback, though, was people like it more reactive, and that certain actions that are repeated over and over again should be rather quick, which means not realistic.</em></p>
<p><em>In the Demo specifically, there were certain elements that were not working out. The Demo is just what it is. It's not representative of the full Gothic Remake game. The Demo is locked at a certain time of day, so you obviously have just no visual variety. There’s no weather in there — it’s always sunny, right? You see one specific weather and daylight condition all the time. It's not doing justice to the full game.</em></p>
<p><em>Everybody has to realize also that, of course, the Gothic Remake demo has daily routines, but they are nowhere near as detailed as in the original. And of course it has some monsters, but like, of course you won't see how monsters beyond that react. You only see very few characters, and you don't see them in a camp, where they are actually living, where they have a real daily routine.</em></p>
<p><em>They are kind of like all in an extreme situation because they are trapped. You should get an idea of what can happen with progression, but it was maybe a little too fast. So players might get the wrong idea of like, oh, in the Gothic Remake you will actually progress faster than you will do. But no, the pacing is still very much the same, the power curve.</em></p>
<p><em>And then another big problem of the combat in the demo was the hit sounds. There were just clear bugs in there. Sometimes, you would think you'd land a hit with the sword, because the models touch each other, but it wouldn't recognize the hit, so it gives you this awkward feeling of like, oh, the combat system is bad.</em></p>
<p><em>But it's a glitch, it's a bug. It's something we'll address and fix. We're&nbsp;not saying like, hey, all is good, right? There's a lot of stuff we need to improve, much, much further and continue to work on until the very end.</em></p>

            <p>
Sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/la-quimera">La Quimera</a> is the first game from Reburn, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-metro-devs-reveal-singleplayer-fps-la-quimera-a-latin-american-cyberpunk-shooter-with-hollywood-credentials">a new incarnation of Metro co-developers 4A Games Ukraine</a>. It's out now in early access. That last bit is a surprise: the developers had planned to release the new shooter as "a large, complete journey", but had to make "certain pivots" in the face of resource constraints, technical complications and, presumably, the broad impacts of living in a warzone. This led to a launch delay last week and then, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2282350/view/512957012199342081?l=english">the abrupt announcement</a> that La Quimera would start out as an early access project.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I've played the first of the early access build's four missions, and yeah, it all feels a bit undercooked, though I feel like the problem is less execution than concept. La Quimera simply doesn't feel like a very enthralling shooter, next to the developer's previous post-apocalyptic Moscow tunnel escapades.</p>
<p>It's set in a futuristic travesty of Latin America that is sort of Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare trying to be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> by way of Horizon: Zero Dawn, with neo-Aztec megacities and verdant metal ruins full of feral bots. You play a PMC trooper who embarks on a straightforward rescue mission and is promptly swept up in wider technofeudal shenanigans that usefully lead to you becoming a guinea pig for some cybernetic implants. 
</p>

<p>
Said early-game Stroggification brings with it a suite of secondary abilities and upgrades, which I've yet to acquire. They'll need to be exciting indeed, because La Quimera's gunplay is currently rather plodding for what is theoretically more of a power fantasy than Metro. In brief: you hide behind things and pick 'em off one by one till somebody flanks or lobs a grenade - rinse and repeat. There are two broad categories of gun: red types are for dudes, blue types are for drones. The weapons are tricked out and greebled to the max - one of the starting pistols looks like a ghost-busting hairdryer - but they don't (yet) have the storied intimacy of Metro's hydraulic BB guns and drum-fed shotties. They're just flashy gizmos. 
</p>
<p>
You can say similar things of the story and world. The setting is touristy bordering on demeaning - this is one of those localisations where people tactically pepper the English with bits of high-velocity Spanish, as though the other language existed to supply punchlines. The dialogue is also sweary in a way that is <em>almost</em> overcompensatory enough to be charming, like you're witnessing kids utter their very first F-bombs, but mostly just insipid. Still, a lot of thought appears to have gone into the ravaged, piled-up, gleaming or gutted and overgrown architecture and geography. It's just a shame La Quimera won't let you explore too far: this appears to be a universe of tunnels and tiered chambers, like Metro, except that being set in the open air, it needs holographic red mission boundaries to stop you wandering off. 
</p>

<p>
It doesn't feel like a particularly tough game on Normal difficulty. Health must be replenished manually, but the game restores a little out of mercy when you're nearly dead, and there are regular checkpoints to soften the fall when you exhaust your capped supply of medikits. You also have the option of co-op, with players forming up in your hub base before embarking on missions.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
La Quimera will remain in early access for "up to 18 months". Here's what you'll hopefully get in the full release:
</p>
<p>
- Deeper integration between narrative and gameplay in both solo and co-op modes.
</p>
<p>
- Expanded NPC involvement in story-driven gameplay situations.
</p>
<p>
- Improved pacing and balance between narrative sequences and gameplay encounters.
</p>
<p>
- Enhanced level design for combat, ensuring challenges remain engaging for both solo and cooperative players.
</p>
<p>
- A larger number of levels that complete the game's major story arcs.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I would definitely reserve your pennies for the moment. I can sort of see a serviceable shooter arising from this one's whirl of doodads, bandidos and cussing. Perhaps the later plot developments and fancier upgrades will save it from disaster. Still, if you're after a campaign shooter right now, you're probably better off digging out <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-2033">Metro 2033</a> again.

                <p>With Fortnite and other Epic mobile titles finally returning to iOS soon after five years, Epic Games is marking the occasion by introducing a major bonus for those who spend money on its games: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/better-deals-in-fortnite-and-more-players-get-20-back-in-epic-rewards-starting-today" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">20% back in rewards cash</a> on all purchases in Fortnite, Rocket League, and Fall Guys made using Epic's own payment system in the Epic Games Store, a massive boost from the 5% it normally offers. Even better is that this change is permanent, and is already live.</p><p>But that's not all--that 20% cash back will apply to <em>all</em> purchases made through EGS until the end of August. If that percentage seems extraordinarily high, that's because it is. Under these terms, buying a new $70 game will net $14 in credit that you can use on anything in the Epic Games Store aside from subscriptions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4491243-epicrewars20percent%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491243" data-ratio="0.56239217941346" data-width="1739" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4491243-epicrewars20percent%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491243"></a><figcaption>The new option that will be presented to Fortnite players when they purchase V-Bucks on iPhone.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4491243-epicrewars20percent%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Epic's motivation for this move is to encourage players to spend money with them directly rather than going through, say, Apple's App Store, which takes its own healthy percentage from every purchase made. For Fortnite specifically, Apple would take 30% off every purchase of V-Bucks--offering 20% back in rewards, by contrast, gives Epic the full purchase amount aside from normal transaction fees, and since the rewards cash can only be spent on the Epic Games Store it hypothetically keeps players invested in the company's ecosystem.</p><p>When players on iOS attempt to purchase V-Bucks now, they're given the option of doing so through the App Store or by using Epic's own payment systems, with the Epic option showing how much you'd earn in rewards. The Epic Rewards credit is applied to your account two weeks after the relevant purchase has been made, and once you've got it you can spend it on anything other than subscriptions. Meaning you can earn this 20% cash back by subscribing to Fortnite Crew, but you cannot use the store credit to pay for a Crew subscription.</p><p>This option is only for people who use Fortnite on PC, mobile or streaming--folks on PlayStation, Xbox, or Switch will not have the option to pay Epic directly when they buy V-Bucks on those platforms. But console players can still use the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/item-shop" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite web shop</a> and earn the 20% cash back that way.</p><p>It's a convenient moment for this change for a lot of Fortnite fans, as Mace Windu will be arriving in the Fortnite item shop this evening--the first new Star Wars item shop skin released during the current Star Wars season.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 x Street Fighter 6 | Animated Collaboration Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The crossover will begin on May 20 with a total of eight character skins, significantly more than recent collabs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-overwatch-2s-gundam-wing-collab-was-informed-by-gunpla/1100-6531147/" data-ref-id="1100-6531147">Gundam Wing</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-debuts-avatar-collaboration-costumes-and-a-free-skin/1100-6528431/" data-ref-id="1100-6528431">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>. Below is the full list of Overwatch characters who will be getting the Street Fighter treatment.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Hanzo as Ryu</li><li dir="ltr">Juno as Chun-Li</li><li dir="ltr">Kirkio as Juri</li><li dir="ltr">Widowmaker as Cammy</li><li dir="ltr">Zenyatta as Dhalsim</li><li dir="ltr">Soldier: 76 as Guile</li><li dir="ltr">Winston as Blanka</li><li dir="ltr">Sigma as M. Bison</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Each skin can be briefly glimpsed in the animated trailer and looks to capture the spirit of Capcom's fighting game perfectly. Sigma as M. Bison and Zenyatta as Dhalsim are no-brainers, and Hanzo being Japanese is a great fit for Ryu.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not released exact details on pricing or what freebies players will be able to score as part of the event, but the end of the trailer does show Hanzo performing a Hadoken, Shoryuken, and Tatsumaki Senpu-kyaku. That may mean each collab skin will come bundled with a few of each Street Fighter character's signature moves in the form of emotes, but fans will have to wait a little longer for more information.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/overwatch-2-battle-pass-season-16-all-skins-emotes-and-rewards/2900-6495/" data-ref-id="2900-6495">Overwatch 2 recently saw the start of Season 16</a>, which introduced a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-latest-hero-is-the-crossbow-wielding-bounty-hunter-freya/1100-6529451/" data-ref-id="1100-6529451">damage hero, Freya</a>, and added the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-stadium-mode-is-excellent-but-makes-an-awful-first-impression/1100-6531214/" data-ref-id="1100-6531214">third-person Stadium mode</a>. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 6 will receive a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/street-fighter-6-elena-gameplay-reveal-trailer/2300-6465935/" data-ref-id="2300-6465935">playable fighter, Elena</a>, on June 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/09/toby-fox-is-releasing-deltarune-chapters-1-4-slightly-earlier-than-expected<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After years of waiting for news, we learned last month that Deltarune Chapters 1-4 would not only be coming out on June 5 but that it <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/from-silksong-to-elden-ring-heres-every-third-party-game-from-the">would be a Nintendo Switch 2 launch title</a>. However, in a newsletter sent out last night, developer/composer Toby Fox explained that the game itself will launch a little earlier than the console, depending on where you live.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDzgiGdekas"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDzgiGdekas" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will be available for purchase in Japan starting at midnight on June 5, and since Deltarune will be a launch title, the game will also go live digitally at that time. However, Deltarune is not a console exclusive – it's also launching on PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC – so tying its international release to the staggered launch of just one of its platforms doesn't make sense. Instead, the game will go live worldwide at midnight JST.</p><p>Since Japan's time zone is ahead of most of the world, Deltarune will launch on June 4 in most areas. In the US, that becomes 8 AM Pacific and 11 AM Eastern, while Europe can expect to play the game in the early evening, and Asia can expect it later that night. The exceptions to this are parts of Australia, New Zealand, and other territories east of Japan. Because their midnight will come even earlier than Japan's, meaning the Switch 2 launch happens earliest there, they'll get access to Deltarune a few hours before the rest of the world's simultaneous release.</p>

</article>
<p>On the subject of Australia and New Zealand, Fox's newsletter urges them not to spoil the game. "But, for convenience's sake, we're just going to ignore you guys and pretend that the game is not out…" the newsletter says. "Meanwhile, don't say anything about it please."</p><p>The newsletter also announced cross-generation purchasing, which applies if you buy the game on a Nintendo or PlayStation platform. For example, if you buy a PlayStation 4 version of the game, you also get a PlayStation 5 version, which is pretty standard on the platform. However, the same will go for Nintendo: if you buy the game on the Switch, you can get the Switch 2 version at no additional cost. Whether you're unsure what time your Switch 2 will arrive on launch day or you didn't get one yet, you can buy the Switch 1 version and have the upgrade ready when you get the new platform. A prior newsletter also confirmed that you can transfer save data between the two versions.</p><p>Deltarune is Toby Fox's follow-up to Undertale, one of the most successful indie games of all time. If you're interested in playing the first two chapters, they're available on PlayStation, Switch, and PC for free. The complete game, which will include four chapters and free updates for any subsequent chapters, will be $24.99.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/07/ex-bungie-developers-create-teamlfg-a-new-playstation-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><span><span>A team of developers formerly employed by Bungie has negotiated a deal to spin-off from its original company and form its own, known now as teamLFG. The news was announced in a </span></span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/welcome-teamlfg-to-the-playstation-studios-family/"><span><span><span><span>PlayStation Blog post</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>, where PlayStation CEO Herman Hulst says, "teamLFG originated at Bungie, but has also rallied developers from across the industry." The team is working on an "ambitious incubation project," though it gave few concrete details outside of that.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>While employees of the new developer </span></span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?currentCompany=%5B%22106699404%22%5D&amp;origin=COMPANY_PAGE_CANNED_SEARCH&amp;sid=KGq"><span><span><span><span>are listed publicly on LinkedIn</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>, the announcement did not name anyone as founder or CEO, instead providing a statement from the studio as a whole. After stating its studio would be based in Bellevue, Washington, the statement explains that the "LFG" in the studio's name stands for "looking for group," a common internet acronym for people searching for people to play games with.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>TeamLFG's first game will include a wide range of inspirations, including one odd one. The statement reads, "Our first game is a team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games." Not only does this list not include shooters, the genre Bungie is best known for, but it also includes "frog-type games," a genre none of the staff at Game Informer is familiar with. If the studio's goal was to pique our curiosity, it succeeded.</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/report/2025/04/21/sydney-sweeney-to-produce-michael-bay-directed-outrun-movie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Sega has been making a concerted push into the multimedia space in recent years. The&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog </em>theatrical&nbsp;trilogy has led the charge since 2020, but just last year, we also received the Amazon MGM Studios-produced streaming series&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>on Prime Video. On top of that, Sega has announced adaptations based on Shinobi, Streets of Rage, and other franchises in the future. The company isn't stopping there, however, as a new report attaches actress Sydney Sweeney and director Michael Bay to an upcoming adaptation of the arcade driving series OutRun.</p>

<p>This report, which <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/sydney-sweeney-michael-bay-outrun-video-game-universal-1236373036/">comes from <em>Deadline</em></a>, attaches Sweeney as producer, Bay as director, and Jayson Rothwell as scriptwriter. Additionally, Sega senior executive officer Toru Nakahara will produce from Sega's side, while Sega President and Chief Operating Officer Shuji Utsumi will oversee the project. Nakahara has produced every project in the&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>film series, including the Paramount Plus&nbsp;<em>Knuckles</em>&nbsp;show. He is also lined up to produce the Streets of Rage movie. Utsumi has served as executive producer on <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Knuckles,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>.</p>

<p>Sweeney is best known for her roles in shows like&nbsp;<em>Euphoria</em>, <em>White Lotus</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>, as well as films like&nbsp;<em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.&nbsp;</em>Though best known for her onscreen work, according to <em>Deadline</em>'s report, Sweeney is only attached as a producer at this point. Bay is known as a longtime director of action films, including&nbsp;<em>Bad Boys, Armageddon</em>, five&nbsp;<em>Transformers</em>&nbsp;films, and&nbsp;<em>Pearl Harbor</em>. Rothwell wrote for&nbsp;<em>Polar&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Arachnid</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The film is being developed by Universal Pictures, though plot details are scarce at the moment, according to&nbsp;<em>Deadline</em>. You may note that Universal Pictures is also the studio behind&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>, which is the studio's third highest-grossing film of all time, behind only&nbsp;<em>Jurassic World</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Furious 7.&nbsp;</em>While OutRun hardly has the name recognition of Super Mario Bros., it stands to reason that Universal would want to return to the video-game-adaptation well that brought them success with both <i>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</i>&nbsp;and <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i>.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Dune: Awakening's previously announced large-scale beta weekend is now live for players to jump in and try Dune: Awakening themselves, as Funcom continues to test its servers leading up to its new June 10, 2025, launch date.</p>
<p>Originally, Dune: Awakening was set to arrive in a little more than a week from the time of writing, on May 20. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-has-been-delayed-to-june-5/">At the ides of April</a>, Funcom announced that it had pushed the release date back three weeks, saying that the team needed "<em>a bit more time to cook</em>" in order to implement some changes and fixes it wanted to make based on feedback the team had received from players already in the closed beta.</p>
<p>Funcom has been beta testing Dune: Awakening for months now, with those lucky enough to get a beta invite being part of Funcom increasingly pushing the limit of its servers. But even with all the testing in the world, fans of the genre know that the biggest MMO's can still suffer from gameplay issues due to overcrowded servers.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, ahead of the beta test kicking off, Funcom <a href="https://duneawakening.com/en/server-structure-and-large-scale-multiplayer-mechanics-explained">directly addressed</a> those concerns, telling players that "<em>this is not our first rodeo</em>," and that the team has expects, and has been preparing, for the "<em>heavy loads</em>" of players that'll hit its servers at launch.</p>
<p>The beta weekend will run from today, May 9, to Monday, May 12, and if you've yet to receive a beta invite from Funcom, you can still register for this weekend's beta on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">Steam page</a>. Funcom <a href="https://duneawakening.com/en/large-scale-beta-weekend-all-you-need-to-know">adds</a> that if you wishlist the game and sign up to receive emails from the team about Dune: Awakening, that can increase your chances of getting a code. There will also be a Twitch broadcast hosted on May 10, 2025, from <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/funcom">Funcom's official channel</a>, where you'll have a chance to grab one of the "<em>tens of </em><em>thousands</em>" of codes that will be made available to those who tune in.</p>
<p>You'll be able to play up to the first 25 hours of Dune: Awakening in this weekend's beta, if you decide to do nothing else but play it the whole weekend, which Funcom says is most of Act 1. A key difference for this beta is that there's no NDA required to join. After playing as much as you like this weekend, you'll be able to talk about what you played and what you think. You'll also be able to stream the game, if you like, while playing.</p>

It happened as part of a demo here at PAX East, and though my time with the system was brief (and I wasn’t even allowed to look at the console itself as it was hidden beneath a demo station), it did give me a chance to play around with one of the features I was most curious about: the mouse controls. I don’t typically play games on my PC, and when I do, I don’t often use my mouse if I can help it. However, I’m always interested in control methods that can bridge the gap between styles of play we typically associate with other platforms. PlayStation’s touch pads have given console players a trackpad equivalent, for instance, so naturally, someone needed to build a proper mouse into a console controller at some point. I found a surprisingly convincing tech demo for the Switch 2’s mouse controls in <em>Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</em>. The specific playing experience I had wasn’t ideal, but it did sell me on the tech.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,195410,196143" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The reason I had a less-than-optimal experience with the Switch 2 Joy-Cons was just bad circumstances. Square Enix’s demo space had us set up at a coffee table that I had to lean over to use the mouse controls. My wrists were already slightly twisted in an uncomfortable position just to hold the controllers properly, so having to adjust further to reach the low-sitting table wasn’t conducive to a great first impression. However, I quickly realized that if I could put the Joy-Cons at about the level I would normally use a mouse, a lot of that discomfort would go away. Nintendo has been adamant that the Switch 2 Joy-Cons work as a mouse even if you’re using them on your pants, and while that’s cool and novel, it really doesn’t feel like a good setup for extended play.</p><p>I use my Switch in tabletop mode fairly often, and I could see the mouse controls becoming a standard control scheme for me when I have my Switch 2 propped up on my desk. Then, I can have my wrists more comfortably resting on a surface, rather than contorting them to reach a coffee table. I thankfully didn’t have much issue holding the controllers in the sideways position to use them as mice, but I can imagine that if you’re someone with bigger hands or a tighter grip, doing so might add to the wrist fatigue. The Joy-Con 2s are a bit bulkier than the toy-like controllers you’ll find on the original Switch, but your mileage may vary.</p><p><br>Once I got past the suboptimal setup, the Joy-Con 2’s mouse controls were surprisingly very intuitive in <em>Bravely Default</em>’s new Switch 2-specific mini-games. Square is bringing over the full turn-based RPG to the console, but it’s also including new extracurricular activities that take advantage of the console/handheld hybrid’s tech. I was able to play two different games at the event, including a rhythm game that had me dragging the Joy-Con 2s across the table in accordance with visual prompts, such as moving a connected line to strike through visual clutter on the screen and bringing both cursors together to line up with beats in time with the music. That was neat, but the real test of the mouse controls was a ship mini-game that had me using the mouse controls to man the party’s airship from a first-person perspective in the cockpit. Compared to the rhythm game, it was surprisingly involved. It’s partially a flight sim, with you using the mouse controls to steer the vessel through rings as you make your way through the air, and then you also control its artillery in ship combat. The mouse controls are responsive, and the game doesn’t throw too much at you at once, so it’s a neat little tech demo that got me curious to see if more third-party devs will make use of the mouse controls.</p><p>The Switch 2 isn’t even out yet, so we have very little concept yet of how developers will use the feature. We can speculate that some games that have historically been tough sells on a controller, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pc-mouse-joycon-civilization-7-1851741008&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pc-mouse-joycon-civilization-7-1851741008"><em>Civilization</em></a></span>, will be a more natural fit on the Switch 2 than a PlayStation or Xbox (my mind immediately went to the idea of mouse controls for a hypothetical <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a></span> port), but after playing a bit of <em>Bravely Default</em>’s new mini-games, I’m more interested in whether or not developers will make games and experiences tailored specifically to dual mouse controls than I am in ports. I’ll need to make sure I set the device up on a more comfortable spot than a coffee table, but I’m sold on the tech. The Switch 2 and <em>Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</em> both launch on June 5.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-is-one-of-the-most-exciting-roguelike-ive-played-in-years<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It feels strange to say that a game about obsessively breeding cats so you can send them into wild battles across back alleys and dirty sewers might end up being one of the most nuanced and thoughtful strategy games I’ve played in a long time, but that’s exactly what I found with Mewgenics. I got to go hands-on with the next roguelike from the creators of The Binding of Isaac for a few hours recently, and although its original incarnation was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/22/team-meats-new-game-involves-mutant-cats"><u>first announced a whopping 13 years ago</u></a>, seeing the version we are actually getting in action has immediately made it one of my most anticipated games in the coming year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pitch of Mewgenics is actually fairly simple: you run a house full of cats that you can expand and upgrade day by day, and you’ll take those cats out on roguelike runs to level them up while you gather resources and items to bring back home. Each run takes the form of a series of randomized encounters and grid-based tactics battles, and you’ll have to weave a wide range of cat-based attacks and abilities together to take down all manner of rats, bugs, and rival toms and make it back in one piece.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mewgenics - May 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That setup might sound somewhat familiar if you’ve played games like Darkest Dungeon, Cult of the Lamb, or XCOM, but Mewgenics does a lot that sets it apart. For starters, each cat can only go on a single adventure before retiring to a cozy life on the couch back at home (assuming you have a couch). That means a lot of the power progression as your feline fighters level up is contained within each run, and you’re not trying to build a perfect little squad of your favorite furballs that you’ll then use every single time. I still grew attached to my heavy hitters, like a glass cannon named Jarvis that could melt groups of enemies thanks to a combination of passive abilities that first split his basic ranged attack into multiple projectiles and then sent each bouncing to other enemies on hit – but once that run was done, that power played a different role.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Your cats back home don’t just sit around all day.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, your cats back home don’t just sit around all day. They have unique personalities and desires, and even their own cat friends and enemies in the house. Put two compatible cats together in a room with some inviting decor, and they could, well… hit it off. The next day you’ll find yourself with a kitten that shares some of their traits and abilities. This is the crux of the larger metagame in Mewgenics, as you mix and manipulate bloodlines to create future generations that can start runs on a more powerful footing. Things get even more complicated as mutations and other effects are weaved in, not to mention as you start to make uncomfortable choices about inbreeding to keep certain traits “pure” at an ever-mounting cost.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Something that struck me is the way Mewgenics frequently asked me to choose between prioritizing my current run or the larger progression back at my house. For example, money can be used to buy items or level-ups at shops mid-run, but it’s also a currency you’ll use </p><p data-cy="paragraph">between them – and some abilities even use it for powerful effects in combat, like hiring a hitman to help you out. Similarly, equipable items can be brought back to base and used on a few future runs (if your limited storage is big enough to hold them), which gives you a bit more control over your starting “builds” but also makes you wonder if that limited consumable is worth using now or saving for next time. You’ll also choose from a semi-randomized selection of new abilities whenever a cat levels up, and suddenly have to consider both what’s useful in the moment and most interesting for breeding later on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some very cool and unique abilities, too. At the start of each run, you can give your team of cats collars that assign them a class, tweaking some of their starting powers and stats – so the green Hunter is better at a distance, while the red Fighter is all about getting up close and personal. Depending on both their class and their equipment, a cat could have dash attacks, teleportation, healing effects, elemental spells with their own interactions, and a whole lot more. A favorite of mine on one run ended up being my Necromancer’s Pestilence ability, which dealt a single point of damage to <em>every</em> space on the board. That let me soften up groups, easily break corpses so that they would drop loot, and even intentionally weaken my own Hunter to make use of an item that allowed them to deal more damage while at low life.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mewgenics (New) Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This dense tapestry of decisions to make is what made Mewgenics’ combat shine during my demo. It’s quite approachable on the surface, especially so in its earliest encounters as you are learning the ropes, but there is a <em>deep</em> well to get lost down for those who truly want to optimize. The order you sequence your actions on any given turn can squeak out advantages, big and small. Where you move in comparison to an enemy’s options or where you think you’ll need to get the next turn can seriously matter. Even mana management for your spells can become a whole little sub-game of its own as you try to save up for more expensive abilities or blow it all on cheaper ones that you could potentially use multiple times per turn. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyone who already caught the Pestilence reference may not be surprised to hear that developers Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel fondly compare this combat system to Magic: The Gathering, as well as its creator Richard Garfield’s philosophy of crafting a vast system to drop folk into and then letting them explore it – and I think the comparison is unexpectedly on point. This is by no means a card-based roguelike in the way you might think of Slay the Spire or Monster Train, but as a huge fan of Magic myself, I could hear the gears in my brain turning over its encounters in a similar way. Pondering how one ability interacts with another, how my actions might cascade into later turns, and how the loadouts of my cats could be combined into something with greater neko-potence.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The developers compare this combat system to Magic: The Gathering, as well as its creator Richard Garfield’s philosophy of crafting a vast system to drop folk into and then letting them explore it – and I think the comparison is unexpectedly on point.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a helluva lot to consider, too. McMillen and Glaiel tell me they knew Mewgenics was going to immediately get compared to The Binding of Isaac – somewhat unfairly, when the size of that game benefits from what is essentially a decade of content updates and DLC. While Mewgenics was first announced by Super Meat Boy developer Team Meat in 2012, it was ultimately cancelled and McMillen took the idea with him when he left, so its current incarnation was restarted pretty much from scratch about six years ago. Even still, in trying to hit the high bar set by the current version of Isaac they’ve pulled out all the stops, and say Mewgenics already has more items to find – and that’s not even counting abilities, furniture pieces, and beyond. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are equipable items that provide simple stat boosts, while others are weapons that give your cats special attacks – like a bag of rocks that leaves bruises or a fire hose that pushes away everything in a straight line. There are also trickier items, like a playing card that doubles the effect of any spell that costs either one or two mana exactly, or a Toxic Canister that gives your attacks Poison, but also poisons every unit at the start of battle, including allies. Some items are part of a set, too, giving a cat a bonus for wearing all the pieces – in one run, I stumbled upon all three pieces of the Transmitter set, which each hinder the wearer in some way while simultaneously providing a buff to your whole team. Apparently I got lucky finding them all in a single run, but if I hadn’t, I could have stored them at my house and then taken an eye toward finding the missing pieces on subsequent runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As hard as this is to believe, McMillen and Glaiel say their estimate based on testing is that it will take a staggering 200 hours to beat the final boss of Mewgenics’ story. Every run initially sends you through the same sequence of three areas, each with a boss at the end, but there are more than a dozen others to discover and fight through instead. There are main and optional quests that ask you to find certain items, reach a certain place, or deliver a certain number and variety of cats to its eclectic cast of humanoid characters. Not to mention all the special furniture you can find to decorate your house and make it as cute as can be for your precious kitties, which have stats or effects of their own. There is a <em>lot</em> going on here beyond the tactics roguelike at its core.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my hands-on session, I even jumped ahead to face one of the many bosses that can show up to attack your house at various points throughout the story, which then gave me an item I needed to take back out into another run to proceed even further. While most enemies have interesting little quirks, like giant sharks that will instantly kill a cat in one hit but move incredibly slowly or cats that hide as inanimate objects at the end of their turn to test your memory, bosses push you to strategize around them even further. The slippery Boris is a wrecking ball that moves toward whoever hits it, while Radical Rat will throw out bombs that can either be avoided or defused.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The best part about each major boss I saw, as well as some areas outside of combat, had to be the music. They are all accompanied by a jazzy tune with lyrics that match the mood of the fight. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But the best part about each major boss I saw, as well as some areas outside of combat, had to be the music. They are all accompanied by a jazzy tune with lyrics that match the mood of the fight. It’s such an unconventional choice that works <em>so</em> well throughout, and a good example of how Mewgenics is weird in the way any fan of The Binding of Isaac is likely to both recognize and adore. It’s not afraid to be gross and uncomfortable, but somehow simultaneously manages to make a game full of cat sex and poop attacks not feel juvenile. Well, okay, <em>mostly </em>– but it’s still a testament to how every bit of strange that’s here is a carefully considered stylistic choice, not just a cheap attempt at shock humor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Frankly, I can’t wait to play more Mewgenics, because it is speaking my language in a half dozen different ways. Beyond not yet getting to dig into the nitty gritty of stuff like trait inheritance and house upgrading myself, the main question I was left with is how well that loop of breeding cats and then taking them out to battle will hold up over the hundreds of hours of things to do that are supposedly here. It’s impossible to truly get a sense of the staying power of a game like this after just a couple runs – things like enemy variety, level layouts, and difficulty tuning can all be the difference between enjoying a roguelike for a few weeks or a few years. But I <em>can </em>confidently say that I played more than enough to be very excited to find all that out.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Activision alleged that Rothholz, of Antioch, Tennessee, developed and released Lergware in 2021 or 2022 and sold it for $25 via his website. Then, in 2023, Rothholz allegedly updated Lergware to work with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone. “The update resulted in online player 'attacks' becoming increasingly frequent, causing some users to post warning messages online,” Activision said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, in June 2023 Activision sent a cease-and-desist letter to Rothholz. In response to that, Activision alleged, Rothholz posted the letter to an online Discord community dedicated to Lergware and “openly mocked Activision.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, later in June, Rothholz agreed to comply with the cease-and-desist, but then “simply changed his online alias and distributed his source code to other video game hackers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision accused Rothholz of then creating a new Call of Duty hack, the aforementioned GameHook, and recruiting others also named in the lawsuit: Collin Gyetvai (“Cid”), of Carbondale, Pennsylvania, and Jordan Newcombe Boothey (“Bossnight55”), of Whyalla Stuart, Australia to act as “resellers” of GameHook.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GameHook was made available for several Call of Duty games, Activision said, including Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops Cold War, and last year’s Black Ops 6. GameHook cost at least $50 per Call of Duty game, with $375 for lifetime access to a “master key” to use all GameHook versions for all supported Call of Duty games. Activision said it believes “hundreds, if not thousands” of people bought GameHook and used it to cheat in Call of Duty games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Activision is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Defendants have received significant revenue from their activities, to the detriment of Activision and its player community,” the lawsuit claims.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision said it had given the defendants an opportunity to comply with its demands without litigation, but “rather than engage with Activision, each has ignored Activision’s outreach, necessitating this lawsuit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, in March 2025, Activision sent cease-and-desist letters to Rothholz and the other Defendants, and while online storefronts were shut down, none confirmed they would cease from creating or selling Call of Duty hacks, and none gave copies of the GameHook source code to Activision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision said it believes Rothholz, Gyetvai, and Boothey are continuing to distribute or sell the GameHook hacks or other Call of Duty hacks through private channels or via the GameHook Discord server.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Additionally, or alternatively, Activision has reason to believe that Rothholz, Gyetvai, and Boothey intend to ‘re-brand’ GameHook and offer the GameHook COD Hacks or similar COD Hacks under a different title, using different online aliases,” the lawsuit alleged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Activision has attempted to reach out to Rothholz, Gyetvai, and Boothey informally, but they have not responded to Activision’s outreach. Accordingly, Activision had no choice but to file this lawsuit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision wants monetary damages, injunctive and other equitable relief, and punitive damages against Defendants. It said the damages could amount to millions of dollars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Defendants’ conduct harms Activision’s reputation and results in the loss of significant customer goodwill,” Activision said. “In fact, GameHook has been so frustrating to COD players that it received significant attention on social media and, on information and belief, has caused players to stop playing or avoid the PC version of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty has a reputation for cheating (it comes with the territory of being such a hugely popular shooter and having a free-to-download battle royale). Cheating is more prevalent on PC (Activision recently confirmed as much, to the point where it said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-console-players-unlikely-to-be-cheating-theyre-just-killing-you-with-an-intel-advantage-activision-says"><u>if you believe you’ve died unfairly to a console player, it’s much more likely that they’ve used ‘intel advantage’ than cheats</u></a>). So, some console players head straight into Call of Duty’s settings to turn off crossplay across the board, just to take the potential for PC cheaters ruining their day out of the equation. With the launch of Season 3, Activision even added new console-only crossplay options for regular multiplayer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-pc-players-who-do-not-cheat-are-being-penalized-by-new-console-only-crossplay-option-for-regular-multiplayer"><u>although PC players who do not cheat said they were being unfairly punished</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision, as IGN has reported, has spent millions of dollars in the battle against Call of Duty cheat makers, cheat sellers, and cheat users, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>. In March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prolific-call-of-duty-cheat-developer-insists-its-shutting-down-but-players-are-skeptical"><u>Phantom Overlay announced it was shutting down</u></a>, with fans reacting in disbelief that such a prominent Call of Duty cheat provider could fall by the wayside. Also in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/4-call-of-duty-cheat-providers-shut-down-in-apparent-sweep-and-clear-operation-ahead-of-verdansks-return-to-warzone"><u>IGN reported on four cheat providers that were shut down</u></a> ahead of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-release-date-for-return-of-original-verdansk-map-to-call-of-duty-warzone"><u>hotly anticipated return of Verdansk to Warzone</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, amid rising complaints about cheating across Warzone and Black Ops 6, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-warzone-cheating-complaints-ramp-up-following-the-return-of-verdansk-activision-insists-its-caused-chaos-in-the-cheat-marketplace-by-disrupting-over-150-cheat-resellers">Activision said it had shut down five more cheat makers since its last progress report</a> (this is on top of the 20+ it’s shut down since Black Ops 6 came out last year), and had “disrupted” over 150 cheat sellers in the same period. Activision said it had also issued cease-and-desist demands to several companies that create and sell third-party hardware used to cheat in Call of Duty games, in a move widely believed to be targeting Cronus users.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A section of the lawsuit makes it clear why Activision takes Call of duty cheating so seriously: because it knows it can have a significant impact on its bottom line:</p><blockquote>Activision works very hard to ensure that the COD Games offer consistently compelling player experiences so that customers will remain engaged in the COD Games, continue to play them for sustained periods of time, and be excited about future releases. If players perceive that a game is unfair or that the multiplayer experience is not working properly, including because others are cheating or disrupting and/or hacking multiplayer servers, players may grow frustrated with the COD Games, become less interested in playing and supporting them (including by purchasing new games and items) and may even stop playing entirely. Cheating and hacking therefore not only harms (and could even destroy) COD player communities, but also impacts Activision’s ability to offer the fast paced, stable, high-quality online gameplay millions of fans have come to expect from Activision and the COD Games.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

A second update introducing various changes, such as a buff to Phantom Form Mode, will follow in late May to early June. <span id="more-964333"></span></p><div><p><strong>■ Introducing the Next Update</strong> (May 15)</p><p>The long-awaited May update is finally here!</p><p>When we wrapped up the preparation for the official launch and began designing new content, the very first keyword that came to our mind was “boss.”</p><p><em>Khazan</em> is a mission-orientated game. You can always go back and fight the bosses that you defeated again, and you’ll still earn rewards. Want a tougher challenge? Unequip your gear or limit your skills to raise the difficulty as much as you’d like. But for this new content, we wanted to create a special challenge—something different from the usual approach.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We had a storm of ideas. Harder. Nastier. More punishing. The kind of challenge that not just anyone could take on. Then, one of our developers said:</p><p>“Yeah… I probably wouldn’t play that.”</p><p>And just to be clear—this person? (He’s our lead character designer.)</p><p>Plays games over four hours a day, has earned platinum trophies in most <a title="Genres > Action [2,718 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> titles, and refuses to consider a game “complete” without one. They even love Boss Rush content. (And yes, we have more than a few people like that on our team.)</p><p>This was one of the hardest parts of designing <em>Khazan</em> and new content.</p><p><strong>Hardcore Difficulty</strong></p><p>How do we determine the measure of a “hardcore” difficulty? What’s the point of content if no one can enjoy it? But then again, if it’s not a worthy challenge, which is at the core of our value, is it really the right call?</p><p>We knew we wanted something players could challenge themselves with. But we also knew it couldn’t just be hard for the sake of being hard. It had to be fun, something that’s tough but rewarding. A mode you’d be proud to conquer and eager to show off.</p><p>Taking all of this into account, we picked two ideas from our brainstorming session. Then came long hours of debate, testing, and refinement. And finally—we found one that made us go:</p><p>“This is worth the challenge.”</p><p>“This is something I’d be proud to tell others about once I clear it.”</p><p>And now, we’re excited to show you those two new modes.</p><p><strong>Two New Boss Rush (Ultimate Challenge) Modes are Coming as Part of This Update</strong></p><p>Once you beat the game and see the ending, a new menu will appear on the title screen.</p><p>Because every boss in Khazan is deeply tied to the story, even showing the boss list would spoil things. That’s why this new boss rush content will only be available after completing the game. (We know there were boss spoilers in a previous patch note—rest assured, we’ll take every precaution to make sure that never happens again!)</p><p>The two Boss Rush modes differ in difficulty and progression, but I’ll give you a brief overview here:</p><ul><li><strong>“Great General’s Crucible”</strong> – Fight through groups of thematically organized bosses, unlocking the next theme each time you clear one. You’ll fight with designated specs (gear, level, skills, etc.), and completing all of them will earn you a special reward.</li><li><strong>“Berserker’s <a title="Games > Bloodshed [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/bloodshed">Bloodshed</a>“</strong> – Make your character stronger with rewards earned from consecutive fights, and push all the way to defeat the final boss. As a final reward, you can earn powerful new weapons and set items.</li></ul><p>We’re really curious to see how you Berserkers will actually feel the difficulty, compared to how it was envisioned by the combat designers in our dev team. Please send us lots of feedback! (It’ll be a big help in fine-tuning the difficulty for future content.)</p><p><strong>Also, Change Appearance Will Now Be Available Even During Your First Playthrough</strong></p><p>You can unlock it by completing the Blacksmith’s Heirloom mission.</p><p>For more detailed information, please check out the patch notes.</p><p><strong>The Expected Update Date is Thursday, May 15</strong></p><p>We’re almost done with the final phase to ensure the best possible quality. As I mentioned before, the update still needs to pass quality assurance and platform certification, and if any stability issues or quality concerns arise, it might take a little longer.</p><p>I’d like to share just the fully locked-in contents with you, and I ask for your understanding where this is concerned. We’ll do everything we can to stick to the schedule we announced.</p><p><strong>■ Introducing <a title="Games > What Comes After [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/what-comes-after">What Comes After</a> the Next Update</strong></p><p>Yes, that’s right! I’m about to introduce the update that’ll follow the May 15 (Thursday) update I just described!</p><p><strong>Regarding Shortcut Resets and Faster Boss Retry Improvements</strong></p><p>Over the past month, we’ve worked really hard to find a way to improve this. But long story short… we concluded that it wouldn’t be possible. I do apologize. This issue stems from my failure to prepare for it in advance.</p><p>The improvement itself isn’t complicated or technically impossible. For example, we could simply adjust the reset conditions for each shortcut object. That way, like treasure chests, they would stay open when restarting the mission instead of closing again.</p><p>So, why do we think we won’t be able to improve it? Let me give you an example from the Embars mission. In Embars, there are huge structures you can interact with. Each interaction rotates them to block or open new paths. If we modify these objects, the mission will be reset when the updated objects are loaded.</p><p>The problem is that every player is at a different point in their progress. Applying a patch under these conditions would cause many players to be unable to continue their missions normally. (In the reviews we conducted, we found that this issue wouldn’t just affect complex missions like Embars or El Ravaca but most missions overall.)</p><p>We truly wrestled with this decision until the very end. “After the patch, should we reset all ongoing missions?”</p><p>But ultimately, we decided not to. There are three reasons why.</p><ul><li>First, resetting ongoing missions would cause players to feel a huge sense of loss. For example, if I were fighting against Maluca or the final boss and suddenly received a patch that forced me to restart the mission from the beginning… I knew it would feel terrible.</li><li>Second, while resetting missions would improve stability, it wouldn’t change the fact that all content would have to be modified, requiring an enormous amount of testing. NG+ would also need to be thoroughly tested, which could cause significant delays to new content updates.</li><li>Third, even if the reset worked normally, we would still have to thoroughly verify all potential risks, such as save file corruption or progression errors.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, although we tried our best to improve shortcut resets and faster boss retries, we won’t be able to implement them this time. If we had been able to prepare for this before release, it could have been handled much more easily… It’s something I deeply regret. I sincerely apologize.</p><p>Instead, we plan to add the following quality-of-life features to minimize inconveniences.</p><ul><li>New items added to allow fast traveling to the Crevice or the last Blade Nexus you interacted with: We’ll be adding items that let you instantly move to the Crevice or to the last Blade Nexus you interacted with. These will be provided as permanent items, not consumables.</li><li>Added teleport between from one Blade Nexus to another: You’ll be able to freely move from one Blade Nexus to another activated in the same mission. Interacting with a Blade Nexus will display a list of available destinations.</li><li>After clearing certain missions for farming purposes, you will now start right in front of the Spectral Portal before entering that mission. You’ll no longer have to travel long distances through the Mortal World for a quick retry.</li></ul><p>This update will include various changes, such as a buff to Phantom Form Mode.</p><p>We’ll share more detailed information in the next Developer’s Note.</p><p>We are currently targeting a late May to early June release for this update.</p><p><strong>■ Introducing What Comes After the Next Two Updates</strong></p><p>Yes, that’s right! This is a preview of the update that will follow the late May update I just explained above.</p><p>Since there’s still a bit of time left, I’ll keep it brief for now.</p><ul><li>[Balance Adjustment] Skill balance adjustments for Dual Wield, Greatsword, and Spear</li><li>[Balance Adjustment] Adjustment to set effect configurations</li><li>[New System] Skill Presets</li><li>[New System] Gear Presets</li><li>[New System] Increase Gear Grades</li><li>[New System] Change Weapon Scaling</li><li>[QoL] New Sorting Option: Sorting Items by Name</li><li>[QoL] Storage Expansion</li><li>And… more special contents coming!</li></ul><p>We are currently targeting a mid-June release for this update.</p><p><strong>■ Regarding Update and Development Progress</strong></p><p>After the previous Developer’s Note and patch notes, we received a lot of questions like, “When will Feature A be updated?” and “When will Improvement B be applied?” So, in this Developer’s Note, I’d like to briefly summarize the current development status and plans.</p><p>Sometimes, issues that seemed simple when we first received feedback turn out to be much more complicated once we start discussing and reviewing them for an actual patch (as I mentioned earlier regarding shortcut resets). There are also many platform-specific issues, with different problems occurring on Steam, <a title="Platforms > Xbox [25,917 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [47,548 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a>. Because of this, there are still areas I haven’t been able to fully share yet.</p><p>However, one principle never changes. Our top priority is always to ensure that players can enjoy <em>Khazan</em> in a stable environment. We make it a point to identify and resolve critical issues as quickly as possible, regardless of how often they occur. After that, we work on improving areas that need quality-of-life updates, one by one, to create a smoother and more enjoyable experience. These improvement efforts are treated with almost the same priority as developing new content.</p><p>I would like to sincerely thank everyone who has shared their feedback and suggestions on Discord. We’ll continue doing our best to reflect your valuable input and deliver an even better experience.</p><p>I hope our first new piece of content will be an enjoyable experience for you.</p><p>Thank you.<br>Sincerely, Junho Lee</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">One of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>'s new features is GameChat, a feature so important that Nintendo created a dedicated button, the C button, for it. There are quite a few things to know about GameChat for Switch 2, so we're rounding up everything we've learned so far ahead of the Switch 2 launch on June 5.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_is_GameChat_"><strong>What is GameChat?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">GameChat is a new feature for the Switch 2 that allows groups of up to 12 people to chat while playing games. Nintendo is often criticized for being late to the game when it comes to online functionality, and many have pointed out that GameChat offers what Discord has for years. But GameChat is a built-in service for Switch 2 that Nintendo has been <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-17-gamechat-part-1/">working on since 2020</a>, and the company believes it is a "defining" feature of the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo's developers said the company wanted to replicate the experience of a "student lounge," that is, a place where people gather and mingle.</p><p dir="ltr">For GameChat on Switch 2, people can share their screens in real time, and they don't have to be playing the same game. Nintendo said, "We wanted to create a space where people would naturally gather, whether it's to play the same game together, or different games, or even just to watch."</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo said it foresees the possibility of players using GameChat to help them get through a particularly challenging puzzle or part of a game. If two people are playing the same game but separately, one person can ask a friend for help, and the other person can <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-17-gamechat-part-1/">share their screen.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVjRBTy5irI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fVjRBTy5irI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_C_Button"><strong>The C Button</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo said it believed it would be "bothersome" to have to pause a game, return to the Home screen, and then launch a GameChat session. So the designers convinced the hardware team to create a dedicated button, the C button, to launch GameChat from. Nintendo's designers said this was a "very last-minute request," and it was made "just before" the Joy-Con controller molds were made. As you can see in the image below, the C button is located at the bottom of the right Joy-Con.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491211-screenshot2025-05-09at11.03.33am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4491211" data-ratio="0.53649956024626" data-width="1137" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491211-screenshot2025-05-09at11.03.33am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4491211"></a><figcaption>Behold, the C button (effect added). </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491211-screenshot2025-05-09at11.03.33am.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Camera_And_Microphone_Support"><strong>Camera And Microphone Support</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">GameChat for Switch 2 leverages the console's built-in microphone, while users can also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">connect a USB-C camera</a> for video chats. Nintendo is selling its own Switch 2 camera, while a third-party company is offering a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-official-camera-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-available-to-preorder/1100-6530549/"> Piranha Plant-themed camera. </a>The built-in microphone contains noise-cancelling technology so only the desired sounds come through. Nintendo says someone in the same room could be making a smoothie in a blender and it wouldn't negatively impact the audio quality of a GameChat chat.</p><p dir="ltr">GameChat is baked into Nintendo titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> and Super Mario Party Jamboree, allowing players to see live footage of their friends and hear them speak in real time during gameplay. As you can see in the image below, GameChat allows users to have multiple feeds at the bottom of their main screen, showing what friends are up to. In some games, like Mario Kart World, your friend's faces can be placed next to their characters, so you can see them during matches.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491216-screenshot2025-05-09at11.36.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4491216" data-ratio="0.57327586206897" data-width="1160" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491216-screenshot2025-05-09at11.36.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4491216"></a><figcaption>What GameChat looks like on Switch 2 with the camera and different games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491216-screenshot2025-05-09at11.36.04am.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="GameChat_Won_t_Be_Free_Forever"><strong>GameChat Won't Be Free Forever</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">When the Switch 2 launches in June, everyone can use GameChat for free. However, GameChat will become a paid service included with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/heres-everything-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online-when-nintendo-switch-2-launches/2900-6407/" data-ref-id="2900-6407">Nintendo Switch Online</a> beginning April 1, 2026. Some have speculated that Nintendo is going to raise the price of Nintendo Switch Online memberships, too, but that hasn't happened yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that GameChat will be a paid Nintendo Switch Online feature in 2026, the C button will be useless for people who don't have a paid membership. Rest assured, though, that pressing the C button without a membership <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-happens-if-you-press-the-switch-2s-c-button-without-nso-now-we-know/1100-6530684/">will not lead to anything bad happening.</a> Instead, pressing the button will take you to a page encouraging you to sign up for NSO.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Video_Quality"><strong>Video Quality</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">During the April Nintendo Direct for Switch 2, Nintendo showed off GameChat and many people remarked that the video quality didn't look all that great. The frame rate, in particular, was choppy to say the least. Nintendo explained that it<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-explains-why-switch-2-gamechat-frame-rate-looked-like-that/1100-6530653/"> intentionally made GameChat the smallest footprint possible</a> to save system resources for the games themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">"In order to explain this well, I think it might first help to explain about the resources the system has," Switch 2 hardware director Takuhiro Dohta said, via a translator. "So obviously, chat is meant to run and work simultaneously and coincide with the game you're playing. But we also think it's critical that it doesn't get in the way of the game that's running right now. And so we wanted to definitely make sure we do was to make sure that running game chat alongside the game doesn't result in the game experience or quality being reduced at all in any way.</p><p dir="ltr">"So from a system resource perspective, obviously even the Nintendo Switch had a set of system resources that it needed to tap into to run the system. And now that we have Nintendo Switch 2, there is bigger, more, basically resource budget to use. However, even with that enhanced and larger budget, we try to use as little of that as possible. And they made it happen somehow. And within that small slice of the resource budget, there's other things to take into consideration, like network systems, all that kind of stuff, and all of that taking into account is where we landed in terms of quality of the video that you saw in the footage."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Safety_Concerns"><strong>Safety Concerns</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo previously outlined the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-camera-nintendo-responds-to-safety-and-spying-concerns/1100-6530594/">steps being taken</a> to ensure safety when using GameChat, including audio and video chats. The company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-clarifies-how-and-why-switch-2-could-collect-monitor-and-record-your-gamechats/1100-6531419/" data-ref-id="1100-6531419">may collect and record video and audio chats</a>, but only in the event that a report is filed; otherwise, the data is stored locally on the Switch 2 device. To begin with, players will not be able to use GameChat with everyone on their friend list by default.</p><p dir="ltr">"We assume some players will have somebody on their friend list who they've only played online with once, and yet somehow, they ended up accepting their friend request. Given that possibility, players might feel uncomfortable if suddenly everyone on their friend list can invite them to a video chat," Switch 2 designer Sumikazu Ono said. "With that in mind, during the initial setup, you can choose the friends you want to be able to chat with from your friend list before you start using GameChat."</p><p dir="ltr">If you join a room created by a friend, players will only see people you or your friend have approved from GameChat. Before joining a room, players will see if a friend of a friend is in the room--if they don't want to join for any reason, they don't have to.</p><p dir="ltr">With regard to protecting the safety of children, Ono said Nintendo had a "lot of internal discussion" on this topic--it was decided that children under 16 can only use GameChat with people on their friend list if their parent or guardian has given permission via the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls app.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the case of voice chat, once a parent gives their child approval to chat with a particular person, their child will always be able to connect with the approved person from then on," Ono said.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo takes an "even more cautious" approach for video chats. "When a child tries to start or join a video chat on their Switch 2, a request is sent to the parent's app. The request must be approved before the video chat can begin. While children may feel a bit restricted, we decided to prioritize safety and require parents to approve the request every time," Ono said.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Switch 2 camera has a "privacy shutter" that closes when not in use--as such, players should be able to see at a glance if the camera is on or off.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want everyone to feel comfortable using this feature, so we've placed a high priority on safety to avoid any unpleasant experiences. Of course, we want all players to follow the Community Guidelines, even when chatting with friends," Ono said.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Preorder_The_Switch_2"><strong>Preorder The Switch 2</strong></h2><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, priced at $450 by itself or $500 for a bundle that includes the system and a copy of Mario Kart World. Preorders opened in April, and while the initial stock quickly sold through, there should be more waves of preorders in the time ahead.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> is celebrating its ninth anniversary with two new collaborations: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> and The Witcher.</p>
<p>Springtrap, the FNAF villain, will be the game's next Killer, joining as part of the next anniversary chapter. This marks the first time the character has been playable in a game.</p>
<p>Further details on the Killer's moveset will be revealed in a forthcoming livestream, but a Springtrap Legendary Outfit will be released to match the Yellow Rabbit version of the character seen in the Blumhouse film adaptation - actor Matthew Lillard has lent his likeness and voice for this outfit.</p>

<p>And then there's The Witcher, which will arrive in Dead by Daylight as a series of outfits inspired by the game's iconic cast.</p>
<p>Survivor Vittorio Toscano will receive Geralt's Legendary Outfit, with other outfits coming based on Yennefer, Ciri, Triss, and Eredin. It will be available from 3rd June.</p>
<p>"Our favourite of the Collection is of course Geralt’s Legendary Outfit for Vittorio Toscano," said Dead by Daylight product director, Rose Li. "Not only will it let players essentially take on the exact look of The White Wolf, but we've also added some really nice details as part of this Outfit. Geralt will have unique lobby animations, and best of all, brand-new voice lines recorded for our game by the original voice actor, Doug Cockle."</p>
<p>The news was announced at the Dead by Daylight anniversary celebration at PAX East, where Behaviour reiterated its commitment to making quality of life improvements. Previously, the studio stated it would be postponing several updates by three weeks to focus on bug fixes and address community feedback.</p>
<p>Later this year, the studio will allow players to add more spectators to custom matches and play matches while queueing for events; will rebalance how map and key items work; new anti-cheat measures are on the way; and steps will be taken to reduce camping, slugging, and tunneling.</p>
<p>Lastly, a new chapter will be on the way in 2026 created by the studio in conjunction with the community. In Choose Your Own Adventure style, the original chapter will feature a new Killer and Survivor with features voted on by players.</p>
<p>Back in April, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-the-board-games-next-expansion-lets-you-adjust-the-difficulty-to-frightening-proportions">new expansion for the Dead by Daylight board game was announced</a>, introducing new Killers and Survivors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Back in March, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/08/killing-floor-3-delayed-until-later-in-2025-just-weeks-before-launch/">Killing Floor 3 was delayed just weeks before launch</a> by Tripwire Interactive following feedback from the closed beta. The team put it bluntly that after receiving the feedback they had missed the mark with Killing Floor 3, so would take more time to develop it. Today, Tripwire Interactive has confirmed a new release date for the game, and it is going to be July 24th. The announcement comes ahead of the studio’s PAX East panel where they will talk about the design of Killing Floor 3.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Art and Design of Killing Floor 3 - PAX East Live Stream" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A2Komzj_nNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Since delaying the launch of Killing Floor 3</em><em>, we’ve dedicated the additional development time to responding to the community’s feedback, ensuring the next chapter in the much-loved cult action/horror franchise lives up to our shared vision,”&nbsp;</em>said Bryan Wynia, Creative Director at Tripwire Interactive.&nbsp;<em>“The support from our fans has been incredible, and with the new July 24th release date in sight, we’re thrilled to bring that vision to players not just at launch, but through the continued support of new features and content that is a hallmark of our studio.”</em></p>

<p>Tripwire Interactive has brought back the ability to pre-order the game, having cancelled and refunded pre-orders for Killing Floor 3 when the delay came in March. We went&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/killing-floor-3-preview-beta/">hands on with the Killing Floor 3 beta test</a>, saying <em>“Killing Floor 3 might not be reinventing the horde shooter wheel, but it is taking that next step with the well-established formula. There’s modern touches like being able to mantle over cover and clamber up to higher vantage points, aiding in how manoeuvrable you are and shifting some of the requirements for the level design.”</em></p>

<p>Killing Floor 3 will be released for PC via Steam &amp; Epic, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-bricked-unatuthorized-use/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-systems-may-be-bricked-by-nintendo-following-%E2%80%9Cunauthorized-use%E2%80%9D.1185444/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-bricked-unatuthorized-use/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the attempt to combat piracy, Nintendo is apparently willing to go as far as bricking Nintendo Switch 2 systems following unauthorized use, according to the updated Nintendo Account Agreement.</p>
<p>As reported by<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/eurogamer-nintendo-reserves-the-right-to-remove-digital-licenses-and-or-brick-your-console-following-unauthorised-use-in-bid-to-prevent-piracy.1185375/"> Eurogamer</a>, users should have received a new email recently informing them of the updates made to the Nintendo Account Agreement ahead of the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. Though the wording differs between the European and the United States Agreement, the message is clear. In Europe, digital products are licensed only for personal and non-commercial use, and unauthorized use of a Digital Product may result in the product becoming unusable. In the United States, the update states that the user acknowledges that if they fail to comply with the restrictions by Nintendo, the company can not only render the Account Service unusable, but also the device itself, in whole or in part. While restricting access to online services is nothing new, bricking an entire system seems rather extreme, and would create all sorts of legal troubles for Nintendo pretty much everywhere.</p>
<p>Nintendo has always been among the video game companies that have fought the hardest against piracy, and they have ramped up their battle ahead of the reveal and the imminent launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. Last year, the Japanese company went after the popular <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/">Yuzu emulator</a>, which allowed users, among other things, to enjoy Switch games on PC with higher resolutions, higher framerates, and all sorts of mods. The other popular Switch emulator, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">Ryujinx</a>, was also taken down last October. With the company now warning users that their system may be bricked, it definitely seems like Nintendo's war on piracy has entered a whole new stage, although it remains to be seen if the company will go to such extreme lengths.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/overwatch-2-street-fighter-6-collab-brings-some-iconic-skins-later-this-month.1185441/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-street-fighter-6-collab<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard and Capcom have announced an<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>collaboration, bringing some of the latter's most iconic characters into the hero shooter.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you won't actually be able to play as the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>fighters themselves; rather, they'll be arriving in the form of skins for&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>characters, with the skins roughly corresponding to the hero that best matches the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>character.</p>

<p>The trailer shows off a Dhalsim skin for Zenyatta, a Guile look for Soldier: 76, a Blanka skin for Winston, and a Juno look for Chun-Li, plus Widowmaker cosplaying as Cammy and a few others besides. It's all kicking off on May 20th.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/overwatch-2-street-fighter-6-collab-ryu-cammy-chun-li.jpg?itok=2DSoITdG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/overwatch-2-street-fighter-6-collab-ryu-cammy-chun-li.jpg?itok=dZbBaDY1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>is getting a&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>collab later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's a full list of the skins revealed during the trailer.</p>

<ul><li>Winston - Blanka</li>
	<li>Kiriko - Juri</li>
	<li>Zenyatta - Dhalsim</li>
	<li>Hanzo - Ryu</li>
	<li>Juno - Chun-Li</li>
	<li>Widowmaker - Cammy</li>
	<li>Soldier: 76 - Guile</li>
	<li>Sigma - M. Bison</li>
</ul><p>As far as we know, these are all of the skins that are debuting as part of the&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2 Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>collaboration, although there might be a few fun extras to grab, like emotes or other goodies.</p>

<p>We also don't know what the skins will actually look like in-game, although we do get to see Hanzo as Ryu at the end of the trailer. Granted, he's not actually taking part in a match, but hey - it's better than nothing.</p>




<p>This is far from&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2</em>'s first crossover. The game has stepped outside of its own lore in the past to team up with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-season-7-reveals-diablo-4-crossover-tons-of-skins-new-map-hero-reworks" rel="nofollow">fellow Blizzard stablemate&nbsp;<em>Diablo IV</em></a>, anime&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-celebrates-one-punch-man-collaboration-release-with-new-trailer" rel="nofollow"><em>One Punch Man</em></a>, and, er, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-reveals-collaboration-with-k-pop-group-le-sserafim" rel="nofollow">K-pop band Le Sserafim</a>. Well, why not, eh?</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>skins in&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>when they launch on May 20th across all platforms on which Blizzard's hero shooter is available.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">Mafia: The Old Country was first revealed</a> last year. Following its announcement, the developer confirmed the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-developer-promises-sicilian-voice-acting-and-italian-subtitles">will include Sicilian voice acting and Italian subtitles on its release</a>.</p>
<p>"Authenticity is at the heart of the Mafia franchise," the team wrote in August. "Mafia: The Old Country will offer voice acting in Sicilian, inline with the game's setting in 1900s Sicily. Additionally, Italian language localisation will be available for both in-game UI and via subtitles."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-focused-experience-that-doesnt-require-massive-time-commitments-for-45">Hangar 13 said Mafia: The Old Country would be a "focused, linear" experience</a>, retailing at £45 for those of us in the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo has pushed back on the suggestion that AI-generated images have been used in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.
</p>
<p>
The statement comes after eagle-eyed viewers watching the game's recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWjkbAQOGY8">Nintendo Treehouse livestream</a> noticed in-game billboards by the sides of the racetrack that featured artwork similar in appearance to that made by generative AI.
</p>
<p>
"AI-generated images were not used in the development of Mario Kart World," a Nintendo spokesperson told Eurogamer.

The images in question include artwork of a bridge, used on a billboard in a city area. It includes wonky lines and oddly-placed elements reminscent of an AI-generated image.

A second billboard next to this one features a work-in-progress skyscraper, with strangely-orientated floors and pathways, again similar to an image created using AI generation.

It should be noted that the version of Mario Kart World shown during the Nintendo Treehouse livestream was likely not the final version of the game, and it is normal for placeholder visuals to be present while a game is still in development.
</p>
<p>
It will be interesting to see if these pieces of artwork make it into the game's launch version.

The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s key launch title will arrive on 5th June, alongside Nintendo's new console. I played an hour of the game last month, and came away hugely impressed. "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Mario Kart World reinvents the series, and feels like Switch 2's killer app</a>," I wrote.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/katseye-gnarly-alice-longyu-gao-hyperpop-fans<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>K-pop group KATSEYE dropped their new single “Gnarly” at the end of April, ushering in an edgy new era for the group. I think the song is a full on bop—but k-pop fans hate it.</p><p>KATSEYE is called a “global” k-pop group, based in Los Angeles and managed through a partnership with Korean label HYBE and the American Geffen Records. This allows for some welcome differences from how Korean groups are managed, in that the group’s members have a smidge more freedom in their personal lives. Recently, Lara Raj, one of the group’s members, <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/katseye-member-lara-raj-came-out-as-queer-to-fans-on-weverse-im-half-fruitcake" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came out as queer</a>, saying that she knew she was “half a fruitcake” since she was a kid. Musically, there isn’t much difference between this “global” group and other groups fully based in Korea. The group’s 2024 second single, “Touch” sounds to me exactly like a light, airy, Korean pop song, just with English lyrics.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="KATSEYE (캣츠아이) &quot;Touch&quot; Official MV" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l9CZykYZkOQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“Gnarly” is a little different. It’s not unusual for k-pop groups to change aesthetics with new releases—in fact, audacious changes for each “era” is part of the charm of following a pop group like this. “Gnarly” is much louder and more aggressive than “Touch,” with fuzzed out vocals and a loud, farty synthesizer running through the track. The girls even say “fuck!” Personally, I love the song. It’s a catchy little ditty about how a slang term can encompass many meanings, describing things that are both cool and uncool as “gnarly.” It’s perfect for screaming along to during a long night out.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="KATSEYE (캣츠아이) &quot;Gnarly&quot; Official MV" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R2-yomhYAj4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Apparently, I am alone in this opinion. For the past week, as I perused my little k-pop subreddits while rotting on the couch, every time I saw “Gnarly” mentioned, it was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1kb7hud/katseye_gnarly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fans lamenting</a> how much they hate the song, expressing <a href="https://screenrant.com/k-pop-katseye-gnarly-single-disappointment-discussion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disappointment with the group’s comeback</a>. Teen Vogue has called it “<a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/katseye-gnarly-meaning-behind-song-lyrics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polarizing</a>.” When I looked at the lyrics on Genius, the top comment reads “<a href="https://genius.com/Katseye-gnarly-lyrics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first and last listen I fear</a>.” Some people wondered if it was a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1kb946v/katseyes_gnarly_just_a_prank_cause_what_was_that/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prank</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1kbobsd/megathread_katseyes_gnarly_and_everything_related/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">satire</a>, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1kbmzo1/im_99_sure_katseyes_gnarly_is_terrible_on_purpose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terrible on purpose</a>.</p><p>One of the major complaints seems to be the lyrics of the song, which are pretty silly, but that’s never been a dealbreaker for a pop song from any country. Grammy Award-winning artist and <a href="https://aftermath.site/charli-brat-kamala-vibes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">should-have-been-Coachella-headliner Charli XCX</a> has a genuinely touching song on her breakthrough pop album <em>Brat</em> with the lyric “why I wanna buy a gun/why I wanna to shoot myself.” The lyrics “hottie hottie, like a bag of Takis,” to me, is no less silly than that. “Gnarly” is also a much more infectious ear worm than many other English language k-pop songs, lest we forget when Blackpink hit ‘em with that “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHNzOHi8sJs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ddu-du ddu-du du</a>.”</p><p>The negative fan reaction got so intense that Manon, one of the members of KATSEYE, said on Instagram Live,, “If you get it, you get it, and if you don’t get it, kindly, get the fuck away from us.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="manon’s response to the gnarly haters 🤭#katseye" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_7bgUhAHi8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The group later shared a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJFYX8IzlGI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok video where they quoted a Nicki Minaj meme</a>, telling fans that they’ll like “Gnarly” better after a few more listens.</p><p>I think I understand the reason for k-pop fans' frustration, especially <em>these</em> fans, who are obsessed enough with these groups to talk about them on the internet all day. While k-pop can encompass a ton of different sounds and styles, the genre’s production style smooths out all the edges. K-pop functions a little bit like <em>Fortnite</em>, in that it is kind of a black hole that absorbs culture and remakes it in its own image. You liked that song “Water” by Tyla? Okay, well, here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNexS61fjus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">k-pop version of an afrobeats song</a>. You like PinkPantheress? New Jeans released an entire EP that sounds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArmDp-zijuc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>a lot</em> like her whole deal</a>. At a very basic level, <em>all</em> of k-pop is a refraction of American hip hop and R&amp;B, to the point that a lot of groups have been criticized for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/20/k-pop-black-fans-creatives-industry-accountable-race" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appropriating black culture</a>. Some fans find that appropriation—which often comes with a serving of anti-black racism—is so extreme that <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/i-was-a-black-k-pop-fan-for-2-decades-unstanned" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they have sworn off the genre entirely</a>.</p><p>I feel like I know what’s going on with “Gnarly.” This song is at least partially based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Sfer9-f3U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a demo by Alice Longyu Gao</a>, a songwriter who’s been associated with the hyperpop genre, which also encompasses artists like the aforementioned Charli XCX, producer AG Cook and gen-z maniacs 100 Gecs. The songs produced by these artists are all extremely aggressive and bold—and also have been extremely popular over the past year. Charli XCX’s <em>Brat</em> was such a hit that “brat summer” lasted an entire year. Instead of being a k-pop version of a hyperpop song, “Gnarly” kind of just <em>is</em> a hyperpop song, with all the sharp edges that come with that.</p><p>I asked Julianne Escobedo Shepherd, co-founder of <a href="https://www.hearingthings.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hearing Things</a>, why she thought k-pop fans disliked the song. While she thinks maybe the Tesla namedrop in its lyrics has something to do with it, she thinks it’s mostly about how the song differs from other k-pop tracks, especially other tracks from the label HYBE.</p><p>“There’s definitely a HYBE sound,” she said. “It’s New Jeans: it’s very vibey, very demure.”</p><p>There is nothing demure about “Gnarly,” however.</p><p>“I think that ‘Gnarly’ probably grates because it is so aggressive sounding,” Shepherd continued. “It reminds me of some old Big Bang songs in the sort of dubstep gesturing. So I can see why some current k-pop fans are not feeling it. There’s also no singing, which is probably unpleasant to some people.”</p><p>All of these qualities are the ones that make me enjoy the song a lot. In fact, I think the song is a showcase for one of the most important qualities of a pop group in any genre: charisma. When KATSEYE perform this song, they perform the fuck out of it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrm7PP1mbtI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">down to their facial expressions</a>. When they say they’re the shit, I believe them. How gnarly.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-analysis-details-rockstar"><h3>A Video Game Trailer Maker’s Take On The Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer</h3></a><p>"If this was a better trailer, then people would be that much more hyped.

			<p>Hideki Kamiya has found himself working with Capcom once again with the unexpected, but highly anticipated sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/">Okami</a>, but it's not the only game he wants to work with Capcom on.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-remake/">February</a>, in a video on his YouTube channel, in response to a question about remaking the first Devil May Cry game, Kamiya said that he would love to go back and remake Devil May Cry, and even added in that he wants to go back to Viewtiful Joe as well.</p>
<p>Once again, in a video on his<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HidekiKamiya_Channel"> YouTube channel</a>, when asked the same question, Kamiya gave the same answer.</p>
<p>"<em>As for a Devil May Cry remake, of course I'd love to do that. I usually don't replay my own games after release, and Devil May Cry is no exception. But once in a while, I catch gameplay clips and think, 'yeah, this really does feel like a 24-year-old game design. With today's technology and game design approach, of course, I'd want to remake it from the ground up. If that ever happen...well, I don't think seriously unless it's really happening, so right now, I don't have anything in mind. But if the time comes,I'll come up with something. That's what I do! So Capcom, leave it to me! Also, let me handle Viewtiful Joe too!</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="“**** remake?” “**** sequel?” &quot;Capcom—Please leave it to me!&quot; Comment Reply Part 11!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOBoqQCcRTQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, it's not a surprise that he gave the same answer. It seems like he doesn't mind being asked the question, as it gives him yet another chance to very publicly declare to Capcom and anyone who will listen that he wants to go back to Devil May Cry.</p>
<p>DMC and Viewtiful Joe also aren't the only games he'd want to revisit, as he also previously said he'd love to work on <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-would-love-to-make-scalebound-again-someday/">Scalebound</a> again, if the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>Hideki Kamiya is one of the industry's most renowned and respected creators, who is partly responsible for some of gaming's most iconic and beloved series. It would be very interesting to see how he'd approach a remake for Devil May Cry, so hopefully someone at Capcom is paying attention.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Don’t look now, but a confirmed gamer is leading the Catholic Church]]></title>
            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/newly-anointed-pope-leo-xiv-is-our-first-confirmed-gamer-pontiff/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-look-now-but-a-confirmed-gamer-is-leading-the-catholic-church.1185396/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/newly-anointed-pope-leo-xiv-is-our-first-confirmed-gamer-pontiff/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Yesterday's naming of Chicago native Robert Prevost as Pope Leo XIV—the first American-born leader of the Catholic church—has already led to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bennyheis.bsky.social/post/3loolfxng2c2a">plenty</a> of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/calliopeanim.bsky.social/post/3loot346axs2m">jokes</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pearlmania500/video/7502177512856816942?_r=1&amp;_t=ZP-8wD5lhDRLCB">memes</a> about his potential interactions with various bits of American pop culture. And that cultural exposure apparently extends to some casual video games, making Leo XIV our first confirmed gamer pope.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/brothers-of-pope-leo-xiv-share-their-reactions-239211077911">Speaking to NBC5 Chicago</a> Thursday, papal sibling John Prevost confirmed that the soon-to-be-pope played a couple of games just before flying to the papal conclave earlier this week. "First we do <em>Wordle</em>, because this is a regular thing," Prevost said. "Then we do <em>Words with Friends</em>. It's something to keep his mind off life in the real world..."</p>
<p>OK, so the pope's love of casual word games doesn't exactly put him in the same category of people who are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/12-years-six-hours-and-23211-demons-defeating-one-of-doom-2s-hardest-maps/">speedrunning <em>Doom</em> slaughter maps</a>. But it's still striking to realize that the 69-year-old pontiff is among the reported <a href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/essential-facts-about-the-us-video-game-industry/2024-data/">44 percent of American Baby Boomer men who play video games regularly</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://civicscience.com/the-wordle-trend-is-still-going-strong/">15 percent of Americans aged 55 and over</a> who have played <em>Wordle</em> specifically<em>.</em></p>
<h2>A new generation</h2>
<p>In the recent past, papal interest in video games has usually taken the form of official statements decrying their potential for harm. Pope Francis, for instance, <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/francis-makes-rousing-call-millennials-get-couch-and-fix-world">warned in a 2016 speech</a> that young people should avoid spending excessive time on "a sofa that promises us hours of comfort so we can escape to the world of video games and spend all kinds of time in front of a computer screen." And in 2007, Pope Benedict XVI <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/pope-benedict-xvi-criticizes-violent-video-games">specifically called out</a> video games "which in the name of entertainment exalt violence and portray anti-social behavior or the trivialization of human sexuality."</p>
