Each of them features unique movesets and abilities to dominate the arena!</p><ul><li><strong>Balzarr</strong> – Nicknamed the Demon Star, Balzarr is a new Titan that came to Earth from outer space as a blazing meteor. It is equipped with a powerful blade tail and high agility, which allows it to leap around the battlefield while cleaving its enemies into pieces. It can also enter its signature Predator Stance, allowing it to perch on walls and even on its own tail to unlock the use of more deadly abilities.</li><li><strong>R.O.J.A.K.</strong> – Five minds in one body; R.O.J.A.K. is a battle mech controlled by an uncoordinated team of Mighty Warriors serving as mankind’s last line of defense against Balzarr. Chomp down your foes with your T-Rex torso, kick enemies into the sky with your cannon-powered boots, snipe foes from afar with your Dragon arm, launch Durian bombs at your enemies, and more. Landing an attack with each body part will allow the pilots to synergize and activate the mech’s full potential.</li></ul><p>With the release of this new downloadable content release along with the past collaboration with the Tokusatsu genre titans such as Godzilla and Ultraman, <em>GigaBash</em> now has a grand total of 18 playable characters in its roster. So will you help the R.O.J.A.K. team protect humanity from this celestial invader, or will you play as Balzarr and unleash hell on Earth?</p></blockquote><p><em>GigaBash</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,815 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,998 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,123 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,439 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,883 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,098 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546400/GigaBash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/gigabash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/concernedape-eric-barone-stardew-valley-crossover-with-fortnite<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Creator Eric Barone says there are no plans yet, but he's open to the idea of a collaboration with Fortnite.</h2></div><section><p>Stardew Valley is no stranger to nods to other games. Among other references, Patch 1.6 has a well-placed Terraria easter egg. Nevertheless, Stardew Valley has never really appeared in another games, though creator Eric Barone aka ConcernedApe definitely has some ideas in that front.</p><p>In a Discord conversation shared by Panedwards on X/Twitter, Barone talks about the possibility of a Stardew Valley collaboration, acknowledging that he's open to a crossover and saying that he would love to have Pam in particular in Fortnite.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The creator of 'Stardew Valley' aka <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ConcernedApe</a> has been trying to make a <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@FortniteGame</a> collaboration happen and is open to anything. <a href="https://t.co/wnaEfgIc5q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/wnaEfgIc5q</a></p>— Panedwards (@Panedwards_YT) <a href="https://twitter.com/Panedwards_YT/status/1828161152817254710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>"It doesn't have to be Pam though, I would be open to anything," Barone adds. "Abigail &amp; Sebatian could be good. Stardrop or Joja Cola item? Galaxy sword or slingshot?"</p><p>All of these items would be fun additions to Fortnite, and Stardew Valley's aesthetic is certainly in line with Epic's ultra-popular sandbox shooter. Pam would hardly look out of place next to Buff Peter Griffin, Solid Snake, and all the other Fortnite crossover characters. But could it actually happen?</p><p>Reached for comment, one of Barone's representatives acknowledged that the screenshot is real, but added a bit of additional context from ConcernedApe.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/27/pam-stardew-valley-1724797104836.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Pam would definitely be a monster in Fortnite.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"I have a small team of people who help me with Stardew updates, admin and business stuff. Sometimes, we play games together, and one game we enjoy playing is Fortnite (Zero Build). One time we were playing and someone said 'what if there was a Pam skin in Fortnite?' And it kind of became a meme for us, like we were imagining us all playing as a squad with identical Pam skins. It was just a silly fun idea," Barone explained in a statement sent to IGN. </p><p>"Then someone asked me if I would collab with Fortnite and I mentioned the Pam thing. There's nothing official in the works or anything like that, but yea we would find it amusing and fun if we were able to play as Pam (or any other Stardew character, really) someday. Other than the occasional gaming session, my team and I are completely focused on Stardew Valley development and ports right now."</p><p>Indeed, ConcernedApe has been busy recently amid the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Stardew_Valley_1.6_Update">release of Patch 1.6</a> and ongoing work on the anticipated release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-haunted-chocolatier-developer-may-have-teased-the-return-of-a-beloved-stardew-valley-character">Haunted Chocolatier</a>. Fans are still awaiting the release of Patch 1.06 on the Nintendo Switch, which failed to materialize during the Nintendo Direct earlier today. As for Fortnite, it's in the midst of its latest Marvel collaboration, having added <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-to-get-disney-villains-incredibles-characters-and-a-season-with-doctor-doom-d23-2024">Doctor Doom for Chapter 5 Season 4</a>.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-ps5-version-requires-early-access-players-to-restart<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The size of AAA games these days means bugs are almost inevitable, especially in open-world games like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>. Whether it's a graphical glitch, a stuttering line, or something more serious, everyone has stories of running into bugs, and sometimes fixing those can be problematic for developers.</p>
<p>In a message sent out to <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> PS5 players, Ubisoft has apologized to those who "had access to an older version of the game", as they might be encountering issues after the most recent update on PlayStation 5. In the letter, they tell players to make sure they've updated to the latest version (1.000.002 as of the time it was sent), and to start a new save as if they continue on a prior save they will "unfortunately face issues and progression blockers."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws.jpg?itok=ypZeWHAL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws.jpg?itok=kjWpQJFb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Image Credit: Andreas Lopez</figcaption></figure><p>While journalists and influencers are used to issues from testing games heading up to release, including needing to restart, what makes <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> different here is that it follows the increasingly popular trend of AAA games to allow early access to players who pay more for a special edition that lets them play the game up to three days later. Thus, players who paid a premium to get their hands on <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> just a bit earlier are losing their progression, and time spent in the game because Ubisoft failed to ensure that the version released was ready for its effective actual launch date.</p>
<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> has received largely positive reviews, including our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Star Wars Outlaws Review"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> review</a> by Erren Van Duine, but this highlights a problem with this model of release, where major publishers are releasing these games as completed with essentially two separate release dates. Here, we see these premium-paying players losing saves they made during that time so far. Electronic Arts has used the same period to help <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/madden-nfl-25-review-limits-ea" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="New Madden’s lack of launch week review scores was partially by EA’s design">shield <em>Madden</em> from reviews</a>, by not letting reviewers publish their reviews until after the early access period was up and it reached the second, 'official', release date.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-owe-money.jpg?itok=IBF7QDdr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-owe-money.jpg?itok=eSjXBAbS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This might be how some <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> players on PlayStation are feeling after they ponied up for the pricier versions</figcaption></figure><p>This is far from the first time that Ubisoft has faced issues with bugs in their games. Most famously would be with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-addresses-every-known-assassins-creed-unity-glitch-and-workaround" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ubisoft addresses every known Assassin's Creed Unity glitch and workaround"><em>Assassin's Creed Unity</em></a>, which became notorious for its wide variety of glitches, so much so that a decade later it's still a byword for it. However, even that game didn't reach the heights of Ubisoft's worst bug, which came in 2001 with <em>Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor</em>, a <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> RPG that when you went to uninstall it, the game would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011126120955/https://www.arstechnica.com/reviews/01q4/pool_of_radiance/pool-1.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor Ars Technica Review">uninstall system files on your computer.</a></p>
<p>As for now, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> appears poised to join the <em>Star Wars: Jedi</em> games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order"><em>Fallen Order</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Review"><em>Jedi Survivor</em></a> as substantial modern single-player additions to the rich <em>Star Wars </em>video game history. Even if it is making life harder on those who tossed in some extra credits to play early.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-gets-price-rise-in-japan-increasing-by-90/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation 5 is becoming even more expensive in Japan, in an announcement made by Sony on the <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/08/27/20240827-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Japanese PlayStation blog</a>. This price hike comes after "the recent challenging external environment, including the current fluctuations in the global economic situation, and the impact it will have on our business."&nbsp; With the current state of PlayStation's finances across the globe, the price hike isn't too surprising. However, it is a relatively drastic price rise for <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-61-7-million-units/">PlayStation 5</a> overall. Regardless of what edition of the console people buy, they will now have to fork out an extra $90 in Yen.</p>
<p>For those who still want to get a PlayStation 5 and live in Japan, now would be the time, as the price rise for the console goes into effect as of September 2. The disc edition of the PlayStation 5 will be going from ¥66,980 (~$465) to ¥79,980 (~$550), which is a stark increase. It's no better for the digital edition of the PlayStation 5, as the price of that edition is going from ¥59,980 (~$417) to ¥72,980 (~507).</p>
<p>Compared to other consoles, PlayStation 5 is the only one that hasn't seen any form of a price decrease over the years, except for decreases when the console is on a temporary sale. Even then, the sales don't happen often, so it's slim to none that people will actually be able to get the console at a reasonable price. While Sony is said to be doing this due to the world's economic climate right now, it most likely won't go over very well by raising the price of the console. It's now made it even more unobtainable for people to get, compared to an Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch, which is significantly cheaper.</p>
<p>Since launch, the PlayStation 5 has seen multiple price hikes in Japan specifically, with both the disc and digital edition receiving significant price rises. Since the release of the console, both editions have seen a total price rise of $210~ and $225, respectively, compared to other countries that haven't seen price rises as significant. However, when the console first received a price rise in Japan, the UK and Europe experienced price increases. Whether the same will happen this time round remains to be seen.</p>
<p>However, it doesn't stop there. Sony has also confirmed that the accessories for the PlayStation 5 will also be experiencing price rises. For example, Dualsense Wireless Controllers and the PlayStation VR2 will all become pricier in Japan as of September 2. Whether the accessories will experience a price increase globally will remain to be seen until the price hikes are officially enforced in Japan.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/spiders-mismanagement-strike-minecraft-greedfall<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To hear French game dev union STJV tell it, workers at Spiders – the studio behind flawed but consistently-ambitious role-playing games like <em>Greedfall</em>, <em>Steelrising</em>, and <em>The Technomancer</em> – are not having a good time right now. Today the union <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/08/open-letter-from-spiders-workers-to-their-employer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published an open letter to management</a> alleging a litany of deal-breaking issues at the company, which has been signed by 44 out of 95 Spiders staffers. Next week the studio will go on strike – (partially) in <em>Minecraft</em>.</p><p>STJV says that Spiders workers previously went on strike in January, but conditions within the studio continued to deteriorate. The letter covers “several” years’ worth of issues, including “instability, opposition to anticipating problems and securing working conditions, global mismanagement, turnover and recruitment problems, unacceptable delays in achieving gender equality and parity, important lack of transparency, denial of problems, [and] refusal to acknowledge worker representation and blocked negotiations.”&nbsp;</p><p>STJV added: “We had demanded that the head of the company receive a delegation of Spiders’ workers to discuss all these points. She accepted, the delegation came to a meeting on August 27, and then waited in vain for the management to come, which it never did.”</p><p>As a result, Spiders workers are going on strike starting on September 2. They plan to picket outside the company’s offices in Paris and – in what I believe is a first for this kind of thing – also in <em>Minecraft</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>“In particular, we will be organizing pickets on September 2 and 3 in front of the company’s offices and online on a <em>Minecraft </em>server created for the occasion,” STJV wrote. “We are inviting our relatives, friends, supporters, workers in the industry in general, journalists, and political actors to join us at the pickets.”</p><p>Aftermath will of course be on the scene bringing you all the latest updates. In <em>Minecraft</em>, at least.</p><p><em>Thanks to Aftermath subscriber Kaile Hultner for tipping us off about this one!</em> <em>If you'd like to join our Discord, you can do so by subscribing <a href="http://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As one of the players affected who had access to an older version of the game, we are aware you might be encountering some issues after this recent patch.

Players on social media have reported encountering the progress block and having to start new games as a result.</p><p>"I just got this email this morning, wish I knew that b4 I played 5 hours last night," one Reddit user said. "Honestly this game is testing my patience."</p><p>Adding insult to injury is that Star Wars Outlaws is still in its early access period, meaning that PS5 players who have access paid more than $100 for the Gold Edition release.

                <p dir="ltr">For years, the Lego franchise has dominated a specific space for licensed action-platformers, taking the essence of properties ranging from Star Wars to Harry Potter and transposing them into a goofy video game setting. What makes the Lego games fun, apart from their players' affinity for colorful blocks, is the lighthearted tone inherent in translating the stories of various movies into toy form.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/funko-fusion/" data-ref-id="5000-569178">Funko Fusion</a> has a lot of surface similarities with Lego's takes on video games, and the main one is a similarly comedic take on a lot of subject matter. Where Lego generally skews young, however, Funko Fusion, like the vinyl Pop toys the game is based on, wants to attract an older audience.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Funko Fusion Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At the top level, Funko Fusion is a 3D action-platformer using the Funko Pop art aesthetic and combining a bunch of different properties--mostly Universal Pictures movies, but with additions like He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, Five Nights at Freddy's, and Mega Man mixed in, as well. There's an overarching story in which an evil, gooey vinyl guy named Eddie starts possessing and mutating Funko toys to turn them into monsters, but the gist is that you travel between the "worlds" of different characters, finding yourself plopped into their movies, games, or TV shows, as they're altered because of Eddie's influence.</p><p dir="ltr">I played 20 minutes of Funko Fusion at a recent Xbox Gamescom event in Los Angeles, which focused on a level based on Jurassic World. The level gave a brief glimpse of the kind of humor Funko is going for. In the opening cutscene for the level, I watched a giant, possessed dinosaur toy--the Indominus Rex from the first Jurassic World--chomp a few random vinyl park-goers and InGen corporate security guys. In the next moment, as the Funko Pop versions of Jurassic World protagonists Owen and Claire (played by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard in the movies) fled from the loose dinosaurs now overrunning the park, Claire got her giant Funko Pop head trapped in the closing double-doors of a gift shop. That's a pretty good indication of the tone that developer 10:10 Games is going for.</p><p dir="ltr">"The major thesis of the game was, action platformers are great, people really love these types of games, and then, for no good reason whatsoever, the genre abandons them once they get to a certain age--and we can do better," Jason Bischoff, Funko's vice president of licensing and business development, told me in an interview.</p><p dir="ltr">Bischoff said the developers of Funko Fusion targeted a T rating from the start of development for a few different reasons. First, the group of people who tend to be interested in and collect Funko Pop toys skews older--there are younger people who buy them, too, but among the huge number of licensed properties represented in the toys are many that are pretty old and would generally only appeal to older fans. Second, Bischoff said, the game is full of "Itchy and Scratchy-like violence," referencing the often-gross and over-the-top in-universe cartoon of The Simpsons, and that required a T rating. And finally, there were the particular licensed properties Funko and the game's developers wanted to include that were often a lot more adult than one might expect for a toy-focused game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358155-funkofusionjurassicworld4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358155" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358155-funkofusionjurassicworld4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358155"></a><figcaption>Dinosaurs look kinda cute as Funko toys, but they were pretty deadly in the demo.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358155-funkofusionjurassicworld4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Those properties include John Carpenter's The Thing, the 1982 horror film that's full of disgusting body-horror monsters. Funko and 10:10 Games released a demo for Funko Fusion on Steam that takes players into its levels based on The Thing, adding some comedy to that film's story by converting its gross, twisted mutant monsters to the Funko aesthetic.</p><p dir="ltr">What's probably the main draw of Funko Fusion, at least for people who aren't already excited about the Funko brand, is the breadth of different properties included. Bischoff said there are 21 different properties tied into the game but hinted that there are plenty of secret characters and maybe even worlds for players to find, too. The list is as weird as it is impressive, including The Thing, Jurassic World, 1999's The Mummy starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weiss, the Jordan Peele-directed Nope, Edgar Wright's genre comedies Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, the 1978 Battlestar Galactica TV series, the foul-mouthed murderous possessed doll Chucky, Jaws, Back to the Future, Voltron, and Netflix's The Umbrella Academy.</p><p dir="ltr">The short look at the Jurassic World level I played gave a quick sense of the moment-to-moment gameplay of Funko Fusion, especially when compared to the Steam demo. It seems you can expect, at least at the start of the world, to get mission objectives that have you exploring a large space as you gather collectibles or kill specific enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">In Jurassic World, the first part of the level is playing out the moment from the film in which all the dinosaurs get loose, focusing mostly on pteranodons swooping down to harass fleeing park guests. You're let loose in the large outer area of the park, which is littered with gift shops and restaurants, with the goal of searching for and shooting five loose dilophosaurus. The spitting dinosaurs have a tendency to run when you threaten them, which can make it tough to track them all down.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358156-funkofusion-jurassicworld2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358156" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358156-funkofusion-jurassicworld2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358156"></a><figcaption>Each world gives you a choice of different characters from its story, each with their own abilities.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358156-funkofusion-jurassicworld2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At the start of the level, you can pick one of four characters--Owen, Claire, Barry, or Kayla (the latter played by Omar Sy and DeWanda Wise in the films). Each has a different main weapon and melee attack, and different capabilities, making them good at different ranges. Owen has a dodge roll and a slower-firing, more powerful rifle, for example, while Claire rolls and carries a faster assault rifle. Barry has a shotgun, but instead of a dodge roll, he gets a shield he can pull out to protect him from damage. There are puzzles in the level that require a certain character to access, and you can quickly swap to any of the other characters whenever you find a Funko Pop box.</p><p dir="ltr">Apart from your main goal, though, you're also free to explore the area to solve puzzles and search for secrets, of which there are a ton. Each level has a bunch of optional objectives to find, like hidden "crown" items that are a lot like the stars of various Mario games--you're putting them toward a larger goal that stretches across all the worlds. You can also find items that let you power up different mold machines to unlock new gear. In Funko Fusion, everything runs on vinyl, and you can earn bits of vinyl from smashing items, beating enemies, and opening treasure chests scattered everywhere. You can then spend that vinyl at mold machines to craft stuff like soda drinks that heal you or give you temporary buffs, new weapons like a grenade launcher or minigun, or environmental items like a bounce pad that can get you to locations you couldn't otherwise reach.</p><p dir="ltr">Putting the focus on vinyl as the lifeblood of the game is how 10:10 Games was able to make He-Man and Mega Man fit with Shaun of the Dead and Jaws, Bischoff said, in the same way that physical Funko toys act to unify those different stories and characters. Everything in the world is made of vinyl, and that gave the developers the ability to unify cartoonish worlds with those in which a character occasionally gets dismembered, bringing both together to a funny tonal middle ground.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358160-funkofusionthething.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358160" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358160-funkofusionthething.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358160"></a><figcaption>The Funko approach takes some intense, often gory stories, like The Thing, and makes them funny through the lens of the toys.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358160-funkofusionthething.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The demo gave me the sense that, in order to complete a few of the puzzles I ran into, I'd need to return to these worlds later when I had access to new crafting blueprints gained from other locations. And as mentioned, you sometimes need specific characters, including ones that aren't native to that particular world. I couldn't open a specific gold door in the Jurassic World level during the demo, but when I later played the Steam demo, I discovered how to clear it: by finding and using He-Man to knock the door down with his sword. Opening the door in The Thing world uncovered a new puzzle that required a different character to solve and was tied to the Battlestar Galactica characters. So it seems there will be lots of different ways the worlds can interact with each other, both from a story standpoint and through secrets you can unlock along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">You're encouraged to use different characters, and Funko Fusion will include more than 60, but you're not required to. If you've got a particular character you love, you can stick with them and the crafting system will help you make sure you don't miss out on anything, Bischoff said.</p><p dir="ltr">"Let's just say you're the world's biggest Orko fan," he said, referencing the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe character. "If you want to play Orko top to tail, you can do that. The mold machines ultimately will allow you to craft the wacky weapons or other supplementary gadgets to basically backfill the special abilities that Orko does not have."</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the Jurassic World demo was concerned with combat, and there were plenty of dinosaurs to fight. In addition to those five dilophosaurus and the pteranodons pestering everyone, there were points when the park was suddenly full of fast, deadly velociraptors. These guys would sometimes leap out of bushes in ambush, or come charging at you in large groups, taking a lot of fire to bring down. Staying alive can be tough, with a lot of scrambling combat that uses your dodge and shield and dumping lots of bullets into enemies to bring them down.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358154-funkofusion-jurassicworld.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358154" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358154-funkofusion-jurassicworld.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358154"></a><figcaption>We only saw the earliest part of the Jurassic World level, which looks to loosely follow the story of the films.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358154-funkofusion-jurassicworld.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Apart from the dinosaurs, I also ran into InGen security teams wielding guns of their own. Approaching the Jurassic World Information Center, the passageway deeper into the park, I was attacked by a bunch of gun-wielding enemies, with a sniper on top of the building throwing down explosive grenades to make things even more hectic. There's a lot of gunplay in the game, and despite the fact that everyone looks like a vinyl toy with a big head, you're frequently blowing off their heads, burning off their vinyl skin, and rendering them into toy skeletons. Packing health items is essential because you're going to take a lot of damage; the enemies in Funko Fusion are definitely coming for you.</p><p dir="ltr">When I finally found all five dilophosaurus, cleared the way to the Information Center, and obtained the key to open it, I was treated to a velociraptor ambush and then another of Funko Fusion's typical puzzles. This one required powering up the door in order to exit into the next area. It requires tracing a power line from the switch back to its power source, which you need to charge up with a battery. The line itself also had breaks in it that needed fuses to complete.</p><p dir="ltr">The trick here was to identify different items around the room that <em>didn't</em> need power and pilfer the parts from those to fix the door switch. A nearby vending machine, which you can use to nab power-ups, was powered by a battery you could snag from it--but ideally, after you'd already gotten the consumable items you needed. Fuses were also hidden around the room, powering things like neon signs and holographic dinosaur displays. Once those were plugged in, the switch opened, and I was able to race out into the next area, although I didn't see much more before the demo ended.</p><p dir="ltr">What's a little more obvious in the Steam demo, which isn't timed, is the overall tone of Funko Fusion. That demo covers what appears to be the beginning of the game, setting up the plot in which Freddy Funko, a vinyl character who Bischoff described as "the world's biggest fan," a 10-year-old boy, and the newish owner of the Funko factory that produces all the toys, is attacked by his evil antithesis, Eddie Funko.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358161-funkofusionshaunofthedead.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358161" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358161-funkofusionshaunofthedead.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358161"></a><figcaption>Funko Fusion incorporates a lot of surprising movie franchises, including Shaun of the Dead.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358161-funkofusionshaunofthedead.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Eddie quickly possesses the first character you meet, a cute talking fox who works with Freddy, and turns him into a giant, misshapen fiend. Killing a friendly character turned into a hulking monster is a surprising start to a game like this and casts the whole experience as a goofy but self-aware and potentially dark comedy.</p><p dir="ltr">"Almost right out the gate when you start the title, when you meet Eddie for the first time, we knew that we wanted to give a voice to all the 'haterade' out there, right?" Bischoff said. "Because if Freddie is the Richie Cunningham, what is the opposite of that? Like an evil Fonz. So that's kind of who Eddie Funko is. And literally, we have taken quotes that we've been hearing for years from folks that aren't necessarily big Funko advocates, or maybe they're Funko critics--like Eddie literally says, 'This dead-eyed, misshapen form.' Some of the other bigger critics and their voices, the things that they've said through the years, we wanted to give that stuff a voice, to pit these two ideas against one another over the course of this adventure."</p><p dir="ltr">The idea of delving into different movie worlds, several of which have never been brought to games before, is the thing that interests me most when it comes to Funko Fusion. In playing both demos, though, I was surprised by the density of the game's levels. They seem littered with small side objectives, secrets, puzzles, and Easter eggs that make them worth exploring, and I'm fascinated to see how the game will approach stories and franchises that haven't gotten this kind of attention in the video game space before.</p><p dir="ltr">Funko Fusion is set to release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 on September 13, and on Nintendo Switch and PS4 on November 15.</p>

            <p>
Sony has announced a significant price hike for PlayStation 5 in Japan, which will see the cost of the standard and Digital Editions of the console rise by ¥13,000 (around £70).
</p>
<p>
Announcing the news in a <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/08/27/20240827-ps5/">post on its Japanese PlayStation Blog</a>, Sony blamed the price hike (as per Google Translate) on "the recent challenging external environment, including the current fluctuations in the global economic situation, and the impact it will have on our business".
</p>
<p>
When its new prices come into effect on 2nd September, the disc version of PlayStation 5 will increase from ¥66,980 (around £350) to ¥79,980 (around £420). As for the disc-free Digital Edition, it'll see its price rise from ¥59,980 (£314) to ¥72,980 (£380).

<p>
Sony's new price points for PlayStation 5 aren't the first time the company has chosen to increase the cost of PlayStation 5 in Japan. The standard console was originally priced at ¥49,980 when it released back in 2020, while the Digital Edition cost ¥39,980 - making for an increases of around £160 and £170 respectively since launch.
</p>
<p>
Sony's announcement has also confirmed price bumps for a wide range of PlayStation accessories in Japan too, with the likes of DualSense Wireless Controllers and PlayStation VR2 all set to be more expensive from 2nd September.
</p>
<p>
Sony last increased the cost of Japanese PS5s back in 2022, which was accompanied by a £30/€50 price hike for the console in the UK and Europe, bringing the price to £480/€550 for the standard edition and £390/€450 for its Digital Edition counterpart. There's no indication its latest Japanese price hike will be mirrored in any other territories.

<p>There are too many wacky video game concepts to list, from Goat Simulator to the upcoming Squirrel With a Gun, many of which bring mayhem and mesmerizing moments. Well, as it turns out, they can get a touch crazier over time. Squirrel With a Gun is the perfect example, in which you play as a squirrel…with a gun. The team intends to keep up with the crazy concept by introducing several free updates as post-launch support in Squirrel With a Gun!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-to-squirrel-with-a-gun-post-launch">What’s Coming to Squirrel With a Gun Post-Launch?</h2>



<p>It’s always welcome seeing an upcoming indie game planning for the absolute best. Developer Dee Dee Creations already has a full year of post-launch updates in store for Squirrel With a Gun, some of which may prove game-changing in the best of ways. Others, however, seem like more quality-of-life, which is always a plus in my book!</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Dee Dee Creations LLC</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>September 2024 – Photo Mode</li>



<li>December 2024 – New Level (Super Platforming Challenge)</li>



<li>December 2024 – A New Rival</li>



<li>February 2025 – Outfit Variety Pack</li>



<li>March 2025 – Gravity Gun</li>



<li>June 2025 – Squirr-LGBT</li>



<li>August 2025 – The Varmint Collection</li>
</ul>



<p>I’m most excited about a photo mode, the new rival, and a gravity gun. Something about a squirrel with a gravity gun sounds so enticing.</p>

<h2 id="h-when-can-you-play-squirrel-with-a-gun">When Can You Play Squirrel With a Gun?</h2>



<p>The wait to play Squirrel With a Gun is nearly over, as the indie action platformer launches on August 29 on PC. It’s also coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, albeit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-gets-october-2024-release-date-for-xbox-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime in October</a>. </p>



<p>You can pre-order the game now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2067050/Squirrel_with_a_Gun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. For a short period, the price will be reduced from $19.99 to $17.99, thanks to a welcome 10% discount. </p>



<p>For that price, and based on our hands-on playthrough of the game recently, it’s worth every penny. You’ll easily get your money’s worth as the mayhem ramps up with each new level!</p>



<hr>



<p>Squirrel With a Gun may be a summer blockbuster, with plenty of whacky antics for players to lose themselves. You can bet Insider Gaming plans to play it on day one!</p>

It's celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, which makes it one of the older <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">modern classics</a> that's still in heavy rotation. The game is revered around the world. It has won major international awards, including the highly coveted <a href="https://cdn.svc.asmodee.net/production-daysofwonder/uploads/2023/09/DoW_news018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spiel des Jahres</a> (Game of the Year) award the year it came out, and continues to be held in high regard by gamers worldwide.</p><p>Due to its ease of play, Ticket to Ride can be played across generations, making it a great <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">board game for families</a> to play together. It also has educational appeal because it explores multiple countries and cities in a unified way. I’ve personally used it as a tool to help my kids learn about major cities worldwide while also keeping them engaged in this fun game of train merriment. </p><p>Ticket to Ride's concept is simple enough: take your trains and connect them on routes across the board as you work towards fulfilling your own secret objectives. The game advances by collecting colored cards to use as resources for getting trains to place on your secret objective routes. You can use the color for the route shown on the board or swap out that color for a rainbow locomotive (or other rainbow-type transportation cards in other versions of the game) to help complete a route.</p><p>Each player has a set number of train tokens to pool from in hopes of placing on the game to complete their routes and score points. The game is over when someone runs out of placeable train tokens. Points are then tallied based on completed and incompleted routes and special goal objectives.</p><p>Now that you know the basics of the game, let’s examine what’s available and potentially worth buying.</p><h2>The Base Games</h2><p id="ticket-to-ride"><h3 data-toc-title="Ticket to Ride">Ticket to Ride</h3></p><div catalogid="3c7163bf-8754-4902-aeb4-e449d6a7b18d" id="161110"><div id="161110" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride</h3></p></div><p>Contents: destination tickets across the US, longest ride goal objective, train cars</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $54.99 USD</li><li>2-5 Players </li><li>30-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 8+</li></ul><p>Ticket to Ride (unofficially the USA version) brings train rides across the US. This game is the easiest of the standalone games to play. Other editions add other elements that make the game more challenging (even without expansions). If you’re going to learn the base game and want it to be the easiest, this is the way to go. </p><p>Of course, after you play and go back to reality you might be disappointed that train rides across America aren’t as abundant or as fast in reality. We can dream that as our American dream someday, though, right?</p></div><p id="ticket-to-ride-europe"><h3 data-toc-title="Ticket to Ride Europe">Ticket to Ride Europe</h3></p><div catalogid="3f7a93b3-10b9-4400-b3d5-521434c00d53" id="206335"><div id="206335" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride Europe</h3></p></div><p>Contents: new destinations across Europe, tunnels and ferries added to the game</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $59.99 USD</li><li>2-5 Players </li><li>30-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 8+</li></ul><p>Ticket to Ride Europe shows you the joy of traveling by train is far more abundant in other parts of the world.

One side allows players to travel across continents, and the other has players playing across lakes. Players who take specific routes to their destinations can receive a tourist bonus. Players can also create harbors to help them get across to their destinations. At the end of the game, these harbors add big points to the people who created them. </p><p>This version of the game is the longest to play in the Ticket to Ride series. It takes double the amount of time to play it than its counterparts. This one will take a patient group for all of the added mechanics and time it takes.</p></div><p id="ticket-to-ride-legacy-legends-of-th"><h3 data-toc-title="Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of Th">Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of The West</h3></p><div catalogid="9b9b5dc2-28dd-4b94-a918-97f797083cbc" id="189675"><div id="189675" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of The West</h3></p></div><p>Ticket to Ride Legends of the West is the legacy version of the game, and it's good enough to land on our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">best campaign board games</a>. It is a massive undertaking that will take groups on a journey of twelve games. It’s an incredible way to experience the magic of this franchise. If you have a dedicated group, it’s worth a playthrough. After you’ve played through it once it is still playable afterwards, but some of its allure and mystique will vanish as is the case of many legacy-type games. </p><h2>Kids Versions</h2><p>Even though I think the original versions and several iterations are already <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">kid-friendly board games</a>, three versions are specifically catered to kids and are available for folks to enjoy.

(Come on Days of Wonder, you can make adults a version like this for us, too.) This one offers a quirky spooky theme to the game changing not only the destinations and the board but the transport route too. Like the other two kids versions, this one goes by quicker too which is good for kids and adults alike who want a shorter gameplay experience of the franchise of games. I used this game to teach some beginner friends how to play other versions of the base game in my <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-paris-board-game-review">review of Ticket to Ride Paris</a>.</p><h2>Ticket to Ride Expansions</h2><p>A couple of different expansions can be added to some of the base games. They are about half the cost of the original game they go with, and they give you another fresh set of the original cards in addition to some new ones and variations on how to play the base games they are connected to. If you have played the base games multiple times already and are looking to spice things up, these two expansion add-ons are worth considering. </p></div><p id="ticket-to-ride-usa-1910-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Ticket to Ride: USA 1910 Expansion">Ticket to Ride: USA 1910 Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="d7612878-8dd1-48f0-8f07-c1378bcc0dd9" id="206342"><div id="206342" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride: USA 1910 Expansion</h3></p></div><p>Contents: 33 new destination tickets, a Globetrotter bonus card for finishing the most tickets, new rules variants </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $21.99 USD</li><li>2-5 Players </li><li>30-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 8+</li></ul><p>Note: This expansion is not a stand-alone game.

You’ll need a copy of Ticket to Ride Europe to play this.</p><p>If you already own the base game with the European destinations and want to change the game up a bit, this expansion can be a fun way to mix things up. The expansion adds ways to play what they call Big Cities Of Europe, Europe Expanded, and Mega Europe. Each of those will have different objectives and rules.</p><h2>Map Collections</h2><p>Map Collections are stand-alone maps which allow you to play around a city. Map games may use different types of transportation outside of trains, depending on their area's popular transit modes. There are a lot of them to choose from!</p><p>The map collections are fun, focusing on different, often more hyperlocal areas. However, their packaging can also be a bit confusing. </p><p>While you can buy some map destinations independently, some game versions have two area maps in the box. The pairing doesn’t always make sense. For example, the map of Japan also includes an Italian map. The United Kingdom also includes a Pennsylvania map. If it sounds confusing to you, you’re not alone. I am still scratching my head about it to an extent myself.</p><p><strong>Ticket to Ride cities</strong>:<a href="https://zdcs.link/rdk0m?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Paris</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRx4Y?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amsterdam</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/NMYyY?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">London</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/dMArK?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">New York</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/BdNYM?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">San Francisco</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/MVEq1?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Berlin</a></p><p><strong>Ticket to Ride maps</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/Jdvyp?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Asia</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/Y0j14?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Heart of Africa</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/PyJXy?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Poland</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/eB0lw?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Berlin</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/XD3oW?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nederland</a></p><p><strong>Games that have multiple versions in the same box</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/pgMrY?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Japan</a> (contains Japan and Italy) | <a href="https://zdcs.link/nodVD?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">United Kingdom</a> (contains the United Kingdom and Pennsylvania) | <a href="https://zdcs.link/KJVZB?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">France</a> (contains Ticket to Ride France and Old West) | Japan (contains Ticket to Ride Japan and Ticket to Ride Italy) | <a href="https://zdcs.link/3d7w2?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">India</a> (contains Ticket to Ride India and Switzerland), </p><h2>More Ways to Play</h2><p>There are several ways to play Ticket to Ride Digitally. Here are three different ones you can experience a few editions of the game you can currently play in digital form. </p><p>A note before going into these is that the current Steam version of the game is different from another that might be seen on Steam but is no longer available for download. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/108200/Ticket_to_Ride_Classic_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ticket to Ride: Classic Edition</a>, developed by Days of Wonder (the board game company that created the physical game) and Twin Sails Interactive, was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/108200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discontinued in September of 2023</a>. Players who bought it but hadn’t already downloaded it before October 2nd 2023, were also unable to download or install it even if they already owned it.</p><p>Ticket to Ride Classic Edition included several different expansions that are not currently available in the newest iteration. All online play of the game was removed. Folks who already own the game and its expansions can still play the game on their own accord on their computers with asynchronous play if they wish. The game being discontinued in this way <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3163124/appsteam-versions-being-discontinued" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caused an uproar of frustration from many players who had the Classic Edition of the game</a>. I personally am frustrated for not having gotten the previous edition of the game. My brother did and even had a copy he could have gifted me with the expansions (one of which was Japan which is a cool one, in my opinion), but we were unable to do so due to this change. </p><p>The below version is a newer and completely different version, which I can attest is quite enjoyable regardless of the Classic Edition not being an option for most folks anymore.</p></div><p id="ticket-to-ride-on-steam"><h3 data-toc-title="Ticket to Ride on Steam">Ticket to Ride on Steam</h3></p><div catalogid="d97c4134-f2c2-4338-ae5c-0beffdec23d7" id="206407"><div id="206407" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride (Steam)</h3></p></div><p>The newest version of the digital version is done by Marmalade Studios. A digital version of Ticket to Ride's base game on Steam costs <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477010/Ticket_to_Ride/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$14.99</a>, and an expansion called Ticket to Ride-Round the World Ticket is available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2608230/Ticket_to_Ride__Round_the_World_Ticket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$34.00</a>. There are also a few expansion packs that include individual expansion portions of the game if you are not interested in getting the Round the World Ticket pack. You can buy the Nordic Expansion for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2856300/Ticket_to_Ride__Nordic_Expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$7.99</a>. The Europe Expansion is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2608220/Ticket_to_Ride__Europe_Expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$9.99</a>. Ticket to Ride USA 1910 Ticket Pack expansion is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2938560/Ticket_to_Ride__USA_1910_Ticket_Pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$3.99</a>. Ticket to Ride- India Expansion is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2938570/Ticket_to_Ride__India_Expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$7.99</a>.</p><p>I have played the new Ticket to Ride and its World Ticket expansion and found them to be quite fun. As stated above, the Ride Around the World Ticket opens several different expansions to the mix, including the USA 1910 Ticket Pack, Europe Expansion, Nordic Countries, and their newest map: India. They released an India expansion in June. The system itself looks great even though some bugs are still in the game occasionally. I found placing trains to be a bit difficult to do at times on my computer. I also had an issue where when I was initially installing the game on my computer, it didn’t work until I had a physical mouse vs. just my laptop’s trackpad. Those issues were admittedly a bit frustrating and hopefully will be worked on more as time progresses because, as I mentioned, the game is otherwise done fairly well.</p><p>You can play the digital versions single-player versus AI, online against other players around the world, pass and play (trading off turns on a single device for folks playing games on a physical train or other form of transport, for example), and asynchronously. I’ve played a majority of my games vs AI on my phone and my computer. I have primarily enjoyed the experience, minus a few times when placing trains was a bit wonky with controls. In particular, I enjoyed the newer editions of maps they’ve added. I look forward to seeing more of the ones that aren’t there yet.</p><p>Playing the game will also provide progression on a leaderboard that ranks players for individual “seasons” about a month in length. This can add another layer for folks who want to be competitive with others, whether they are competing for single-player rankings or online rankings. The leaderboard will also show statistics and Hall of Fame results, which can give players a better idea of how they’ve done throughout a “season.”</p><p>The community around the game in this iteration is also very positive. They have an online community Discord server that encourages players to connect and share their positive experiences, report bugs, and collaborate with gaming events. I found that experience to be a really nice edition to this game personally. </p><h3>Board Game Arena</h3><p>My digital gaming group has played both the base game of <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=tickettoride" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ticket to Ride</a> and <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=tickettorideeurope" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ticket to Ride Europe</a> on Board Game Arena. The versions we’ve played over there have been very user-friendly in their interface. You can play both versions on Board Game Arena if one person in your board game group has a premium subscription to the site.  We are currently playing Ticket to Ride Europe, and if you’re in my board game group, I swear I will take my turn after I’m done writing this!</p><p>Board Game Arena premium costs $3 a month or $36 a year. You’re billed upfront for the year when you go premium, and you'll have access to both editions of Ticket to Ride.  </p><h3>Tabletop Simulator</h3></div><div catalogid="cc7d2ba4-bd21-4f58-a944-0ac252cb6d58" id="206408"><div id="206408" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tabletop Simulator</h3></p></div><p>Tabletop Simulator has three versions of Ticket to Ride available: the original, Ticket to Ride London, and Ticket to Ride Japan. These games do not have scripting, so they play differently to an extent. Tabletop Simulator is a physics-based virtual gaming simulator. Some games have scripting, which helps newer gamers with gameplay. Unfortunately, since the versions of Tabletop Simulator are not available to be played with scripting, it’s not recommended to play these versions unless you know someone familiar with the game already and familiar with physics-simulated style games.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>Ticket to Ride is a timeless, award-winning franchise of board games that players across generations can enjoy. The core two versions of USA and Europe are solid games to add to your collection. However, multiple other maps are also available in the collection, as several introduce new concepts and layers to enhance the experience. The Ghost Train variant, while a kid's version, also may appeal to fans of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">horror board games</a> regardless of age.</p><p>For the most part, outside of the kid's games, these games take a bit more time to complete, whether you are doing the games virtually or in person. Ticket to Ride’s USA digital version on BGA was the longest game for my personal digital board game group to complete last year. It’s become a bit of an ongoing joke, considering how long it took to complete. While I’m excited about Rails and Sails, I am admittedly a bit nervous about how much longer it would take to play if a digital version ever became available, let alone a sit-down game in real life. That version is also significantly more expensive than the other maps. I’d recommend several other available maps to explore if your group has limited time and wants to change up your experience.</p><p><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.

            <p>
Balatro, the acclaimed poker-themed rogue-like that continues to haunt my dreams, has just released a free update for PC and consoles introducing a bunch of cosmetic cameos from the likes of The Witcher, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a>.
</p>
<p>
Balatro's Friends of Jimbo update, as it's officially known, is available now and gives player the option to swap out the game's usual Kings, Queens, and Jacks with characters from the aforementioned series. So if you'd like to spice up a run with a beaming Jaskier or a vampire from the infamously vampire-free Vampire Survivors, today's your lucky day.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2379780/view/4275691671073449544?l=english">post shared on Steam</a>, developer LocalThunk explained Friends of Jimbo is the second of three big Balatro announcements due this summer, with the first being the recent news of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-passes-2m-sales-with-free-major-update-due-in-2025">free major gameplay update</a> - promising "new ideas and strategies" - that's currently due next year.

As to what the final reveal in LocalThunk's "Three-of-a-Kind of Surprises" campaign will be, that remains to be seen, but expect the announcement to happen before September concludes.
</p>
<p>
And if you've yet to play Balatro, Christian Donlan had good things to say about its rogue-like spin on poker in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-review">four star review</a> earlier this year, calling it, "So striking and so brilliantly constructed, and something that has given me such pleasure for the last week".

			<p>At Gamescom 2024, Blizzard showcased Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, the first of a series of expansions coming to the action RPG with a scheduled annual cadence.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-is-the-first-expansion-due-in-late-2024-will-add-brand-new-class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> during the BlizzCon 2023 Opening Ceremony, Vessel of Hatred is set to add the Spiritborn class, which is brand new to the Diablo franchise. You can check it out in action in our gameplay capture video available below.</p>
<p>During the German convention, I had the chance to interview Game Director Brent Gibson and Systems Designer Aislyn Hall to discuss not only Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred but also the future of the live service game at length. Here's the full transcript of our chat. As a reminder, the expansion is out on October 8 on all platforms.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred Gamescom 4K Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItkbOwx5XQE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>To start off, which feature from Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred do you think is most important for the future of the game since you plan to support it for years to come?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> The most important new feature, well, we're adding new ways to play, we're adding new forms of power. I think Mercenaries is going to have a really big impact on gameplay. Not only is it going to give players who like to play solo a small taste of playing in a party, where they can take the weaknesses of their class build and supplement it with a follower that comes along, but they can also use this whole new feature that we have called reinforcements.</p>
<p>With this one, you can take a mercenary and slot them into come into the fight for a moment, pull off the power of me. The cool thing about that is that you can actually define the condition, like, my health is getting low, come in and tank some of my damage, for example. It essentially starts to address the feedback that people want more skills and abilities on their bar. Now you can actually use reinforcement as kind of an additional ability that you normally wouldn't have.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall:</strong> Another feature in Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred that I think is really important and is going to have an impact further on is the Kurast Undercity. It's really important in a game like Diablo that there are a lot of different activities that you can participate in, a lot of different activities that are relevant to the endgame. The Kurast Undercity is going to be a time attack mode where you have to go quickly through a dungeon. It also has a tribute system that allows you to search for specific kinds of gear that your character specifically needs right now. So, with those two things combined, I think having just a different way to play, combined with the specific rewards that it gives you, is going to be a really, really important thing.</p>
<p><strong>With the addition of Mercenaries, did you have to balance the whole game a bit differently because people can now have these companions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> Yeah, every time we add a new source of power, we have to balance it against everything else. Not only are we adding a new class that has to be balanced against everything, but then we also have the Mercenaries system that has to be balanced in such as well. We're making a bunch of changes in the game from the progression system that allows us to have a more sustainable way of looking at the balance across the game, and the difficulty across the game, and being able to add new ways to earn new sources of power without breaking everything.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>Yeah, there are going to be some major progression updates similar in scope to Season 4 Loot Reborn with how itemization was fundamentally altered there. Russian season 640B is to be really improved upon as well, and so we're basically using that philosophically as an opportunity to lay the foundations of Diablo IV for years to come to ensure that when we're adding features like Mercenaries or other sources of power to the game, that the game is going to remain in a healthy state where players can always face a challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Do the Mercenaries only work in the open world?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> They work in dungeons as well. They're always with you in some form and you have a lot of control over how they come along with you.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, if you have a full party of players, you can't use them, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> That's where the Reinforcement system comes in. If you have a full party, you can still use your Reinforcement. I can set up Raheir, who gives me advantages to taking damage, and then I can also have Varyana, who gives me advantages to attack speed, and I can have that combination. You might be using a fire build, in which case you'll want to bring Aldkin around because he can do a lot of fire damage if you spec them that way, and so he can actually amplify your fire build. There's a lot of different ways to mix and match.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>The Reinforcements are like a separate concept from the Mercenaries themselves in the sense that you can have your Reinforcement regardless of how many people are in your party, like Brent said. Even if you're in a full party of players, you'll still have your reinforcement, and the reinforcement will use an ability based on what you decide when you want them to use it. There are a lot of different triggers that you can set, so it can be whenever you reach low health, then perhaps you can set them to use a defensive ability. Or you could set it so that when you use a big AoE attack, they can use an ability that might pull everyone in, so there are a lot of synergies.</p>

<p><strong>I know that Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred is also adding a multiplayer dungeon. Did that desire come internally, or was it more community feedback that you got?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> The excitement around doing more cooperative gameplay definitely came internally, but we also saw that our player base that likes to play socially has been growing, right? So we want to make sure that when we're adding new content to the game it is going to really reflect the type of people who are playing our game. We introduced a new cooperative PvE dungeon that has cooperative mechanics built into it, but the core gameplay is still that Diablo combat and it's just one way to challenge players who'd like to play together in the endgame. It was a little bit of both. We knew that we wanted to grow that player base, and it was actually happening, and so it was worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>A big part of the philosophy behind a lot of systems in Vessel of Hatred is that we want to ensure that what we're creating is really, really fun to do, either by yourself or in a group and doing it cooperatively. That ties into the progression changes that are coming, it ties into the Kurast Citadel, and it really is amplified across the entire game. We want to ensure that Vessel of Hatred is the best time to play Diablo IV.</p>
<p><strong>Personally, I'm a fan of MMOs. I've played World of Warcraft for a long time, so multiplayer dungeons are definitely something I'd like to see more. Actually, in a pre-release interview we did remotely, I asked if you would consider more defined player roles, like tank or support. Is that something you're talking about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>We definitely talk a lot about it. World of Warcraft has the Holy Trinity, you know, tank, DPS, and healer. Diablo IV is not quite that type of game. When we look at the when it comes to the rules and a cooperative thing. It's more about the activity, and so when we talk about cooperative mechanics, anybody can play any role, and the activity is just calling for a different type of interaction from those worlds. You've probably seen this in other games, but the focus is on the activity, not necessarily the class.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>It is something that I know the team is fully aware of in the sense that we know from previous Diablo had some builds for support focused characters, and more team oriented skills creating opportunities for that is definitely something the team is aware of.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, you're adding the Spiritborn class. Whenever you add a new class to a game, for example, going back to World of Warcraft, when the Death Knight landed, it was by far the most popular class, and the other players that stick with the old classes feel a bit diminished for a while. So, what are you doing to make the other players using existing classes feel as powerful and cool as the Spiritborn?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>There's a couple of things. First off, every single class is going to get some update. They're going to get new skills, they're going to get changes to the progression. We will be releasing new items for the classes, so there's a lot to go on for those players who main a Barbarian, for example. They'll have changes where they can really dig in and do some really cool stuff. There's some more conversations that we'll have in our live stream about some of the upcoming progression changes that will help with that, but it's such a fundamental change that I think every player is going to have more than enough content to deal with. As for the Spiritborn, it's brand new and there's nothing we can do about that.</p>
<p>Actually, we're very excited about that, but one of the things you're going to see with the Spiritborn itself is that there are a lot of elements. Each Spirit Guardian that you can spec into has a different fighting style built in. If you're a Barbarian main, the Jaguar has some things that help you lean in that direction and customize it even beyond that. The hybridization is the thing that I think is really exciting. I think everybody who has a favorite class today will have something to experiment with in that regard, so I'd highly recommend giving it a try.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of the story content included with Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, can you share how many hours of new gameplay players can expect on average?</strong></p>
<p>That is tough because it depends on the type of player. Some people skip all the cutscenes. There's the player who likes to kill every monster. There's the player who skips all the encounters to go straight to the bosses. There's so many different play styles. But this is a rich story, and if you sit down and you really enjoy it... It is a healthy next chapter to the game. Unfortunately, I can't put a number on it because I don't know what type of player will be reading in this article.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>The story of Vessel of Hatred is a direct continuation of the story from the original game, and I think you can expect the same degree of care and detail that went into the original campaign story.</p>
<p><strong>So, it's a bit like a new Act.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>Yeah. It shares a lot of the same philosophies as what you saw in the base game. There's a certain amount of story that we want to be able to tell because we're learning about what the fate of the Soulstone is, so there's a lot of work that has to go into that. We're super proud of the story.</p>
<p><strong>Are there more itemization layers coming with the expansion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>Nothing to announce today, but you're definitely going to want to stay tuned to our next couple of live streams.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>Yeah, we're going to have a campfire chat on August 29th, and we'll go over many details about the systemic changes coming.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The Armory isn't available at launch, but it's top of the list. However, there are no plans for an Auction House.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Okay. Is there any news on Armory or Loadouts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>The Armory is at the top of the list of things we're considering, and we are trying to figure out the best way to bring a feature like that to the table. It's not at the launch of Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, but it is at the top of the list.</p>
<p><strong>Bigger stash?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>Everybody loves to talk about the stash! Actually, I don't believe we have anything to announce today on the stash. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>You're adding a Party Finder with the update, correct?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>Yes. Party Finder is a huge addition that we really feel is important to have for something like the Dark Citadel, because it's cooperative. I play with my friends, but sometimes they can't be online, so we need to have that. But it is something that applies to all activities in the game, and it is going to be available to everybody, regardless of Vessel of Hatred.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any other social features coming with the expansion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>I think the biggest new social feature is our Party Finder.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Party Finder is a huge addition that we really feel is important to have for something like the Dark Citadel, because it's cooperative. But it is something that applies to all activities in the game, and it is going to be available to everybody, regardless of Vessel of Hatred.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>A lot of players ask about adding an Auction House.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>The great debate. There's no plan for an Auction House at this time.</p>
<p><strong>What will happen to our level 100 characters in the Eternal Realm, in case the cap is 60?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>I would stay tuned for the progression discussion on August 29, but we're taking into account everybody coming in at every single level coming into Vessel of Hatred. The user experience is definitely going to be custom-tailored to make sure that everybody feels great.</p>
<p><strong>On a personal note, I wanted to add that I'm not a big fan of creating new characters every season. Especially early on, right after the game was released, it kind of felt like the Eternal Realm was a bit left behind.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>I've heard that feedback a lot. One of the things that you notice more often is our seasonal content is going to Eternal. We want to make sure that the Eternal players and the seasonal players are getting the same amount of fun. Now, we have a huge seasonal community that absolutely loves renewing, and we have a huge Eternal community, so we're going to continue to look at how we bring those two communities together.</p>
<p>You'll see that in seasons, obviously, and then there's other things like the progression changes that we're talking about. Everybody's going to get that. So if you are an Eternal player, you're going to get an extension of the campaign, you're going to get a new area to explore and unlock content, there's new dungeons, there's new gameplay modes, all that stuff is coming for the Eternal characters.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>Out of all the updates that have come to Diablo IV so far, Vessel of Hatred is going to be the one with the most amount of new things that are coming to the Eternal Realm. As Brent said, we're going to continue to do our best to include as much as possible in seasons to the Eternal Realm.</p>
<p><strong>Are you looking into tweaking the difficulty curve early on? Some players say it's a bit too easy while you're leveling up until endgame.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>When we talk about fundamental changes to the progression system, we want the difficulty to feel smoother, and we'll want more player agency there, so it's definitely something we've been investing into.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>Yeah, we have a philosophy that we have been utilizing with these major progression things that are coming, where we want to ensure that it's in the player's hands what kind of challenge they want to face and ensuring that you could tune the game's experience in any content, from the early game all the way to the very late game. That's a big guiding North Star for us with these changes coming in season 6.</p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>And a good example, you've talked about this in the past, is all the feedback we've been getting from the Profane Mindcage. We know that players are trying to use something like the Profane Mindcage to influence the difficulty, and we don't want a consumable to play that role, so we are looking to make some changes.</p>
<p><strong>What's your number one favorite feature in Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall:</strong> I really like the Dark Citadel. I ran through it a few weeks ago and it was just so exciting to go through and basically figure out the mechanics and have that feeling of overcoming a significant challenge with my friends. I really love that and we also get some pretty juicy rewards from it that we can cash every week. So, doing it every week once Vessel of Hatred launches is definitely going to be something fun.</p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> I'm gonna talk about the Spiritborn class. The playstyle, the rhythm, and the flow of this class really speak to my playstyle, so I'd have to say I'm really excited about the class.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'It is extremely healthy right now. I actually think our interaction with the media, the content creators, with our fans, we've been pouring a ton of energy into reaching out and getting the feedback and listening. The state of Diablo is the healthiest I think it's been since launch.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Earlier, you said there is a big Eternal community and a big seasonal community. Talking about the size of the Diablo IV community, is it healthy, especially after the Game Pass <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lands-on-game-pass-on-march-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent Gibson:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, you know. Being on Game Pass is one of those things that we looked forward to the most, with the idea that we get out to as many players as possible. Diablo is a community that has a lot of folks that have been around since the first one, but something like Game Pass is also introducing the franchise to a bunch of newcomers. So, it is extremely healthy right now. I actually think our interaction with the media, the content creators, with our fans, we've been pouring a ton of energy into reaching out and getting the feedback and listening. The state of Diablo is the healthiest I think it's been since launch, and I'm super proud of it.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
