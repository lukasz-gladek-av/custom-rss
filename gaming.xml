		<p>BioWare and EA have debuted a solid 15 minutes of edited gameplay for Dragon Age: The Veilguard – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/06/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dreadwolf-single-player/">the new name for Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a> – taking us into the city on Minrathous and exploring what will make up this long-awaited RPG sequel. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is set to release later this year across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The gameplay reveal features our player character Rook and Varric as they delve into the very pretty, but seedy city of Minrathous on the hunt for Solas. Specifically they head down to Docktown to try and meet up with the renowned detective Neve Gallus, who apparently has a lead that they might be able to follow – especially as they’re one of the companions who will join you on your journey.</p>
<p>You’re in a race against time to stop Solas from conducting a ritual that’s breaking the barrier between world, the Veil, which is allowing demons to enter this world. Meeting up with Harding, you get to see the typical multi-choice BioWare dialogue system, with the script bending to accommodate Rook’s chosen origin story – being one of the Shadow Dragons in this demo.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of scripted moments on the path through the city, as well as battles with demons and cultists. Combat for the Rogue character class looks nice and fluid with a flippy attack style with two swords that’s fairly reminiscent of modern superhero games, and the ability to quickly whip out a bow and arrow for a little bit of range. However, there’s also the Ability Wheel, which freezes the game to let you select the next special ability you want to whip out and target it.</p>

<p>There will be seven companions, which BioWare promise will all be unique and unforgettable heroes. There’s an assassin, a necromancer, a detective and more, and yes, you’ll be able to romance them. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bellara</b>, a creative and romantic Veil Jumper obsessed with uncovering ancient secrets.</li>
<li><b>Davrin</b>,<b> </b>a bold and charming Grey Warden who has made a name for himself as a monster hunter.</li>
<li><b>Emmrich</b>, a necromancer of Nevarra’s Mourn Watch who comes complete with a skeletal assistant, Manfred.</li>
<li><b>Harding</b>, the dwarven scout, returns to the fray as a companion with her big heart, a positive outlook, and a ready bow – as well as unexpected magical powers.</li>
<li><b>Lucanis</b>, a poised &amp; pragmatic assassin who descends from the bloodline of the House of Crows, a criminal organization renowned throughout Thedas.</li>
<li><b>Neve</b>, a cynic fighting for a better future, both as a private detective and a member of Tevinter’s rebellious Shadow Dragons.</li>
<li><b>Taash</b>, a dragon hunter allied with the Lords of Fortune who lives for adventure and doesn’t mind taking risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s your combined journey that will be put to the forefront of this new game, so while the Dread Wolf is still a significant part of the game’s story, BioWare felt it important to rebrand to The Veilguard to make that distinction.</p>

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-everything-we-know-9415">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree releases on 21st June - that's just 10 days away.
</p>
<p>
Now is not the time to procrastinate, Tarnished! The Land of Shadow awaits, but it seems some players still haven't completed the necessary requirements.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, a social post on X has gone viral for noting only 37.8 percent of Steam players have the achievement for defeating Mohg, a boss that must be beaten to access Shadow of the Erdtree.

<p>

Are you one of these people? Then don't delay!
</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>There is an achievement on Steam for beating Mogh. Which the <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ELDENRING</a> devs have said you have to beat  for the DLC. 37.8% of Steam players have this achievement. </p><p>This means that 62.2% of Steam players that have Elden Ring...</p><p>Will not be able to play the DLC! 🤣</p></div>— Cohh Carnage (@CohhCarnage) <a href="https://twitter.com/CohhCarnage/status/1800313422535364790?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
As FromSoftware has previously stated, in order to access Shadow of the Erdtree players will need to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Defeat <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-starscourge-radahn-tips-strategy-8042">Starscourge Radahn</a></li>
<li>Defeat <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-beat-mohg-lord-of-blood-elden-ring-8042">Mohg Lord of Blood</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
From there, players will access the expansion by interacting with the ominous withered hand of Miquella protruding from the egg in the Mohg battle arena.
</p>
<p>
But is there anything else you should do to prepare?
</p>
<p>
Firstly, we've got the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-date-preload-file-size-9415">Shadow of the Erdtree preload times and file sizes</a>, so make sure you've got enough space on your hard drive. You can also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-system-requirements-9415">check the system requirements if you're on PC</a> to make sure your rig meets the minimum.
</p>
<p>
Now is also a good time to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-classes-best-class-starting-choice-8042">optimise your build</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-best-weapons-twinblade-8042">choose the best weapons</a>. Shadow of the Erdtree is set to offer a high level of challenge, so get practising and level up your character and favourite weapons. You should also spend some time deciding what to wear, because you'll want to look your best for Messmer.
</p>
<p>
You'll want <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-best-talismans-more-slots-8042">the best talismans</a> too to get the most out of your build, plus there's an achievement attached to the legendary talismans.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, items like your flasks will carry over, so make sure you've collected enough <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-golden-seeds-locations-8042">Golden Seeds</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-sacred-tear-locations-8042">Sacred Tears</a> to level up your flasks to maximum potency.
</p>
<p>
With that you'll be all set to explore the Land of Shadow on 21st June!

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> features a far more fleshed out romance and relationship system than in previous BioWare games, the developer has told Eurogamer - including the ability for party members to go off and find their own love interests, should you not be interested yourself. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer's deputy editor Chris Tapsell at an event in LA this week, The Veilguard's creative director John Epler revealed more of the game's relationship system.
</p>
<p>
"In Dragon Age games, BioWare games, romance is a core part," Epler said. "We wanted to give each character their own flavour, or their own style, of romance. So some characters may be a little more steamy while some characters maybe a little bit more innocent. But for each one, you can build these relationships.

<p>
"And what's interesting in this game is, if you don't romance characters, they may decide to find their own romances for themselves, whether within the team or within the world itself."
</p>
<p>It's reminiscent somewhat of how Shepard could walk in on Garrus and Tali locked in a kiss towards the end of Mass Effect 3 - but only if you had chosen not to show romantic interest in either one beforehand.</p>
<p>
What sounds like another improvement from previous BioWare games is how a character's romance arc will be better woven into their own personal story arc, and their involvement with The Veilguard's core questline. BioWare has also worked to ensure that getting to know your characters as friends feels just as satisfying - and that just because you're not banging your buddy, their (platonic) relationship with you will still continue.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
"One of the things we tried to do with The Veilguard is it's not just romantic relationship building," Epler continued. "You need to get to know a person before you can really build that kind of relationship with them, and if you choose not to build a [romantic] relationship, we never want to feel like you're being cut off. There's no 'okay, well, their arc isn't progressing, I'm done'. 
</p>
<p>
"We want to make sure the non-romantic relationships are deep as well, with friendships not just for companions and yourself, but also between companions across the party."

            <p>Nintendo has released an update for its Switch consoles, removing support for social media platform X in the process.</p>
<p>We knew this day was coming, with the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-removing-x-support-from-switch">previously announcing its plans to pull support for X</a> last month.</p>
<p>While the company has not provided a reason for this change, Nintendo follows both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-dropping-playstation-5-and-ps4-twitter-integration-next-week">PlayStation and Xbox in removing integration with the social media network</a> since X changed its API pricing in March last year.</p>

<p>When Nintendo first announced its plans to pull support for X on Switch consoles, the social media platform said it was "dedicated to enhancing and supporting gaming-related features", maintaining it had a good relationship with Nintendo. This post has since been removed. 
</p>
<p>You can read the full notes from Nintendo's most recent Switch <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information#current">update</a> below:</p>

<li>The ability to post Super Smash Bros. Ultimate screenshots from the <strong>Album</strong> in the Nintendo Switch <strong>HOME Menu</strong> to Smash World in the Nintendo Switch Online smart device app was removed.</li>
<li>The option to link X (formerly Twitter) from "Settings" &gt; "User Settings" &gt; "Posting to Social Media" was removed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The option to link social media accounts from "My Page" &gt; "Friend Suggestions" was removed.</li>

But after three games spanning almost two decades, all I really wanted out of the next <em>Dragon Age</em> was a skin tone that matched mine <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-returning-to-dragon-1844909473">and didn’t look like I’d never seen a bottle of moisturizer</a>.</p><p>So I know there is a <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Maker">Maker</a> who loves me when one of the very first features that game director Corinne Busche showed me was all the different skin tones in <em>Veilguard</em>’s character creator.</p><p>“We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about skin tone,” she said. In the character creator, once you choose a race and customize your features — including the series-first ability to change your body size — you can check your work under different kinds of lighting. The character we made, a Black elf, seemed to glow in the bluish light of a nighttime scene, and under bright sunlight, I could see the richness of his color.&nbsp;</p><div><p>“We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about skin tone.”</p></div><p>“We want to make sure that skin tone is reflected authentically,” Busche said.</p><p>The second feature I saw — one that I insisted Busche show me, risking the precious little time I had with this hands-off demo at Summer Game Fest — was the hair options.</p><p>“We have dozens and dozens of hair types,” she said. “And they’re fully affected by physics.” The quality and variety of choices I saw delighted me. The rows of bouncy, luxurious-looking hair of all curl types and textures (and yes, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/killmonger-cut-everywhere-games-spider-man-tekken-8">the annoyingly ubiquitous “Killmonger cut”</a> was among the options, what can you do?) brought the biggest smile to my face in the hour I spent with Busche and <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>“A very important part of our philosophy is that no matter who you are, you’re able to realize yourself inside of this game,” Busche said, and I think they nailed it.</p><p>There was only so much I could see in the hour I had with the hands-off demo, but all of it was really heartening as a longtime <em>Dragon Age</em> fan. <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Minrathous?so=search">Minrathous</a>, the city we explored in the demo, was dark and moody, with its blood mage cultists, yet awash with the color of magical signs like the neon lights of a major city.</p><p>To some, that colorfulness, combined with <a href="https://youtu.be/drVOCrvXHhE?si=N7fny-Lwo3r8hR2t">a reveal trailer</a> that had a more stylized art direction, led to grumblings on social media that <em>The Veilguard</em> didn’t feel like a “real” <em>Dragon Age</em> game. Detractors complain that the new stylization looks too cartoonish and is too much a departure from the series that once featured Marilyn Manson’s “This Is the New Shit” <a href="https://youtu.be/6SuJ5T9sfAA?si=u66B6ZL1zfpqg_ek">in one of its blood-splattered trailers</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Busche understood the criticisms and offered a two-pronged explanation. The first part was simply that <em>Dragon Age,</em> as a series, has always changed. “What we’ve seen over the years is an evolution of the visuals in the franchise,” Busche said. “<em>Dragon Age</em> has never really had an ownable visual identity.”</p><p>Busche explained that the team wanted to give players a game where locations were imbued with just as much personality as the characters. “That meant making contrast from the areas that are dark and decaying to the areas that are illuminated with magic,” Busche said.&nbsp;</p><p>Another reason <em>The Veilguard</em> looks so different from other <em>Dragon Age</em> games is because the locations themselves are unlike anything the franchise has seen before. The first three <em>Dragon Age</em> games took place in the southern parts of the world, where magic and its users were brutally repressed.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, for the locations in <em>Veilguard</em>, “This is a part of the world where magic has been embraced,” Busche said. “It is a society of mages and magic in this world is inherently colorful. So whether we’re seeing them use magic for everyday purposes like signage or using them as spells, that color really comes through.”</p><div><p>It’s been a long and possibly agonizing time coming for fans of the series who first got a glimpse of the new game back when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18126070/dragon-age-4-trailer-teaser-ea-announcement-release-date-game-awards-2018">it was announced at the 2018 Game Awards</a>. In the intervening years, there were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22947737/bioware-dragon-age-4-production-update">a few “proof of life” updates</a>, including the news that the game had undergone a massive change of scope with BioWare <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301634/dragon-age-single-player-only-ea-bioware-shifts">scrapping plans to add live-service multiplayer elements</a> to instead focus on a single-player-only experience.</p></div><p>But while that information was generally met with enthusiasm, optimism concerning the game’s future was imperiled by constant news of layoffs and high-profile departures. After decades with the studio, BioWare general manager Casey Hudson and <em>Dragon Age </em>executive producer Mark Darrah <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/3/22151192/bioware-casey-hudson-mark-darrah-leaving-dragon-age-mass-effect">left the company in 2020</a>. Creative director Matt Goldman <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22801037/dragon-age-4-matt-goldman-bioware-ea">left in 2021</a>, 19-year BioWare veteran <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567676/bioware-mass-effect-mac-walters-dragon-age-dreadwolf">Mac Walters left in 2023</a>, and in that same year, the studio announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23843096/bioware-layoffs-dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect">the layoffs of over 50 people</a>, including several long-serving BioWare employees.</p><p>Needless to say, <em>Veilguard</em>’s development has been beset by issues. And an hour of hands-off gameplay isn’t enough to completely dispel the lingering concerns that the game’s tortured development cycle has affected its quality. But I know the <em>Dragon Age</em> series, and based on the conversations I’ve had and the&nbsp;little I’ve seen, it feels like despite the turmoil, BioWare still got it right.</p><p>Final judgment will have to be reserved for when I can finally play the finished product when <em>Veilguard</em> launches in the fall of this year. But seeing all the character creator options, knowing that we’ll finally get a romanceable dwarf companion, and knowing that we’ll finally visit places like Weisshaupt and the necropolis of Nevarra — requests and locations that have dominated <em>Dragon Age</em> fandom discussions for decades — <em>Veilguard </em>feels like it’s on the right track.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Yesterday, Kai checked out a behind-closed-doors media presentation of Dragon Age: The Veilguard; you can read his report <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-summer-game-fest-presentation-impressions-back-in-thedas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Today, BioWare is sharing the first 15-minute gameplay video with everyone, and they've also sent a fact sheet that clarifies several details and features of the upcoming action RPG.</p>
<p>Let's start with the first juicy details on the storyline of the fourth mainline installment in the franchise. As everyone who played Dragon Age: Inquisition and its DLCs already knows, Solas, companion to the Inquisitor player character during the previous game, is none other than the Elven trickster god of legend, also known more ominously as the Dread Wolf (the game's previous title). All along, his goal has been to tear down the Veil between the world of Thedas and the demon world to restore the ancient elven glory and immortality, and he doesn't care in the slightest if that means everyone else's doom.</p>
<p>According to BioWare, Solas does manage to go through with his tearing ritual only to see it backfire, freeing two of his most powerful and relentless adversaries among the elven gods. It will be up to the player character (named Rook) and his party to clean up Solas's mess and stop these god-like beings from ravaging Thedas, all the while fighting other menacing foes like Venatori Cultists, Demons of the Fade, Dark Spawn, and more.</p>

<p>As teased by BioWare a while ago, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will portray more of Thedas than ever before in the RPG series. Lore fans will be happy to know they'll visit the Rivain peninsula, the fortress of the Grey Wardens at Weisshaupt, the elven city of Arlathan, the Tevinter capital of Minrathous, the Deep Roads, and more. Biomes will be as diverse as bustling cities, lush tropics, boreal forests, forbidding swamps, and the deepest dungeons. The titular Veilguard will assemble at the Lighthouse, the classic RPG-style place where you can rest and chat with companions at your leisure.</p>
<p>The developers also promised 'some of the most compelling individual storylines' in the franchise history, which is an ambitious target given that this was always one of the strengths of Dragon Age and BioWare games as a whole. The seven companions (Veil Jumper Bellara, Grey Warden Davrin, Necromancer Emmrich, returning Scout Harding, Mage Killer Lucanis, Detective Neve, and Dragon Hunter Taash) will provide expansive and dynamic stories exploring love and loss, and player choices will affect both your relationship with the individual companions and with the whole group. Each companion comes with their own individual skill tree and specialized gear.</p>
<p>Finally, going back to the player character Rook, players will get the most powerful character creator in the franchise yet with a vast range of customization options. As you can see from the gallery above, you can select other races as well, such as elf or Qunari. You'll also be able to <a href="https://x.com/JackdawYT/status/1800249581361406392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choose a starting faction</a> as part of the character's background. There will be six choices in this area, including Grey Wardens, Shadow Dragons, and Antivan Crows. In terms of character progression, players will be able to customize their playstyle through skill trees for three different classes: Warrior, Mage, and Rogue. As previously rumored, there won't be any direct control of the other two members of the party, but the ability wheel allows players to perform specific skills against any given target.</p>

<p>In a very brief post-presentation roundtable Q&amp;A at Summer Game Fest 2024, BioWare confirmed Dragon Age: The Veilguard would feature a 'tremendous amount of side content' that is entirely handcrafted rather than randomly generated in any way.</p>
<p>The game doesn't have a concrete release date yet other than a generic Fall 2024 window. It will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-veilguard-is-the-new-name-of-dreadwolf-reveal-scheduled-for-june-11-with-15-minutes-of-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No longer focused on Dread Wolf</a> (Solas’ pet name, as players learn early on in this upcoming story), Bioware has returned to their storied RPG franchise with Dragon Age: The Veilguard. In one of the first semi-public demonstrations, Wccftech recently sat in on a behind-closed-door experience to take a peek at the character creation and initial story beats to the Veilguard.</span></p>
<p><span>As is typical for Dragon Age heroes, players first begin by picking their primary class between the assortment of Rogue, Warrior and Mage. From there, players dig into specializations that make each class feel specialized. For the Rogue that was shown off during our presentation for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, there were choices between a Duelist (parries and flourishes), Saboteur (explosives and turrets), and Veil Ranger (archery and magic). As the demo MC discussed at length, each specialization offers extensive skill trees to fit a player’s individual playstyle while also building towards unique synergies between both Rook and companions. After deciding on a lot in life, players then pick one of six factions to build out the backstory from before The Veilguard’s opening acts. Of the six factions, only five were discussed during our session: Grey Wardens, Veil Jumpers, Lords of Fortune, Mourn Watch, and the Shadow Dragons, the last of which was the faction of choice and lent to the main character’s last name. Two perks from opting to ally with the Shadow Dragons increase damages inflicted against the Venatori while also increasing the rate at which the Rogue’s class resource fills up.</span></p>
<p><span>The crux of the opening act to Dragon Age: The Veilguard is to stop Dreadwolf (again, Solas) from completing a ritual that would tear open the Veil and unleash daemonic foes upon the world. Minrathous, the capital city of the Tevinter Imperium, sets the stage for the prologue and the introduction to a world still populated by the likes of Varric (albeit a bit more grizzled and worn out). It’s a city that’s shown to be bustling “in a way never seen before” in a Dragon Age title, while the destruction wrought by demons introduces dynamic city destruction and set pieces.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DA_EA_Exploration_07_3840x2160_RGB_WM-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard opens with the lead character of Rook heading into the seediest bar in Minrathous to seek out a missing contact, Neve Gallus. It’s here that players are introduced to the dialogue systems at play in Dragon Age and only a couple of dialogue options. Rather than presenting the outcome and consequence of one’s words, the dialogue wheel instead simply states what the main character will do, putting players into the seat of more immersive role-playing. Returning to the conversation are a multitude of dialogue options, from the affable and tough to the irreverent and snarky.</span></p>
<p><span>For the main focus of the showcase, BioWare wanted to show off the combat in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Billed as a fusion between moment-to-moment action and strategy, players will get to experience some of the fastest action combat that’s been seen in a Dragon Age title. Fighting takes a few notes from popular open-world action game with parry indications and a form of Spidey Sense that highlights when enemies are about to hit Rook and also indications for ranged attacks from afar. For players who are less comfortable engaging with the action combat, there are a number of modifiers that can be tweaked including increasing the parry indicators, or simply removing them entirely for increased difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span>While there is a focus on the action in The Veilguard, it wouldn’t be a Dragon Age title without implementing a form of Real Time with Pause to the strategy. Players will have access to 9 slots for abilities that can be toggled during these pause segments and ally abilities can be slotted in as well as player abilities to create synergies between followers. One such combo that was recommended was to cast a spell that would slow down time to synergize with another mage that could cast a damage-over-time spell.</span></p>
<p><span>BioWare touched just briefly on the companion stories but wanted to emphasize that one of the core pillars of Dragon Age was to inspire a team of unforgettable companions. Each of the seven companions (Harding, Neve, Taash, Emmrich, Davrin, Lucanis, and Bellara) has a story arc that runs parallel to the main campaign but can be skipped by players who don’t wish to get too emotionally invested in that character’s plight. The Veilguard also continues the trend of integrating side characters from the previous game as a full companion. In this instance, Scout Harding is now a proper member of The Veilguard and it’s been a full ten years since the events of Dragon Age: Inquisition.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dragon-Age-The-Veilguard_Screenshot_03_GroupB_3840x2160-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>For the most part, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is feature complete and the development team is currently in the midst of bug fixing when we spoke with them during Summer Game Fest 2024. This introductory mission brought technologies and ancient enemies from the Dragon Age mythos to the forefront, and our mission director talked about wanting to make the prologue feel like the final mission of another game so that players could get stakes in the action as quickly as possible. In just a matter of thirty minutes, players progressed from a bare-knuckle brawl in a local tavern to a near-apocalyptic event with Solas trying to tear the literal fabric of space and time before disappearing into a portal wrought open with two yet-unnamed folks. </span></p>
<p><span>Are they on par with an Elven god like Solas? Only time will tell! Meanwhile, check out the first 15-minute gameplay video and some extra details from BioWare in this article.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preview-epic-fantasy-action-at-its-peak.898125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-epic-fantasy-action<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After a decade, <em>Dragon Age </em>is finally back. With a name change to <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, I had the chance to see the first hour of gameplay in a hands-off presentation at Summer Game Fest Play Days.</p>
<p><em>Check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/star-wars-outlaws-preview-finally-lets-us-see-galaxy-of-scum-and-villainy">hands-on preview of Star Wars Outlaws</a> and our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/assassins-creed-shadows-dual-protagonists-open-up-world-of-possibilities">hands-off preview for Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> from <a href="https://techraptor.net/topic/summer-game-fest">Summer Game Fest</a>.</em></p>
<h2>Veilguard's Character Creation is Robust</h2>
<p>As with all <em>Dragon Age</em> games, we began with the character creator. We all know some people could spend hours and hours fine-tuning a character as they see fit, but we didn't quite have the time to get into the weeds.</p>
<p>I can say that the <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> character creator is incredibly robust with all of the deep character customization you could hope for, with some added things on top like changing your body type and proportions. You can even check out how your character will look in different lighting situations.</p>
<p>Character creation goes beyond just looks, of course. You will get to choose a backstory from your character from several factions. They could have been a Grey Warden, an Antivan Crow, a member of the Mourn Watch, a Shadow Dragon, or a Veil Jumper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of those we've spent a lot of time with, but some of those are new. All of them will regularly affect your interactions with characters in the world.</p>
<p>Often this sort of feature only gets mentioned every so often once you make the choice in a game, but our playthrough used the Shadow Dragon background and that came up a few times in the short hour of gameplay. Of course, who knows the rate that continues after what is essentially the prologue.</p>
<p><em>Veilguard </em>has a substantial difficulty customization as well. There's your standard ramp up in difficulty, but you can also choose to tweak your own difficulty to fit your preferred playstyles. You can affect things like parry timing, damage, and more.</p>
<p>As with all <em>Dragon Age</em> games, you will have three classes to choose from: rogue, warrior, and mage. They will all have their own specializations to modify the way they play further, with deep progression trees as well.</p>
<h2>Veilguard Says Goodbye Tactics, Hello Action RPG</h2>
<p>Our playthrough showcased the rogue, with the Duelist specialization. This one emphasized parries and dodging.</p>
<p>Parrying and dodging isn't a usable ability, it is just something you have access to. Yes, <em>Dragon Age</em> has made the leap away from the more tactical gameplay to be more action-oriented.</p>
<p>To be clear quickly though, this is not a soulslike, nor is it quite a <em>Devil May Cry</em>. It lives somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>Most of the combat we saw was fairly simple, and I couldn't tell you if there's a light and heavy attack, nor just how complicated the combos can get. But it's not some auto attack -- you're directly involved.</p>
<p>Skills are of course still incredibly important, and do bring with them some of <em>Dragon Age</em>'s tactical lineage. You can use skills on the fly, but you also can pause the battle and queue up abilities, making sure to target the right person. Plus, it's time to stop and think if you need.</p>
<p>Using abilities is tied to resource generation, which is different for each class. Mages charge up their resource to use abilities, leaving them open to attack, and Warriors generate rage to use their abilities.</p>
<p>The rogue in our demo used momentum, which built up the more they attacked. However, the meter can get knocked down if they start taking damage.</p>
<h2>Companions Are Still a Backbone of the Series</h2>
<p>Just as in <em>Dragon Age</em> of the past, you'll have a cast of companions with you. They confirmed you'll still be giving them commands and telling them to use abilities or what have you. Or you could set up their AI to do things as well.</p>
<p>One big change worth mentioning is that this time around you can only have two companions in your party, not the standard three in the rest of the series.</p>
<p>That action wheel that pops up when you stop the battle has slots for the companions abilities as well, though I didn't get to see use of it in the demo.</p>

<p>When it comes to companions, it will be no surprise to learn that their stories play a big part in <em>Veilguard</em>. Each of them has their own deep arc that will have profound affects on the overall story if you choose to complete their stories or not. Abilities and combat effectiveness are tied to these arcs as well.</p>
<p>In some ways, it feels like <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is taking a <em>Mass Effect 2</em> approach to its companions.</p>
<p>There will also be the classic Bioware companion banter, and you'll have them approve and disapprove to certain choices you make over the course of the game, too.</p>
<h2>Where the Dragon Age Veilguard Story Starts</h2>
<p>If you don't want any of the story or state of the world spoiled for you, read no further. I want to set the stage for the demo I saw.</p>
<p>Creative Director John Epler was narrating the gameplay, and he said that they wanted the prologue, this opening to the game I saw, to feel like it was the final moments of a previously told story.</p>
<p>That scale was epic, the scenes were flashy, and it definitely felt like one of those awesome crescendo moments so many great games end with.</p>
<p>The prologue took place in Minrathous, the biggest and most impressive city in Thedas. It is full of tall spires and has floating buildings. As Epler put it, Minrathous uses magic like we use electricity to power the cities we live in, so it is full of wondrous things.</p>

<p>Taking place some nine years after <em>Inquisition</em>, it is that backdrop that Solas is attempting to take down the Veil with an enormous ritual. Once that tearing begins, the Veil is weakened and demons start pouring out.</p>
<p>Running through the streets of Minrathous looking for Solas, demons were constantly chasing down citizenry and causing all kinds of havoc. Of course, there's plenty to fight as well.</p>
<p>The city of Minrathous is a powerful weapon in its own right, firing magic at demons all around as you're just trying to survive -- hoping its weapons don't turn their sites on you.</p>
<p>Led by Varric, you eventually find where Solas was hiding and Varric confronts him in an attempt to stop him.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Dragon Age: The Veilguard Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I won't say more than that for the sake of spoilers, but suffice to say that it was an absolutely wild ride and a perfect hook to get people back into the world of <em>Dragon Age</em>.</p>
<p>There's no way that level of adrenaline-inducing action, cool cutscenes, and just absolute mania has enough fuel to last the whole game, but everything that's in the prologue is a good sign for what we can hope to see further along in the game.</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is poised to remind people that <em>Dragon Age </em>is one of the finest fantasy franchises out there.</p>

		<p>Apologies for the delayed post here. Our schedule took a minute to bring together as Patrick was traveling back from Game Fest and we weren't quite sure what his availability looked like once he got back.</p><p>On top of that, we're busy planning our studio stream next weekend (22nd and 23rd). I can't make up my mind whether I expect a delightful, surprisingly frictionless success or a classic <em>Waypoint / Remap </em>Stream Alpha version that should have a NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION watermark all over the stream. I had a nightmare last night where we were about to go live and we realized we didn't have microphones. We had microphone backs and wires coming out of them, just... attached to nothing.</p><p>This is also the first stream where my travel logistics are complicated by the fact that I hopefully will need to bring multiple typewriters into the studio. There's a reason for that, but also, who doesn't agree with me that there should be a Remap Radio Typewriter Collection that we can showcase? I mean besides Patrick. Fun fact: did you know the "portable" part of the phrase portable typewriter is pretty nominal and they're really not very portable at all?</p><figure></figure><ul>
<li><strong>MONDAY:</strong> But it's Tuesday now, innit?</li>
<li><strong>TUESDAY:</strong> Cado and I are Motorsportsing some more this afternoon, starting around 2:30 Eastern.</li>
<li><strong>WEDNESDAY:</strong> Are you a bad enough Remap Radio supporter to Fest what's Next with Patrick and Cado at 2:30 Eastern?</li>
<li><strong>THURSDAY:</strong> We're recording Remap Radio, then it's GeForce Now Thursday in the afternoon starting around 2:30. We <em>probably</em> won't stream more <em>Gollum</em>... But after all, why shouldn't I?</li>
<li><strong>FRIDAY:</strong> Publishing Remap Radio. Probably not doing anything else but who can say for sure?</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-first-hour-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-looks-more-fun-than-that-trailer-did.898116/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24175705/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preview-impressions-summer-game-fest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9HXfzC">It’s tough to be a Dragon Age fan in 2024. It’s been 10 years since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/11/11/7134385/dragon-age-inquisition-review-ps4-xbox-one-playstation-4-pc#:~:text=Dragon%20Age%3A%20Inquisition%20puts%20the,higher%20praise%20I%20could%20give."><em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em></a>, and BioWare has changed a lot since then, having made a very different type of game in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/2/20/18232256/anthem-review-pc-xbox-one-ps4-bioware"><em>Anthem</em></a> that had fans (and <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1653550047542534144">former staffers</a>) fretting that studio had turned away from its focus on narrative-centric games. That might be why, when I saw the first hour of <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> in a hands-off demonstration at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164106/summer-game-fest-2024">Summer Game Fest</a>, the game’s creative director John Epler said the word “narrative” to me at least a dozen times, as though trying to reassure me this game would not let me down on that score. I ate it up every time, grinning and nodding like a bobblehead. Because, honestly? That’s all I really want <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> to be, and I don’t think I’m alone.</p>
<p id="JA9fzh">The first hour of the game drops your player character right in the midst a real bad situation. As we know from <em>Inquisition</em>, Solas has decided it’s time to destroy the Veil, a construct that he himself created long ago that separates the physical realm of Thedas from the magical, metaphysical realm called the Fade. Way back in the day, these two worlds weren’t separated, but Solas separated them because he thought it would be helpful to his fellow elves, and it kinda was, except it also caused a lot of other problems.</p>
<p id="b5AVbB">Unfortunately, destroying the Veil will <em>also</em> cause a lot of problems, like ghostly spirits and demonic entities coursing out of the Fade and attacking the innocent citizens of Thedas. That massive, sparkly battle is how the game begins, with your character (a newcomer of your own customization) getting thrown in with Dragon Age stalwarts like Varric and secondary character Harding, who has been promoted to party member status in <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p>

<p id="bwfFtT">Character customization is very extensive here; you can choose from the four races (human, elf, Qunari, or dwarf) and then choose a fighting class (rogue, mage, or warrior). You then choose from several backstories that inform what type of person you were before you showed up in the midst of the high-octane action sequence at the start of the game. The character creator has lots of sliders for body parts and overall shape, none of which are tied to the voice or pronouns (she/her, he/him, or they/them, a new addition to the series) that you choose. Thankfully, you can look at your character in different lighting upon designing them to be sure you’ll actually like their custom appearance. Epler took special care to show off the extensive curly and textured hair options in the game, including several versions of braids and locs, noting that increasing these options in particular was very important to the team. You can change your character’s physical appearance at any time during the game, but not their class or backstory.</p>
<p id="bV4VRG">After designing a rogue character, we caught up with Varric and pals. I was so excited to see Varric and hear him telling jokes; he’s my favorite character. This was around when I asked Epler about dating-sim mechanics in the game, to which he simply laughed and refused to answer in specifics. (BioWare general manager Gary McKay told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">IGN</a> earlier this month that players can “romance the companions [they] want,” which has led most people to assume that this Dragon Age is different from <em>Inquisition,</em> in which all the companions had specific sexual orientations.) Epler did assure me that the player character’s choices will increase or decrease the other characters’ estimation of them over the course of the game.</p>
<p id="7sdhYc">From what I saw, the combat in the game looks exciting and engaging, although it may disappoint those who were hoping to have full control of every companion. You control your own character in real-time, third-person action combat — light and heavy attacks, parries, and dodges. You can also “pause” everything by pulling up an ability wheel to select further combat abilities, including combo attacks with your companions. Epler emphasized that the different combat classes should make it possible for every player to have a way to enjoy combat according to how they prefer to engage with it. Each individual class has some variability, too; even the mage class has some up-close-and-personal attacks, since a mage player character could still conceivably have an assassin backstory and would therefore need to have some attacks to accommodate that sort of career path. </p>
<p id="GptvIP">For the people who don’t care so much about the combat and who will only be interested in those longed-for narrative elements, Epler also told me the game does have an easy mode, and that there is even a setting which makes it impossible for your player character to die in battle. </p>

<p id="EO6EtW"><em>The Veilguard</em> starts right in the middle of the action. Solas is already in the midst of his ritual to destroy the Veil, and you and your brand-new friends are going to do your best to stop him before he completes it. The city of Minrathous — which looks gorgeous, by the way, with neon magic illuminating shops and houses rather than electricity — has already been overrun with demonic entities and spirits that are attacking the populace. You and your pals fight your way through these baddies; eventually you run into Neve Gallus, a private investigator with impeccable fashion sense (she’s from the Dragon Age comics and also appears in a Dragon Age short story anthology, Epler told me). She joins up with you, Varric, and Harding, and you all keep fighting your way to Solas himself.</p>
<div id="XDdRQN"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="yZ4KDU">Epler explained to me that the team wanted this opening hour to feel almost like the climactic ending of a different game. It definitely does — it’s sure not the slow start that some other Dragon Age games have had (I’m referring here to the Hinterlands in <em>Inquisition</em>). When you and your party finally reach Solas, Varric decides to try to talk him down rather than charge in with violence. I loved this section; as the rest of the crew was fighting off spirits, we could occasionally overhear bits of Varric and Solas’ tense, emotional conversation. Naturally, it’s not that easy to talk Solas out of his plan. The confrontation does result in his ritual being interrupted, but it definitely doesn’t seem like we’ve changed Solas’ mind.</p>
<p id="Oe3o6H">After we wrapped up the hour of play, Epler turned to me to emphasize, once again, the game’s narrative. The game, he said, is really about each of the companions, each of whom will have their own storylines and arcs. I saw a lot of combat sequences in that first hour, but I also heard a lot of snappy dialogue. I left excited and even optimistic about getting to know my new group of pals. After all, it’s Dragon Age — and it’s about <em>narrative</em>, people! That’s what they told me, and so that’s what I’m going to keep on being excited about playing when <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is finally released. For now, the release date is fall 2024 (although that’s all we’ve got, still no exact date), and it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. </p>

<p>EA Sports has revealed the cover athlete for Madden 25, not to be confused with Madden 25 (2014) that came out 10 years ago. </p>



<p>Gracing the cover this year is San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey. It marks the first time a player from the 49ers has been the stand alone cover athlete for Madden. It’s the second time, however, a 49ers player is on the cover as defensive lineman Karl Wilson was on the cover of Madden 95. He wasn’t a focal point on the cover, though, as John Madden remained the main person.</p>



<h2 id="h-madden-25-covers">Madden 25 Covers</h2>



<figure></figure>







<figure></figure>



<p>Drafted eighth overall in 2017, McCaffrey spent five-and-a-half seasons with the Carolina Panthers before being traded to San Francisco. In his seven seasons in the NFL, McCaffrey has put up 6185 rushing yards and 52 touchdowns to go along with 4320 receiving yards and 29 receiving touchdowns. In 2023 alone he had 2023 total yards and 21 total touchdowns.</p>



<p>Madden 25 releases on August 16 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. A full feature reveal of the game is set for Thursday, June 13.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Best Beginner Board Games]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-beginner-board-games.898101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Congratulations - you have decided to take off those training wheels, put down that deck of Uno cards, and dip your toe into the exciting hobby world of board games! Now, before you reach for that box of Twilight Imperium or put your investigator pants on to trot around the city of Arkham (the Cthulhu one, not the one with Batman), it’s important to work up that level of game complexity. There are a ton of great games that are far more welcoming to learn and play, to help ease you into things, but a lack of complexity doesn’t mean a lack of fun </p><p>The following games on this list were compiled to point new players towards experiences that, first off, won’t break the bank, secondly, give you a good foundational understanding of some popular mechanics and game types, and finally,  be a blast to play, whether that's with your friends, partner, or a random person at your local game shop. </p><h2>Best Board Games for Beginners</h2><h3>Azul</h3><div id="198412"><p><h3>Azul</h3></p><div><p>"Azul, designed by world famous game author Michael Riesling, is a multiple award-winning game and is a must-own for any board game enthusiast."</p></div></div>
<p>With colorful plastic tiles and a simple premise - collect sets of similar tiles to score points - Azul is a great game for folks who want to dabble in the hobby of board games. The goal is to fill up a small grid, earning points by completing lines and connecting filled-in spots on your grid to each other. It's been said before, but it rings true for Azul: It's quick to learn, but it takes time to master and figure out strategies. This makes Azul a great addition to any existing board game player’s collection as well. </p><p>As an added bonus, there are a number of variants that change out the theme while retaining the core gameplay. For example, if you are more of a fan of chocolates and treats than colors and patterns, perhaps Azul: Master Chocolatier would be more up your alley.</p><h3>Ticket to Ride</h3><div id="198413"><p><h3>Days of Wonder Ticket to Ride</h3></p><div><p>"Ticket to Ride is an award winning, cross-country train adventure game."</p></div></div>
<p>Ticket to Ride is one of those games that could find a place on any person's game shelf - whether they’re longtime players with an established game group or a family getting into the hobby. The premise is relatively simple: use matching colored train cards from your hand to turn them into train routes that connect the specific cities listed on your goal cards. </p><p>Ticket to Ride also has a wide range of versions that will take you around the world - from the United States to Europe, Paris to Amsterdam - you can find the version that interests you the most. For families with younger players, Ticket to Ride First Journey will be a good choice, and groups that get together frequently may want to check out Ticket to Ride Legacy!</p><h3>Pandemic</h3><div id="198414"><p><h3>Z-Man Games Pandemic</h3></p><div><p>"Players must work together playing to their characters' strengths as they plan their strategy of eradicating the diseases before they overwhelm the world with ever-increasing outbreaks. A truly cooperative game where you win or lose together."</p></div></div>
<p>For those new players seeking a cooperative experience rather than a competitive one, there are few games that offer it quite as well as the pandemic. Each player will be assigned one of six potential jobs, such as the Dispatcher, which can move other players around the map, or the Medic, which can remove extra diseases from their location; you and the other players will need to work together to cure and eradicate four deadly diseases that are quickly spreading around the globe. </p><p>Few games can offer such a tense and rewarding experience while still remaining easy to teach and not taking overly long to set up or play. With plenty of expansions as well (including one that makes the game one-player versus many), if you find yourself enjoying Pandemic, there are tons of options and expansions available to keep your games fresh.</p><h3>Coup</h3><div id="198415"><p><h3>Indie Boards and Cards Coup</h3></p><div><p>"A Fast &amp; Fun Social Deduction Bluffing Game. A popular game for family and adults, delivers endless excitement and suspense."</p></div></div>
<p>Deception, suspicion, and deduction are all part of the small-box game of Coup. Coup asks the simple question—do you know when your friends are lying to you? Can you spot their tells well enough that you can confidently call them out when they aren’t being truthful? And can you do it when your own “life” is on the line?</p><p>Coup is an easy game to set up, learn, and play quickly. At the start of a new game, each player is given two cards with occupations on them, with each one having unique abilities, including the Captain’s ability to steal money from another player, the Assassin that can kill a single card, or the Contessa that can block the previously mentioned assassinations. The goal of Coup is to be the last person with a role left. By utilizing your roles (either the <em>actual</em> roles you have or those you <em>claim</em> to have), the object is to deceive or trick your way to the top. This is a great game to bust out at parties and a good taste of the hidden-role genre of board games.</p><h3>Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</h3><div id="198416"><p><h3>Space Cowboys Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</h3></p><div><p>"Immerse yourself in the gaslit streets of Victorian London with this standalone box that offers ten thrilling cases for Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective"</p></div></div>
<p>Perhaps the biggest departure from what most people consider a "board game," Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective pits you and your friends' wits and know-how against the legendary detective himself as you work to solve some of his most memorable cases</p><p>Take your own notes as you follow up on tips, interview people, and look through the telephone book and even newspapers to uncover clues and get to the bottom of the case. Once you have it solved, you compare your methodology against Holmes’ to determine whether or not you found the right culprit. Since Consulting Detective is more about solving a mystery and having everyone work together, it’s a great game for date nights or a chill night with some friends. Whether you like board games or not - it's also a great one for folks who like true crime podcasts.</p><h3>Betrayal at House on the Hill</h3><div id="198417"><p><h3>Avalon Hill Betrayal at House on the Hill</h3></p><div><p>"Players must work together to survive the nightmare…but beware . The house turns one player against the others in this cooperative strategy game"</p></div></div><p>Betrayal at House on the Hill is one of those games that frequently comes out during game nights around my table—especially if friends who don’t play games are around. It’s a game that can be explained in just a few minutes, picked up after a round or two around the table, and offers great moments where everyone will hold their breath. Discovering that the guy who found a crossbow, ceremonial dagger, and is walking around in armor turns out to be the traitor can really make you sweat - speaking from experience.</p><p>We here at IGN rank Betrayal at House on the Hill among one of the best horror board games around., There are a bunch of editions and reskins utilizing the same ruleset, so even if the horror aesthetic doesn’t appeal to you, there's almost certainly a variation to appeal to your tastes.</p><h3>Star Wars: The Deck Building Game</h3><div id="198418"><p><h3>Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars: The Deck Building Game</h3></p><div><p>"Immerse yourself in the epic struggle between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance in this head-to-head card game set in the Star Wars universe."</p></div></div>
<p>What do you get when you take one of the most well-known and important franchises and mix it with one of the most popular modern game types? You get Star Wars: The Deck Building Game, a great entry point in the deck-building genre to hook all those Sith and Jedi out there. </p><p>One player plays as the nefarious Empire, while the other straps on the boots of the Resistance. Players take turns trying to defeat three worlds using an army of recognizable ships, characters, and weapons from the series. Unlike some games, Star Wars: The Deck Building game comes in a small box and is easy to set up, meaning you'll save (or conquer!) the galaxy in no time.</p><h3>Dice Throne</h3><div id="198419"><p><h3>Dice Throne Inc. Dice Throne</h3></p><div><p>Dice Throne is a fast and strategic game of card play and dice manipulation for 2-6 Players.</p></div></div>
<p>Dice Throne is the perfect way to introduce new prospective board game players to the wonderful chaos of dice rolling wrapped up in a Yahtzee package. Dice Throne has players choose their fighters, each with a small deck of cards and a set of special attacks. The attacks are triggered based on the dice rolls, the aim of which is to reduce your opponent’s life to zero. </p><p>There is a decent amount of strategy you can learn and figure out, or you can quite simply roll the dice and see what happens. An additional element that makes Dice Throne a great beginner game is the fact that you can purchase smaller two-pack sets of heroes to try before investing in the large seasonal box sets. That being said, those big boxes are pretty tempting, with a Marvel season featuring heroes such as Thor and Miles Morales, as well as an upcoming X-Men set. If you'd rather go for OC, there are two sets of 8 original characters designed specifically for Dice Throne.  Since each character comes in their own tray, transporting and setting up Dice Throne is incredibly easy, too. In other words,  Dice Throne is easily one of the best beginner dice-rolling games out there.</p><p>Cascadia</p><div id="157128"><p><h3>Cascadia</h3></p></div><p>Theme is a surprisingly important factor when it comes to introducing people to board games: the kind of nerdy or aggressive topics favoured in the hobby can be off-putting to folk outside it. But you can’t go wrong with the wonderful <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cascadia-board-game-review">Cascadia</a>, a simple game of building a wilderness out of hexagonal tiles and populating it with enchanting wild creatures, building your very own corner of unspoiled American paradise. The rules essentially involve you selecting a terrain tile and animal pair each turn and adding it to your growing landscape, trying to meet scoring patterns that vary each game. There are easy scoring patterns to start with, more difficult ones to graduate onto and a solo mode with challenges to tick off so it’s fun for every occasion. No wonder it won board gaming’s biggest prize, the Spiel des Jahres, in 2022 or made it onto our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">best family board games</a>.</p><h2>Heat: Pedal to the Metal</h2><div id="195818"><p><h3>Heat: Pedal to the Metal</h3></p></div><p>Who doesn’t love the thrill of a race? Unfortunately, a lot of race games are either tiresome roll and move for kids, or are simulations that edge the more complex edge of gaming. Heat hits the sweet spot between the two, with a simple yet cunning system based on shifting gears up and down. The higher your gear, the faster you can move, but each corner on each track is labelled with the highest gear you can attempt it at. Take it too fast, and you risk spinning off and loosing your turn. A hand of cards that works in tandem with your gears to move your car ensures plenty of excitement, while the need to anticipate your gear changes and slipstream your opponents ensures plenty of strategy.  
</p><h2>Parks</h2><div id="177137"><p><h3>PARKS Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Some games have a strangely Zen-like air of calm and tranquillity about them as you play, and they tend to make great introductory games. Parks has that mood, alongside straightforward rules, quick play time and absolutely delightful components based on fifty-nine national parks from the US. Players take turns traversing a modular trail, one for each season of the year. Each space offers opportunities to score by collecting forest or mountain terrain, or by photographing animals and you can move as far as you like, but there’s a catch: you can only go forward, and you can’t share a space. That makes deciding how far and how fast you want to go a decision of surprising strategic importance. Whatever you decide, make sure you enjoy the scenery along the way.
</p><p>Just because a game may be good for beginners, it doesn’t mean that you're missing out on fun game experiences. There are plenty of great games out there for folks who are interested in adding some cardboard and dice to their friend hangouts or date night activities. Whether it's deck building in the Star Wars universe, dice rolling battle with Marvel's heaviest hitters, or just lying to your friends for fun,  you don't need to be stuck with a new variation of Monopoly to entertain your beginning board game friends - thank the dice gods for that.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">The cover star of an annual sports game series is probably less of a big deal in a world where digital sales dominate, and the game tile on your console will change several times per year to reflect in-game seasons of content, but it's still an exclusive club to grace the Madden cover. That's the company San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey is joining this year, as he's been revealed to be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-25/" data-ref-id="5000-629476">Madden NFL 25</a> cover star.</p><p dir="ltr">McCaffrey--nickname CMC--started his career with the Carolina Panthers and has been a superstar in the league for years now, especially since he was traded to San Fran in 2022. Since then, he's largely shed the perception of being an injury-plagued player to instead be one of the league's (and fantasy leagues') most dynamic offensive weapons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4316716-ea_madden25_standard_keyart_16-9_3840x2160.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316716" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4316716-ea_madden25_standard_keyart_16-9_3840x2160.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316716"></a><figcaption>CMC lands on the cover of Madden 25.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4316716-ea_madden25_standard_keyart_16-9_3840x2160.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For some fans of his, CMC's Madden cover appearance is a dark omen. The "Madden Curse" is said to affect players who land on the cover by causing them to suffer poor statistical seasons or injuries. The truth, however, is cover stars tend to be coming off career-best seasons, after which they regress to the mean during their Madden cover season, and injuries will forever be prevalent in a sport like football. Since Madden started using cover stars in 2000, roughly as many stars <em>didn't </em>suffer any ill effects as those who did.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, aside from the talk of hexes, sports fans will surely debate who else could've (or should've) landed on the Madden 25 cover--I'd have guessed Justin Jefferson. Look for a lot more news on Madden NFL 25 here on GameSpot soon, all ahead of the game's launch on August 16 for all platforms, or as early as August 13 for those who purchase or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-preorder-guide-bonuses-release-date/1100-6523515/">preorder certain editions</a>.</p>

                <p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door launched on GameCube way back in July 2004.

<p data-characters="132" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Lamine Yamal is one of the biggest talents in the world of football, and <em>EA FC 24</em> players have been waiting for him for a long time.</p> <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">Yamal is undoubtedly the breakout youngster of the recently-concluded club football season, and it’s always challenging for a wunderkind to shine at a big side like Barcelona. His performances have ensured him a place in Spain’s squads in the Euros, and the youngster could even get a spot in the starting lineup. Many fans had expected that the Euro 2024 mode would introduce Yamal to EA FC 24, but that has yet to be the case as of writing.</p>
 <h2 id="h-is-lamine-yamal-in-ea-fc-24-euro-2024-mode" data-injectable="false">Is Lamine Yamal in EA FC 24 Euro 2024 mode?</h2> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false">The Euro 2024 is a dedicated game mode in <em>EA FC 24</em> that allows players to recreate their own versions of the tournament. While EA Sports has included all the updated squads, Lamine Yamal is still missing from Spain’s squad. This is the case as of writing (June 11, 2024); although he could be added as part of a future squad update, it’s unlikely going to be the case.</p> <figure data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-why-is-lamine-yamal-absent-in-ea-fc-24" data-injectable="false">Why is Lamine Yamal absent in EA FC 24?</h2> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">Usually, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/will-ea-sports-college-football-25-release-on-ea-play/">EA Sports</a> only includes footballers who are 17 years or older when the database is created. As of this writing, Yamal is still 16, which will change on July 13 of this year. This is the main reason why EA Sports has yet to include him in Spain’s squad in the Euro 2024 mode. Yamal is also absent from other modes like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-darwin-machis-path-to-glory-sbc-solutions/">Ultimate Team</a>.</p> <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="739" data-injectable="false">Could things change in the near future? EA Sports could introduce a special Lamine Yamal card in Ultimate Team after July (once he’s 17 years old). I don’t think it would happen as the developers are expected to put all the efforts into FC 25, which is expected to be released in September of this year. That could also be the first FC game where Yamal gets added to the database.</p>

<p data-characters="222" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After teasing that <em>XDefiant </em>would get a Search &amp; Destroy mode in the future, executive producer Mark Rubin has confirmed that not only will it arrive in the game, but it’s coming quicker than any of us expected. </p> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/search-destroy-is-coming-to-xdefiant-but-fans-are-worried/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rubin first teased Searc</a>h &amp; Destroy back on June 5, telling an eager player that the mode was “coming,” but didn’t go into details about when we would see it. When <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-season-1-roadmap-includes-new-faction-eruption-skins-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 was announced on June 10</a>, it announced that Capture the Flag would be the next mode added, leaving many to feel that Season 2 would be Search &amp; Destroy’s time. </p> <p data-characters="177" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">Thankfully, that doesn’t appear to be the case, with Rubin confirming that the mode, which will be named “Bomb!” in <em>XDefiant</em>, was being moved up the timeline. </p>

While we may still be waiting, the fact that Rubin and the team are listening to feedback from the community and moving forward what we want to see most is a good sign for the future, and we can’t wait to get our hands on it. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/synergy-is-an-elegant-city-builder-for-a-less-civilized-age.898080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/synergy-pc-city-builder-impressions-review-moebius<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Synergy </em>is a post-apocalyptic city-builder. And before we go any further, please leave your preconceptions about that collection of words at the door.</p><p>See, we're far enough along in the city-builder resurgence that saying a game in the genre is "post-apocalyptic" conjures images of nuke-blasted landscapes, the player tasked with leading a ragtag group of survivors eking out a grim existence searching for food and warding off mutants.</p><p><em>Synergy</em>--which Riley played a little of earlier in the year when its demo first hit--couldn't be further from that, in presentation or in play. It's a game set on a distant alien world, where humanity has...well, just had a bad run. What was clearly once a highly advanced civilization has fallen into disrepair, and the humans of this world have, over the ages, stopped talking to each other, forgotten how a lot of their old tech works and settled into a more tribal lifestyle. It's clear that things aren't that <em>bad</em>, they're just different.</p><p>Your goal is to try to stitch society back together, and <em>Synergy </em>does this through a singleplayer campaign that serves as a kind of long-winded tutorial (there's also a more traditional, sandbox-style city-builder you can play), setting the player a number of challenges they need to meet and weaving that into a story that has you slowly rediscovering the people and landscape of a world that whose horizons have been all but forgotten.</p><p>This game <em>rules</em>. I've been playing the Early Access build for a couple of weeks now and just can't put it down. It takes everything I like about city-builders and makes them better, then takes everything I hate about survival city-builders and makes me not hate them.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="SYNERGY - Early Access OUT NOW | One of the most highly anticipated City Builders of 2024 on Steam!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_w9L7bkoUWY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Structurally this game has a lot in common with <em>Frostpunk</em>, another end-of-the-world city-builder. You need to build a settlement and keep people alive by making sure they're fed and sheltered, and then you need to send some of those people outside the city walls on expeditions into the wild to complete quests. <em>Synergy</em> is different, though, because while I ultimately find the pressures of games like <em>Frostpunk</em> (or even<a href="https://aftermath.site/against-the-storm-is-a-really-good-city-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Against The Storm</em></a>) stressful, this is anything but.</p><p>There's an elegance to <em>Synergy's </em>design that's based on the adaptability of your people and the malleability of the world around you. This is a weird, alien place; developers Goblinz<a href="https://aftermath.site/you-wait-ages-for-a-bus-and-then-two-come-along-at-once" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> could have slapped the <em>Scavengers Reign</em> license on this</a> and nobody would have batted an eye. One of the first things you need to do is send scientists out into the field to study the plants around you and find out what exactly is what, because while some are for eating, others can be mined for building materials. Some can be trimmed, leaving them in place and making them a renewable resource, while others will only give up specific bounties if they're pulled out of the ground and lost to you forever.</p><p>What you then do with those resources is just as flexible. You need to build a kitchen to make meals out of raw foodstuffs, and these kitchens have a variety of menu options you can cater towards what's available on the current map. Your factories can also output different tools and utilities depending on what's around, or even what's available at that moment if you're waiting for a forest to regrow its berries. And if you need something that can only be had by cutting a tree down, creating a potentially terminal economy? Just build a farm, harvest some seeds and start planting your own.</p><p><em>Synergy </em>thus provides all the flexibility of a management game with little of the stress. Everything, from resource gathering to production lines is a problem to solve, but nothing is ever going to run out or and rarely is it going to someone killed. I never felt stuck or lost like I do when city-builder resources are more finite, or which start starving your citizens at the slightest hint of a particular food supply running short. For a hostile alien world, it's pretty chill! There's still some danger around--your people can get sick from eating the wrong plants, and wounded or even killed on expeditions--but for the most part this is an apocalypse full of possibilities, not impending doom.</p><p>Your settlers are hardy and industrious, and so are many of the other humans you meet out in the world. They might be living in the ruins of an old city and want to trade, or need some help getting an old printing press up and running so they can distribute a zine telling people what's safe to eat and what's not. This pioneering spirit matches the pliable nature of the gameplay perfectly; the people can make do with <em>whatever</em>, so it's fine for you to do likewise.</p><figure></figure><p><em>Synergy's </em>city-planning is just as elastic. Every settlement needs the basics first, like water treatment and housing, but after a while you'll need to start creating whole districts that specialise in stuff like culture or science, and the way you place each building within those districts creates a series of overlapping bonuses for every structure within their radius. The whole point of this game is rediscovering the glories of a fallen civilization, so your people don't just want to survive, they want to live in nice houses on nice streets with trees for shade and access to good food, schools, jobs and somewhere to unwind at the end of the day.</p><p>In terms of feedback, <em>Synergy's </em>consistent coloured icon system is an intuitive way to keep you informed of what everyone's up to and what each building needs (and may be short on), though in this Early Access build it could do with some refinement; it's quick to tell you that a kitchen is short in ingredients, for example, but actually tracking down those resources in the wild can be a pain, while the reliance on a district system in bigger settlements would be easier to manage if you could move a building instead of being forced to individually disassemble then reconstruct every building you may have placed a square or two out of place.</p><p>The RPG-lite quest system is also pretty cool, for what it is. In the singleplayer campaign you need to explore the world around you by attending various points of interest on a world map, and while some are vital storyline missions, most are just random encounters with survivors, natural obstacles, weird aliens or...all three at once. There's not much to them; usually you're just told what's going down and are then given an option on how to tackle them. Sometimes it's an ethical decision, other times you might unlock certain responses because you've built enough gear back in your settlement (some protective equipment would let you explore a toxic swamp, for example, while some tools might let you fix an ancient turbine). The writing in all of them is great though, conjuring up all kinds of weird and wild alien scenarios, and they're all accompanied by big pieces of splash art that are just…</p><p>OK, I've made it this long without bringing it up, but let's talk about <em>Synergy</em>'s visuals. I could have written a whole post just about how this game looks. It is <em>beautiful</em>. I have often found myself completely neglecting my responsibilities as town custodian just because I'm staring slack-jawed at my little people moving around their gorgeous buildings and doing their little 2D-animation things. The art on quests and story updates is stunning. There's a lot of Moebius here, and as a result some <em>Nausicaa</em> here as well, but I think it's important to stress that those are just influences, conversational starting points. <em>Synergy's</em> look is very much its own, everything from its buildings to its clothing all coming together with wonderful...synergy, and if Goblinz had just shipped this as a "watch little guys and don't actually do anything" game I'd still probably have 1500 very nice words to say about it.</p><p>As things stand, I've written 1364 words on it, and think I'm about done. This game is great, go play it, and when you look back on 2024 as<a href="https://aftermath.site/manor-lords-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a very good year for indie city-builders</a>, remember to rank this very close to the top.</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/conscript-release-date-brings-world-war-i-survival-horror-in-july.898050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/conscript-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team17 and developer Catchweight Studio have announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Conscript</em>, a World War I-era survival horror game that's also Catchweight's first foray into development.</p>
<p><em>Conscript&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC and consoles on July 23rd, and if you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/amnesia-bunker-review">Amnesia: The Bunker</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/resident-evil-hd-remaster-review-remastering-remake">classic&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em></a>, then you'll almost certainly want to keep this one in your sights.</p>
<p>Set during the Battle of Verdun, <em>Conscript&nbsp;</em>sees you playing as a French soldier who's searching for his brother, who's missing in action. Since this is a World War I story, I'm guessing it doesn't end well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/conscript-release-date-world-war-i-horror.jpg?itok=ibVPlFpD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/conscript-release-date-world-war-i-horror.jpg?itok=GBlcoTnP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Conscript&nbsp;</em>brings scrappy World War I-era survival horror in July.</figcaption></figure><p>If you vibed with&nbsp;<em>Signalis</em>, then you'll probably appreciate the direction Catchweight and Team17 are heading in here as well, since&nbsp;<em>Conscript&nbsp;</em>employs a similar top-down perspective.</p>
<p>Catchweight promises "classic and methodical survival horror gameplay" in which you'll explore intricate levels that demand route planning and clever item management. Areas will "intertwine and overlap", too, so exploration is very much the name of the game.</p>
<p>You can check out the release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Conscript&nbsp;</em>right here. It features an appropriately flat reading of "I Have a Rendezvous with Death", a war poem by Alan Seeger published in 1916 (the same year the poet tragically died).</p>

<p>As well as everything outlined above, Catchweight and Team17 are also promising that&nbsp;<em>Conscript&nbsp;</em>will be highly replayable thanks to its multiple endings, different difficulty settings, and "unlockable costumes".</p>
<p>World War I honestly feels like a very appropriate and strangely underexplored setting for horror. Of course, all war is horrific, but World War I's technological innovations and sky-high death toll give it a gravitas that lends itself well to the tension of survival horror.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I'll be keeping my eye on&nbsp;<em>Conscript</em>, and if you want to do the same, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1286990/CONSCRIPT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">demo is available right now on Steam</a>. The game will also be available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

			<p>Nintendo has deployed Nintendo Switch update 18.1.0, ditching Twitter/X integration on Nintendo's hybrid platform.</p>
<p>Aside from the regular system stability improvements that Nintendo's firmware updates offer, this new system update ends the integration of X/Twitter by removing the "Post to Twitter" option when sharing from the Switch Album in the HOME Menu. In addition, the firmware update removes the option to post Super Smash Bros. Ultimate screenshots to Smash World in the Nintendo Switch Online smart device application. Also, Nintendo has removed the option to link X to a user profile within the platform's user settings.</p>
<p>Another change is that Nintendo has removed the option to link social media accounts from “My Page” &gt; “Friend Suggestions”. Those interested can find the full release notes for the Nintendo Switch update 18.1.0 on Nintendo's official <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525#current" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support page here</a>.</p>
<p>As always, the new firmware update downloads automatically if this option has been enabled in the Switch's system settings. Players can also manually check for availability and download the update.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch is available worldwide now. The hybrid platform was released back in March of 2017. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-announce-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo is currently gearing up to announce a Switch successor</a> - for now dubbed the Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24176043/rebel-moon-snyder-cuts-r-rated-netflix-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98sexier-bloodier%E2%80%99-snyder-cut-of-rebel-moon-movies-to-vie-for-attention-in-august.898044/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24176043/rebel-moon-snyder-cuts-r-rated-netflix-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="3Agxbx">Zack Snyder spent years quietly hyping up his director’s cut of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/15/16650996/justice-league-review-superman-wonder-woman-dc"><em>Justice League</em></a> and activating the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/19/17591154/release-the-snyder-cut-justice-league-zack-snyder-joss-whedon-sdcc">#ReleasetheSnyderCut</a> hive before Warner Bros., in need of content for its grand HBO Max experiment, threw him a few million to complete the job. The four-hour-long finished product was... <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22328263/zack-snyder-justice-league-review-snyder-cut">definitely better than the 2017 theatrical version</a>! This lent the director some credence that the Snyder Way should, in the future, be THE way. So maybe there’s hope for Snyder’s <em>two</em> big August 2024 releases: <em>Chapter One: Chalice of Blood</em> and <em>Chapter Two: Curse of Forgiveness </em>— the expanded, uncut versions of his two Rebel Moon films.</p>
<p id="FBHD7t">Netflix announced on Tuesday that, starting Aug. 2, any willing participants would be able to “delve further into the mythology and madness of Zack Snyder’s epic sci-fi saga in the viciously sexier, bloodier world of <em>Rebel Moon” </em>when the two director’s cuts simultaneously arrive to the platform. The new edits were always part of the plan; while Netflix <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23751262/rebel-moon-zack-snyder-netflix-release-date">still demanded two PG-13 movies</a> from the filmmaker, Snyder negotiated two R-rated versions that would premiere at a later date — four movies for the price of two! During the release of the original first movie, <em>Rebel Moon: Part One — A Child of Fire</em>, Snyder <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2023/12/22/24012244/rebel-moon-r-rated-directors-cut-zack-snyder">told Polygon</a> that the changes weren’t just about blood and guts. “It’s almost like the story takes place in a slightly different dimension than this movie that’s about to come out,” he said. </p>
<p id="a5eofP">The new titles illustrate that level of dramatic shift. You see, the first movies were <em>parts</em> and the new movies are <em>chapters</em>. <em>Chalice of Blood </em>ain’t your grandpappy’s <em>A Child of Fire</em>, ya dig?</p>

<p id="LXFDQY">The notable difference between Snyder’s iterations on <em>Justice League</em> and his Rebel Moon saga is that the latter is all him. Whereas Snyder undid and expanded on the work of his cut-to-bits <em>Justice League</em>, a movie partially directed by Joss Whedon, everything Rebel Moon is the vision of Zack Snyder. He <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23840513/rebel-moon-zack-snyder-star-wars-sci-fi-preview">dreamt of a Star Wars movie</a>, he <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24006240/rebel-moon-cast-zack-snyder-references-300-sequel">stole from his own scrapped ideas</a> to illustrate his new universe, and he even acted as both cinematographer and director to put the purest version of his ideas on screen. But the two PG-13 movies he delivered were <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24135254/rebel-moon-2-scargiver-review">completely uninspiring and drab</a>, among the limpest work of his career. Can more Rebel Moon really save Rebel Moon? </p>
<p id="oWpYuL">We’ll know by the end of the summer. <em>Rebel Moon — Chapter One: Chalice of Blood</em> and <em>Rebel Moon – Chapter Two: Curse of Forgiveness </em>arrive to Netflix on Aug. 2.</p>

That could take the form of a series of remakes of past games, a strategy that has been a great success for Capcom with its<em> Resident Evil </em>remakes. But more enticingly, it could mean that if <em>Delta</em> performs well, and the development team delivers the project Konami is hoping for, an entirely new story in the series could be on the way.</p><p>Of course, without the involvement of series creator Hideo Kojima—who <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/report-kojima-finally-leaves-konami-to-start-his-own-s-1748162428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/report-kojima-finally-leaves-konami-to-start-his-own-s-1748162428">left Konami on bad terms</a></span> shortly after the release of <em>MGSV</em> in 2015—many see no future in the series.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hyper-light-breaker-preview-your-next-roguelite-addiction.898008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hyper-light-breaker-preview-your-next-roguelite-addiction<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hyper-light-drifter"><i>Hyper Light Drifter</i></a>&nbsp;is a bona fide indie legend, so to have a successor to such a title, well, let's just say the upcoming <i>Hyper Light Breaker</i>&nbsp;has a lot to live up to. Though it's a departure from the original, fans of the series and new gamers alike are going to eat this up.</p>
<p>It's not necessarily a sequel insofar as I can tell, and certainly, it plays different from the previous 2D pixel art hack-and-slash. This time, <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/heart-machine">Heart Machine</a> concocted a gorgeous 3D roguelite with active, action-packed combat and even co-op.</p>

<h2><em>Hyper Light Breaker'</em>s Addicting Gameplay Loop</h2>
<p>During Summer Game Fest, my hands-on time with&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>&nbsp;comprised a solo run through one of the game's limitless procedurally generated dungeons. To begin, though, players begin in a town and equip themselves for battle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vendors sell handy new items like melee weapons and guns, and it's also where we progress through the story -- though I should emphasize, like its predecessor, <i>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</i>features no dialogue and only a cryptic alphabet of alien letters.</p>
<p>And indeed, players can see hints of&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Drifter</em>&nbsp;DNA throughout. It shares a similar bright color scheme, albeit in 3D. The dichotomy of ancient ruins and more modern buildings and tech are still prevalent, as can be seen in the game's dungeons.</p>

<p>Before embarking, players can choose from various characters and are able to unlock more as the story progresses. We're led into this vast, open environment filled with tons of monsters, and of course, tons of loot.</p>
<p>There're also various tasks to complete as noted on your map, so it's your job to explore, gather up equipment, and eventually take on the boss. Looking out in the distance is a great big cathedral, a floating island, and different biomes, all of which I can explore.</p>

<h2>Exploring in&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>Gives me Wanderlust</h2>
<p>Exploration is also pretty easy when you use your hoverboard, a nifty craft allowing you to cross distances fast. Though, like&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild</em>&nbsp;and so many others, there's a stamina meter that limits your use. Oh, and there's even a glider.</p>
<p>Combat shines just as much as <i>Hyper Light Breaker'</i>s combat. It's relatively simple, but with so many different weapons and guns, as well as different abilities attached to said equipment, you can effectively build your character to cater your playstyle.</p>
<p>You're able to parry attacks too, which opens up another layer of complexity -- and to be sure, it's important to parry in combat. A boss absolutely trounced me, and while I pulled off a few parries, I missed just as many.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But defeat is not the end, as there are a limited number of tries graciously granted to players. You'll be able to level up, gather resources, grab new gear, and hopefully try again.</p>
<p>Co-op wasn't available for this build, but you can bring some friends along, which has me quite excited. It's a fun, well-made, relatively straightforward roguelite playing by yourself. But with friends? It should be even better.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-case-for-rewatching-the-boys-before-season-4.898005/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24173211/rewatch-the-boys-season-3-4-what-know-gen-v<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="1bTyTa">This week, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23188742/the-boys-season-3-is-about-tv"><em>The Boys</em></a><em> </em>finally returns after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23894052/gen-v-when-timeline-boys-season-4-clues-connections">a college-bound hiatus</a> for another season of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23984773/the-boys-season-4-trailer-2024-prime-video-release">violent satire</a>. You remember <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23200353/the-boys-season-3-ending-finale-explained">what happened</a>, right?</p>
<p id="lRyGxG">Polygon has seen the upcoming season of <em>The Boys</em> — look forward to lots more on that in the coming weeks — and in studying up to remember where things left off, a funny thing happened. We were kind of pumped at the idea of rewatching <em>The Boys. </em>For all of its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23150699/the-boys-termite-scene-explosion-ant-man">ridiculous juvenilia</a>, the series remains a surprisingly thoughtful dramedy, with breakneck pacing that actually rewards a rewatch. And with only a handful of eight-episode seasons, a rewatch seems extremely achievable.</p>
<p id="I2KcIk">But maybe you only have time for the new stuff, or just want a guided meditation on the things you should know. That’s what this piece here for. Think of this as a quick, spoiler-free syllabus on what to refresh yourself on, because with a show as propulsive as <em>The Boys</em>,<em> </em>it can be easy to miss the finer details in the constant rain of gore and other fluids. </p>
<h2 id="b0TO1Z"><strong>Consider starting over from the beginning</strong></h2>
<p id="p8acVw">Three seasons and a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23943858/gen-v-season-2-release-date-cast-news">couple</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22961941/the-boys-diabolical-episodes-list-grossest">spinoffs</a> across five years is a lot of ground to cover, even with streaming’s abbreviated episode counts. Even if you’ve got a solid-enough grasp on <em>The Boys</em>’ major narrative arcs, the show has reached a comfortable place where it’s built out its world enough that it can lean on its own history and remix it in interesting ways. Granted, the most important thing on <em>The Boys</em> will always be what’s happening this very moment, so you won’t be lost at sea without brushing up. It’s just cool to see how far we’ve come.</p>
<h2 id="MtfTIH"><strong>Gen V is kind of important</strong></h2>
<p id="m56H6y">Without spoiling anything, there’s a bit of a mystery hiding behind <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23891544/gen-v-the-boys-prime-video-early-impression-review">the suped-up collegiate drama</a> of <em>Gen V</em>. What’s at the bottom of it ends up being pretty vital to what <em>The Boys </em>season 4 gets into, so if you’ve been looking for an excuse to finally dive in, now’s your chance. Again, you won’t be lost if you skip it — we just think <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23945317/gen-v-season-1-ending-too-short">the show is really fun</a>, and you’ll feel a little more informed if you’ve seen it. </p>
<p id="erixXI">The most important thing: There was a conspiracy at Godolkin University (if you can believe that a Vought-run organization would have a dark side) that resulted in a supe-specific virus that was capable of killing them. </p>
<h2 id="VHyIHJ"><strong>Frenchie and Kimiko fans have a big season ahead of them</strong></h2>
<p id="BSzE3Q">There’s some reshuffling in <em>The Boys</em>’<em> </em>status quo this season, and the result is a renewed focus on characters outside of the spotlight — namely Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) and Frenchie (Tomer Capone). The pair tend to have their own subplots running in the background in prior seasons, but here they’re front and center, and it’s worth recalling what you can of their history.</p>
<p id="duM6oE">When we last left them: Kimiko and Frenchie kissed in season 3, and even talked a bit about getting out and running away together. But ultimately they had a more pressing problem (Kimiko briefly losing her powers). </p>
<h2 id="vf2NyX"><strong>Refresh yourself on Victoria Neuman’s political career</strong></h2>
<p id="muUnY1"><em>The Boys</em> has always been a political show, both in the sense that it is written from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/10/13/21514329/the-boys-season-3-season-2-ending-spoilers-interview">a clear ideological perspective</a> and in that the machinations of its fictional elected officials and unelected corporations have played a big part in the overarching story. The literal, governmental politics are a big part of season 4’s election-year setting, and an easy way to get your bearings is via <em>The Boys</em>’<em> </em>rising political star, Vicky Neuman (Claudia Doumit), now a VP candidate. Remembering how she got there would do you a lot of good. Also important to remember: The Boys found out she’s a supe (along with some of their allies), but that information is not public.</p>
<h2 id="lq6NwY"><strong>Remember who dies and how</strong></h2>
<p id="MH3ls5">This is kind of a gimme, but on <em>The Boys</em>, death almost always signals a status quo shift. Unlike, say, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/24157742/game-thrones-finale-anniversary-next-show-like"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, where shocking deaths rippled out to change the fate of the Seven Kingdoms or signaled how small its characters were in the grand scheme of things, death in <em>The Boys</em> is on a smaller scale, bodies to burn in an unlikely war of attrition between Billy Butcher and Homelander. While the show loves to revel in its gross-out violence, its writers <em>are</em> keeping score, and the bill may eventually come due — probably in a way none of us are expecting. </p>
<p id="mhgonH"><small><em>The Boys</em></small><small> season 4 premieres with its first three episodes on Prime on June 13, with new episodes weekly.</small></p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the upcoming instalment for first-person shooter franchise arrives on October 25, 2024. The pre-orders for the game are already live and one of the details on the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-standard-edition/9N58QRBG9WDG/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox store page</a> for the game had made many players anxious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The now-updated store page for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 stated that the game would take up more than 300 GB of storage space on the Xbox Series X/S, however, that does not seem to be the case anymore.</p>



<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1800273804389941699" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CODUpdates</a> X account posted a clarification tweet today. The update states that the “estimate file size” for Black Ops 6 pre-order pages “does not represent the download size or disk footprint for Black Ops 6” (sigh of relief).</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>📢 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps6</a></p><p>Correction: The estimated file size currently displayed on the Black Ops 6 pre-order pages does not represent the download size or disk footprint for Black Ops 6.</p><p>The sizes as shown include the full installations of Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone…</p></div>— Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1800273804389941699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Moreover, they further clarified that the install size previously shown included full installations of Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone, and all relevant content packs, including all localized languages combined, which is not representative of a typical player install experience”. – True.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, players can download Black Ops 6 without downloading any other game or language packs. Also, the correct file size for the game will be revealed closer to the release date. Players are certainly happy about this clarification, as 300GB to play one game sounds like a nightmare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, a recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/treyarch-found-out-about-black-ops-6-on-game-pass-shortly-before-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> states that Treyarch wasn’t aware of Black Ops 6 arriving on Game Pass until the very last moment. Additionally, the first beta for the game could be hosted between August 28 – September 3, according to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-beta-dates-possibly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent leak</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suicide Squad Isekai is a new anime series that will see the iconic villainous crew from The DC universe enter an entirely new world. They are still operating under the head of A.R.G.U.S., Amanda Waller, and have set foot on a mission that takes them to an otherworldly realm. The supervillains that will be entering through a “Gate” for this new world include Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Peacemaker, Clayface, and King Shark. They will be entering an Isekai, a fantasy world where swords and magic are your tools, Orcs spread chaos in the streets and dragons rule the skies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following their infamous personality, the crew ends up causing chaos in the Isekai as soon as they enter, and are captured by the Kingdom’s soldiers.

It's a new adventure game (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-park-survival-is-back-from-the-dead-as-a-new-action-game-game-awards-2023">no relation to the canceled early 2000s action game of the same name</a>) made by Saber Interactive in partnership with Universal. At the time, they didn't share much detail. But today, Saber and Universal have given IGN an exclusive peek into their rendition of Isla Nublar — new characters, new locations, new dinosaurs and all.</p><p>Universal and Saber have shared with us an internal Q&amp;A conducted with Universal Products &amp; Experiences executive producer John Melchior and Saber Interactive creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick, which contained a number of tidbits about what to expect from Jurassic Park: Survival. Going in, we already knew the game will take place one day after the events of the 1993 film. The action will follow InGen scientist Maya Joshi, who has been left behind on Isla Nublar after the characters of the film depart. There, she must survive and attempt to escape the park, avoiding dinosaurs and other hazards as she goes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Jurassic Park Survival Exclusive Concept Art and Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>From Melchior and Hollis-Leick, we learned that we'll not only be revisiting iconic locations from the 1993 film, but we'll also be seeing brand new ones. This particular setting allowed the developers to explore places that were only implied in the film, but never seen — distant buildings, places where visitors were meant to stay the night, and so forth. And the locations that we're familiar with may have been changed by the aftermath of the film.</p><p>"We have been working with all our stakeholders on what the island would have looked like after the events of the film," Melchior said. "This includes areas we all love like the Visitor’s Center and the T-Rex paddock. But also, what we didn’t see, things that were not part of the tour or got cut off by the storm. Those on the island were supposed to be there overnight, so what does that mean? What would they have seen and where would they have stayed if everything went according to plan? That is where we are starting. One thing is certain - the island is as much a part of the story as the characters and dinosaurs."</p><p>Speaking of the characters and the dinosaurs, it sounds like we'll see new ones of both. Hollis-Leick specifically refers to "new characters," plural, meaning more than just scientist Maya Joshi. And in response to a question about "special dinosaurs" in the game that aren't in the movie, Melchior uncryptically replied with "Life finds a way..." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As for what you'll be doing as Maya, we still haven't seen gameplay yet. But Hollis-Leick offered this explanation of how exploring the island will work:</p><p>"The island is full of different types of terrain, many of them quite challenging. The player will need to use caution and planning in some cases, checking routes in advance. There will also be times when the player will need to move very carefully through an environment to avoid the attention of certain predators. Maya, the main character, is neither superhuman nor an action hero. There are real risks for her around every corner and the player will need to use a mixture of intelligence, grit and patience to survive the island’s many challenges."</p><p>There's still plenty we don't know about Jurassic Park: Survival, and there's certainly pressure on it to nail the nostalgic vibe of the film. Melchior says that Jurassic Park is the "most requested" game for Universal to make. Sure, there's the Jurassic World Evolution series from Frontier Developments, but the management sim rendition on the franchise is a very different beast from a single-player adventure. Unfortunately, we may still have a while to wait, as Universal and Saber aren't sharing a release date just yet, but did confirm the game won't be out in 2024. We'll see it out eventually on PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?
