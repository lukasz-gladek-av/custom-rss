			<p>A new Elden Ring patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing significant changes to the final boss of the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion and more.</p>
<p>Patch 1.14 makes plenty of adjustments for the final boss battle of the expansion, changing the attack pattern at the beginning of the battle, adjusting some attacks, and decreasing their health and stamina damage. The range of some non-weapon-based attacks was also reduced, while the visibility of some attack effects has been improved. The visibility changes, in particular, are extremely welcome, as I have found one of the biggest issues in this boss battle, other than the massive range of most attacks, is the visual clutter that makes it hard to understand what's going on.</p>
<p>The new Elden Ring patch also includes the usual slew of PvP and general balance changes and bug fixes. You can find the full patch notes by going <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Despite the high challenge level, the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expansion is a worthy addition to the experience and one of the best expansions FromSoftware has put out to date. You can learn more about it in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game</em>.</p>

        <p>Expect "free game drops" throughout the year, rather than one big summer update</p>

            <p>If there's one thing I've heard from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a> modders when I've asked for their thoughts on the future of Minecraft, it's some variation on "fewer updates, please". This might seem unreasonable if you're not into modding, but the price of updating a game is often that you break any mods designed for it. Hence, the parts of Minecraft's history many seasoned Minecraft modders - together with server owners and pro mapmakers - remember most fondly are the longer lulls between updates. </p><!--more-->
<p>I've heard Minecraft: Java Edition 1.12.2 described as a "golden" period, simply because there was almost a year between it and the next major update. Picture these interludes as sustained magma leaks on the chilly ocean floor, creating a pocket of warmth in which various species of uncommonly inventive organism can dwell and prosper and make little houses out of coral. But then, the magma supply runs out, and the tinkersome critters must hastily relocate to the next thermal oasis.</p>
<p>Repeatedly updating a successful mod is a full-time job which potentially steals time away from other projects. As such, I'm curious to know what Minecraft's modders think of Mojang's recent announcement that Minecraft is switching to a faster "feature development rhythm". It's seemingly reminiscent of the days before Microsoft bought Mojang, when features arrived in more of a when-they're-ready fashion rather than at the bidding of a seasonal "content drop" cadence.</p>
<p>"Instead of providing one free update during the summer, as we've done in the past, we'll now be releasing a number of free game drops throughout the year," <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-future-of-minecrafts-development">reads a post on the game's official site</a> from Minecraft general manager Ryan Cooper. "These game drops will vary in size and will bring you features to explore more frequently."</p>
<p>It's not quite clear what "game drops" amounts to, but recent updates contain a few clues. "Sharp-eyed players will have spotted our first trial of these drops all the way back in December 2023, when we made visual changes to bats and turned decorated pots into functional storage containers," the post continues. "Next came Armored Paws - which included armadillos, wolf variations, and wolf armor - and released in April 2024.</p>
<p>"And that's not all our developers will be working on. Minecraft is a game that has been growing since it first released, and alongside these regular content drops, our developers will be focusing on long-term initiatives to ensure we can continue to evolve Minecraft long into the future," the post concludes.</p>
<p>Well, it doesn't quite end there. They also mention that they're bringing "a native version of Minecraft to the PlayStation 5", but I don't know what a PlayStation 5 is and neither do you. They're also "exploring ways to improve Minecraft's multiplayer experience and make it easier to find and connect with friends".</p>
<p>If you don't want to update your mods to keep pace with Minecraft's updates, you'll need to stick with an older version of the game. Mojang made this easier a while back by letting you pick versions from the game's launcher, albeit only on Java rather than the console-specific Bedrock edition. They've also tried to make modding Minecraft easier by means of tools like the data pack system. Still, modders may feel obliged to update their creations to take advantage of new features. </p>
<p>It's strictly anecdotal social media ephemera, not an accurate snapshot of the mood, but I've seen a <a href="https://x.com/legend_xt_oli/status/1833167576987312555">few</a> <a href="https://x.com/SixFootBlue/status/1833177375573418192">arsey</a> <a href="https://x.com/obser_vic/status/1833189234544369914">replies</a> to Cooper's post above. Mind you, all of that is somewhat lost in the <a href="https://x.com/2022krl/status/1833167677948379512">celebrations</a> over the parallel announcement that Mojang are retiring the Mob Vote, a regular fan vote on adding creatures to the game that has cultivated community grudges that go back nigh a decade. Did you vote for the Phantom back in 2017? I hope all your precious mods turn to ashes in your mouth.</p><hr>

If you had absolutely no trouble with this boss, I’m happy for you, as long as you go sit in the corner and keep it to yourself. For everyone else, you’ll be happy to learn the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s latest patch has “Improved the visibility of some attack effects” for the boss, alongside some other tweaks.</p>
<p>Patch 1.14, the full notes of which you can find <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-114">hereabouts</a>, comes bearing the following tweaks for Erdtree’s final boss:</p>

<li>Changed the action pattern when the battle starts.</li>
<li>Adjusted some attack moves.</li>
<li>Decreased the damage of some attacks.</li>
<li>Decreased stamina damage of some attacks.</li>
<li>Decreased the attack range of some non-weapon-based attacks.</li>

<p>If you peeve the pee, you may also find these of passing interest:</p>

</ul></blockquote>
<p>There are also a host of other changes for various weapon arts, alongside some bug fixes. This one wins my personal award for “most likely to get you sectioned if you mention it to anyone who doesn’t play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>’:</p>

<p>“Erdtree is closer to Souls of old, with a more focused interlocking map and locales that seem more adventurous, bleaker, weirder,” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">review-edly spoke</a> Edders. “I do think its sheer density makes it frustrating at times, as seeking out optional areas to level up means seeking out routes you never would've fathomed.

            <p>Noteable games analyst Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis expects the PS5 Pro's sales to follow a very similar trend to those of the PS4 Pro, even with that rather high price tag.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">Sony announced the long-rumoured digital-only PS5 Pro</a>. This souped-up version of the PlayStation 5 will allow for Fidelity level graphics at Performance level frame rates, but it comes with a cost. When it goes on sale later this year, it will retail at £700 for those of us here in the UK. Another £100 is then required to purchase the separate disc drive with a further £25 to buy the vertical stand.</p>
<p>The price point differential between the original PlayStation 5 and PS5 Pro is "between 40-50 percent", Harding-Rolls noted, adding this is "significantly more than the differential between the PS4 and PS4 Pro" on its launch.</p>

<p>"In the US, the PS4 Pro launched at $399 and the slim PS4 was $299 at the time, a 33 percent differential," Harding-Rolls said. "Additionally, the slim PS4 had a retail price of $299 having dropped from the original PS4 launch price of $399."</p>
<p>Harding-Rolls stated Sony's PS5 Pro pricing reflects the company's "adjusted strategy to protect its margin, generally supply chain inflation and a lack of direct competitor to its mid-cycle upgrade compared to last generation".</p>
<p>He noted Microsoft had its Xbox One X console geared up during the last console generation. However, as the PlayStation maker doesn't have this same competition right now, "it is an easier decision for Sony to run with a higher price point to protect its existing margins" with the PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>"For most prospective PS5 consumers, the standard edition will represent the value sweet spot," Harding-Rolls said.</p>

<p>Despite this, Ampere predicts "around 1.3m PS5 Pro consoles will be bought by consumers in the 2024 launch window". In comparison, the PS4 Pro sold 1.7m units on its launch.</p>
<p>"We expect the price point to soften demand with some consumers, but for PlayStation enthusiasts the pricing is less of a consideration," Harding-Rolls said.  "According to Ampere data, over its life, the PS4 Pro sold-through 14.5m units, around 12 percent of total PS4 sales."</p>
<p>Ampere is currently expecting the PS5 Pro to "sell-through around 13m units" come 2029.</p>
<p>"Sony’s PlayStation business is now more global than ever," Harding-Rolls closed. "Eight years on from when the PS4 Pro came to market, PS5 is selling strongly in countries where there are increasing numbers of consumers with growing disposable income such as mainland China and Saudi Arabia. These markets represent a growing opportunity for PlayStation versus the PS4 generation."</p>

<p>So far, Sony has only officially named 13 games set to receive PS5 Pro upgrades on launch day, meaning there's still plenty more to be shared.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Commence Star Wars rolling prologue screen: A minority Ubisoft investor has written an open letter to Ubisoft's board outlining their "deep dissatisfaction with the current performance and strategic direction of the company" and threatening a full-blown coup against the Guillemot brothers, Ubisoft's founders, and their backers at Chinese juggernaut Tencent. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In the letter (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisofts-share-price-tumbles-again-as-minority-investor-calls-for-the-company-to-go-private">GamesIndustry.biz</a>) Juraj Krupa of Sloakian hedgefund AJ Investments and Partners <a href="https://aj-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ubisoft-Open-Letter.pdf">cites</a> the delaying of future instalments of Rainbow Six: Siege and The Division together with a lowered revenue outlook for Q2 2024 as cause for shareholder upset, noting that Ubisoft's share price has fallen by over 40% since last year. Accordingly, Krupa wants the board to "take Ubisoft private or allow it to sell to strategic investor", who will "get new air into" Ubisoft's videogames by, amongst other things, carrying out a bunch of layoffs. They're giving the board 60 days to reply.
</p>
<p>
AJ Investments are even now talking to other shareholders with a view to overthrowing the Guillemots. They're going to "use the French minority law to collect enough shareholders to start a proxy fight and initiate SALE PROCESS of Ubisoft to increase shareholder value for all shareholders". In particular, Krupa is calling for long-term CEO Yves Guillemot to be given the boot.
</p>
<p>
"The main reason why the valuation is so low compared to the peers is that Ubisoft at current state is mismanaged and shareholders are hostages of Guillemot family members and Tencent who take advantage of them," the letter reads. "Management is focused on pleasing investors with beating quarterly results and not focusing on long-term strategy to provide exceptional experience for the gamers." 
</p>
<p>
AJ Investments appear to be new kids on the block as Ubisoft minority shareholders. According to Krupa, "we started our Ubisoft position couple weeks ago and are still adding to it". They do, however, boast of their "extensive knowledge about the gaming industry" after being a "long-term shareholder in Activision Blizzard".
</p>
<p>
"We cannot understand the decision-making process of current management that is focused on releasing multiple average games per year that are harming Ubisoft's reputation among gamers community instead of focusing to provide hit games within its exceptional franchise portfolio," Krupa's letter continues. There follows a breakdown of Ubisoft's handling of their games which, frankly, reads like a frothing forum post full of gamer punditry:
</p>
<p>
"Division Heartland which was very much expected game from the gamers was cancelled. Skull and Bones release was not a success, Prince of Persia Lost Crown was okay but not very impressive as nobody talks about the game anymore. Rainbow Siege is doing great, nevertheless franchises such Rayman, Splinter Cell, For Honor, Watch Dogs are sleeping for years despite these games are loved by millions of players all around the world. Latest release of Star Wars Outlaws is expected to bring good numbers, but recent reviews shows that game was not 100% ready to release, despite the fact that whole world was waiting for open-world game under the Star Wars franchise. The Metacritic rating was 76% and IGN has 7/10 rating, which is quite good rating in our view."
</p>
<p>
Krupa, you debonair chancer, you Machiavellian oaf! Forget going toe to toe with the Guillemot dynasty - describing 7/10 as a "quite good rating" is how wars get started. Also, you forgot to mention <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
There are some spicier assertions in the paragraph below. Krupa thinks that Tencent and the Guillemot brothers' holding company are essentially in cahoots to stop Ubisoft being acquired by private equity firms such as KKR and Blackstone - with Tencent buying shares in the Guillemot holding company in 2022, and the Guillemots then buying up more Ubisoft shares "to prevent any future acquisition or takeovers that would make Ubisoft operations more effective and agile against its competitors."
</p>
<p>
AJ Investments believe that Tencent and the Guillemot family are keeping the share price low so that they can scoop up shares on the cheap and eventually take full control of Ubisoft. While he doesn't say that it's a deliberate part of this strategy, Krupa suggests that delaying games is "beneficial" for Tencent and the Guillemots on this count.
</p>
<p>
Hence, AJ Investments' desire to start a shareholder rebellion. Krupa asserts that minority shareholders "own roughly 70% of the company", versus the roughly 25% of shares owned by the Guillemots and Tencent, and as such "based on our talks with other shareholders, we believe that we have enough voting power to challenge Guillemot's". So what would such a takeover and change of leadership bring about? Well, what does any major company strategic readjustment seem to result in these days? You guessed it, more layoffs! 
</p>
<p>
"The company needs to implement significant cost reductions and staff optimization to improve operational efficiency," Krupa adds. "We also suggest that Ubisoft should consider selling certain studios that are not needed for development of main IP's in the portfolio. Ubisoft has over 30 studios, it's obvious to every investor that this structure is too large for Ubisoft and its profitability going forward." He acknowledges "the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-makers-ubisoft-continue-2023s-gutting-of-the-games-industry-as-they-lay-off-over-100-staff">layoffs</a> that Ubisoft has made in the recent years which accounted to approximately of 10% cut of workforce but that is simply not enough."
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, AJ Investments want Ubisoft's current management gone, with the Guillemots continuing in "an advisory capacity" alongside a new, more "efficient" CEO. They also want Ubisoft to go private, because "Ubisoft as a public company is under ongoing scrutiny to report better and better quarterly results to please investors which may harm strategy going forward and is harming Ubisoft at this time, when they need to think long-term to get new air into their exceptional franchises".
</p>
<p>
To me, all this is sort of Aliens vs Predator, except that the Alien and the Predator are cool movie monsters, rather than angry suits fighting for the biggest chunk of a billion dollar company. Best of luck to any Ubisoft developers worrying about the potential fallout.

            <p>If you partake of some virtual rubber-burning, you might remember Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play">shuttered</a> its open world racing game The Crew in March by turning off its servers. Given that The Crew is an online-only game, that signalled its death knell… or death horn, more accurately. Then in April, they tow-trucked the game out of people's libraries and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-has-started-disappearing-from-game-libraries-after-its-closure-last-month">revoked their purchases</a>. This led to a backlash, as you'd expect, and Ubisoft are accordingly taking a different approach with The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. They're giving both an offline mode to "ensure long term access to both titles". </p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/TheCrewGame/status/1833543516506435739">Xwitter post</a>, Ubisoft put out a short video saying that they're "currently exploring different solutions", and "can confirm an offline mode". It's more than likely this is in response to how they handled both the previous games' shut down. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/racing/holy-cow-the-crew-2-is-on-sale-for-dollar1-on-steam/">PC Gamer notes</a>, the game is also currently on sale for $1, which is objectively a good deal.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We heard your concerns about access to The Crew games</p><p>Today, we want to express our commitment to the future of The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. </p><p>We can confirm an offline mode to ensure long term access to both titles, stay tuned for more news in the next months. <a href="https://t.co/pZhx4WUBPT">pic.twitter.com/pZhx4WUBPT</a></p></div>— Ubisoft_UK (@Ubisoft_UK) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft_UK/status/1833543517596954728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">

<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>Even when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/need-for-speed-shift-2-the-run-and-more-ending-multiplayer-this-year">EA turned off the online servers for a tonne of Need For Speed games</a> in 2021, they were at least playable offline. Then again, The Crew 2 sells itself more heavily as an online game. Turning off the servers means it'll likely be a lonely experience even if it's still playable.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-the-crew-2-as-a-single-player-game">single player review</a>, John Walker (RPS in peace) deemed it "an awful lot of not very much", which doesn't bode all too well for when Ubisoft's pit crews arrive and bolt in the offline mode (unless they announce local co-op or something?). Mind you, John wasn't impressed by the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trying-and-failing-to-find-the-multiplayer-in-the-crew-2">multiplayer offerings</a>, either. "The Crew 2, an online only game, has no inherent multiplayer at all", he said. "Up to four of you can group together as a "crew" and take on its scant co-op challenges. That's it." </p>
<p>I've not played The Crew 2 so I can't comment. The closest I've come to playing a driving game recently is when I logged into Fortnite and the season at the time had you driving Mad Max-style vehicles. Honestly? The best driving game I've played as of late was Warzone's late Armored Royale mode. I still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/keep-armored-royale-as-a-permanent-mode-in-warzone-you-cowards">think about it often</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2 id="h-about-ps5-pro">About PS5 Pro</h2>



<p>The PS5 Pro is a mid-gen console refresh that offers higher-fidelity graphics at smoother frame rates. The console features an upgraded GPU, which provides more compute units, faster memory, and faster gameplay rendering. The PS5 Pro features advanced ray tracing, casting double and sometimes triple the rays the current PS5 console can cast.

            <p>FromSoftware has released a new patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, version 1.14, which adjusts the final boss of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> to make it easier.</p>
<p>It's been three months since the DLC was released and many players have struggled to beat its final boss - it's an incredibly tricky challenge in an already difficult game.</p>
<p>Now, changes have been made to ensure more players can finish Shadow of the Erdtree. Notably, the start of battle has been changed to give players a chance to settle into the fight - indeed, many of the DLC's bosses immediately attack the player upon entering an arena.</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition, some attack moves of the boss have been adjusted, with damage dealt decreased, stamina damage decreased, reduced attack range of some non-weapon attacks, and improved visibility of some attack effects.</p>
<p>That last one is important, as this particular boss has plenty of flashy gold effects that can make it hard to clearly see certain attacks.</p>
<p>Other adjustments in this patch include balance changes for PvP play, as well as general changes to some equipment, improvements to some weapon arts, and tweaks to various spells.</p>
<p>Bug fixes have also been implemented, and the patch notes include suggestions to improve unstable performance. You can <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-114?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=ER-Patch114">read the full patch notes here</a>.</p>

<p>What's not included in these patch notes is any mention of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-removes-latin-american-translation-staff-from-credits">translation staff who were removed from the credits</a> after the release of Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-motivated-amds-development-of-advanced-ray-tracing-says-mark-cerny/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been less than a day since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official announcement of the PS5 Pro console</a>. The biggest news (largely a shock) was certainly Sony's pricing choice, but when it came to the hardware features, they were mostly in line with the leaks.</p>
<p>As early as July 2023, insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-rumored-to-launch-in-november-2024-with-accelerated-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> that the upgraded PlayStation 5 would feature 'accelerated ray tracing'. This March, YouTube channel Moore's Law Is Dead <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> from a leaked document that ray tracing performance could be twice or even thrice as fast as the original PlayStation 5, which was confirmed yesterday by Sony:</p>
<p><em><strong>Advanced Ray Tracing</strong>: We’ve added even more powerful ray tracing that provides more dynamic reflection and refraction of light. This allows the rays to be cast at double, and at times triple, the speeds of the current PS5 console.</em></p>
<p>While the PS5 Pro GPU is mainly based on the RDNA 3 architecture, it will anticipate several ray tracing enhancements that won't be seen until next year in AMD's first RDNA 4 PC graphics cards, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-rdna-4-gpus-feature-enhanced-ray-tracing-architecture-double-rt-intersect-engine-radeon-rx-8000-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double Ray Tracing Intersect Engine</li>
<li>RT Instance Node Transform</li>
<li>64B RT Node</li>
<li>Ray Tracing Tri-Pair Optimization</li>
<li>Change flags encoded in barycentric to simplify the detection of procedural nodes</li>
<li>BVH Footprint Improvement</li>
<li>RT support for OBB and Instance Node Intersection</li>
</ul>
<p>According to another leak, it may also include thread reordering to reduce data and execution divergence, similar to NVIDIA's Shader Execution Reordering (introduced with the Ada Lovelace architecture) and Intel Arc's Thread Sorting Unit.</p>
<p>Interestingly, PS5 Pro Lead System Architect Mark Cerny told <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/exclusive-hands-on-i-played-sonys-all-new-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNET</a> that Sony drove the development of these advanced ray tracing features at AMD.</p>
<p><em>PS5 Pro uses the new advanced ray tracing feature sets that AMD created as the next step in their roadmap architecture But if you look around, there are no other AMD GPUs that use it yet. We motivated the development, and I'm very happy we did so -- the response from the developers has been extraordinarily great.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, while AMD GPUs compete well enough in rasterization, they've historically trailed behind NVIDIA in this area. RDNA 4 hardware, starting with the PS5 Pro this November, is looking to change all that at a time when more and more game developers are implementing ray tracing in their games. Of course, NVIDIA is unlikely to rest on its laurels and may well have something up its sleeves for the GeForce RTX 50 Series 'Blackwell' GPUs, whose design is expected to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-550w-5080-350w-september-design-fianlize-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finished this month</a> for a tentative announcement at CES 2025.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has confirmed offline modes for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest “to ensure long-term access” for the community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2023, Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-taking-the-crew-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the original The Crew would be taken offline due to “upcoming server infrastructure and licensing constraints”. The news didn’t sit well with the fans, with many expressing disappointment all across social media. Additionally, the community took it upon themselves to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-crew-is-being-revived-just-months-after-going-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revive the game</a>, with a dedicated team working to get it running by the Crew’s 10th anniversary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seems that Ubisoft understands the community’s sentiment and is committed to providing long-term access to both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. According to the new video on <a href="https://x.com/TheCrewGame/status/1833543516506435739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, the developers are “currently exploring different solutions and can confirm an offline mode” for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. More details about the offline mode will be revealed in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest are online-only racing games, the former released in 2018 and the latter in 2023. The decision to introduce an offline mode for these games has gone well with the fans, with many <a href="https://x.com/KlassikerGamer/status/1833632300824682976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">praising</a> Ubisoft’s decision. However, some still wonder whether an offline mode is possible for the <a href="https://x.com/DyhZar_/status/1833543606696554961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">original game</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Ubisoft was recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-being-pressured-to-go-private-as-share-prices-continue-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pressurised to go private</a> as share prices continue to fall. Also, Ubisoft has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vulkan-api-rainbow-six-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stripped Vulcan API </a>from Rainbow Six Siege.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/the-crew-motorfest-and-the-crew-2-are-both-getting-offline-modes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft Ivory Tower have announced that both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/04/the-crew-2-review/">The Crew 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-crew-motorfest">The Crew Motorfest</a> will be getting support for offline play in a future update, ensuring that they will remain playable long after the servers are eventually shut down.</p>
<p>To mark this announcement, Ubisoft have put both games on sale for the next two weeks. The Crew Motorfest is reduced by up to 70% – it’s cheapest on PC at £18, while the Xbox Deluxe Edition is £22.50, and PlayStation seemingly hasn’t put discounts in place just yet. But you want an absolute steal? Well,&nbsp;you can get The Crew 2 for just 79p!</p>


<p>Say it with me:</p>
<p><iframe title="Robocop - I'd Buy That For a Dollar" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/85cL1HisrNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Patching in an offline mode is huge for game preservation, and it will also help Ubisoft get back some good will after making the original The Crew completely inaccessible to play with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/14/the-original-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-2024/">that game’s server shutdown earlier this year</a>. Now, The Crew 2 was a much better game than The Crew, but still, it sucks to see games effectively disappearing.</p>

<p>Motorfest owners have a lot to look forward to, as Ivory Tower announced plans for Year 2 in the game’s post-launch support. It will get its biggest update yet on 6th November, with the game map getting 50% bigger when they add the entire island of Maui… for free!</p>
<p>This will be integrated seamlessly, so you’ll be able to head over to the new island by sea, by air, or by driving across a connecting bridge, without any loading screens.</p>
<p>Once again, the team will be trying to honour real life with an abstracted recreation, though it will feature real roads and locations with the road to Hana, bamboo forests, waterfalls, Kaihalulu beach’s red sands, Haleakalā National Park, and more.</p>
<p>Year 2 will have another seasonal content plan, though with three seasons instead of 4. This will start with Season 5 and a new Made in Japan Volume 2 playlist. There will also be a new PvE mode included in the Year 2 Pass called The Chase Squad, which sadly won’t feature Bradley Walsh, but will have you trying to hunt down racing rivals across the island.</p>
<p>The Year 2 Pass is included with new versions of the Gold and Ultimate editions of The Crew Motorfest, or sold separately. It will add 20 more vehicles, nine of which are there on day one and the other 11 added in monthly drops through the year.</p>
<p>Launching last September, we said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/29/the-crew-motorfest-review/">The Crew Motorfest review</a>, “The Crew Motorfest provides plenty of fun arcade racing, though it does very little to break new ground for the genre. There’s plenty to get your teeth into, but there are some annoying design decisions and a few technical issues that take the shine off it. Still, I can see it finding plenty of fans, particularly on PS5 where the only competition from a ‘Horizon’ game involves robotic dinosaurs.”</p>

            <p>Abandon all hope, ye who are shackled to your workmates in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chained-together">Chained Together</a>. The "co-op" game about escaping hell now has a map editor that'll let you make your own infuriating obstacle courses for condemned souls to throw themselves upon. Finally, you can make the endless mountain of perdition you have dreamed about since being emotionally scarred by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This update is designed to unleash your creativity," say developers Anegar Games in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2567870/view/4606707511976656411">brief patch notes</a>. The editor will let you place moving platforms, swinging axes, pulsating spikes, and all the rest of the game's horrendous machinery. There are a few levels already up in the Steam Workshop, including the one pictured above, in which I slipped to my death five times before quitting to desktop. You win this time, spinning log. </p>
<p>We at RPS have already enjoyed a brief foray into the fiery pits. It was a journey that saw Edwin, Nic and I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">bickering about the correct way to perform a countdown</a> before committing to deadly leaps and scrambled sprints. The darkest place in hell is reserved for those who run into a gauntlet of lasers insisting "let's just eyeball it, boys".</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> multiplayer platformer Chained Together is cheap, silly, and unsurprisingly janky. In other words, pure streamer bait - the video game as meme. But I often admire games like this for their playground simplicity. It reminds me of Sen's Fortress as much as it does Bennet Foddy's cauldronised clamberer. Nic called it a "layer cake of fuckery", a description both accurate and pleasing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The esports industry has suffered from various challenges and tribulations over the last few years, and the path it has followed to become as big as it is has been a weary one. It’s not over yet, though. Sadly, many issues still plague the industry that leave people asking the question: ‘Is esports dying?’</p>



<p>In this walkthrough, we’re identifying the biggest blockers that are preventing the esports industry from being considered profitable and sustainable. If you’ve been wondering whether esports is a good career path to follow, you’ll want to check out this guide first.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-wrong-with-esports">What’s Wrong With Esports?</h2>



<p>The esports industry has suffered under the weight of many long-standing problems for more than a decade. It ebbs and flows like any other market, but it’s especially volatile, leading to organisations dipping in and out of the industry with an alarming regularity.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it almost always comes down to <strong>dollars and cents</strong>. In the last few years, we’ve seen funding, investments, and cash on hand dwindle across the wider market, but at the same time, player and staff salaries have remained almost <strong>too high</strong>. </p>



<p>In terms of companies, the market is fast becoming saturated. More <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-successful-esports-teams-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esports teams</a> are surfacing every day, but the structure of major esports tournaments doesn’t tend to change, which means there isn’t ‘enough room’ to accommodate these aspiring organisations.</p>



<p>That being said, viewership is increasing, the number of fans supporting the industry is growing, and other revenue streams, such as betting, merchandising, and brand sponsorship deals, remain quite consistent.</p>



<h2 id="h-so-is-esports-dying-now">So, Is Esports Dying Now?</h2>



<p>Esports isn’t dying, but it is still recovering from a monumental boom that ballooned the industry to epic proportions in a relatively short time. We saw hundreds of millions of dollars invested in the esports industry, and some tournaments exploded, pulling in staggering prize pools that ultimately proved unsustainable.</p>



<p>It’s now a matter of adjusting on a global scale.</p>



<p>It can be argued that sports and esports are nothing without the fans and the viewers, and that’s where the esports industry shines. Most <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-esports-games-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esports games</a> are seeing a growth in viewership that’s nothing short of promising.</p>



<p>Here are some key examples:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <strong>Six Invitational 2024 </strong>set a peak viewership record at 521,374 users and kickstarted a popularity boom for the game.</li>



<li>The <strong>League of Legends World Championship 2023 </strong>set a peak viewership record at 6,402,760 users, setting a new world record for the esports industry.</li>



<li>The <strong>FNCS 2024 Global Championship </strong>became the most-watched Fortnite tournament in five years, securing a peak viewer count of 809,854.</li>



<li>The <strong>PGL Major Copenhagen 2024 </strong>proved to be a huge boost for Counter-Strike 2, landing a peak viewer count of 1,853,954 users.</li>
</ul>



<p>The global fanbase is growing, and that means more ticket and merchandise sales. It also means better stability for investors and sponsors who are slowly but surely coming back into the fold. It means more ad revenue from boosted streams, co-streaming opportunities, and more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-betting-guide/">esports bettors</a> going out and placing wagers.</p>



<p>It’s tough for new esports games to surface, but that doesn’t mean developers have stopped trying. In recent months, we’ve seen the likes of The Finals, Spectre Divide, Tarkov Arena, Deadlock, Stormgate, and XDefiant all surface with the desire to become an esports game.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the appetite is there to make something special out of the esports industry. With almost half a billion enthusiasts worldwide, there’s a solid fanbase pooling, and with the likes of the Esports World Cup and the Olympic Esports Games trying hard to add further legitimacy to the industry, we’re likely only a few years away from a much more sustainable position.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The PS5 Pro is real, and it's coming soon. As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">Sony revealed during a livestream Tuesday morning</a>, the PS5 Pro will offer a bump in horsepower over the current PS5 and PS5 Slim models, making it possible to play PS5 games--and even some PS4 titles--in 4K resolution at 60fps. In other words, the PS5 Pro could make it possible to play games with the visual quality of fidelity mode and the smoothness of performance mode. The enhanced console is set to launch on November 7 for $700--$200 more than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Slim ($500)</a> and $250 more than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-Digital-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Slim Digital ($450)</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS5 Pro is a digital-only console, but it supports the $80 disc drive attachment PlayStation released last year. If you prefer to place your consoles upright, you'll need to buy the optional vertical stand for $30. All told, you could be looking at $820 plus your local tax rate. That's pretty steep for a mid-generation hardware refresh, but if the visual upgrades have already caught your eye, you can preorder the PS5 Pro starting September 26 at PlayStation Direct. Major retailers will begin taking preorders on October 10.</p><div title="6526406 - Ps5 pro preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2651" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6526406 - Ps5 pro preorders" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/gallery\/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game\/2900-5758\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/">Preorder PS5 Pro</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/gallery\/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game\/2900-5758\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/">$700</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The PS5 Pro features a larger GPU that, according to Sony, allows for 45% faster rendering and support for enhanced visual technology like AI-driven upscaling and advanced ray tracing.

            <p>
Just days after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-punishing-stealth-sequences-will-soon-be-easier">pledging</a> a fix for Star Wars Outlaws' "unfair" and "incredibly punishing" insta-fail stealth sequences, Ubisoft has released a brand-new patch doing just that - and it introduces a bunch of other features, including cross-progression support, too.
</p>
<p>
It's unclear how extensive these initial changes to stealth are in Outlaws' new Title Update 1.1.2, with today's patch notes failing to go into much detail. They do, however, promise "tweaks and improvement on some challenging stealth moments", with an additional note confirming the "level of detection [has been] adjusted depending on location", and that players are now "less likely to be detected while rolling."
</p>
<p>
1.1.2's next big addition is support for cross-progression and cross-saving via Ubisoft Connect, and that's accompanied by the likes of PC performance improvements and optimisations, crash fixes and stability improvements across all platforms, plus various bug fixes. The Hyperspace mission has been fixed, for instance, meaning players can finally take off, and PS5 players can now unlock the Old School Cool trophy and platinum the game.

Star Wars Outlaws' 1.1.2 update weighs in at 1.92GB on PS5, 2.25GB on Xbox Series X/S, and 1.89GB on PC. Full patch notes - which don't include all the planned tweaks Star Wars Outlaws director Julian Gerighty <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-punishing-stealth-sequences-will-soon-be-easier">recently outlined</a> - can be <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-sg/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/PCOasRfTRCek2FfFirser">found on Ubisoft's website</a>.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell felt Star Wars Outlaws' flaws ran considerably deeper than its wonky stealth in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">two out of five review</a>. "The result is a series of quite painful comparisons," he wrote. "It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed. It lacks the linear polish and charisma of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a>. Lacks the animation flow to its yellow-ledge platforming next to a Horizon, or the sheer joy of taking platforming and making it into an actual game in itself, as in Star Wars Jedi."

During a Q&amp;A segment, Okamura acknowledged the fans eagerly waiting to learn which games will be included in Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2. However, bringing some of the newer titles to modern audiences comes with a unique set of issues, including a desire to dodge the problems Vol. 1 faced at launch.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/06/22/metalgaer-1687441506936.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Konami wants to make sure it gets Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2 right.</figcaption></figure></output><p>While Okamura assures that an additional entry in the Master Collection is in the works, the team doesn’t want to run into <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-confirms-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-issues-to-be-addressed-post-launch"><u>the same issues</u></a> that plagued Vol. 1 buyers at launch. PC players, for example, were <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-is-packed-with-problems-on-pc"><u>quick to criticize the Metal Gear Solid collection’s</u></a> lack of display settings and locked 720p resolution. These issues as well as others saw its Steam reviews brought down to “mixed,” though it did eventually bounce back, with many titles from the collection now boasting a “very positive” banner.</p><p>“We’re also worried about how Vol. 1 had a pretty rough launch, with all of the issues,” Okamura added, “so we’re going to do everything we can not to repeat that, but we just have to ask for everyone to give us time.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There’s more than one reason Konami wants Vol. 2 to stay in the oven for a while longer, though. Games from last year’s collection, such as Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3, are based on pre-existing HD ports. It helped streamline the process for Konami, but it won’t have that leg up when it comes to the remastered versions of more recent Metal Gear titles.</p><p>“We had HD ports of MGS1, 2, and 3. Or, sorry, not really for 1, but the other two,” Okamura said. “But most of the titles released after those don’t have a pre-existing HD port we could use. Some are in HD, but those would all be really big titles, and that comes with its own set of issues.”</p><p>It’s because of these hurdles that Konami says it will “be a little while” before it commits to a lineup or release date for Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2. So, while Okamura isn’t ready to confirm whether fans will finally get the long-awaited Metal Gear Solid 4 port they’ve always dreamed of, he at least notes that they’ll reveal more information when the team is ready.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Konami isn’t ready to announce a Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2 release date, but that won’t stop fans from guessing which titles will make the cut. Players were able to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-fans-uncover-additional-evidence-of-possible-mgs-4-remaster-and-more"><u>uncover evidence</u></a> that games like Metal Gear Solid 4, 5, and Peace Walker will join the collection late last year. Konami itself has teased <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/solid-snake-actor-david-hayter-teases-this-is-only-the-beginning-for-the-metal-gear-franchise"><u>more to come in Vol. 2 since last October</u></a>, going as far as to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-about-metal-gear-solid-4-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-stay-tuned-konami-says"><u>tell fans to “stay tuned” just last month</u></a>.

                <p dir="ltr">In my years of reviewing NBA 2K games, I've come to appreciate--and even expect--the game to feel like an authentic love letter to basketball in so many ways. This has been a consistent attribute of the series going back over a decade. NBA 2K doesn't just capture the culture of basketball; it helps shape it. No other game--not even Madden, despite the head start gifted to it by simulating Americans' unique obsession with football--offers a total package as immersive and rewarding as NBA 2K. That's why, in addition to my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k25-review-luxury-taxed/1900-6418281/" data-ref-id="1900-6418281">NBA 2K25 review</a>--and so as not to become too bogged down in the ins and outs of it there--I'm also taking a moment to address the unfortunate pay-to-win economy still infecting what is otherwise the perennial sports game of the year.</p><p dir="ltr">If you don't play NBA 2K, you may be unfamiliar with its woes in this regard, and if you do play it, you may have normalized it to the point that you no longer see it as a concern. Unlike other sports games in which the focal point is often either the team-centric Franchise-style mode or the fantasy-card-collecting loot-box mode, Visual Concepts has built up its MyCareer mode and its social MMO hub, The City, to offer a compelling--and somehow, after all these years, still-unrivaled--tandem attraction in the sports gaming world.</p><p dir="ltr">Players create a character and decide on a build like in an RPG, which determines how their player will perform on the court. From there, they can follow a narrative-driven story mode, join an NBA team and play out many seasons of their career, and, best of all, jump into the game's thriving community in The City. The shared social space that offers an impressive range of things to do, like limited-time events, pick-up games on streetball-style courts, competitive 5v5 games with dedicated groups of teammates, and so much more. This year, they can even race go-karts.</p><p dir="ltr">The City and MyCareer combine to create sports gaming's deepest experience on the market, but it's hampered annually by a community that has been taught to spend extra cash on making their custom players competitive or else drown in a sea of others getting ahead with the virtual swipe of their debit cards. This is because the MyCareer player debuts as a terrible on-court performer--carrying a 60 overall (OVR) rating--and the in-game money, called Virtual Currency (VC), can be used to improve the MyCareer player, rather than just to buy cool shirts and sneakers for them. The community is so attuned to this reality that it's actually quite rare in my experience to see many players in the low 60s, even on the game's launch day.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365210-45ec1b55-8627-4941-8e57-f1e61ce6ba98.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365210" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365210-45ec1b55-8627-4941-8e57-f1e61ce6ba98.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365210"></a><figcaption>I tried waiting by the entrance to The City to find players with ratings in the 60s and could hardly ever find any. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365210-45ec1b55-8627-4941-8e57-f1e61ce6ba98.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While it surely isn't true, it <em>feels </em>like everyone is spending a bit extra to get their player up to an OVR where they can compete with others online, and the social pressures the game implies through its careful design choices over many years mean this problem feels like it's hardly ever improving. On launch day, I waited by the subway tunnel where players arrive in The City and tried to spot the players whose banners showed they were still hovering around 60 or even 70 OVR. It was rare that I found one, and when I did, they were standing still, suggesting the not-unlikely scenario that the human on the other end may have been buying their VC right then and there so they could upgrade their player.</p><p dir="ltr">A player who chooses not to invest in VC will start the game at 60 OVR and have to slowly improve through play, at the risk of being left out by their friends and teammates who spent more and aren't willing to have a low-level player on their team. A player paying <em>only </em>$70 on NBA 2K is liable to make games harder for everyone. If you're one of 10 people playing in a PvP game on launch day, and nine of them are 80+ OVR, and you're 60 OVR, you're going to have a bad time, and you're going to make your teammates' experience worse too. By 2024, the NBA 2K community has seemingly adapted to this reality by simply spending what they need to in order to remain viable as a player.</p><p dir="ltr">For this year's review, I tried a new method in which I didn't spend any of the 100,000 VC (roughly $30 worth) that comes with my review copy of the game so I could better experience it as a 60 OVR player trying to make my player better via training, playing different modes, and otherwise grinding it out. What I found was the game isn't very fun at all. In PvP, I was a consistent source of frustration for my teammates, as I couldn't cover far better players on the other team, whether they were humans or even the game's CPU bosses. In modes where you can see others' OVR ratings, some quickly backed out of matchmaking, maybe because they didn't want the headache I'd bring.</p><p dir="ltr">Other modes hide this number, but my player's low figurative ceiling meant they'd soon come to the same conclusion, in my experience. I was essentially being picked last for gym class because I didn't want to shell out another 30 or more dollars to make my player competent. Even in solo career games it felt like being stuck on the Pistons last season. I made it not 48 hours before I caved and used my VC to buy better attributes for my player just so I could accomplish anything of importance in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The slow grind from 60 OVR to something better would be enjoyable if everyone were in the same situation. Instead, the game's servers come online, and before players do anything else, a seemingly significant number of them immediately buy sums of in-game gold coins that could fill Scrooge McDuck's vault. It's remarkable to me that the annualized $100 version of the game, this year called the All-Star Edition, comes with enough VC to get players to about 80 OVR, and still many players are spending more on top of that because you easily find players eclipsing 85 or even 90 OVR right out of the gate. Players and media often discuss how many major games have moved to an expected price of $70, but NBA 2K appears to be the first de facto $100+ sports game. To pay less than that while being interested in the game's best mode invites frustration and ostracization.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365212-f8acd40d-c694-4e5f-9327-09eaff598263.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365212" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365212-f8acd40d-c694-4e5f-9327-09eaff598263.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365212"></a><figcaption>Playing through the game as myself is a lot of fun, until I find that bills are stacking up in my virtual world, too.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365212-f8acd40d-c694-4e5f-9327-09eaff598263.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This ties into something I wrote last year, in which I lamented how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/whats-even-the-point-of-sports-game-reviews/1100-6516988/">sports games get away with things like this</a> while other games can't. Most wouldn't try, and when others <em>do </em>try at times, like Overwatch 2 paywalling some heroes or Star Wars Battlefront 2 offering gameplay-altering upgrades as microtransactions, it's usually not long before the disapproving player base forces a change. I understand the cost of making a video game of this caliber is prohibitive, and so I've always been comfortable with ample cosmetic DLC options. Heck, I've spent plenty of my money in games like Fortnite, Sea of Thieves, and even NBA 2K, buying visually cool style options for my avatars. I've even come around on NBA 2K's The City mode looking like a virtual shopping mall--partly because it's wisely presented like a beach boardwalk in this year's game, so it feels less like a giant pop-up ad. But once you've allowed a game's currency to dramatically affect gameplay like NBA 2K has for many years now, a line has surely been crossed.</p><p dir="ltr">I get the sense these economic problems are not Visual Concepts' choice, and this is very likely closer to a publisher mandate. The Visual Concepts team clearly loves basketball, and I genuinely look forward to hearing about all the cool new things it's done with the NBA 2K series each year. This year's game is no different, and you should read my whole <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k25-review-luxury-taxed/1900-6418281/" data-ref-id="1900-6418281">NBA 2K25 review</a> to get a broader sense of how great this game otherwise is. It truly stands alone in so many ways, and it feels like the one sports game I could play forever and never run out of enjoyable things to do.

The big difference between Game Pass Standard and Game Pass Ultimate, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">the now $20 a month version</a></span>, is that the former won’t include certain day-one additions to the library until <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-standard-day-one-cod-blops-6-1851626993&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-standard-day-one-cod-blops-6-1851626993">up to 12 months later or even longer in some cases</a></span>. The most notable example is <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, which will only be part of Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC when it launches on October 25. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But a list of the existing libraries</a></span> for each tier also reveals other discrepancies for games that already came to the service. <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, added last month, is notably absent. As is<em> Diablo IV</em>, added in the spring with a new expansion, <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>, coming October 8. <em>Valorant</em>, Riot Games’ hero shooter that recently came to console, is free-to-play but locks certain characters behind a paywall. The Game Pass version that unlocks them all for free is part of Ultimate but not Standard. </p><p>There are some smaller day-and-date games missing as well.<em> Flintlock</em>, the colonial-era Soulslike, came to Game Pass in July but isn’t included in Standard’s library. Neither is<em> Another Crab’s Treasure</em>, the cartoony Soulslike that joined in April. <em>Still Wakes The Deep</em>, the horror walking sim that arrived in June, is also absent. It seems like a lot of recent day-one Game Pass releases, including Microsoft’s own <em>Age of Mythology Retold</em>, won’t be hitting Standard anytime soon, despite arriving on the service before the split was official. <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II </em>isn’t there either, nor<em> Starfield</em> which came out over a year ago. </p><p>When will we see these games and others make it to the middle tier? That’s the most confusing part of all. For now there doesn’t seem to be one standard approach, with all releases being staggered by the same number of months. Even for Microsoft’s own first-party releases, it seems like their arrival on Standard will happens when it happens. <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, for example, might not hit Game Pass Standard until it first arrives on PS5 in the spring. </p><p> Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It is a story about the death of Isao Takahata: one of Ghibli’s founders, director of <em>Grave of the Fireflies</em> and <em>The Tale of the Princess Kaguya</em>,<em> </em>and “longtime ally, rival, and friend” of Miyazaki’s. But although Takahata died in 2018, our documentary begins five years earlier, with Miyazaki’s promise that he is retiring—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/boy-heron-how-do-you-live-studio-ghibli-hayao-miyazaki-1850819008&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/boy-heron-how-do-you-live-studio-ghibli-hayao-miyazaki-1850819008">for real this time</a></span>—after the release of <em>The Wind Rises</em>. </p><p>Hindsight being what it is, we know the director comes out of retirement, bringing the initial idea for what would become <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> to longtime producer Toshio Suzuki in 2016. But Takahata’s death ends up engulfing Miyazaki in production, and though the idea preceded his passing, <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> is ultimately a product of Miyazaki working through the grief of that loss. That is, if he is to be believed.</p><figure id="" data-id="c8b1847ac7ac9b0c8f71d00f33c30150" data-recommend-id="image://c8b1847ac7ac9b0c8f71d00f33c30150" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Miyazaki, Suzuki, and Takahata sit on a bench" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Miyazaki, Suzuki, and Takahata sit on a bench" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>From left to right: Hayao Miyazaki, Toshio Suzuki, and Isao Takahata</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Toho</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c8b1847ac7ac9b0c8f71d00f33c30150" data-recommend-id="image://c8b1847ac7ac9b0c8f71d00f33c30150" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Miyazaki, Suzuki, and Takahata sit on a bench" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Miyazaki certainly seems unmoored by the loss of his friend. For instance, during Takahata’s memorial service, he relays an anecdote about the two of them sharing a moment at a bus stop in the rain. Producer Suzuki, however, confesses that he doubts the moment ever happened, suggesting that Miyazaki is getting reality confused with images from his own films, in this case a famous moment from <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em>.<br></p><p>The documentary emphasizes this blending of fact and fiction, with frequent shots from Studio Ghibli’s collection of iconic works being spliced throughout. During Miyazaki’s story about Takahata, for instance, the film suddenly jumps to that iconic shot in <em>Totoro</em>. It’s an editing trick used to great effect, in how it unmoors the audience from reality in the same way Miyazaki—and all artists to some extent—constantly walk between the real and imagined worlds within their minds.</p><p>The director copes with his grief the only way he knows how—by writing. He further skirts the line between realities by casting those around him, alive and dead, as the characters in <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>. Producer Suzuki, whom Miyazaki describes as a con-man, is the trickster heron, and the documentary flips between shots of both cackling deviously. Dearly departed Takahata is the mysterious old Granduncle, and Miyazaki himself is Mahito, the film’s protagonist. More shots intercutting the real people with the animated counterparts Miyazaki has paired them with in his mind give us a glimpse into the madness of the method.</p><p>Isao Takahata isn’t the first or last death we see Miyazaki dealing with during the making of <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>. It’s a production unfortunately filled with the passing of people close to Miyazaki, and each death hits the director hard, adding new dimensions to <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>’s own themes of grief and acceptance. With each loss Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli must endure, he, like Mahito, is increasingly filled with anger toward the world for taking those around him. But Takahata’s death haunts Miyazak the most. He thinks of the departed director as the only person who ever “got” him as a fellow creator, and now that he’s gone, he sees him in everything from a lost eraser to a lightning storm. The documentary continuously cuts back to the departed director cycling down a road and around the corner, just out of reach. And watching, you come to understand Miyazaki’s perception of the world—and of <em>The Boy and The Heron</em>–thanks to this incredible documentarian work.</p><p>But Miyazaki’s narrative isn’t the only one that exists. <em>Hayao Miyazaki and the Heron</em> has its own perspective, highlighting a filmmaker who seems more taken with life than death throughout the film’s process. In <em>The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness</em>, an earlier Ghibli documentary made before the death of Takahata, Miyazaki is more nonchalant about the prospect of death and the fate of Ghibli should he pass on, at one point laughing when asked about the studio’s future, responding that the future is clear. “It’s going to fall apart. I can already see it.” During production of <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>, however, the director reiterates his desire to continue living and creating despite the cloud of death around him. He’s preoccupied with Ghibli’s legacy. Clips of past films worm their way into his head as often as they do in this film, as they represent not just his life’s work, but also Takahata’s and that of countless others. He wants there to be a next generation that can take up the pencil.<br></p><p>Enter Takeshi Honda, known for his work as a character designer and animation director on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/neon-genesis-evangelion-is-about-the-cost-and-trauma-of-1835768948&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/neon-genesis-evangelion-is-about-the-cost-and-trauma-of-1835768948"><em>Rebuild of Evangelion</em></a></span> films. Brought on as <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>’s supervising animator, Honda is of a younger generation, as Miyazaki likes to put it, being at the spry age of 56 while Miyazaki is 83 (in 2024). His new ways of doing things irk the director immediately, despite the evident skill of the newcomer. Over the course of production, however, Miyazaki finds a new friendly rivalry in the form of Honda’s presence. The collaborative, and sometimes combative, relationship has hints of Miyazaki’s dynamic with Takahata. Maybe there are other creators out there that can understand Miyazaki, and— just maybe—Honda is one of them. But the old man is doubtful.</p><p>Miyazaki has always been a perfectionist. In the past we’ve seen him labor over animations for days to get them right as only he can, such as with the intricate planes he became obsessed with during production of <em>The Wind Rises</em>. So many shots in <em>Hayao Miyazaki and the Heron</em> show the director throwing away the efforts of others, and sometimes his own lesser tries. But when faced with a particularly difficult shot, in which Mahito strolls through a passageway near the end of the film, Miyazaki and Honda come face to face yet again. We see the director pick up Honda’s version, as we have many times, with his own in hand ready to replace it. But Miyazaki looks at Honda’s work, in which the younger animator shows Mahito fade through the camera itself, and he can’t help but see the incredible talent on display. Miyazki tosses his own version in the bin. Honda’s rendition of the scene remains one of the most subtly stunning moments in the final version of <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="beb2633ab5227d1e988a3d51ba978db1" data-recommend-id="image://beb2633ab5227d1e988a3d51ba978db1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1798" data-height="1008" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hayao Miyazaki (left) and Takeshi Honda (right) overseeing animation on The Boy and the Heron" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hayao Miyazaki (left) and Takeshi Honda (right) overseeing animation on The Boy and the Heron" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Hayao Miyazaki (left) and Takeshi Honda (right) overseeing animation on <em>The Boy and the Heron</em></figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Max</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="beb2633ab5227d1e988a3d51ba978db1" data-recommend-id="image://beb2633ab5227d1e988a3d51ba978db1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1798" data-height="1008" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hayao Miyazaki (left) and Takeshi Honda (right) overseeing animation on The Boy and the Heron" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Miyazaki may see himself as Mahito, but at this moment, as in many others, the documentary suggests he may be more like the animated film’s Granduncle. Desperately searching for a sign that the next generation can create something for the future, something new that doesn’t just emulate his own work, but pushes beyond it. That creative drive would be a true fulfillment of his, Takahata’s, and Ghibli’s legacy. In his relationship with Honda he seems to find a glimmer of it.</p><p>The truth behind <em>The Boy and The Heron</em> lies somewhere between both Miyazaki and the documentary’s perspective. He isn’t solely Mahito or Granduncle; he is both at once. In fact, he is everyone in <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> in some way. The con-man heron that convinces Mahito to go on this journey is also Miyazaki convincing himself to make yet another film. Each character from every Ghibli film that started in Miyazaki’s mind bears some shard of him. The director himself says that to make these works of art, he must open his brain to the world. <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> is a masterful work in which Miyazaki lays himself bare to the world in a way he has never done before. No wonder the documentary opens with a shot of the director naked in an onsen.</p><p>Despite being obsessed with the death taking place around him, and joking about his own inevitable demise, Miyazaki lives. The end of <em>The Wind Rises</em>, which was once going to be the director’s final film, ends with the simple command to live. <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>’s Japanese title, <em>How Do You Live?</em> responds to that command with a question. <em>Hayao Miyazaki and the Heron</em> answers that question. “If we don’t create, there’s nothing,” says the director. So Hayao Miyazaki creates.</p><hr><p><em>The Boy and the Heron</em> and <em>Hayao Miyazaki and the Heron</em> are now available to stream on Max.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
