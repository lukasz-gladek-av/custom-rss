            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Do you remember that game from <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Glowmade</strong> at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-and-glowmade-reveal-king-of-meat-at-gamescom-2024/">Gamescom ONL 2024</a></strong> that put <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oykf2q9_LM"><strong>Geoff Keighley </strong>in its trailer</a> and looked like a more medieval version of <strong>Fall Guys</strong>? No? Well, to remind you (unless you're <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1926980/charts/">one of the 10 people playing it on Steam right now </a>who need no reminder), that game was <strong>King of Meat</strong>, a co-op party platformer that dropped four friends into a medieval, community-built obstacle course.</p>



<p>That's what King of Meat was, with 'was' being the keyword here, because today, Amazon and Glowmade announced on <a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us">the game's official website</a> that its servers are going to get <strong>shut down</strong> on <strong>April 9, 2026</strong>. It has already been delisted from all storefronts, and anyone who did buy it, whether at its <strong>$30</strong> price or its more common sales prices, will be <strong>getting a refund</strong>.</p>



<p>The game initially launched on <strong>October 2, 2025,</strong> and while we can't know how popular it was on its console platforms, SteamDB can tell us that it never had more than <strong>320</strong> people playing it at one time, a number that it didn't even hit at launch, but a month after launch, during a free weekend trial period. Its 24-hour peak currently sits at 10 players.</p>



<p>Depressing as these numbers may be to read, they are, according to Amazon and Glowmade's statement, the reason the game is getting shut down. "<em>Despite the creativity and innovation Glowmade brought to King of Meat, the game has <strong>unfortunately not found the audience we hoped for</strong>. As a result, we have made the difficult decision to conclude our investment in the game, and King of Meat's servers will close on <strong>April 9, 2026</strong>. Players will be able to access and play all existing content until then, so we encourage you to enjoy your remaining time in the game with your fellow Contenders</em>." </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="King of Meat: Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/stZ0Vvfvd6s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The statement is then followed by a message written in all-caps, which reads, "<em>All players who purchased King of Meat <strong>will receive a full refund in the coming weeks from their platform provider</strong>."</em> So whether you jumped in at launch, hoping this would be the next big multiplayer game, or gave it a shot after its free trial weekend, you'll be getting your money back.</p>



<p>Amazon and Glowmade have also turned off the game's microtransactions, so the only thing left to do in King of Meat is to enjoy the game if you already own a copy of it.</p>



<p>"<em>We want to sincerely thank every player who supported King of Meat and the wonderful community that formed around it. Your enthusiasm, imagination, and feedback have meant the world to us and to the team at Glowmade. We're grateful for Glowmade's partnership and passion throughout this journey and wish them continued success in the future</em>," Amazon concludes. </p>



<p>When King of Meat was first announced at Gamescom 2024, we got the chance to <a href="https://wccftech.com/king-of-meat-gamescom-2024-qa-it-is-an-obvious-good-fit-for-streaming-streamers-really-enjoyed-it/">preview the game and speak to the development team at Glowmade</a>. Even at the time, Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo identified that despite its run-of-the-mill gameplay, its capacity for user-generated content could be the thing that established King of Meat as a must-play multiplayer game. </p>



<p>The studio even seemed to imply that it was built as a game that could be extremely popular on Twitch, adding that "<em>It is sort of an obvious good fit for streaming</em>," and that the studio had "<em>a bunch of streamers and content creators play the game already, and they really enjoyed it.</em>"</p>



<p>Clearly, its strategy of designing for content creators and streaming, and seemingly relying on influencers to help get the game going, did not pan out. Even a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1drt0O2U8DY">Mr. Beast collab</a> that arrived just as the game launched was unable to do anything for it.</p>



<p>There's been no word from the Glowmade team as to how it is moving forward from here, though the website's statement does seem to imply its partnership with Amazon has concluded. Hopefully, the studio is able to come together around its next project, because whatever your thoughts on King of Meat, it's clear that, despite missing the mark with this game, Glowmade is an extremely capable studio. We'll see if they get another kick at the can.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Billions of dollars later and still nobody knows what an Xbox is]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The last few years of Xbox have been expensive. Under Phil Spencer’s leadership, Microsoft has spent billions of dollars in an attempt to build an ambitious future for gaming that looks a lot like Netflix. And while its subscription service Game Pass started out as a good deal for gamers (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">although now not so much</a>), that spending spree has led to catastrophic layoffs, studio closures, and confused and inconsistent messaging about what Xbox actually stands for. And <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/882363/xbox-microsoft-phil-spencer-out">with Spencer set to retire as new leadership takes charge</a>, the future of Microsoft’s gaming efforts looks increasingly unclear.</p><p>Spencer announced his retirement last week, after over a decade leading the Xbox division and nearly four at Microsoft. He’ll be replaced as CEO by Asha Sharma, formerly president of Microsoft’s CoreAI Product, while Xbox Game Studios boss Matt Booty has been promoted to EVP and CCO. As part of the restructuring, Xbox president Sarah Bond will be leaving Microsoft. One of Sharma’s commitments, she wrote in a memo, is “the return of Xbox.” But given the brand’s uncertain status right now following Spencer’s tenure, what that actually means is anybody’s guess.</p><p>Spencer took over the Xbox division in 2014, a year after the launch of the Xbox One. And while he was popular among fans for being the rare exec who also appeared to really be passionate about games, his legacy will ultimately hinge on the transformative changes that took place around Game Pass and cloud gaming.</p><p>Despite being a comparative latecomer, Microsoft made up ground quickly in the console race against Sony and Nintendo, due in large part to its prescient focus on online play through Xbox Live. With the follow-up Xbox 360, Microsoft found itself competing closely with the PS3, but that momentum was lost with its third console, the Xbox One, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/15/23306068/microsoft-xbox-one-sales-lifetime-versus-ps4-sales">which never really recovered from a messy launch and ultimately sold less than half of what the PS4 sold</a>.</p><p>Around this time, signs pointed to the console paradigm changing, with the cycle of releasing a new device every five years giving way to something more fluid, where hardware was less important and games carried over between devices. Meanwhile, streaming services like Netflix were upending the world of film and television. A service like Game Pass was a chance for Microsoft to get out of its third-place position by being early to where the games industry <em>could</em> be headed. At that point, Game Pass was still a nascent but exciting prospect, offering players an all-you-can-eat assortment of games at a reasonable price. But its unproven potential seemed to make Xbox rethink its entire strategy: If it couldn’t compete on console sales, maybe it could win with subscribers?</p><p>In fact, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18661247/phil-spencer-interview-xbox-project-scarlett-xcloud-e3-2019">as early as 2019 Spencer was telling me that console sales didn’t really matter in the long run</a>. “I don’t need to sell any specific version of the console in order for us to reach our business goals,” he said. “The business isn’t how many consoles you sell.” That’s a positive spin when you’re not selling a lot of consoles. So instead the focus was on reaching players where they were through Game Pass and the cloud.</p><p>But in order to do that, Game Pass needed games, and Microsoft went out and bought as many as it could. First, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized">Microsoft spent $7.5 billion to acquire Bethesda</a>, and along with it franchises like <em>Fallout</em> and <em>Elder Scrolls</em>, for the express purpose of getting more exclusives it could offer through Game Pass. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">Then it spent a whopping $68.7 billion on Activision Blizzard</a>, the biggest publisher in the world, giving it access to everything from <em>Call of Duty </em>to <em>Candy Crush</em> to <em>World of Warcraft</em>. (These genre-defining franchises never became Xbox exclusives <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23769580/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-playstation-call-of-duty-arguments">due to antitrust concerns</a>.)</p><p>Problem is, even with all of those games, Game Pass hit a plateau; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/23570040/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-subscriber-numbers-34-million">Microsoft announced that it hit 34 million subscribers in 2024</a>, but there hasn’t been an update since then. Even while offering the service at a subsidized price that made Game Pass relatively affordable, it became clear the audience for a subscription like this wasn’t as large as Microsoft had anticipated. Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware">Spencer hoped to hit 100 million subscribers by 2030</a>. That seems increasingly unlikely now.</p><div><p>Meanwhile, the acquisition spree has had devastating effects. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">Thousands have been laid off as part of Activision’s integration into Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">while a pair of Bethesda studios were shuttered for good</a>. Games were canceled, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696676/microsoft-forza-motorsport-turn-10-studios-layoffs-xbox-cuts">even successful studios like <em>Forza</em> developer Turn 10 were hit hard</a>. Meanwhile, on the business side, the focus on Game Pass also messed up one of most consistent streams of revenue in video games: selling a <em>Call of Duty</em> every year. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-03/xbox-s-game-pass-hike-shows-cost-of-lost-call-of-duty-sales?srnd=undefined">Putting the shooter series on Game Pass reportedly led to $300 million in lost sales</a>. Game Pass keeps getting more expensive for consumers, and it’s unclear if it’s recouping the losses of selling games directly.</p></div><p>This shift also significantly watered down the brand. Initially, the sales pitch for an Xbox was obvious: It was a powerful video game console from Microsoft. But with Game Pass and cloud gaming, the messaging changed. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">The “This is an Xbox” ad campaign</a> tried to position Xbox not as a console, but any device — whether it’s a PC, smart TV, Windows handheld, or your phone — that could play Xbox games. And as these efforts struggled, Microsoft went a step further and made bringing games to rival platforms a pillar of its strategy. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/23/23771828/microsoft-betheda-acquisition-starfield-playstation-exclusive">It may have bought Activision and Bethesda for exclusives</a>, but now it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661814/xbox-best-selling-games-ps5-oblivion-minecraft">one of the biggest publishers on PlayStation</a>. Xbox is now a state of mind, it seems.</p><p>Criticisms have already been levied against Sharma because, unlike Spencer, she’s not a “gamer,” and instead has a background in Microsoft’s AI efforts and at companies like Instacart and Meta. But then again, the current presidents of Nintendo and Sony Interactive Entertainment aren’t known for being gamers, either, and they’ve managed to stay ahead of Xbox (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/881578/sony-close-bluepoint-games-studio-remaster-remake-demons-souls-shadow-colossus-god-of-war">albeit with their own stumbles</a>). And being a gamer didn’t necessarily help Spencer, who saw some of where the industry was going but wasn’t able to change Xbox enough to meet that moment. Sharma could represent a huge shift for how Microsoft operates in gaming, but that’s also exactly what the company needs right now.</p><p>Which is all to say that “the return of Xbox” could mean a lot of things, because Xbox now means a lot of things. In her memo, Sharma describes it as “as a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console” while also noting that “as we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve.” Which sounds a lot like the state of things right now.</p><p>Maybe we’ll never find out what an Xbox really is.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/883159/phil-spencer-xbox-game-pass]]></content:encoded>

<p>Seamus Blackley believes the recent changes at Microsoft Gaming are intended to sunset the Xbox brand.</p>



<p>Seamus Blackley was a game developer who helped create the original Xbox, which launched 25 years ago. In the last quarter-century, the Xbox brand has reached the heights and fallen quite far from that perch.</p>







<h2 id="h-seamus-blackley-thinks-xbox-s-end-is-near">Seamus Blackley Thinks Xbox’s End Is Near</h2>



<p>Recently, Microsoft Gaming underwent a massive restructuring,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-sarah-bond-resigns/" id="178338"> with Phil Spencer retiring</a> and Asha Sharma becoming the new CEO. Now, Blackley is speaking out about why he believes this move will ultimately spell the end for the Xbox brand.</p>



<p><a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with GamesBeat</a>, Blackley explained that he believes many Microsoft businesses that aren’t related to the CoreAI business, the department that Sharma worked at previously, are being sunsetted. As such, he believes that Sharma’s role is to move the Xbox brand out of the picture.</p>



<p>“Xbox, like a lot of businesses that aren’t the core AI business, is being sunsetted. They don’t say that, but that’s what’s happening. I expect that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, her job is going to be as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night,” he said.</p>







<h2 id="h-asha-sharma-s-public-stance-has-been-polar-opposite">Asha Sharma’s Public Stance Has Been Polar Opposite</h2>



<p>Publicly, Asha Sharma, who officially assumed her duties today after the announcement on Friday, February 20, has touted a rebirth of the Xbox brand. She claims that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asha-sharmas-full-memo-following-promotion-to-ceo-of-microsoft-gaming/" id="178373">she’s focused on revitalizing the brand</a> and recommitting to core Xbox players. A social media account tied to her has even been hearing out fans’ suggestions, including<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-xbox-ceo-responds-to-fans-desire-for-console-exclusives/" id="178442"> a return to console-exclusive games.</a></p>



<p>Everything is still fresh regarding the changes at Microsoft, but time will tell whether this is a reset or the sunset for the Xbox brand. Another thing that’s fresh is Asha Sharma’s gamer profile. Learn more about that, and why it’s set off some alarms for players, at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-ceo-profile-one-month-old-suspicious/" id="178467">this link.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Story Behind One Of The Best Video Game Magazine Covers Of All Time]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-10-yoshitaka-amano-art-egm-2000672858</link>
            <guid>1444186</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The 2000s was a new dawn for console gaming. The PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and even Dreamcast were expanding the horizons of what dreams could unfurl on the living room TV. It was a heyday for print publications as well, the specialty press being the best window between players and this unwritten future. </span><i><span>Electronic Gaming Monthly</span></i><span> (</span><i><span>EGM</span></i><span>) was one of the biggest on the shelves, and in 2001 they’d flex those bonafides with a gorgeous, original cover from </span><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i><span> artist Yoshitaka Amano. It turns out landing on those shelves was kind of an accident.</span></p> <p><span>After </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span> stunned PlayStation owners, the signature SquareSoft series finally found a level of popularity abroad that had previously been elusive outside of Japan. Its first outing on next-generation consoles was going to be a hot affair, with new fidelity and processing power able to render these adventures, exploits and intimacies better than ever before. Cover material for sure.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>At </span><i><span>EGM</span></i><span>, then editor-in-chief Dan “Shoe” Hsu wanted something special for </span><i><span>Final Fantasy X</span></i><span>. “Shoe wanted to see if we could commission an Amano painting for the cover and it got [complicated] because we needed Square’s permission,” </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/milkman.bsky.social/post/3mfcduiavxs22"><span>posted James Mielke</span></a><span>, famed </span><i><span>EGM</span></i><span> alumni. “Plus, it cost us $10,000 when the average art budget for a cover was essentially zero.”</span></p>   <p><span>Surprisingly, publisher ZiffDavis gave them the green light. Mielke personally oversaw the cover’s creation, with Amano’s turnaround being much faster than expected. Amano used gold leaf for the painting, which </span><i><span>EGM</span></i><span>’s printer struggled to do justice. The interesting complexion of the finished cover remained alluring all the same.</span></p>

 <p><span>That wasn’t the only complication. According to Hsu’s follow-up thread, the Amano cover was intended to go to all </span><i><span>EGM</span></i><span> subscribers, with only 25 percent shipping to retail, taking a page from the ‘90s superhero comics boom. “I wanted it to be very exclusive and rare. And I thought the non-Amano cover would be more mainstream anyways,” </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/danshoehsu.bsky.social/post/3mfck67rpy226"><span>posted Hsu</span></a><span>. “Something got miscommunicated along the way.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Instead, the publisher thought they wanted Amano to occupy 25 percent of all covers overall. Meaning some subscribers ended up with the standard issue, featuring pretty decent key art of Yuna, and retail shelves found themselves with way more of the painterly approach.</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:zum2teecl6yxcchpcuuc4drk/app.bsky.feed.post/3mfck67rpy226" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreicfysrtymishocluoqnylgupjsp46nfss2h2jcipzusd3bttn47nu"> <p lang="en">But something got miscommunicated along the way and the entire run (newsstands + subs) got 25% Amano. I wondered if some subscribers (those who weren’t into Final Fantasy) would be less happy. And that’s also X more people who wouldn’t buy the Amano issue (this was a sales stunt, after all). 🧵2/</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zum2teecl6yxcchpcuuc4drk?ref_src=embed">Shoe (@danshoehsu.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zum2teecl6yxcchpcuuc4drk/post/3mfck67rpy226?ref_src=embed">2026-02-20T16:37:10.361Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>While some of those subscribers felt burned, overall it proved a happy mistake. Readers seemed chuffed by the gorgeous surprise and it boosted sales considerably, making it one of </span><i><span>EGM</span></i><span>’s best selling-issues. Even </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/08/07/limited-edition-final-fantasy-x-cover"><span>nascent digital rival </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> wrote about it</span></a><span>. ZiffDavis allowed another commission from Amano two years later for a </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Everything</span></i><span> cover. Mielke is just happy to see the art </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/milkman.bsky.social/post/3mfce4i5qws22"><span>make its way into Zippo culture</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sadly, the new millennium wasn’t too friendly to printed specialty press. </span><i><span>EGM</span></i><span>’s print run ended in 2009, its beloved digital counterpart </span><i><span>1UP.com</span></i><span> being closed not long after in 2013. However, its legacy still lives on. A crowdfunded </span><i><span>EGM</span></i><span> anthology raised $1.7 million, the </span><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/egmbook/egmcompendium/posts/4609961"><span>tomes heading to press in the short future</span></a><span>. Mielke recently announced he’s releasing </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/882892/final-fantasy-nobuo-uematsu-biography"><span>a biography of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i><span> composer Nobuo Uematsu</span></a><span> through Viz.

		<p>Amazon Game Studio has announced that it will be shutting down the servers of the co-op platformer King of Meat, six months after it launched. King of Meat released on October 2nd and its servers will be switched off on April 9th. It has been removed from sale with immediate effect, so if you were curious to give it a try you won’t be able to now unless you already bought it.</p>

<p>In a statement, Amazon Game Studio wrote, <em>“Following the launch of King of Meat, it’s been incredibly rewarding to watch the community enjoy this fun and chaotic world. <wbr>Despite the creativity and innovation Glowmade brought to King of Meat, the game has unfortunately not found the audience we hoped for. As a result, we have made the difficult decision to conclude our investment in the game, and King of Meat’s servers will close on April 9, 2026. Players will be able to access and play all existing content until then, so we encourage you to enjoy your remaining time in the game with your fellow Contenders.</em></p>
<p><em><wbr>All players who purchased King of Meat will receive a full refund in the coming weeks from their platform provider.<wbr>We want to sincerely thank every player who supported King of Meat and the wonderful community that formed around it. Your enthusiasm, imagination, and feedback have meant the world to us and to the team at Glowmade. We’re grateful for Glowmade’ s partnership and passion throughout this journey and wish them continued success in the future.”</em></p>

<p>If you do own King of Meat you can no longer buy Stamps in the game. The game will receive no further updates regarding content or bug fixes. In regard to refunds, they will be handled directly by the platform holders, and they should be automatically done between 24th February and 9th April. If a refund is not received by April 9th, players have been told to contact customer support for the platform that they own King of Meat on.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marathon-cheaters-will-be-permabanned-no-second-chances-says-bungie/</link>
            <guid>1444150</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Bungie's</strong> upcoming first-person PvEvP extraction shooter, <strong>Marathon</strong>, will be out on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S in a little more than a week from the time of this writing, and as you might expect, there has been a lot of <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-gamelay-new-impressive-death-awaits-trailer/">communication and marketing from the team</a> as we get closer to the game's release.</p>



<p>The most recent of which arrived today, in the form of a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonsecurity">new blog post</a> on the official Bungie website, all to do with the game's networking and security. The blog post highlights the game's dedicated server networking and how elements like Fog of War limit the usability of things like wall-hacks, while also explaining what happens if you find yourself disconnected from a game.</p>



<p>One point it hammers home, though, is that if you are caught cheating in Marathon, you are forever <strong>banned</strong> from the game. "<em><strong>Anyone found to be cheating will be permabanned from playing Marathon forever, no second chances</strong></em>," the blog post reads in its initial bullet-point summary.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’re investing in networking and security for Marathon:</p><p>🖥️Dedicated servers<br>🤖Server-side authority over key actions to reduce exploits<br>😶‍🌫️Fog of War to limit wall hacks and loot revealers<br>⛓️‍💥Disconnect recovery<br>🛑No second chances </p><p>Learn more: <a href="https://t.co/CBTJ1wGDVi">https://t.co/CBTJ1wGDVi</a> <a href="https://t.co/FT2fXQgyIp">pic.twitter.com/FT2fXQgyIp</a></p></div>— Marathon (@MarathonTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2025963870045843652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>"<em>We are taking a strong stance against cheating</em>," the post adds towards the end of the blog post, "<em>and anyone found to be cheating or developing cheats will be permanently banned from playing Marathon forever, no second chances</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>That said, no system is perfect, so we will have an appeals system to monitor for any issues in detection</em>." So if you are mistakenly banned for cheating, you will have the chance to regain access to Marathon, but it seems like Bungie is doing its best to take a hardcore stance against cheaters in its upcoming shooter.</p>



<p>Which is understandable, considering how toxic cheaters can be to a multiplayer community. Once enough of them begin to crop up in lobbies, it makes the idea of going back to the game for players who don't want to cheat impossible to consider. It doesn't even have to be that you experience cheaters in every match you play; sometimes, all it takes is consistently running into cheaters all at once in a single session for players to have seen enough evidence that cheaters are ruining their gameplay experience.</p>



<p>Marathon arrives on PC and current-gen consoles on <strong>March 5, 2026</strong>, and if you're looking to try it out before dropping <strong>$40</strong> to buy it, you'll be able to try it out on your platform of choice this coming weekend, starting on February 26, during its <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-will-host-a-marathon-server-slam-test-just-ahead-of-launch-next-month/">open-preview server slam test.</a></p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>We hear a lot about “puzzle platformers,” but none has ever taken the notion as literally as <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3249380/Piece_by_Piece/">Piece by Piece</a>.&nbsp;</em>This is a collection of tiny platform games by Neon Polygons, set within the rearrangeable pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and it’s really ever-so smart.</p> <p><em>Piece by Piece&nbsp;</em>sets its agenda from the very first puzzle. You play as a little king dude trapped inside a single jigsaw puzzle piece. However, when you click in another piece he’s then able to run between the two—so long as there’s not a wall or obstacle blocking his path. So you’d imagine this would start with your just connecting three pieces together and running from left to right to get to grips with the conceit. But no! <em>Piece by Piece</em> wants you on top of things straight away, and you’re going to need to do a slightly more complicated bit of piece juggling to be able to get past a solid wall impeding your path.</p>

  <p>In the full game, due out March 13, you’ll then spend a fair while with this little guy and his challenges, learning the neat tricks the game has to offer like falling vertically from one piece to the next, or snatching pieces away just in time such that he lands on their bottom edge before he can fall through to the next. This is then really drummed into you, and for a moment you wonder if this is it, if this is the extent of the game’s ideas, before it suddenly furls like a fabulous flower and reveals six brand new twists on the format, each with not only their own set of challenges, but then paired up to combine their features for even more. So you might now be an alien trying to move around by creating portals that only work when pieces are connected, or the cutest little drill-guy who burrows through lines of rock, then the two combined into some really brain-pushing challenges.</p> <p>The demo that’s out now is smart enough to not just stick with the opening set of puzzles, but instead jumps about a bit, quickly moving on from the king to the princess lady (who in the full game has to deal with puzzles that require some complicated jiggery-pokery to have flat puzzle pieces align rather than the usual fitting of tabs into sockets), and then to the teleporting alien, the drill guy, and finally those two combined. Said demo includes a total of 13 puzzles, and while they likely won’t have you stumped for long, they certainly give you a great idea of what’s on offer here.</p>

 <p>In the full game you’ll be using magic tiles that can copy pieces, two-sided pieces you can flip, rotating pieces…you get the idea. And it gets&nbsp;<em>much</em> tougher as it goes along, offering some properly juicy head-scratchers. We’ll have a full review when the game is properly out, but for now you should know it’s well worth <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3249380/Piece_by_Piece/">checking out the demo and putting on your wishlist</a>.</p>

Martin Schelling, Jean Guesdon, and François de Billy each have experience with various stages of the series' nearly 20-year history, but all three worked on 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins.

<p>Schelling will serve as the Head of Assassin's Creed Brand, which will put him in charge of "overall strategy and long-term vision." He's previously worked as a producer or brand producer at various levels on most games since Revelations, including Black Flag, Origins, and Valhalla. According to LinkedIn, he's worked as Ubisoft's Chief Production Officer since April 2024.</p><p>Guesdon will be the Head of Content, which seems to be the most hands-on out of the three roles. He'll reportedly "lead [the franchise's] creative direction, support individual games, and guide the future of Assassin’s Creed." He was the creative director of both Black Flag and Origins, though he left Ubisoft from 2023 to mid 2024 to work at Behaviour Interactive, a studio best known for Dead by Daylight.</p><p>Finally, de Billy is the new Head of Production Excellence, tasked with broadly strengthening production practices across Vantage's various Assassin's Creed projects. He was a production designer on Origins and Valhalla, but has worked at Ubisoft since 2001, and currently is its Global Senior Production Director.</p><p>We enjoyed Shadows, the most recent entry in the Assassin's Creed series (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows/dont-stop-me-naoe-because-im-having-a-good-time">and you can read our review of it here</a>). We're still waiting to see what exactly Ubisoft has in mind for the popular historical fiction franchise moving forward, but the last entry is less than a year old, so it'll likely be a while. But while we haven't heard about Assassin's Creed, its parent company has been in the news a lot in 2026, and not for good reasons.

<h2 id="why-return-to-ashes-of-the-singularity-now">Why Return to Ashes of the Singularity Now</h2>



<p><strong>It's been several years since the first Ashes of the Singularity. A year and a half ago, you released a game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ara-history-untold-all-nothing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ara: History Untold</a>. Why was this the right time to get back to Ashes for you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Adrian, you want to field that one?</p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> Yeah. As we were finishing up and looking at our next project, considering where we were at, it just made sense for us to go back and revisit Ashes. Ashes has had a really good following. A lot of folks have joined the Discord community and are really excited about Ashes 2 coming out. For us, you know, we have our own proprietary engine, and games like Ashes just really allow us to push that even further. So Ashes just made a lot of sense when we were figuring out what our next project would be.</p>



<h2 id="evolution-from-benchmark-to-gameplay-first">An Evolution From Benchmark to Gameplay-First</h2>



<p><strong>One of the distinguishing features of Ashes of the Singularity was that, for a time (and perhaps even still to this day), it was one of the most benchmarked games. It was the first game to use DirectX 12, so it was quite important from a technical point of view. Now that it's been 10 years, how do you plan to evolve this legacy? Do you still plan to rely heavily on being a new technical benchmark, or are you perhaps more focused on gameplay this time around?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> We're much more focused on the game and gameplay for the second one. Not that we won't push the boundaries, and we certainly have a benchmark that folks can use, but it's really more important to us that the game is really, really solid and fun to play. That's the number one driver for this game, not solely being a benchmark.</p>

<h2 id="scale-and-unit-count-thousands-on-screen">Scale and Unit Count: Thousands on Screen</h2>



<p><strong>Even so, how did the tech evolve compared to the first one? Can you do more things now? One of the main features of the first game was its support for thousands of units. Are you still looking to maintain that scale, or even expand it, in Ashes of the Singularity II?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Absolutely. From a technology standpoint, the engine has evolved a lot. Ashes of the Singularity 1 was built on what we can kind of think of as Nitrous Engine 1.0. The engine evolved from&nbsp;Ashes of the Singularity 1&nbsp;to&nbsp;Ara: History Untold, and now to Ashes of the Singularity II. What we're actually working with is an evolved version of the Ara engine. So it's a substantial improvement technologically over both what was in Ashes 1 and even another jump up over what we had available in Ara.</p>



<p>From a rendering standpoint, we're still focusing on large maps and large worlds with vast quantities of units, buildings, characters, and detail. If you've seen the "living world" aspects of Ara, we've brought a lot of that technology forward into Ashes of the Singularity<em> </em>II to make the maps a lot more interesting, livable, and believable, while still maintaining the scope and scale from Ashes 1 where you can just have a vast number of units on screen.</p>



<p>The focus of Ashes of the Singularity II from the get-go has been to be a real-time strategy game of scale, and we needed the technology to be able to power that. We didn't want to just have fights between 10 units per player. We wanted an order of magnitude greater than that. We wanted 100 units versus 100 units. And then we wanted to have battles with multiple players all throwing units at each other across vast, sprawling maps. So you could do an eight-player game where each player is managing well over a hundred individual units at the same time, if not 200 to 300. You wind up with multiple thousands of units at any given time on some of the larger battles.</p>



<p>We set out from the ground up to say this is the goal. We don't want an engine like a first-person shooter engine, which deals with a small number of high-fidelity characters. We need the ability to do high-quality characters that we can render in the tens, hundreds, and thousands all on screen at the same time, running very well on both modern PCs and reasonably older PCs. I don't know if a machine that came out as far back as Ashes 1 will run Ashes 2 as well, but we will be able to support hardware as low-end as the Steam Deck, for example. The Steam Deck is sort of our min-spec hardware target, and we're expecting the game to play well on it. We have a high degree of customization on our graphics options, everything from resolution to various features, so we support a wide degree of scalability. We wanted to ensure our high-end settings, the things that we would use for a benchmark, are also pushed pretty high. If you want to run the game at 4K with a lot of graphics settings, you will push almost any modern hardware. But if you want to run it on a low-power GPU device like the Steam Deck, you absolutely can.</p>



<h2 id="system-requirements-and-hardware-scalability">System Requirements and Hardware Scalability</h2>



<p><strong>I saw that you've already listed the system requirements on Steam. Are those accurate, or are they still subject to revision?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Expect some small revisions there. We're in the midst right now of doing a lot of broad-scale hardware compatibility and performance testing. We expect a lot of optimizations over the next several months, and a lot of the data we get from Steam Next Fest will help us better optimize and understand people's hardware configurations. It varies a lot on PC, and we want to understand what we need to do and how to best target graphic settings for it.</p>



<p>So, it's a reasonable spot for what we have listed as the Steam hardware recommendations. I won't say those are final, though, because we hope to get them even lower realistically depending on how performance optimizations go. We'd love to push it lower, but we always want to list a safe cut-off so that we're not encouraging people with very old PCs to jump in and struggle to play it.</p>

<h2 id="dx12-features-no-ray-tracing-hdr-modern-graphics-tech">DX12 Features (But No Ray Tracing or HDR) &amp; Modern Graphics Tech</h2>



<p><strong>Does Ashes of the Singularity II<em> </em>support ray tracing? If not, do you think it would even make sense in a real-time strategy game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dan Baker:</strong> We had some promising ray tracing experiments, but at the scale of our game, it was simply too slow for the visual payoff. Ray tracing becomes significantly more expensive when everything in your scene is in motion or can be deformed. With the number of objects that can be on-screen, it can consume an enormous amount of GPU memory as well. The most appealing benefit for an RTS would be the ability to properly shadow the many thousands of point, line, and area lights.</p>



<p><strong>Will the game support HDR displays? If not, can you explain why?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dan Baker:</strong> No, we don’t have official support. Unfortunately, only a small portion of our players have HDR displays. Moreover, an RTS game requires quite a bit of tuning to both look excellent and play well.</p>



<ol></ol>



<div><p><strong>Are you using any of the latest DX12 features, such as Opacity Micro-Maps (OMM), Work Graphs, and Tiled Resource Tier 4? Which one do you think will be more impactful in the coming years?</strong></p><p><strong>Dan Baker:</strong> We aren’t using these specific features, but we are using many of the newer shader model features, such as the new wave intrinsics. Though these are a little bit older features at this point, we also make heavy use of enhanced 16-bit float support and bindless textures to improve performance.</p></div>



<p>As for Work Graphs, we are not using them because we have implemented our own subset internally. After consultation with IHVs, it was unclear if the native support would be significantly faster than our current implementation. Additionally, we would still need our current implementation for older hardware anyway (e.g., GTX 970 or RX 580). However, we’ve given the IHVs access to our code so they can experiment with it for future architectures.</p>



<p>In terms of the most impactful, it’s hard to say. Unfortunately, Tiled Resource Tier 4 is difficult to use properly on a PC architecture, so we don’t think that it will have a huge impact. Work Graphs definitely have the potential to be most impactful, but will likely need a generation or two of hardware advancements to really see the benefit.</p>



<ol start="2"></ol>



<h2 id="console-and-steam-deck-potential">Steam Deck and Console Potential</h2>



<p><strong>Just one last question on the technical side. Are you open to potential console releases for Ashes of the Singularity II, or is it just a PC game in your mind?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> I mean, we would love it to be everywhere. The core goal for us is to make sure that the gameplay works for everybody. Brad mentioned the Steam Deck. If you're a PC player who's played RTS games, you'll have all the plethora of keybinds and shortcuts that you're used to, but it's also playable with a controller on the Steam Deck as well.</p>



<p><strong>Gabriela Leskur:</strong> Yeah. Coming from the experience lens, from the very beginning of the creation of this sequel, we wanted to be able to validate that the game could be played both on a controller/gamepad as well as keyboard and mouse. That's something we've done to future-proof it in case that comes to pass and we do move to console. But for now, the proof of that is evident in our work on the Steam Deck. We do test on controllers, so that's something we've kept in mind to keep ourselves open to that possibility.</p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> And I think the biggest thing there is to ensure we do not lose functionality just because we want to be on a different platform. The core PC experience is the core SKU. As we look at making the user experience work for the Steam Deck or other platforms, we don't want to lose functionality. We want it to be playable and be a really good RTS game.</p>

<h2 id="ai-improvements-and-difficulty-scaling">AI Improvements and Difficulty Scaling</h2>



<p><strong>Okay. Can you speak about the improvements made to the AI compared to the first game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Certainly. In terms of how we use it, we use player-replacement AI. If you want to play a single-player game, we have multiple modes. There's a campaign mode, which is a narrative, story-driven mode. And then we have a sandbox-style skirmish mode where you can currently play against up to seven different AIs. You can do friendly teams, asymmetric matches, free-for-all, whatever you would like to set up.</p>



<p>We spent a lot of time getting the AI functional pretty early and ensuring that it was a reasonable competitive challenge for a typical player, trying to scale it up and down for both hardened RTS veterans and players who are very unfamiliar with RTS games. If you've never played an RTS before, we have very easy modes that will help you ramp up and give you a lot of breathing room to explore and feel out the game, and then you can graduate through the different difficulties.</p>



<p>In general, we think they're pretty competitive. We've run tests where the AI is playing with no cheats enabled (it has no insider knowledge about the map), and it plays the game fairly. Right now, it's quite competent at beating a lot of the office staff here at Oxide. A lot of the staff struggle against the default regular AI. If you're a hardened RTS veteran, you can probably take it out thanks to memory knowledge and understanding how to play RTS games well. We also have difficulties that go beyond that, which try to make the AI smarter, and then ones that just outright let it have economic advantages if you want to set yourself up for a very unfair, hard challenge.</p>



<p>We're actually reasonably proud of it. We started with it early, we've been iterating on it over the last several months, and it's playing very well. A number of the core gameplay changes in Ashes of the Singularity II actually facilitate making the AI play better. It's not done, and we know there are more improvements to make, but we think players will be very challenged by just the default AI going into Steam Next Fest.</p>



<h2 id="the-three-factions-uef-phc-and-substrate">The Three Factions: UEF, PHC, and Substrate</h2>



<p><strong>One of the sequel's main changes is the addition of the human faction, the UEF (United Earth Forces). Was it an issue at first when you introduced the idea of AI controlling humans because they play differently?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> That's a great question. We actually started off with the human faction since it was brand new. So really, as we were building out the AI early on, it was being built to handle them. It hasn't been a huge issue. You'll see some different types of units for the PHC in the Next Fest build, where they have a lot of bipedal mechs, for instance, and some other more grounded units alongside an old favorite hover unit from the original game.</p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Yeah, we set out to build Ashes of the Singularity II; we weren't trying to make Ashes 1.5. It's a pretty ground-level change-up. We knew that the AI was going to have to be rebuilt. It's not the same AI that was present in Ashes 1. As we were exploring what we thought would be the units and the buildings for all the factions (the UEF, the PHC, and the Substrate), we tried to approach everything holistically. We needed an AI that could play all three factions, and we needed gameplay systems that worked for their unique unit rosters. We built them somewhat sequentially: we built the UEF, then we built the PHC, and the Substrate will be available for the full launch after Steam Next Fest, but the entire game was structured so that the AI and systems could support all of them.</p>



<p><strong>What are the main differences between these three factions from a gameplay perspective?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> We can talk about the two factions that will be in the Steam Next Fest demo. We kind of want to hold back on revealing too much about the third faction for now. Brett, I'll let you go into more detail on the first two.</p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Sure. The two factions available for Steam Next Fest are the UEF and the PHC (Post-Human Coalition). The UEF is the new faction for Ashes of the Singularity II. They are a faction of united humans from Earth working against the posthumans and the AI Substrate. Their forces are comprised largely of near-future semi-conventional military units. They have access to infantry, near-future modern armor, tank destroyers, artillery units, etc. They also have access to a few "prototype" units, which are more scientifically advanced. </p>



<p>Throughout the course of the campaign, they start to adopt and steal technologies from the more advanced PHC and Substrate and incorporate them into their arsenals. The UEF is organized around standard tech and generally favors quantity over quality. They use a lot of infantry in the early game to seize territory, and their equipment is not the best, but they pump out a lot of it and can overwhelm enemies with numbers.</p>



<p><strong>Gabriela Leskur:</strong><span> What I might add there is that you've probably noticed in the promotional material that the human faction does, in fact, have humans on the ground.</span> There are infantry units comprised of human beings, which is unique to the UEF faction.</p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Yeah, and that's a noticeable difference from Ashes 1, which featured the PHC and Substrate, both with a lot of hovercrafts and flying units. There wasn't a whole lot of bipedal units. The UEF units are generally conventional wheeled or tracked vehicles. We have far more ground locomotion-based units here in Ashes<em> </em>of the Singularity II, and we've done great things to make that look cool, like having tanks drive through trees and knock them over.</p>



<p>Conversely, the PHC is sort of like the "tech bro" faction. They consist of a very small number of posthumans, and each one is very powerful. They control an army of drones that we call constructs. Their units skew towards being far more expensive and fewer in number. The PHC takes pride in their creations and wants everything to be the best, the shiniest, and the strongest. Their units are tougher and have more powerful weaponry than their UEF analogues. </p>



<p>They don't field infantry; their cheapest unit is really more of a light tank called the Brute, produced in far fewer numbers than the UEF infantry. They don't have the swarm tactics of the UEF, making some of their units vulnerable to being swarmed, but they have returning units that are adept at countering infantry. The PHC will also feature fan favorites like the Hyperion, which is now a true flying dreadnought—quite powerful, scary, and very challenging to take down.</p>



<p>Narratively, it's been 10 years in real life since the last game came out, and a little bit of time has passed in the in-world timeline as well. If you remember the end of Ashes 1: Escalation, there is mistrust now between Haalee (the Substrate) and the PHC. It makes narrative sense that you would see the posthumans adapt and update their technology because it used to be heavily influenced by Haalee, who is now seen as an enemy by some of them.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ashes2_feb_ss05-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="apm-army-system-and-accessibility">APM, Army System, and Accessibility</h2>



<p><strong>Where do you think the game sits on the APM (Actions Per Minute) spectrum compared to the first one? Is it faster-paced, slower-paced, or about the same?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Ashes 1 was a pretty high APM game given the scale, the number of units, workers, and buildings you had to manage. It followed the legacy of games like <em>Total Annihilation</em> through <em>Supreme Commander</em>. It was a high APM game, perhaps not quite as high as <em>StarCraft 2</em> at a competitive level, but still high.</p>



<p>With Ashes of the Singularity<em> </em>II, we are putting in a lot of affordances and control updates that allow you to play the game with a lower APM floor. The ceiling is still fairly high if you want to be tactical, but the army system has been completely reimagined. It's an entirely new system that is core to how you build and recruit units. The goal was to make it so that you can experience these awesome huge battles with a thousand units on screen without needing a very high APM. </p>



<p>You don't have to constantly recruit, lasso five new units, put them in a control group, and move them around. The army system and the warfront system softly automate a lot of those functions. It handles reinforcement automatically. We've put out some developer journals illustrating these changes. It makes it so anyone, even players with low APM or low RTS experience, can enjoy the game. It also makes it very playable on a gamepad. If you want to go APM wild and get into detailed tactical micromanagement, you still can, but the "APM tax" required to play large-scale games previously has been solved.</p>



<p><strong>Gabriela Leskur:</strong> I would just underline the importance of player empowerment. If you are someone who loves micro, our system is set up so you can have dozens of armies with only a few units within them, which replicates the feel of Ashes 1. But the new army system also allows you to group a lot of units into one central control group in a way that can be replenished automatically if you choose.</p>



<h2 id="gamepad-vs-keyboard-and-mouse">Gamepad vs Keyboard and Mouse</h2>



<p><strong>Since you're running internal tests, do you think an experienced player on a gamepad can beat a less experienced player on keyboard and mouse, or will they still be destroyed?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Absolutely. An experienced gamepad player would be able to beat a newer, less experienced person playing on keyboard and mouse. There's a bigger demand for strategic thinking in <em>Ashes 2</em> than in a lot of other games. It's about managing warfronts, positioning, and timing. Those core strategic decisions are reasonably efficient to do with both a gamepad and a keyboard/mouse. There is definitely still an advantage at the tactical, micromanagement level that favors keyboard and mouse because you can get higher APMs, but that's not where we sink much of our gameplay. We're not a game about stutter-stepping 10 units back and forth every quarter of a second to eke out extra DPS. Strategic decisions decide a game of <em>Ashes 2</em>. Between two equally highly skilled players, I would give the edge to the keyboard and mouse player due to flexibility, but at the strategic level, a good strategic player on a gamepad will beat a weak strategic player on a keyboard and mouse.</p>



<p><strong>Good to know, because nowadays I prefer playing on a gamepad; it's a lot more accessible.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> We've been playing on Steam Deck for months now to ensure it's very playable. All the core strategic functions are highly accessible on a gamepad.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ashes2_feb_ss02-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="modding-support">Modding Support</h2>



<p><strong>Modding was quite important for the first game. How did you approach it for the second one? Are you going to support Steam Workshop eventually?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> We haven't announced any formal plans for what we will support with modding at launch, but the engine, especially where we're at with Nitrous, is very moddable. We have a lot of things that are highly exposed and easily accessible on the data end, and we use a combination of Lua and XML for a lot of our interface elements. There's definitely more than basic ability to do great mods for it. We also have a cool scenario editor. How much in-engine support we will have natively out of the box is still TBD, but it's an extension of the Nitrous 1 engine, so it's just as moddable as Ashes 1 was, if not better. It's very easy for people to mod stuff through Lua, XML, and data setups. We've even had internal alpha testers already modify data locally just to try different configurations and setups out.</p>



<p><strong>Okay. Well, thank you very much for the answers.</strong></p>

			<p>Publisher <strong>Nacon</strong> will host its next <strong>Nacon Connect</strong> event next week on <strong>March 4, 2026,</strong> at <strong>11am PT / 2pm ET / 7pm BT</strong>. A press release for the event doesn't identify how long it will be, but it does tease new looks at upcoming titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/edge-of-memories-is-a-new-japanese-inspired-action-rpg-from-the-edge-of-eternity-devs-out-in-q4-2025/">Edge of Memories</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mound-omen-of-cthulhu-gameplay-nacon-ace-team/">The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cthulhu-the-cosmic-abyss-gameplay-trailer-ahead-of-steam-next-fest-demo/">Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</a></strong>.</p>



<p>The press release also adds that "<em>This key event will highlight the publisher-developer's future releases as well as the latest from its accessories department</em>," so we know we won't just be hearing about new games from Nacon; we'll also get an update on what's new from its <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en-US/peripherals">accessories line</a>.</p>



<p>Of the games mentioned in the press release, the only one with a release date is Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss (which also has a <strong>Steam Next Fest</strong> demo you can try), while the rest of what's shown in the teaser trailer are games we've already seen from Nacon, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-blades-of-greed-review-a-sandbox-goblin-adventure/"><strong>Styx: Blads of Greed,</strong></a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/"><strong>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</strong>.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>On February 19, developer Mega Crit finally announced that</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-steam-trailer-2000671424"><i><span>Slay the Spire 2</span></i><span> has a release date</span></a><span>: March 5. For those of us who would gladly sell a kidney to get our hands on the sequel to the best roguelike deckbuilder ever made (sorry, </span><i><span>Balatro</span></i><span>), this is incredible news. For every indie dev who was inspired to make a roguelike deckbuilder of their own following the original game’s success, however, this is potentially awful news, as </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2’s</span></i><span> early access release date is smack dab in the middle of one of the busiest release periods of the year. <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-delayed-silksong-hollowknight-demonschool-baby-steps-cloverpit-2000620407">It’s <em>Silksong</em> all over again</a>, and games that were set to release around that time are now moving out of the way.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The most well-publicized delay so far is </span><i><span>Handmancers</span></i><span>, a roguelike deckbuilder from developer and publisher 58BLADES. As the devs revealed in a post on </span><a href="https://x.com/Handmancers/status/2025236242204336358"><span>X</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Handmancers </span></i><span>was supposed to release during the Turn-Based Thursday Fest, a seven-day-long yearly event that’s scheduled to begin </span><a href="https://turnbasedfest.com/"><span>on March 6</span></a><span>. Considering that it starts a day after </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2’s</span></i><span> March 5 release date, this one feels like a smart call. “Yea…we’d get absolutely crushed,” the team wrote.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The developers behind </span><i><span>Mini Tank Mayhem</span></i><span>, a tower defense and deck-building strategy game from Algorocks, have yet to confirm exactly why their game has suddenly been delayed. However, an apparent tester </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1rbg1ps/comment/o6qrfg7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>on Reddit claimed</span></a><span>&nbsp;that </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2</span></i><span> is indeed to blame. While a random comment on Reddit is obviously not the most reliable source, the timing of </span><i><span>Mini Tank Mayhem’s</span></i><span> sudden delay is awfully suspicious. Its </span><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2096260/history/?changeid=U:73009738"><span>SteamDB history confirms</span></a><span> that its 3 March, 2026 release date was pushed back to April 30 (and then changed again to April 29) mere hours after </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2’s</span></i><span> latest trailer dropped.</span></p> <p><i><span>Omelet You Cook</span></i><span>, a “cozy chaotic cooking roguelike” published by SchuBox Games, was ahead of the curve. The two-man dev team responsible for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-meets-luck-be-a-landlord-in-chaotic-cooking-roguelike-that-cant-stop-winning-new-fans-2000668754">excellent <em>Balatro-</em>like food prep game</a> </span><span>decided to move up its 1.0 launch back in January. As confirmed by co-developer Dan Schumacher during an interview with </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/slay-the-spire-2-pulls-a-silksong-scares-indie-devs-into-releasing-roguelike-ahead-of-schedule-in-fear-of-losing-players-to-an-absolute-juggernaut-in-our-own-genre/"><i><span>GamesRadar</span></i></a><span>, they pulled it forward out of fear that they’d be overshadowed by </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2’s</span></i><span> yet-to-be confirmed (at the time) March release window. “Every streamer we’d reach out to will be playing it. Every roguelike enjoyer will be checking it out. Even I’ll be playing so much that I won’t have time to finish our game!”</span></p>

 <p><span>While no other devs have yet publicly announced any </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2</span></i><span>-related delays, it’s clearly become a popular topic of discussion among indie studios. Bermrad, the studio behind the hack-and-slash roguelite </span><i><span>Trials of Valor</span></i><span>, noted that their game sharing “some elements with </span><i><span>Slay the Spire</span></i><span>” was less of an issue than the release date itself. Unfortunately, the two games </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1r9e5vd/were_releasing_the_same_day_as_slay_the_spire_2/"><span>now share</span></a><span> the same release date, as Bermrad announced roughly three weeks ago that </span><i><span>Trials of Valor </span></i><span>will be dropping on March 5.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Other studios have instead chosen to have a little fun with the increased attention on early March’s release lineup. </span><i><span>Grimslair</span></i><span>’s </span><span>developer, ThunderRam Studios, revealed on </span><a href="https://x.com/AWMassMedia/status/2025638786454233168?s=20"><span>X</span></a><span> that there will be “no hiding in the bushes until the hype train passes,” as the studio intends to stick to its previously announced March 6 release date. Fishagon, who are working on the party card game </span><i><span>Vice Versa</span></i><span>, opted to copy and paste 58BLADES’ announcement and swap it out </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/1rbnq5n/handmancers_release_date_announcement_forces_vice/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>with references to their game</span></a><span> instead. </span></p> <p>Games have tried ride the hype wave for a top Steam release before. <span>It’s essentially what the developers behind the decent Metroidvania <i>Adventure of</i><em> Samsara</em> did last year, launching on the same day as<em> Silksong</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-atari-adventure-of-samsara-2000624067">It did not go well</a>. Other studios, fortunately, have been spared from making that choice themselves. </span><i>Slumber Realm</i>’s devs, Chugga Chugga LLC, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videogames/comments/1rb638e/another_slay_the_spire_2_related_announcement/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">announced</a> that their card game roguelike won’t be ready in time to compete with <i>Slay the Spire 2</i> anyway, or, as they put it, “I guess in every sense it has no impact.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-explains-why-clouds-hair-looks-rough-on-switch-2-2000672823</link>
            <guid>1444075</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last month, Square Enix released <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-the-kotaku-review-1842697312">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a></em> on Nintendo Switch 2. The port of the 2020 RPG was <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-handheld-performance-2000661851">well-received</a>, with many praising the game’s clarity and performance. But there was one aspect of <em>FF7 Remake</em> that annoyed some players: Cloud’s famous luxurious hair could look fuzzy or pixelated at times. Well, in a new interview, the game’s director has explained <em>thoroughly</em> why this is the case, and said that it might be a problem in future<em> FF7</em> remake trilogy ports on Switch 2 as well.</p>  <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/interviewsjp/ff7-20260223-423487/">In an interview posted on February 23, <em>Automaton</em></a> talked to <em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</em>&nbsp;director Naoki Hamaguchi about the Switch 2 port of the RPG. Specifically, they asked him about Cloud’s pixelated hair. Instead of just saying, “Hey, guys, the Switch 2 isn’t as beefy as a high-end PC or PS5, so we had to make some compromises,” the director behind the remake provided a very detailed response. Here’s some of it via Google Translate:</p>

 <blockquote><p><span dir="auto">“In <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, we use a process called TAA (Temporal Anti-Aliasing) to prevent the outlines of characters from appearing jagged. TAA is a system that creates smoother images that are closer to high resolution by referencing and overlaying information from past frames in addition to the currently drawn frame. </span><span dir="auto">Hair is a very thin component, so if you draw it as is, it’s easy for each dot to appear or disappear. That’s why in this game, we use a special process that switches between drawing and not drawing hair on a dot-by-dot basis for each frame. By combining this process with TAA, we make it so that the fine hair lines appear to connect smoothly across frames.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>Got all that? Hamaguchi then explained that when the Switch 2 is in portable mode, there are “<span dir="auto">additional restrictions.” This forces the game to lower its internal resolution to ensure solid performance. But doing this makes it harder for TAA to create a stable image, leading to the “graininess and jaggedness” of Cloud’s hair. But because <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/i-adore-final-fantasy-7-remakes-dorky-eco-terrorists-1842843860">FF7 Remake</a></em> on Switch 2 uses a dynamic resolution system, his hair can look worse or better depending on the scene.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>Cloud’s fuzzy, pixelated hair is likely to return in <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Switch 2</em></h2> <p>So hopefully, that explains why Cloud’s hair is a bit pixelated in the Switch 2 port. As for the upcoming Switch 2 port of 2024’s <em>Rebirth</em>, which is set to arrive in June, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4-ue5-gen-ai-2000663075">the third and final entry in the project releasing sometime in the future</a>, Hamaguchi made it clear that you’ll probably see some fuzzy Cloud hair in those releases, too.</p>

 <p><span dir="auto">“Yes, on the Nintendo Switch 2, in order to stabilize the frame rate, the internal resolution is lowered in scenes with a high load, and DLSS compensates for that,” the director told the outlet. “This is a basic mechanism that is not compatible with current hair rendering technology.”</span></p>

 <p>But Hamaguchi says that being able to play <em>FF7 Remake</em> on the go is worth the trade-off of some elements, like Cloud’s hair, being a bit fuzzy, adding, <span dir="auto">“There are limitations unique to portable devices, but we will continue to do our best to continue optimizing it so that we can improve it even if only a little.”</span></p> <p>I genuinely love that the director didn’t offer up some boring PR quote about the hair, but dug into how it works and why it looks that way. Making games is, like playing games, a series of decisions and trade-offs. Considering how great<em> FF7 Remake</em> runs and plays on Switch 2, I think some fuzzy hair is a fine compromise, even if Cloud might disagree.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Masks, Rituals, Nuclear Strikes, and CRT Televisions – How ZA/UM Created the Spy World of Zero Parades]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/masks-rituals-nuclear-strikes-and-crt-televisions-how-zaum-created-the-spy-world-of-zero-parades</link>
            <guid>1444060</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">“Zero Parades is ultimately about identity,” explains Kaspar Tamsalu, art director at developer ZA/UM. “The conflict between what you subscribe to as an individual, as a private person outside of the professional sphere, and then how that mixes with what your vocation is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your vocation in ZA/UM’s latest RPG is espionage. Hershel Wilk, your protagonist, is a spy for The Superbloc, a union of left-wing republics. She was born bourgeois before ending up spying for the communists, a background story intentionally filled with blanks to allow you to shape Hershel as you see fit.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Just because she's from a communist country does not mean that she subscribes to the ideology,” says Siim "Kosmos" Sinamäe, Zero Parades’ principal writer. “This is up to the player to decide. Spies can be spies for ideology, for money, for a sense of accomplishment, or because they are batshit insane and want to do things like that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sinamäe quickly offers an example of the latter: “I'm going to subscribe to this thought called Unguided Missile Strikes, because I want to say violent things to people. I want to threaten people with nuclear strikes, because that's the type of spy I am.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When Sinamäe says “subscribe to this thought”, he’s referring to Zero Parades’ Conditioning system, which reformats Disco Elysium’s Thought Cabinet for an espionage setting. When exploring the world and talking with characters, you’ll encounter new ideas and concepts you can “subscribe” to, rewriting your personality to unlock new dialogue options and roleplaying opportunities. But where ZA/UM’s previous game explored what it would be like for an alcoholic amnesiac detective to soak up ideas like a sponge, Zero Parades approaches the mind of a spy like a collection of masks. Which one is required for today’s task? This required a new method for thought subscription. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You get the choice about whether or not you want to reinforce or punish the thought,” explains Nicolas Pirot, Zero Parades’ lead technical artist. “You have a branching option of, ‘I don't like this. I don't want that to be a part of myself. I was always a violent spy. I no longer want to be a violent spy.’ You can resist that, and then that'll have a different impact on the way you do things.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's really framed as this violent reordering of your mind,” he concludes. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">It’s All in Your Head</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That violent reordering is viewed through the flickering glass screen of an old CRT television. Much of Zero Parades’ in-world technology is modelled after the gizmos and appliances of the 1990s – down at the Bootleg Bazaar, you’ll find vinyl records housed in plastic cartridges in an analogue echo of Sony’s old MiniDisc format. This approach extends past the boundaries of reality and into Hershel’s psyche. The art team needed something functional but flawed to represent this spy’s troubled mind – a mind that could tune itself into dangerous thoughts and settle into uncomfortable programming. And so the Conditioning system’s menu sits inside that box of cathode rays.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's in an imperfect state,” explains Maeve Bonefacic, a technical artist at ZA/UM who helped create the system’s look and feel. “In the sense that [the television] works, it does, but there's a slight imperfection to that tool. We worked a lot on the particular glitches and effects that a CRT might have.”</p><p>I want to threaten people with nuclear strikes, because that's the type of spy I am.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The CRT is just one example of Zero Parades’ fascinating, two-pronged approach to art design. There’s the physical – the environments you explore, the people you meet, the items you acquire – and then there’s the creations of Hershel’s mind, represented by the wild art cards assigned to each quest, the disturbing televised thoughts assessed through Conditioning, and the badges assigned to your sentient skills. ZA/UM describes this approach as representing the two realms that Hershel exists in: the objective and subjective. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The subjective side of Hershel’s reality is spearheaded by lead illustrator Anton Vill, who created the surrealist artwork for Disco Elysium, including its grotesque Thought Cabinet. Once again, he took inspiration from the work of David Lynch, particularly the ominous tone of Twin Peaks’ dark forests, reflecting the messed-up thoughts of a broken character in his bizarre, twisted, emotionally heavy artwork. In one example, a collection of five, cigarette-smoking Hershel doppelgangers face each other in an unnerving pentagon as words of insecurity, such as “abandoner”, “liar”, and “f***ing spy”, hover above them on flowing reams of paper. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm a huge fan of this kind of mysterious, dark, inner world of a person,” says Vill. “I think that shines through [in Zero Parades’ subjective artwork] and I think it’s perfect for the game.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Portofiran Identity</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While the art team understandably wanted to create a sense of warped darkness for Hershel’s interior thoughts, it needed to create a complementary vibe for the physical world. It would need to be via different techniques, though, so that subjective thoughts didn’t merge with objective reality. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We try to subtly inject this unease for the players,” says Tamsalu. “There is a lot of detail that we put into the game, but the way we have textured these [details], and how we approach lighting for the scenes and set up these situations, there is this underlying current of something brewing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This thing that is brewing is, of course, why Hershel is in the city of Portofiro. But her job is very unlike that of Disco Elysium’s disaster cop protagonist, and the espionage story Zero Parades tells had a significant influence on the way the city was designed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you’re a police officer looking into a crime, anybody who's in the vicinity is a potential suspect and expected to speak with you,” Tamsalu explains. “And in a spy game, it's kind of like the inverse of that. You don't want to stand out. And because of that, we needed to create a slightly busier backdrop. That's why you have these characters that go about their own business, and you have your own covert business as you navigate through that.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Zero Parades: For Dead Spies - Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While capturing the heart of spy fiction has been an important part of the project, ZA/UM has been very intentional with how it has approached a genre filled with tropes, staples, and conventions. As you’d expect from the studio, this isn’t a James Bond or Jason Bourne adventure, but nor does it aspire to be a John le Carré novel repackaged as a video game. This had to be a fresh take on this shadowy world, and so a number of rules have been set in place. For instance, Herschel is an “operant”, rather than an agent. Her mission takes her “in-theatre” rather than in the field. And her employer, the communist Superbloc, flips the typical capitalist nation perspective of classic Cold War thrillers.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We wanted to avoid the obvious spy themes,” says character artist Liis Väljaots, who explained how this philosophy extended into the art. “One of the things we wanted to avoid was making the world look too noir-y and too oppressive, to kind of contrast the subject matter, which is quite serious.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are a lot of trench coats in the game, though,” she laughs. “That's undeniable.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Roll Play</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Your choice to wear a trench coat or not is just one of many decisions that shape the kind of spy you are – clothing, as in Disco Elysium, provides stat modifiers that boost or inflict penalties on your skills. That pool of skills has been reduced (now 15, down from Disco’s 24) with the idea of making each attribute more prominent and viable. They’ll also be tested with much more frequency. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have a skill check every 3,000 words, compared to Disco Elysium’s every 6,000 words,” reveals Sinamäe. “We feel this makes the player more engaged with what they're doing and what type of spy they want to be.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I explored in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zero-parades-hands-on-preview-a-complex-spy-rpg-hiding-in-one-giant-shadow">IGN’s hands-on preview of Zero Parades</a>, skill checks have deeper mechanical complexity this time around thanks to the Pressures system. Each of your skills fits into one of three categories – athletic, psychological, and intellectual - and those categories have corresponding “health” bars that measure your fatigue, anxiety, and delirium levels. Fail a psychological skill check and your anxiety bar will fill. Max the bar out, and you’ll take a permanent stat penalty. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things are made even more interesting by the ability to “exert” a skill check – you can roll an extra die to increase your chances of passing the check, but at the cost of purposefully damaging the skill’s corresponding pressure bar.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's like, how much more can the player take?,” says Bonefacic. “Can I afford to, for example, exert a dice roll? Am I allowed to do that? Do I have the resources to do that? I think it has added an interesting element of strategy.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/23/unguided-missile-strikes-zero-parades-1771856619109.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">That strategy wouldn’t work if there were no method for reducing your pressure gauges. By default, a bar will reset after taking so much damage that you endure a stat penalty, but that’s hardly an approach to build a self-care system around. Instead, you can have Hershel perform a ritual. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rituals are a system that we have where you can reduce your pressures by doing all kinds of small things in the world,” explains Pirot. “It can be sitting on a bench and watching the sunrise that might lower your anxiety. It can be smoking a cigarette, having a cup of coffee, or yelling at someone in the street. These very small, very immersive moments, that are available in different parts of the world at different times, that can help an incredibly stressed out, anxious, fatigued, or delirious spy to keep their sanity more or less in check.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather than, say, the classic health potion of other RPGs, which are clearly labelled and a genre staple, you’ll need to discover these rituals through exploration and experimentation. They also unlock further roleplay opportunities – yelling at someone in the street doesn’t exactly sound like a traditional remedy, but for an operant boiling over with rage, it may be very cathartic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“By the player making a build choice of, ‘I want to be a very violent spy’, they would naturally seek out the rituals that complement that,” says Pirot.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rituals, mental masks, blending into busy cities, and threats of nuclear armageddon. These are all important aspects of Zero Parades’ spy fantasy, and each is manifested within the game by a different team at ZA/UM. Writing works alongside artwork and system design to produce a world through which you can observe, bargain, and bully. A world in which you can roleplay the type of spy you think can change the world.
