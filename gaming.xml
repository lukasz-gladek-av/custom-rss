            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In February 2024, Disney <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-a-persistent-universe-in-fortnite-based-on-its-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a $1.5 billion investment in Epic Games to create a persistent universe within Fortnite based on its own franchises: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar, and more.</p>



<p>We later <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-talks-about-disneys-persistent-universe-in-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> a bit about that project from Epic Games Executive Vice President Saxs Persson:</p>



<p><em>Disney wants a persistent place where all things Disney can be there, but they want to be part of an ecosystem we’ve built. We see the power of ecosystems interoperating as being really the magic here. From a player perspective, you want to flow between a Fortnite experience, a Disney experience, or any experience. We see the power of ecosystems interoperating as being really the magic here. From a player perspective, you want to be able to flow between a Fortnite experience, a Disney experience, or any experience really.</em></p>



<p>Now, though, the Wall Street Journal has <a href="https://www.tovima.com/wsj/is-it-still-disney-magic-if-its-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a report</a> that cites anonymous sources within Epic who allegedly are disgruntled with the speed of the collaboration. According to the report, the project is codenamed Bulldog, but it is being slowed down by Disney's requirement for signoffs 'from so many divisions' before proceeding. </p>



<p>However, Epic founder and president Tim Sweeney has countered this claim. Posting on X, he set the record straight on the matter:</p>



<p><em>The anonymous quote is BS. The speed of Disney and Epic collaborations like Darth Vader has been awesome and is around 10x the ordinary speed of media company dealings in this business. We even provided a statement to the writer of this article saying so, but they chose not to print it.</em></p>



<p>Sweeney did not, however, appear to counter the report's claim that the Fortnite x Disney project is targeting a Fall 2026 release window 'at the earliest'. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/genshin-impact-shut-down-playstation-4/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-being-removed-and-support-ending-on-playstation-4.1263087/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The HoYoverse team has announced that support for Genshin Impact on PS4 is being <strong>shut down</strong> and that the game will receive no further updates after April 8th, 2026. It was stressed that this decision was made due to hardware limitations and ‘platform application size’, and that PlayStation 5 support will continue as normal.</p>



<p>From September 10th, 2025, you won’t be able to search for or download Genshin Impact on PlayStation 4.</p>



<p>This decision garnered immediate backlash from the Genshin Impact fanbase still playing on the platform, which launched way back in 2013.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impactful-decision">Impactful Decision</h2>



<p>In a post on the HoYoLab page, the decision to shut down Genshin Impact on PlayStation 4 was unveiled:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your continued support and love for Genshin Impact on PS4! Due to limitations related to hardware performance and platform application size, we will be discontinuing support and updates for Genshin Impact on PS4 in future versions.</p>



<p>Genshin Impact on PS5 will continue to operate normally and is not affected by the removal and update discontinuation on PS4. Traveler will still be able to enjoy the latest content updates on PS5 and other supported platforms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was then stressed that the removal of Genshin Impact will unravel across three phases on PS4:</p>



<ul>
<li>Game Removal (September 10th, 2025) – You will no longer be able to search for or download Genshin Impact on PS4</li>



<li>In-Game Purchases Delisting (February 25th, 2026) – Store purchases for Genshin Impact will be removed from the in-game shop and the PS Store</li>



<li>End of Update Support (April 8th, 2026) – No more updates will be rolled out across Genshin Impact’s PS4 version</li>
</ul>



<p>The article from the HoYoverse team <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained how users</a> can port their progress to other platforms.</p>



<p>In the comment section under the article, the backlash was fairly instant and aggressive, with users branding the decision ‘disgusting’, ‘the biggest middle finger’, and ‘gross and dumb’.</p>



<p>Let me know in the comments if this move will impact you as a Genshin Impact fan.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-and-saints-row-delisted-adult-games-debate/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-and-saints-row-%E2%80%98at-risk%E2%80%99-of-being-delisted-in-adult-games-debate-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1263084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent weeks, few topics in the gaming space have earned as much attention as the ‘adult games debate’. It was recently revealed that payment processors for certain gaming outlets are cracking down on adult and NSFW games, targeting some of the smuttier titles that sit on storefronts like Steam.</p>



<p>It has brought about the rise of some activist actions from the likes of GOG, a storefront that made a bundle of NSFW games free to claim for a short time to protest the ‘financial censorship’ being pushed by some payment providers and processors.</p>



<p>However, it has now been claimed that games such as Grand Theft Auto, Saints Row, and Duke Nukem could be targeted by payment processors, potentially resulting in them being delisted.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-potentially-at-risk">‘Potentially at Risk’</h2>



<p>In an article penned by GamingOnLinux, it was highlighted that a digital retro storefront had been ‘targeted’ by payment processors looking to clamp down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/itch-io-latest-site-strike-down-adult-games-payment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on adult games</a>. The storefront, ZOOM Platform, <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/news/preserving-and-protecting-artistic-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained in a statement</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As you are likely aware, there have been a number of adult title de-listings across the industry. One of our payment processors made us aware that a “fellow member of the industry” was concerned about our content.</p>



<p>We have no plans to remove any titles, and will do absolutely everything in our power to prevent such de-listings. We are fervent supporters of artistic freedom and always will be.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/zoom-platform-also-had-payment-processor-issues-say-they-have-no-plans-to-remove-any-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingOnLinux</a> reportedly received an email from the ZOOM Platform team, explaining that ‘they expect the de-listing situation to expand further.’ It was specifically said that games like ‘Grand Theft Auto, Duke Nukem, and Saints Row were described as <strong>potentially at risk.</strong>‘</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto has long been one of the most controversial franchises in gaming, but the ‘NSFW elements’ of the game only make up a small part of what’s on offer. It’s not one of these smut titles that are hidden in the libraries of some questionable gamers on Steam, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>That being said, the violence, behaviors, and destructive potential of franchises like Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row could be described as gratuitous and harmful to the wrong people, like minors.</p>



<p>Is the answer taking them off the shelves and preventing people from buying them? <strong>Absolutely not.</strong></p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that ZOOM Platform is a retro-focused site, and these claims could be angled towards more classic titles, especially where the likes of Duke Nukem are concerned.</p>

<p>It's been another solid year for arcade racing fans on Nintendo platforms so far, and there's even more to come...</p>
<p>The independent studio 3DCloud has announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/formula_legends">Formula Legends</a> will be racing onto the original Switch later this year on <strong>18th September 2025</strong> for <strong>£19.99 / $19.99 / €19.99</strong>.</p>
<p>This new title, offering a "mixture of arcade and sim-focused racing gameplay" which "emulates the last seventy years" of the world's premier motorsport - including the tracks, drivers, teams, and cars, which are all "playfully inspired by racing's past and present".</p>
<p>There's also a Switch eShop demo "coming later this month", so be on the lookout for that. This demo includes two game modes (custom and time attack), two tracks (Belgium and Hungary), three iconic racing eras, new extreme weather, fully customisable gameplay and new camera modes.</p>
<p>Apart from a Switch release, this title is also coming to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. If we hear anything about a Switch 2 version, we'll let you know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Whether you are on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC, here is everything you need to know about whether Madden 26 is available on your preferred platform or console.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-madden-26-release-exact-release-date-time/#:~:text=Madden%2026%20Release%20Date&amp;text=Madden%2026%20officially%20releases%20on,game%2C%20starting%20on%20August%207." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a> pushes the series forward in new and exciting ways. For <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-gets-gameplay-deep-dive-showcasing-on-field-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay</a>, EA brought over the wear and tear system from College Football 25, and also introduced the Coach DNA system, which mimics real-life playstyle tendancies. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-franchise-deep-dive-shows-new-coaching-updates-gameplan-changes-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Franchise</a>, some of the big new changes include coach archetypes, weekly playsheet updates, a new weekly highlights show, and more. As for&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-presentation-updates-include-updated-gameday-experience-new-mascots-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">presentation</a>, Madden 26 features former NFL legends in stadium pre-game rituals, has licensed more than 40 songs for stadium music, and includes official team mascots. With that all in mind, let’s take a look at which platforms the upcoming game is coming to. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Madden 26 on Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Madden 26 ends a 13 year drought for Nintendo fans. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Madden 26 is available on the Switch 2</strong>, making it the first game in the series available on a Nintendo console since Madden 13 on the Wii and Wii U in 2012. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/gridiron-notes-madden-26-pre-order-details" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA</a> confirmed that Madden 26 on Switch 2 will have all of the same features as other platforms, meaning this isn’t a “lite” version of the game, as we have seen from other stripped down versions of other sports games on the Switch. </p>



<p>That being said, there is a slight visual downgrade compared to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-madden-26-on-switch-2-and-it-didnt-suck/1100-6532037/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamespot</a> reported that the game feels smooth in handheld mode, however it is reported to perform at around 40 frames per-second on the Switch 2 and the menus load slowly. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-playstation-4-and-5">Can You Play Madden 26 on PlayStation 4 and 5?</h2>



<p><strong>Madden 26 is available on PlayStation 5, but is not on PlayStation 4</strong>. This is the first time that a Madden game won’t be on last-gen consoles. </p>



<p>It’s odd that Madden 26 won’t be available on PlayStation 4, because EA is still developing EA FC 26 for PS4. Regardless of the reason, it’s time for previous generation console owners to make the upgrade. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-xbox-one-and-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Madden 26 on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>Like PlayStation, <strong>Madden 26 will be on Xbox Series X|S but not Xbox One</strong>. </p>



<p>On the Xbox Series X, Madden 26 supports 4k Ultra HD, HDR 10, ray tracing, spatial sound, and performs at 60 frames per second or better. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-pc">Can You Play Madden 26 on PC?</h2>



<p>Yes, <strong>PC users can download Madden 26 on Steam or Epic Games</strong>. </p>



<p>EA recommends playing Madden 26 on PC with a controller, and Xbox and DualShock controllers are both supported. It’s unclear if the game will be able to run on a Steam Deck. </p>



<p>Which platform do you plan on playing on? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/is-madden-26-on-nintendo-switch-2-all-platforms-consoles-explained.3201/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>. </p>



<hr>



<p>For more on Madden 26, there was a change to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/change-made-to-madden-26-broadcast-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broadcast team</a>, and all of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-rookie-ratings-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rookie ratings</a> were revealed. </p>

<p>Before pre-ordering Madden 26, it’s worth reviewing every edition and understanding the differences between them. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-madden-26-release-exact-release-date-time/#:~:text=Madden%2026%20Release%20Date&amp;text=Madden%2026%20officially%20releases%20on,game%2C%20starting%20on%20August%207." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a> officially releases soon, meaning you don’t have much longer to take advantage of the pre-order bonuses. Madden is much different than other sports video game franchises because EA develops both Madden and the College Football franchise. </p>



<p>EA used that luxury to its advantage and offered a package that includes both games. Not only that, but you can take the player you created in College Football 26 and continue their journey in Madden 26, after spending four seasons in school. </p>



<h2 id="h-madden-26-pre-order-bonuses">Madden 26 Pre-Order Bonuses</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There are several different coach archetypes in Madden 26. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pre-ordering any edition of&nbsp;Madden 26 comes with a few bonuses, including Franchise Coach Ability Points, a MUT Cover Athlete Elite Player Item, and a Super Star Legendary XP Boost. </p>



<p>Coach Abilities are a new feature in Madden 26, and there are 22 offensive and 24 defensive abilities available at launch. For example, the&nbsp;Trimmed Edges&nbsp;ability gives your offensive tackles an increased chance to win against various pass rush moves, while Sure Hands increases the likelihood of receivers catching passes. Coach Ability Points are used to unlock new abilities. </p>



<p>As the name suggests, the Superstar Legendary XP boost significantly accelerates the amount of XP earned in Superstar mode for your created pro. If you bring over your created player from College Football 26 and combine it with this boost, you will have a massive head start. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-madden-26-editions-amp-prices">All Madden 26 Editions &amp; Prices</h2>



<p>The Standard Edition of College Football 26, priced at $69.99 and this edition includes all of the previously mentioned pre-order bonuses. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Deluxe Edition, priced at $99.99, comes with seven days of early access, Early Access Solo Challenges, and Madden Points to spend in Ultimate Team. </p>



<p>Finally, the MVP Edition costs $149.99. It includes all of the previously mentioned bonuses, as well as the College Football 26 Deluxe Edition, which contains 4600 CUT Points and a Names of the Game Player Item in Ultimate Team. </p>



<p>Each of the editions has a slight price reduction with an EA Play membership, which is included in an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>

<p>Here are the full patch notes</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>When Nintendo launched the Switch 2 earlier this year in June, it also released multiple free game updates for select Switch titles.</p>
<p>One of these updates was for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/game_builder_garage">Game Builder Garage</a> - adding visual optimisations, Joy-Con 2 mouse support and more. Now in a new update, it's rolled out Version 1.1.1. This particular patch tackles some issues when playing this title on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's support page. If there is anything else going on with this latest patch, we'll let you know.</p>
<h2>Game Builder Garage: Ver. 1.1.1 (Released August 5, 2025)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General Fixes</strong></p>
<p>Fixed issues with system functionality when playing using a Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>
<p>Note: An update addressing the issue above is now available for <em>Game Builder Garage: Demo Version</em> as well (Ver. 1.1.1).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>In the previous update, Nintendo also released a patch for the demo version of Game Builder Garage.</p>
<p>These latest updates for Game Builder Garage also happen to tie in with the four year anniversary. In June, the game's community even held an unofficial 'Direct' presentation, showcasing the many games and demos made within the software. You can see more in the video above and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/game-builder-garage-fan-made-direct-reveals-multiple-amazing-new-creations-alongside-switch-2-update">our previous story</a>.</p>

<p>This patch for Game Builder Garage follows an update to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> earlier today.</p>

<p>Here are the official patch notes, courtesy of Nintendo's support page. If we find out about anything else going on behind the scene, we'll let you know.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-time-to-kill-system/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-devs-say-game%E2%80%99s-time-to-kill-system-%E2%80%9Cwill-evolve%E2%80%9D.1263015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 is set to enter open beta in the coming days, and its developers have addressed on of the game’s primary multiplayer concerns: Time-To-Kill.</p>



<p>Time-To-Kill or TTK is exactly what you think it is. It’s the amount of time it takes for a player to kill an opponent. As part of a media event in Hong Kong, developers from DICE addressed how the team is handling the system in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p><strong>“We’ve done in-depth research on TTK,”</strong> DICE’s Jac Carlsson said <a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via GNN</a> courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1952869411125100656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Bulletin</a>. <strong>“In fact, in Battlefield 6 we’ll be dealing with complex gunfights and environments. TKK is typically fastest in close combat (where it’s very fast), and the scenes we’ve shown in the trailers are mostly close combat.” </strong></p>



<h6 id="h-more-battlefield-6-battlefield-6-servers-will-use-bots-if-not-enough-players">More Battlefield 6: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-bots-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Servers Will Use Bots If Not Enough Players</a></h6>



<p>Carlsson continued: <strong>“We’ve actually done a lot of testing on the game itself, as well as a lot of historical experience, and based on this experience, we’ve found the most enjoyable and comfortable combat situations for players. Based on our own experience, the TTK in the dynamic battlefields of Battlefield 6 needs to be fast enough to keep up with the changes on the battlefield. </strong></p>



<p>Carlsson said that they used “a lot of data analysis” in order to get the TTK results that currently exist. However, the studio will listen to feedback from the players during the betas and after the game launches in order to “evolve” and “adjust” the game.</p>



<p>What do you hope to see from the TTK system in Battlefield 6? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>EA and DICE plan on using AI bots to fill Battlefield 6 servers if there aren’t enough players for a game.</p>



<p>As part of a multiplayer event in Hong Kong (per <a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Taiwanese outlet GNN</a> and spotted by <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1952869411125100656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Bulletin</a>), DICE said AI soldiers will “backfill” servers if they’re unpopulated.</p>



<p>It was said that Battlefield Studios’ philosophy is to “allow as many players as possible to play at the same time”. This would just be used on the off chance should a game need a few players in order to get started. DICE’s Jac Carlsson also gave an example use case of AI bots in Battlefield 6’s multiplayer, saying players could create a custom game mode in Portal that allows players to get more comfortable in the game.</p>



<p>While not confirmed, it should be expected that should more players join the servers, those bots will then be replaced. There was also no mention of the skill level of the bots.</p>



<p>Sticking with multiplayer, it was said that the game will also have a number of “seasonal events” that include new weapons, maps, and modes in order to keep things fresh. How often those seasons come, however, wasn’t revealed.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game is set to have two beta weekends starting August 7 for those who managed to get a code for a two-day early access (closed) period. The beta will open up on August 9-10 before returning from August 14-17.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">While it wasn't ready for a gameplay demo at Evo, the new Virtua Fighter project was still one of the most exciting games of the show, thanks to a brand new trailer released during Finals day that gave us our best look yet at what Sega and RGG have cooking for this revival of a series that has been dormant for more than two decades at this point. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the show, I got a chance to sit down with Riichiro Yamada, producer on the New Virtua Fighter project, to dig into some of his previous statements about the game, ask about how he plans to modernize the series to compete with other more, current 3D fighters, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">[<em>Editor's Note: This interview has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The concept gameplay that we've seen for the new Virtua Fighter project has been very fluid with guards going for each individual attack, the arms moving to block each individual attack. How close to this do you expect the final game to look? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Riichiro Yamada, Producer on New Virtua Fighter Project: </strong>In terms of how it looks, yes, [the battle system is] 70% there, and tomorrow there will be an announcement made at EVO [Editor’s Note: This interview was recorded the day before the trailer release]. So I really feel that I’ll be able to showcase what the current situation is. And from a vision perspective, I really have a very strong vision and really feel that we are getting very close to that vision.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So fighting games are in a very different place than they were when Virtua Fighter V was released. What are some of the ways that you're ensuring that the new Virtua Fighter project will modernize the series?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>Virtua Fighter originally was a very simple game. It only has three buttons and everyone could basically touch and play it, but as the series went on, it became very complicated. And in terms of that and in terms of the progression, I feel that Virtua Fighter 5 is the complete version. In terms of a new Virtua Fighter, we need to keep progressing even more, not just in the gameplay but function as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I really feel that I need to look towards how do we progress this game, how do we improve this game, in terms of functionability, gameplay and how do we make it more modernized? Otherwise, I really feel like it won't sell. So those are the places that I’m really looking into. Not only gameplay, but functionality as well. We need to modernize those parts.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I really feel that modernization is very vital in order to sell.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>In a previous video, you said that the two words that come to mind when asked what is Virtua Fighter were innovation and reality. Can you explain a little bit more about what that means and how those words have guided you through production on this new game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>So in terms of innovation, I really won't be able to specify in details, but it used to be graphics at the very beginning, and then computer graphics like CG has been improving. But with CG, it's really up there right now. It's really difficult to improve the current CG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CG is already innovated, it's really up there. So in terms of innovation, I really feel that bringing up more ideas is very important when it comes to that term. And then as for reality, I feel like reality is a very difficult word, but Virtua Fighter, it's not a very UFC-like battle. It's more of like a kung-fu movie battle. It's more of that type.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And when I played Virtua Fighter at the very beginning, I felt like the reality of being hit, when you're being hit by an opponent, you felt that hurt in your arms or your legs, your body. So that sensation, I really felt that. So with the new project, not just the battles but reality, I really want that reality to be felt within the players, not only the battles but the other places as well, which I feel is very important. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So with this new Virtua Fighter project, do you envision this as a new beginning for the franchise? Not just for the franchise but for the characters? Like Akira obviously looks a lot different than what we're used to. He is not in his traditional gi, his hair is not styled up, he's wearing a hat. Are these the same characters from the previous games or is this kind of just a new reboot of Virtua Fighter?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>So in terms of characters, I really feel that new characters are necessary, and as you said, Akira looks different. So in this one, Akira is a little bit older than the previous series. So in terms of that, I feel that a new generation of characters is needed and [I’m not] saying that the character designs in the previous VF is not very good. That's not true.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We need to make the character designs look better, to look cool.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't want to say that the VF characters previously, that the character designs were a little bit weak. I’m not trying to say that. I feel that they were stylish, but we do need to evolve these characters, we need to make the character designs look better, to look cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not saying that they were bad before, but I just need to make them cooler. So that's why when I think about new characters, I said reality is one of the statements that I’m really focusing on. That too, when I create new character designs, I have to bring this reality to it and to make it a more good-looking character. So yes, using the same characters, but evolving it from the past, putting more elements to it, putting more design characters to it, making it more real is my stance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Speaking of characters, in a previous Virtua Fighter direct, you revealed Stella, a character that bears a striking resemblance to Sarah Bryant. Is there anything you can tell us about this character? And on the screen the text says that she's the bridge between worlds. Can you elaborate a little bit about what that means?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>Unfortunately, I won't be able to answer your question on that, sorry. But please be excited. Please look forward to that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You touched upon this earlier, Virtua Fighter traditionally is a three-button game — punch, kick and guard — but it derives a lot of depth from that very simple control scheme. Do you feel like the three-button control style for Virtua Fighter is core to the series, or is that an area where you see an opportunity to evolve the franchise by either adding another button or just changing the way the typical Virtua Fighter core gameplay works?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>So originally when Yu Suzuki created the Virtua fighter, he did a lot of testing. He actually tested with more than three buttons, like a lot of buttons. But they came to the three button conclusion. At the time it was more of a Game Center (Arcade) focused game, so that was the best at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the concept was that they wanted to create a game that was not too complicated and that anyone could enjoy. And so from that concept, I feel like, yes, I need to respect that concept. I want to create a game where anyone can play.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I want to create a game where anyone can play.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But currently, or moving forward, it's not just a Game Center game, it's more of a household game. So when you think about how people could enjoy playing this game in their living room or in their house, that's when it kind of changes a little. So yes, the concept does stay the same, But… I’m not really focused on, oh, we need to keep it to three buttons. The more important thing is I want to create a game where anyone can play in their household when it comes to the new style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>For all the years that Virtua Fighter has been around, Akira has been the face of the franchise and he's also the character that you revealed the new Virtua Fighter project with, but we don't really get to see his face all that much. Do you feel like Akira is still the kind of face of this series or is it a new generation? Is there going to be a new person that's going to take that mantle of being the face of the franchise?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>So when it comes to the protagonist, I really feel that users will still buy a game because of the protagonist. For example, for Street Fighter, it's Luke, there's probably a reason why it's still Luke. For Ryu-Ga-Gotoku (The Yakuza series), it used to be Kiryu, but it's changing. They did bring a new protagonist, Kasuga. Originally, RGG fans love Kiryu.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So I think there were challenges in bringing a new protagonist, a new character, Kasuga, into the series. Ideally, I would like to bring out more characters, but it feels like users really like Akira. History has proven or is proving that there is a lot of love for Akira.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, I would like to bring out new characters, but I really feel that the protagonist, because Akira has been a strong face, the users will still look forward to or see or would like to buy the game because it's Akira. So I feel that changing characters or bringing new characters is not a very easy thing to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

                <p>Call of Duty developer Raven Software has now secured a contract for its union after after three years of work. Workers at Raven "unanimously voted to ratify their first union contract between Game Workers Alliance-CWA (GWA-CWA) members and Microsoft," according to a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/raven-software-workers-secure-first-contract-microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a> from the Communication Workers of America (CWA).</p><p>The collective bargaining agreement secures a few conditions for the 19 quality assurance testers at Raven. This includes a 10% wage increase over two years, along with additional raises through merit and promotion. CWA says this follows 18 months without wage increases and 45 months without promotions.</p><p>The contract also addresses crunch time, with "seven days' notice required for mandatory overtime, no excessive overtime on back-to-back weeks, flexible scheduling of overtime, and no mandatory overtime of any duration for the majority of weeks in a quarter."</p><p>Finally, the contract includes provisions for bridging of time worked as contract and temp employees, with defined job descriptions, a fair promotions process, expanded disability accommodations, and layoff protections.</p><p>This comes after "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/raven-software-qa-testers-can-move-ahead-with-union-vote-following-nlrb-ruling/1100-6502770/" data-ref-id="1100-6502770">three years</a> of organizing and bargaining," according to QA tester Erin Hall. "From day one, we made it a priority to include every voice in the room, and the contract we came out with reflects what we need--better pay, real career paths, and protection from burnout. It’s a contract that actually values the work QA does. I’m proud of what we accomplished, and I hope it shows other game workers that organizing works—and it’s worth it."</p><p>Microsoft has laid off thousands of workers through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">multiple rounds of layoffs</a> in recent months, and one tactic of questionable legality in corporate playbooks to fight unions is to simply lay off the unionized workforce. For this contract to stick, Microsoft will have to respect the contract and the union. With that said, a secured union contract is a big step forward for game developers.</p>

Although both are great games, Donkey Kong Bananza has staunchly entrenched itself as one of the best games of the year and an absolute must-buy game for any Switch 2 owner.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Donkey Kong Bananza is the Only 10/10 Masterpiece of 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only did we rate Donkey Kong a 10/10, it's the <em>only</em> game we've given a Masterpiece rating so far this year. Granted there isn't too much competition in the way of Switch exclusive games for 2025, this has been a fantastic year so far for console gaming in general. We've seen some of the best games released in recent history, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/17/kingdom-come-deliverance-review">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Death Stranding 2</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, all of which got close to a Masterpiece rating but didn't quite hit the mark. That's not to say that Donkey Kong Bananza is necessarily better than those other games since, after all, different people have reviewed each of these games, but it's a testament to just how outstanding Donkey Kong Bananza is on its own merits to have achieved that score.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Pick it up in under an hour at Best Buy</h3><div catalogid="7e14ca20-d3b4-46c3-be95-0d920f6e2169" id="226427"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've read the reviews and are itching to pick up a copy to play immediately, the surest best is ordering online and picking it up in-store at a nearby retailer like Best Buy, Target, or Walmart. Best Buy, for example, offers pickup in as little as one hour. I find it more convenient to order online ahead of time and then picking it up in-store because you're pretty much guaranteed that it will be in stock, and you don't have to wander around the store looking for a copy. If you're looking for a discount, don't hold your breath. I haven't seen any deals this game, and to be honest, I don't expect any before Black Friday. That's not to say you can't find ways to incentivize your purchase. Best Buy, for example, gives you rewards points for every purchase if you sign up for its free membership, and Best Buy cardholders get 5% cashback, similar to Target's Circle card or Amazon's Prime card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still on the fence over getting the Switch 2 console?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Finish 'em. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Humble Bundle has announced its Humble Choice lineup for August. For just $14.99, you’ll get access to a solid selection of games, including one of my personal favorites, Persona 5 Royal. For reference, P5R’s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1687950/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest recorded price on Steam</a> is $23.99, making just that game alone a crazy steal. Even better, you get seven more games (and the feeling of giving back) out of it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Humble Choice August 2025 Game Lineup </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Each month, Humble Choice curates a selection of games for members to redeem. These games are sent as Steam codes, which you can keep forever, making Humble Choice one of our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-subscription-services">favorite gaming subscriptions</a>. Here's what Humble Choice members are getting in August: </p><div catalogid="f5ee5aee-bdfd-43a2-b5bb-4f4dbc146197" id="226429"><div id="226429" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Humble Choice August 2025</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Eight games, discounts on the Humble Bundle store, and one month of IGN Plus.</p></div></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Persona 5 Royal </li><li>Banishers: Ghost of New Eden</li><li>My Time at Sandrock 	</li><li>Let’s School </li><li>Lil Gator Game</li><li>Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip </li><li>Wildmender  </li><li>Warpips</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">As noted, the highlight this month is certainly Persona 5 Royal. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-royal-review"><u>IGN’s 10/10 review</u></a>, Leana Hafer goes so far as to say, “Persona 5 was already a strong front-runner for being the best JRPG ever made, and Royal really gets me wondering what else could even compete.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The social links in Persona 5 Royal are a big standout for me, even compared to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">rest of the Persona franchise</a>. Every “Palace” (basically a dungeon) feels like a full season of an anime, with solid character development, laughs, and yes, plenty of emotional moments. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you recently played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2024">IGN’s 2024 Game of the Year</a>, Metaphor: Refantazio, this is a great chance to check out Atlus’ hallmark series with plenty of the same mechanics. Otherwise, I highly recommend this entry point to anyone who’s considered getting into the modern generation of turn-based JRPGs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">August’s Humble Choice bundle also includes a solid selection of more casual games, including the co-op gardening survival game, Wildmender, and the cozy farming sim My Life at Sandrock, which, like many cozy games, is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/bomoore/lists/games-like-stardew-valley">a lot like Stardew Valley</a>. You’ll also pick up Banishers: Ghost of New Eden, an action RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review"><u>IGN’s review</u></a> describes as having “a solid concept and a stellar paranormal investigation system.” Again, all of this for just $14.99. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>5% of Humble Choice Proceeds Go to Charity </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Every month, 5% of the proceeds from Humble Choice members go to a charity chosen by Humble itself. This month, those proceeds are going to <a href="https://donorschoose.org/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DonorsChoose.org</u></a>, an organization that helps teachers and educators get access to the resources they need in the classroom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You spend a lot of time in P5R studying for exams (I promise it’s fun), so this bundle makes sense to me. Charity Navigator and GuideStar have also awarded DonorsChoose, a 501(c)3 nonprofit, their highest ratings for transparency and accountability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Humble Bundle is part of IGN Entertainment, the division of Ziff Davis that includes GamesIndustry.biz, IGN, and MapGenie.</em>

Not necessarily. There are dozens of good laptops on the market at various price points. However, it can feel overwhelming to find the right one for your needs (some are better suited for, say, college students, whereas others are ideal for gamers).</p><p>That’s why we’ve come up with this list of some of the best laptop deals available right now. In addition to the latest discounts, we’ll share each discounted model’s best features (and downsides) to give you more clarity during your shopping journey. And if you need to do more research, you can also check out our guides to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops">the best laptops on the market</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop">top gaming laptops</a>.</p><div><nav><h2>In this article</h2><ul><li><span><a href="#mWntBg">The best laptop deals</a></span><ul><li><a href="#eMoIgc">Apple MacBook deals</a></li><li><a href="#m3szGY">Microsoft Surface deals</a></li><li><a href="#acer-laptop-deals">Acer laptop deals</a></li><li><a href="#E63Snk">Asus laptop deals</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><div><p id="mWntBg"><h2>The best laptop deals</h2></p></div><div><p id="eMoIgc"><h2>Apple MacBook deals</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->599</span></p><div><p>The 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold).</p></div></div><p>Apple itself no longer sells the 13-inch MacBook Air with M1 — and hasn’t for years — but you can still get this solid laptop for $599.99 ($50 off) at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?sharedid=appleaug&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Silver-M1-Chip-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage%2F609040889" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>. The 2020 model is available in one configuration, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but it’s still capable at handling basic tasks like a champ, including streaming video, browsing, and dealing with documents. You can also use the M1 MacBook Air for creative work in Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Logic, and Pixelmator, though you may experience slowdown due to its low 8GB of memory.</p><p>The laptop’s battery lasted between eight and ten hours when we <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon">originally reviewed it</a>, and those figures should be mostly accurate, barring some differences likely caused by operating system updates. In addition to offering great performance for its price, the laptop also comes with other nice-to-have features, including a comfortable keyboard and an excellent trackpad. Just note its 720p webcam isn’t particularly good, so if a high-resolution webcam matters a lot to you, you may want to buy one separately. Also, be aware that, due to the limitations of the M1 chip, you can only use one external display at a time and port selection is also more limited than newer models.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->699</span></p><div><p>The 2022 MacBook Air is a thin, lightweight device powered by Apple’s M2 chip. The M2 model touts an improved 1080p webcam and a better display than its predecessor while retaining features like long battery life and MagSafe charging.</p></div></div><p>Apple’s 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip is a significant leap above the M1 model it succeeded, both in terms of design and performance. The old wedge-shaped look was replaced for a more squared-off design that’s still used by the current-generation MacBook Air. It has a 1080p webcam, which was a welcome improvement given the disappointing camera on the 2020 M1 model. It’s also much lighter and thus more portable as well, yet it retains features like MagSafe charging and Touch ID, as well as a nice display.</p><p>Despite its age, the M2 processor inside of this machine is still powerful enough to handle many tasks, from common ones such as browsing to more complex and creative projects. Compared to newer, pricier models, this one unsurprisingly struggles with gaming. That being said, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707106/cyberpunk-2077-mac-release-date">it’s capable of running</a> <em>Cyberpunk 2077.</em> The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 launched with 8GB of RAM, but that configuration became unavailable last year when Apple made 16GB the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24270669/apple-macbook-pro-mac-mini-imac-16gb-ram-doubled-apple-intelligence-ai">new standard</a>.</p><p>While a well-rounded laptop overall, there is one key area where Apple’s M1 model is better: storage. The base M2 MacBook Air with 256GB of storage is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23220299/apple-macbook-air-m2-slow-ssd-read-write-speeds-testing-benchmark">actually slower</a> than its predecessor because it’s stored in a single NAND chip. This was corrected in subsequent MacBook Air models, so the slowdown is unique to M2 machines with 256GB of storage<strong>. </strong>Also, be aware as well that port selection isn’t great, and the included display notch — which is also found on both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros — can make using the menu bar more challenging until you get used to it. If that doesn’t bother you, however, you can get a configuration with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, an 8-core CPU and GPU for $699 ($100 off) at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-macbook-air-13-inch-apple-m2-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-starlight%2F6602762.p%3FskuId%3D6602762" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->799</span></p><div><p>The M4 MacBook Air has a speedy processor, and double the RAM of previous models. It has a thin and light design, all day battery life, and still starts with 256GB of storage.</p></div></div><p>The 13-inch MacBook Air with M4 is Apple’s latest thin and lightweight laptop, and it’s our top pick in <em>The Verge</em>’s guide to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops">best laptops</a> right now. It’s not a MacBook Pro, but Apple’s M4 processor in the Air is still mighty capable. In our tests, it only throttled under heavy load from creative applications, which is understandable given its fanless design. The machine comes with 16GB of RAM as standard rather than an optional upgrade, but the base configuration still comes with just 256GB of storage, so be mindful of that limitation if you work with a lot of larger files.</p><p>Apple hasn’t increased the number of ports on a MacBook Air since reintroducing MagSafe to the M2 model in 2022, but this generation has Thunderbolt 4 ports rather than Thunderbolt 3 for faster file transfer speeds. Another notable addition is the 1080p Center Stage camera from the MacBook Pro, so you’ll stay in frame if you move around on a video call. Battery life should last all day, though your experience will vary depending on how hard you push this machine.</p><p>You can currently get a configuration of the 13-inch with M4 with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and a 10-core CPU and GPU for $799 ($200 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2025-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DZDC3WW5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-macbook-air-13-inch-laptop-apple-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-midnight%2F6565862.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.

The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, and comes equipped with three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port, an SD card slot, and a MagSafe charging port. It can send video to two external displays simultaneously (the previous generation could only handle one) and has an improved 12-megapixel Center Stage camera with better video quality.</p><p>The M4 MacBook Pro and M4 MacBook Air run on the same chip, but the Pro’s cooling system is better, so it handles resource-intensive tasks (including games) without throttling as easily. The laptop’s 14.2-inch screen is bright (up to 1,600 nits when viewing HDR content), and supports the P3 color gamut, both of which are important to professionals who rely on color accuracy when editing photos and video. The display has a 120Hz refresh rate, so scrolling through webpages or moving windows around should appear smoother than 60Hz screens. In our stress test, which included editing 33-megapixel RAW images and working with a large photo library in Adobe Lightroom, the laptop ran for 12 hours without kicking up the fans or feeling hot to the touch.</p><p>If you want even more power, you can jump up to the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro processor. It comes with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, a 12-core CPU, and a 16-core GPU. The M4 Pro MacBook Pro has over twice the memory bandwidth of the base M4 MacBook Pro, so it should perform better across the board. That said, it might be tough to notice the benefits of its extra memory and processing power during casual use, but it will come in handy when you’re pushing the laptop to the limits while video editing or playing games. It has three Thunderbolt 5 ports, and you can use that extra bandwidth with an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/OWC-Thunderbolt-Portable-Enclosure-Compatible/dp/B0DMTTTCM2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">external SSD</a> with fast transfer speeds, to name an example. You can also get the MacBook Pro with M4 Pro with a 16-inch screen if you’d like to work on a larger display.</p><p>Right now, the 14-inch M4 model with 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD and 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU is $1,299 ($300 off) at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-macbook-pro-14-inch-apple-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-space-black%2F6602741.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> and $200 off at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1859560-REG%2Fapple_mw2u3ll_a_14_macbook_pro_m4.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a>.

The laptop runs on a power-efficient ARM processor that doesn’t skimp on performance. Its 13.8-inch 2,304 x 1,536 120Hz screen supports Dolby Vision HDR (High Dynamic Range) and looks very nice. It has a large, precision haptic trackpad that gives you plenty of room to tap and swipe, an offers satisfying feedback no matter where you press it.</p><p>The laptop has a pair of USB 4 ports, one USB-A 3.1 Gen 1 port, plus a headphone jack. One of the concerns of using an ARM-based Windows PC has been software compatibility, but this model proves that’s no longer something to be as worried about. It runs Photoshop, and apps compiled for X86 processors work thanks to Microsoft’s Prism emulator. Be sure to check the compatibility of the specific Windows app you rely, though, as there’s still a chance they won’t work as intended.</p><p>Even after our toughest tests, the battery lasted seven hours. That’s with 100 percent screen brightness, after downloading multiple Steam games, attending video calls, and running through multiple projects in Photoshop. Using the laptop with less power-hungry apps, including Slack, WhatsApp, Discord, and Chrome, the laptop used just 30 percent of its battery in seven hours. For the best battery life, you’ll want to stick to using native ARM apps when possible. If you want to make the switch to an ARM-based laptop to get some of the benefits MacBook users have had for years, the 7th Generation Surface Laptop is worth checking out.</p><p>You can get a 13.8-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop (7th Edition) with a Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB of RAM and 512GB SSD for $999 ($100 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Surface-Touchscreen-Snapdragon-Platinum/dp/B0CXL6B4QF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>.

It’s also made the cut in our guide to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks">best Chromebooks</a> because it supports Google’s Gemini smart assistant, and comes with a one-year subscription to Google’s One AI premium service. The current-generation laptop is a solid choice a year after it was released thanks in part to its Intel Core Ultra 5 Series 1 processor, which allows you to run Linux apps instead of being limited to software solely available through Google’s Play Store.</p><p>On to the specs: The laptop has a 14-inch 1920 x 1200 resolution touchscreen display, which can be flipped 180 degrees, so you can use the laptop as a large tablet if you prefer. The Plus Spin 714 has two Thunderbolt 4 ports and an HDMI port, which is an acceptable array of ports for a Chromebook. However, it only has 8GB of RAM, which will likely be a performance bottleneck if you intend to keep dozens of tabs open.</p><p>If your needs are relatively light and you don’t mind working mostly in the cloud instead of with local files, this is a solid computer. You can grab the Chromebook Plus Spin 714 for $629 ($170 off) at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Facer-chromebook-plus-spin-714-laptop-with-google-ai-14-wuxga-touch-intel-core-ultra-5-115u-8gb-lpddr5-256gb-ssd-steel-gray%2F6576960.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.</p><div><p id="E63Snk"><h2>Asus laptop deals</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->1300</span></p><div><p>The Asus Zenbook S 16 features AMD’s Ryzen AI mobile processors. It’s one of the thinnest and lightest 16-inch laptops available and doesn’t cut corners on performance. It’s a mighty machine that can handle all sorts of heavy workloads with ease and grace.</p></div></div><p>We chose Asus’ Zenbook S 16 as another one of our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/713373/best-laptops-for-students">top recommendations for students</a>, but it’s a solid laptop for anyone who wants a large-screened Windows laptop. In our tests, the 16-inch 120Hz 3K (2,880 x 1,800) OLED display emits vivid colors and excellent contrast. The laptop was more than capable of handling common tasks, including video chats using its 1080p webcam, music streaming, but its graphics and gaming performance is what really sets it apart from laptops in its size and price classes.</p><p>This machine runs <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>at around 77 frames per second with the resolution set to 1080p with AMD’s FSR 2.1 upscaling software turned on. The laptop isn’t designed for gaming, but it’s good to know it’s up to the task if you’re willing to turn down some graphical settings. The Zenbook S 16’s battery lasted 11 hours during our testing. However, the percentage indicator in the Windows taskbar would often fluctuate, making it difficult to pin down exactly how much juice was left.</p><p>You can get a configuration of the laptop with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor for $1,299.99 ($500 off) <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2F90nb13m3-m00790-asus-zenbook-s-16-um5606.html%3Fbdl%3D0" rel="sponsored">from Asus</a> if you sign up for a free Asus membership.

It has a 16-inch 240Hz Mini LED display with a resolution of 2,560 x 1,600. The screen can’t quite match an OLED when it comes to rich contrast, but you get Dolby Vision HDR here, and its color accuracy impressed us in our tests. The laptop has larger keys instead of a number pad, which makes sense for a gaming-focused laptop. If you need a number pad, you can bring up a touch-sensitive one by clicking and holding the top part of the laptop’s large trackpad.</p><p>Under the hood, Asus fitted the ROG Strix Scar 16 with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, 32GB of RAM, 2TB of storage, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card with 16GB of dedicated video memory. The laptop’s display supports Nvidia’s G-Sync technology, so you shouldn’t see screen tearing or other graphical anomalies when playing games. The laptop has three USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, an HDMI 2.1 port, an ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. You can use either the HDMI 2.1 port or Thunderbolt 5 ports to carry a 4K 120Hz video signal to a compatible TV or gaming monitor.</p><p>In case aesthetics matter to you, the ROG Strix Scar 16 has RGB lighting on its underside as well as a dot-matrix LED array that can display animations on its lid. These features <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21306808/asus-zephyrus-g14-dot-matrix-display-release-date-price-specs-features">aren’t new</a>, but each can add some flair to your setup.

<p>This comes from PM Studios, the physical game publisher who is handling Yooka-Replaylee's release. The company shared a video on Bluesky giving us a very short explanation on what to expect.</p>
<p>The video confirms that the game is "content complete" and Playtonic are currently in the playtesting phase, looking for bugs to iron out.</p>

<p>We don't know when that "soon" is, of course. It could be the Indie World showcase on Thursday, but it also could be at gamescom Opening Night Live, which is on 19th August.</p>
<p>Basically, there are many places we could find out, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>Gears of War: Reloaded releases at the end of August and the game’s file sizes are becoming available. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NZ7KCLZ1SX1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Xbox app</a>, Gears of War: Reloaded will be <strong>68.7GB on the Xbox Series X|S</strong> and <strong>70.3GB on PC</strong>. The <strong>PlayStation version of the game</strong> has yet to be revealed, but, it based on the Xbox and PC numbers, it should fall somewhere into that 68-71GB range. When the official number is available, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>Gears of war: Reloaded is a remaster of the original Gears of War game that was first released in 2006. This new build of the game from The Coalition—along with Disbelief and Sumo Interactive—not only brings the series to PlayStation for the first time, but also includes a number of updates for players.</p>



<p>Features of the game include 4K resolution and up to 120 frames per second if you are multiplayer. The game will also support cross-play and cross-progression on all platforms. To get cross-progression, however, you’ll need to link a Microsoft account.</p>



<p>Other features for the game include zero loading screens during Campaign, Variable Refresh Rate, 4K assets and remastered textures, enhanced post-processing visual effects, improved shadows and reflections, and more.</p>



<p>Also you happen to have 2015’s Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, you can upgrade to Reloaded at no extra cost. The game will also be available via Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>



<p>Are you going to pick up Gears of War: Reloaded when it releases on August 26? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

He's now the CEO and founder of ProbablyMonsters, a company that assists developers with "early stage infrastructure" and support to help get games off the ground. The company just revealed its first two games, a rogue-like action game called Storm Lancers for Nintendo Switch and a psychological horror game called Ire: A Prologue for PC. ProbablyMonsters formerly owned Concord developer Firewalk Studios, before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-acquires-another-studio-headed-by-bungie-veterans/1100-6513445/" data-ref-id="1100-6513445">selling it to Sony in 2023</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">only for Sony to close the game and shutter the studio in 2024</a></p><p>Ryan said he would make another live-service game if he saw the "right game idea and the right audience." But he pushed back against the idea that a developer should focus too much on the business model. "I think [for] sustainable careers, I think for the industry, it's pretty clear that we can't just pick a business model and say that's a reason to make a game," he said.</p><p>As for Bungie, the company has undergone significant changes in recent times, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">mass layoffs and a major studio reorganization in 2024.</a> Bungie's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon</a>, is a live-service title that publisher Sony believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">won't suffer the same fate as Concord.</a> The game was previously set for release in September but has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">delayed indefinitely.</a> Despite Concord's struggles, Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">remains invested in live-service</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/1100-6529497/" data-ref-id="1100-6529497">as does Ubisoft.</a></p><p>Ryan reflected on the upheaval at Bungie, saying, "It feels like they're in the very same place that almost everyone in the industry is, where the things that were working and reliable before aren't quite as reliable."</p><p>Ryan said it's his hope that developers across the industry can find a "sustainable business model" for their game that makes players happy and brings in enough revenue for studios to "pay the bills."</p><p>"Everyone can't be the number one most successful game in the industry," he said. "But I think we all could be shipping successful games."</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/akane-banashi-shonen-jump-manga-anime</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-shonen-manga-right-now-is-about-a-niche-performance-artist%E2%80%99s-fall-from-grace.1262907/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For years, I treated <em>Akane-banashi</em> like a dessert, saving the chapters for last every Sunday as the highlight of my <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-new-manga-to-read-2025-2000560252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weekly Shonen Jump lineup</a>. Then I got greedy. I stopped reading—not out of disinterest, but to stockpile chapters and indulge later. With the announcement of an <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-08-04/akane-banashi-rakugo-manga-gets-tv-anime-in-2026-by-studio-zexcs/.227338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming anime adaptation</a>, I broke my moratorium, expecting to see my girl shine once more in her series. Instead, I returned to find my best girl fighting for her life in a bold deviation of shonen tropes that only further cements the manga’s growing legacy as a truly remarkable work.&nbsp;</p><p>The best kind of manga can focus its stories on a niche interest and elevate it into compelling storytelling through strong writing and a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-harassment-comes-with-the-territory-of-translating-popular-manga-2000556430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genuine appreciation for its subject</a>. <em>Akane-banashi</em> is the top modern example of this. The ongoing series, which started in 2022 by writer Yuki Suenaga and illustrator Takamasa Moue, is a performance art drama. The story follows Akane Osaki, a teenager who aspires to make a career in <a href="https://www.japansociety.org.uk/review?review=549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rakugo</a>. In this traditional Japanese solo performance art form, an artist portrays multiple characters using only their voice, gestures, and a fan to bring the story to life. Driven by a love for the art form and a desire to uncover why her father was famously banished from it, Akane works to become an accomplished rakugoka.</p><p>Although <em>Akane-banashi</em> might not seem like typical shonen at first glance—especially to those who assume “girl on cover” indicates a shoujo vibe—the manga is, at its core, a masterful example of shonen storytelling. Akane’s journey to redeem her disgraced father is more than just a personal mission; it immerses her in the rakugo world, a hierarchy resembling the <em>Demon Slayer</em> corps or a Yakuza organization. Performers take on surnames as inherited symbols of renowned rakugo lineages and compete for prestige in intense tournament arcs, ultimately facing the art form’s heavenly kings, who judge whether they can advance further. One such top king is Issho Arakawa, the man who expelled Akane’s father. It’s his looming presence that fuels Akane’s unyielding rise.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Official Manga Trailer | Akane-banashi | VIZ" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E18XM9loxZM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It’s not just me and former Kotaku writer Sisi Jiang who <a href="https://kotaku.com/shonen-jump-akane-banashi-one-piece-manga-evangelion-1849391135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sing praises for the series</a>. <em>Akane-banashi</em> has motion in manga and anime circles, with creatives like <a href="https://x.com/akanebanashi_PR/status/1531197181301968897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em>’s Eiichiro Oda</a> and <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2022-08-01/evangelion-creator-hideaki-anno-recommends-akane-banashi-manga/.188234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Evangelion</em>’s Hideaki Anno</a> recommending the series to their fans. However, the series’ latest developments, which subvert typical shonen tropes, have only made it all the more engrossing to read.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So spoilers for that.</strong></p><p>Much like how <a href="https://kotaku.com/naruto-shippuden-anime-director-s-ocean-cut-filler-fan-1848765385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Naruto Shippuden</em></a> reintroduced its orange knuckled-headed ninja with a time-skip and a sharpened resolve, <em>Akane-banashi</em> delivers a similar grand return. After an excursion overseas honing her craft in France, Akane returns to Japan—not as the bright-eyed ingénue we first met, but as a rakugo contender equipped with new techniques and a sharpened fire, all while carrying the quiet burden of fulfilling what her father couldn't. However, she’s no longer the talk of the town. Rakugo is a brutal “what-have-you-done-for-me-lately” stage, and the early chapters show her struggling under the pressure to regain her reputation, rhythm, and relevance.&nbsp;</p><p>I put the series aside for a couple of months, thinking <em>Akane-banashi</em> might stick to familiar beats—rivalries picking back up, theatrical power shifts in rankings, and Akane climbing the ladder as usual. But when I checked back in, I saw my manga daughter in the trenches.</p><figure><figcaption>(。﹏。*)<span></span><span>Shonen Jump</span></figcaption></figure><p>Akane’s comeback arrived with drama worthy of a shonen resurgence. She throws down the gauntlet against Karashi Nerimaya—the volatile “problem child” of rakuga—and Hikaru Koragi, the ragkugo world’s voice actor idol. These two, part of Akane-banashi’s in-universe Big Three, owe their rise to the bar Akane once set, pushing them to their limits to chase her rising star. When they compete in a tournament, Akane doesn’t just lose to them as the third-best in their trio; her performance sees her slide even further down the rakugo rankings, ranking fifth for the day. My GOAT is washed.&nbsp;</p><p>However, instead of celebrating their victory, Hikaru and Karashi confront Akane with a colder expression: disappointment. They don’t desire a hollow rival—they want her at her best self. The performer who once had the audience roaring is gone, replaced by this version filtered through the stern lens of her toxic new mentor, Issho, who forces her to perform without making audiences laugh (her signature rakugo style). She tried to fix this with an unconventional medley performance blending genres that, while impressive, didn’t wow audiences or judges like Hikaru and Karashi—two rakugokas who’ve become household names in Akane’s absence.</p><p>The manga’s brilliance lies in how it turns this niche theater tradition into a narrative engine. Its performers dissect each other’s creative choices, tweak genres, and chase emotionally cathartic payoffs to their tales. But they’re not just telling stories—they’re rewriting the rules of rakugo to get to their emotional climax.</p><p>And then there’s Akane, my manga daughter. She doesn’t walk back into this world to cheers. She reenters the rakugo world to scrutiny, doubt, and whispered what-happened-to-her’s as a has-been rakugoka instead of a returning star. It’s a reversal of the classic shonen hero’s homecoming. But instead of deflating her arc, it electrifies it.</p><figure><figcaption>This girl. She can do it. <span></span><span>Shonen Jump</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just when I felt an immense guilt for abandoning my girl in her time of need, Akane appears to have tapped into rakugo’s version of ultra instinct, declaring, “I’ve become only rakugo.” It’s a declaration that made me feel like the manga is teasing one of the most imposing comeback shonen victories for Akane in its ongoing tournament arc to rival that of a Saiyan’s <a href="https://ultradragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Zenkai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zenkai boost</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Akane-banashi</em> doesn’t just dramatize rakugo, it weaponizes it. Each character refines their delivery like a fighter adjusting their style through off-screen training or mid-performance improvisation, blending comedic, romantic, and dramatic styles to redefine what a solo performance can feel like. Whether it be its cast of comedians, actors, or wild-card upstarts, witnessing them morph their performances into slapstick routines, psychological thrillers, or heart-tugging romance—all while locked in a quiet rivalry to be crowned the new rakugoka legend makes <em>Akane-banashi</em> my favorite read on Shonen Jump.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="TVアニメ『あかね噺』ティザーPV｜2026年放送決定！" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qVmUVrYDGys?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><br>Watching Akane reclaim her space in a medium that lives and dies by audience response, pushing against etiquette and expectation, is nothing short of exhilarating. If Shonen Jump, like rakugo, is a stage where only one voice rules the room, <em>Akane-banashi</em> holds the floor every week. More folks should get in on the ground floor before it becomes passé to say you liked it before it became an anime.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/labubu-lafufu-lawsuit-pop-mart-7-eleven"><h3>Labubu To Lafufu: ‘See You In Court’</h3></a><p>Pop Mart is suing 7-Eleven for allegedly selling fake Labubus in its stores</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve"><h3>Gabe Newell Bought A Yacht Company</h3></a><p>Valve's head honcho is now in the big boat business</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/akane-banashi-shonen-jump-manga-anime]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazons-new-war-of-the-worlds-features-a-head-scratching-twist-2000636929">Amazon’s new <em>War of the Worlds</em> movie</a> starring Ice Cube and Eva Longoria was quietly released online last week and received universally negative reviews. Clips of the horrible sci-fi disaster flick, which is told entirely via a computer screen, have gone viral online. But one particular clip involving an Amazon delivery driver and a drone perfectly sums up how this latest iteration of the classic sci-fi story is less a movie and more a cheap branding exercise that doesn’t even hit 90 minutes.</p> <p>Released on July 30, <em>War of the Worlds</em> was <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/09/ice-cube-to-star-in-untitled-patrick-aiello-timur-bekmambetov-sci-fi-pic-for-universal-1234584529/">cooked up during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic</a> and tells the story of an alien invasion. But instead of following a group of characters through a dangerous and hostile invasion, you mostly watch Ice Cube struggle to act in front of a webcam for 80 minutes, not counting the credits and opening logos. Very late in the film, Ice Cube’s character needs a specific piece of code to shut down a powerful computer that the aliens are going after, and which the United States is willing to nuke to keep out of their Martian hands. The problem is that Ice Cube and a load of people, including his family, would be killed by the bomb. So a hacker sends him the code. But he has to put it on a USB thumb drive, which he somehow doesn’t have. Don’t worry, Ice Cube’s daughter has an idea. She downloads the code and loads it up on a USB drive, and then her boyfriend, who is an Amazon delivery driver, will use his Amazon Prime Air drone to deliver the USB device to Ice Cube and save the day. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hypercubexl.bsky.social/post/3lvgttjlv5s2h">Here’s the scene:</a></p>  <p>Yeah, you just watched an Amazon Prime ad shoved into this movie about an alien invasion. This honestly feels like a Super Bowl commercial more than a film. And here’s the wild thing: This isn’t the worst moment involving Amazon in the movie. A few minutes after this scene, the drone crashes and flips over near a homeless man living in a tent. This man is scared, as all around him are alien tripods destroying Earth. But our “heroes” need his help. So they use NSA tech to track down his phone number and text him to flip the drone over. He won’t risk his life to do it so they offer him a $1,000 Amazon gift card, pushing him over the edge and getting him to fulfill the deadly task. Gross shit!</p> <p>Anyway, <em>War of the Worlds</em> is barely a movie. More than half the runtime is just a view of a desktop PC and stock footage spliced into windows as if they’re security cameras or YouTube videos. It’s horrendous. It’s awful. And it’s exactly the kind of movie Amazon and other big corporations want to make. Movies that are barely movies, made for little money, starring people you might recognize, and filled with ads and product placement. This is our future. It sucks, huh?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Aggro Crab, the developer of Another Crab's Treasure and the recently-released co-op survival climbing game Peak, took aim at a Roblox clone version of the latter in a Twitter/X post today, in which the studio said it would rather people pirate Peak than play "this microtransaction-riddled Roblox slop ripoff".</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">tbh would rather you pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled <a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Roblox</a> slop ripoff <a href="https://t.co/ulRShLLGz2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ulRShLLGz2</a></p>— AGGRO CRAB 💥 (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1952475157433549083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1952475157433549083" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post in question</a> shows screenshots of a Roblox game called "Cliff", which does look suspiciously similar to Aggro Crab's Peak. Both games feature a round-headed protagonist whose goal is to climb a mountain at the center of an island, an activity that can be accomplished either alone or with friends. Cliff even calls out in its description that it's inspired by Peak!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though, "inspired" might be a bit generous. Take a look at the two game descriptions side-by-side. Here's Peak:</p><blockquote>PEAK is a co-op climbing game where the slightest mistake can spell your doom. Either solo or as a group of lost nature scouts, your only hope of rescue from a mysterious island is to scale the mountain at its center. Do you have what it takes to reach the PEAK?<p>WORK TOGETHER</p></blockquote><blockquote>Need a Hand? You’ll need to rely on your friends to have any hope of scaling the mountain, which changes every single day. Help each other up ledges, or place ropes and climbing spikes to make the way easier for those who come after.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">And this is Cliff:</p><blockquote>⛰️CLIFF is a challenging climbing game where even the smallest mistake can be your downfall. Trapped on a mysterious island, your only way to escape is to reach the top of the towering cliff. Do you have the skill and courage to make it to the summit?</blockquote><blockquote>✋WORK TOGETHER</blockquote><blockquote>Need some help? You’ll have to rely on your friends if you want any chance of reaching the top. The mountain is tough, so help each other up ledges and watch out for dangers to make the climb easier for those who come after you.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Woof, that's...the same? It's essentially just the same description copied wholesale with some swapped synonyms. And a comparison of the Badges for Cliff and the Steam Achievements for Peak reveals that Cliff also named its "Shore" and "Tropics" biomes directly after Peak's locations of the same names.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest material difference between the two games, apart from things like quality and scope, is that Cliff has microtransactions. You can buy certain items using Robux including a Climbing Pickaxe, a Parrot Friend, and a Starterpack. Peak doesn't have any such thing. It's $8 for the game itself, and that's it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is unfortunately a common phenomenon on Roblox. Plug the name of just about any game, AAA or indie, into Roblox's search feature and you'll find countless clones. On just a quick search I was able to find microtransaction-filled variations on Pokemon, Mario, Sonic, Undertale, Untitled Goose Game, Five Nights at Freddy's (woof, there are LOADS of those), Fortnite, Elden Ring, Stardew Valley, Celeste...I could go on. Some of these games are marketed as homages or fangames, but many just straight-up use stolen assets from the games they're based on, and others are pretty blatant clones trying to disguise themselves by changing some proper nouns around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given Roblox's historical <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-makes-big-changes-to-parental-controls-amid-pedophile-hellscape-report">whack-a-mole approach to moderation</a> it's hard to say whether or not Aggro Crab's callout will have any effect on Cliff. But at least the studio has made its wishes known. Probably, the solution is just to buy Peak. But if you're so desperate you're going to play Cliff instead, the developers would prefer you engage in some piracy instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Developed by Strange Scaffold (creators of I Am Your Beast and Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3) in collaboration with Paramount Game Studios, the game mixes the strategic thinking of turn-based combat with the satisfying chaos of beat-’em-up action, bringing a refreshing edge to the franchise.</p><p>Set in a darker timeline where both Splinter and Shredder are dead, and the Turtles are on the brink of adulthood, Tactical Takedown tells a gritty coming-of-age story across 20 evolving, diorama-style levels. The game is driven by a genre-smashing soundtrack from award-winning composer RJ Lake, keeping battles intense and the energy high.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0prD_mVl45g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0prD_mVl45g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Launching alongside the console debut is the all-new Remix Mode, which will also be released as a free update for the existing PC version. Remix Mode doubles the enemy variety and introduces unique attack patterns that force players to rethink their strategies. Familiar foes become unpredictable, and survival means adapting on the fly, making every decision count more than ever.</p><p>For those who crave deep customization, Remix Mode also brings enhanced build crafting. As players face off against iconic enemies like the Foot Clan, they'll unlock skills, swap out gear, and build powerful loadouts for each Turtle. Whether you're mastering Michelangelo's speed or Donatello's tech-driven tactics, you decide the best way to take down the bad guys. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-the-perfect-time-to-buy-a-used-video-game-console.1262856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>We’re in the first video game console generation where prices are going up instead of coming down. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-price-deal-discount-tariffs-xbox-switch-2-trump-1851778878">It’s rough out there</a>, especially if you were someone who was waiting on the sidelines for the right deal before finally buying a Nintendo Switch or upgrading to a PS5. But the good news is that even if <em>new</em> consoles keep getting more expensive, used versions have never been more affordable.</p> <p>If you asked me for the best deal in gaming right now, I’d probably say the Switch Lite. It arrived back in 2019 and as low-end dedicated gaming handhelds go, it performs decently well. Best of all, it has access to one of the best gaming libraries ever assembled. If you’ve never owned a Switch before, you can instantly start playing anything from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> and<em> Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> to <em>Hades</em> and <em>Stardew Valley</em> on one of the most convenient form factors around. The only downside is that despite coming out six years ago, it’s never received a price cut. In fact, following Nintendo’s latest price hikes in <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">response to tariffs</a>, it’s now $230 to buy new.</p> <p>Used, however, you can get one in decent shape for just $100. According to reseller pricing data logged on <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-switch/nintendo-switch-lite-gray">Price Charts</a>, that’s around the lowest it’s ever been, and prices don’t seem likely to spike again in the near future. It’s a similar story for the base model Switch with the blue and red Joy-Con. Recently raised to $340 new, you can get one for <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-switch/nintendo-switch-with-blue-and-red-joy-con-version-2">less than half that used</a>. Prices for other older used consoles are also at all-time lows. A 1TB PS4 Slim hovers just above $100 right now. The cheapest Xbox One right now is just $98. Some of the newer consoles have decent used discounts as well.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000614754" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614754"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614754">Price Charts / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Lets start with the Xbox Series S. It launched at $300, was frequently on sale for $250, and is now going for $380 new at GameStop. That’s nuts! The whole point of the Series S is that it can’t play discs or run games at 4K but it can give you convenient access to all of the great stuff that rotates through Game Pass. Used, however, the Series S remains a great bargain. While it once dipped down to as low as $160 in 2023, it’s still easy to find second-hand <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/xbox-series-x/xbox-series-s-console">for around $200</a>. That makes it the cheapest way to play <em>Helldivers 2</em> when it comes to Xbox this month. <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/xbox-series-x/xbox-series-x-1tb-console">At around $375</a>, a used Xbox Series X is nearly double the price, but still way less than its current $600 MSRP.</p> <p>The PS5 is, surprisingly, an even better used deal than the Series X, probably in part because there’s way more of them floating around in the first place. Sony hasn’t raised the prices on its hardware in the U.S. yet and you can still grab one of the new <em>Astro Bot</em> PS5 slim bundles for just $450. Used, the slim with a disc drive <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/playstation-5/playstation-5-slim-disc-edition">runs about $330</a>, while the all-digital base PS5 can be found <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/playstation-5/playstation-5-console-digital-version">for $300 or lower</a>. That’s only a third off the sticker price, but still not bad. At $70 each, that’s the same as buying both<em> Borderlands 4</em> and <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> new this fall.</p> <p>There’s sometimes been a stigma around buying used consoles. GameStop refusing to price them competitively is part of that. You also don’t always know how well looked-after a system was. Has it been overheating from dust-clogged fans? <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-repairmen-explain-why-cockroaches-love-ps4s-1794393470">Is it infested with bugs</a>? My personal experience with used consoles in the modern era has been quite positive, though. A used Xbox One I purchased in the mid aughts lasted me until I traded it in toward my Series S. A Switch I bought on Facebook last Christmas for just $200 (it also included <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> and Switch Sports) still feels practically brand new.</p> <p>The only used console you can’t get a deal on right now is the Switch 2. Even pre-owned versions are going for over the current $450 MSRP. It’ll probably only get worse if and when Nintendo eventually raises that price as well. Fortunately, at least for now, most of the games worth playing on Switch 2 are still available on Switch 1.</p>

<p>EA Sports was so committed to getting input delay and response time sorted out for online play in EA Sports FC 26 that it actually went to players’ houses to test the connections.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, senior producer Sam Rivera said that the developers worked with pro players and content creators to make sure they had everything they needed to solve the issue.</p>



<p><strong>“We really needed to understand the root of the problem,”</strong> Rivera <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fc-26-developer-ea-sports-actually-visited-content-creators-homes-to-test-their-internet-connections-and-uncover-the-real-reasons-for-input-delay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told IGN</a>. <strong>“We worked with pro players, we gathered data from players all around the world to try to understand the issues, but we didn’t want to only listen to the feedback. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“We wanted to experience input delay ourselves. So we also traveled to Europe to meet with pro players at their eSports studios. We actually met with content creators at their homes, and we learned a lot.”</strong></p>



<p>By taking these steps, Rivera said that the problem was caused by a variety of factors whether it be network connection, being wired or Wi-Fi, or even in-game animations.</p>



<p><strong>“Sometimes we request actions in the game that are very difficult to perform,”</strong> he said. <strong>“So if there’s a very fast incoming ball and I want to go for a long pass backwards, that is very difficult, and sometimes there are no animations for that. So it is like in real life, very difficult to perform. It’s difficult for us to capture those animations.”</strong></p>



<p>Rivera added, however, that the team added a number of new animations to the game to have “more coverage” for those instances. He also spoke on the EA Sports FC 26 animation system in general, calling it “one of the most complicated systems”. The system, he says, has <strong>“solve every request, every shot, every pass, considering what animations are available, where the opponents are, how the ball is moving, and all of that.”</strong></p>



<p>While there are a number of improvements, it’s unlikely that input delay will ever be completely solved. There are too many factors to go into the cause. But Rivera says that the potential is there to make it the best it’s ever been.</p>



<p><strong>“There’s a big opportunity there,”</strong> he said. <strong>“We have done a very good step in FC 26 to create a more responsive game.”</strong></p>



<p>EA Sports FC launches on September 19 for those with the Deluxe Edition of the game. Those without will have to wait until September 26.</p>
