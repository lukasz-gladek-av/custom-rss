            <p>The<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/movies/street-fighter"> Street Fighter movie</a> may have found its Chun-Li, who will reportedly be a "lead female role" in the 2026 adaptation.</p>
<p>Callina Liang, known for her roles in recent thriller Presence and high school drama Bad Genius, has been picked for the role of one of gaming's biggest female fighters <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/street-fighter-movie-casts-callina-liang-chun-li-1236439931/">according to Deadline</a>.</p>

<p>Additional details on the Street Fighter movie are scarce. We know Capcom is "deeply involved" with the adaptation thanks to a report by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-finds-its-director-1236140934/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, but the premise or other featured characters remains a mystery.</p>
<p>What we do know is Chun-Li has found herself in a second surge of popularity - not thanks to the excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, but due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> where a crossover skin introduced her to a new generation of fans. This skin has also recently made a return to the battle royale, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1lj01px/chunli_is_1st_best_seller_for_3_days_straight_so/">quickly becoming the top selling cosmetic in-game</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Atomfall was a thoroughly intriguing, if flawed, game. Set in the Great British countryside after the worst nuclear accident in the UK’s history, its rendition of Cumbria featured four beautiful areas to explore, sleuth through, and shoot things in. Now it’s time to wander down the jetty, hop on a boat and visit the ominously named Wicked Isle DLC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Wicked Isle DLC Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5HdforNUuuE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Wicked Isle runs in parallel to the main game, which is to say, it’s another region you can access alongside the others. This being the case, it intriguingly features a new story that is both self-contained, but also connects back to the main story and provides new endings to reach. All you have to do is go to the dock in Wyndham and chat with a grizzled, old sea captain. He’ll give you a quick boat ride to a place called Midsummer Isle if you agree to find something for him – some literally blessed mead, as it turns out.</p>


<p>This is an interesting enough pitch for those wanting a bit more Atomfall, but once things get going, you’ll quickly realise that this is largely more of the same as the main game, except now there are some monks involved. I don’t just mean that this feels similar, I mean that the specific story for this island is close to a complete retread of the plot.&nbsp;Once you realise this, you notice how little information you’re actually finding most of the time, just letters from people about the mysterious voice, being one with the soil – you know, the usual.</p>


<p>The most helpful information you gain comes from memories of conversations from many years ago, as shadows or ghosts of monks have conversations. These lack impact for a few reasons, not least of which being that you’re just stood there awkwardly watching them unfold, and it’s far from a unique method of delivering information in video games. If this DLC had been part of the original game, it would fit right in and perhaps be a highlight, but for anyone who’s completed a playthrough, an expansion needs to bring something fresh or new, and this one doesn’t. Even the new endings are extremely similar, with just a few details changed, to the ones in the main game.</p>
<p>This feeling persists into the gameplay as well. I experienced some AI oddities in my run through the main game, but in Wicked Isle they were all over the place. Enemies were getting stuck when trying to climb over something because they keep inexplicably jerking back away from the ledge, enemies were just not moving or shooting at all, clipping through cover, or just generally being poor. Maybe I got lucky on the main game playthrough, or unlucky here, but it’s felt particularly bad.</p>
<p>There’s the same mix of enemy types to encounter – bandits and the infected – but there are two new foes to face. One is a boss fight that was quite novel and fun, the other is an aquatic feral, which would be a nice surprise if the first thing I thought when I saw one wasn’t “that is a drowner from the Witcher 3, isn’t it?” because they look, move, attack, and sound exactly like them, but are even more annoying to fight because <em>you can’t dodge or block!</em></p>

<p>Returning to Atomfall also means returning to its gameplay systems. Honestly, I don’t know how I played through the game on the recommended difficulty. I was miserable when I first returned to play this DLC, constantly running out of ammunition, still wishing for a dodge or block in melee combat, the severely limited inventory, and infected enemies that can literally soak up six full shots to the head from a sniper rifle. I ended up tuning the difficulty by making ammo more common and enemies far less tough and it was a huge improvement. Sure I could still run out of ammo sometimes, but now at least I have a chance of meleeing everyone, even without being able to block, which is still one of the most mystifying decisions I’ve seen in a combat system. Walking around awkwardly in front of people to try and dodge their attacks is the least immersive form of combat I’ve ever encountered. It feels like a Monty Python skit.</p>
<p>Once I’d fixed the difficulty a bit, I was having fun. There are some highlights here mostly in the new characters, who are as delightfully odd as you’d expect, but then it decided to give me fetch quests back to the mainland. A side quest wanted me to traipse about the Interchange finding messages to discover what happened to someone, muttering swear words under my breath the entire time (that wasn’t a quest requirement, it happened naturally). Yes, your first guess about what happened to that person is correct, but the game wants you to wander around and to collect messages from areas that not only have enemies in them, but sometimes those enemies respawn or are replaced with other enemies when you slightly leave the area to look around a corner.</p>

<p>I wasn’t going to bother doing this side quest, but then the main story of the DLC also sent me to three different regions on the mainland, this time to spend five seconds in each digging something up, so I thought I may as well do both missions and waste as much of my time as possible. They were both very unsatisfying and just felt like obvious padding to extend the length of the DLC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bloober Team (recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be working on a remake of the first Silent Hill) has published a new developer diary to show off the combat mechanics of its next game, Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>
<p>The developers said they are putting a lot of emphasis on a tactical combat experience. Players will have to remain cautious and alert at all times because the game's enemies, the Orphans, can merge with each other. When players kill an enemy, the defeated foe can become fuel for other enemies to be absorbed and become stronger. Each encounter in the game is handcrafted, and in some cases, you can use the environment to your own advantage, such as firing at a canister or luring the enemy out into your position, or you can just go into melee and fight them head-on. Even within Bloober Team, some developers play more offensively, while others prefer a more defensive approach. It depends on the loadout, the gameplay style, and how many resources you have.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn features different types of weapons, tools, and abilities, so players will have to figure out by themselves what works best for their playstyle. Resource management is also a key in the game. More offensive players may want to craft more ammunition, while defensive players should have more health packs. Like in other survival horror games, there's also a progression tree where players can upgrade the weaponry, the tools, and the suit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Deep Dive into The Combat" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qWVTXo05K7s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bloober has also revealed to have devised specific roles for the enemies. There's runners who just run to the player and try to kill him as fast as they can. There are ranged foes who stand behind and shoot, forcing the player to get closer. There are bruisers, 'big ass tanky guys' whose only goal is to grab as much resources they can from you. The team believes these differences will create a lot of unique encounters where players must think, analyze, and decide what would be the best<br>
primary target in each instance.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn doesn't have a fixed release date yet, but it does have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release window</a>: Fall 2025.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-canceled-dev-shuts-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ambitious-voxel-sandbox-game-hytale-canceled-as-dev-shuts-down.1226628/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>developer Hypixel Studios has announced that the ambitious voxel sandbox game has been canceled, and that the studio itself will be shutting down as well.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>website, Hypixel co-founder Noxy says that the decision to shut the game down came "after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path".</p>

<p>Noxy says that despite a major engine reboot,&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>needed "a lot more time" in order for the developers to "get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision" they had for the game. According to Noxy, Hypixel's "vision evolved" and its "technical ambitions grew more complex" over time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hytale-canceled-dev-shutting-down-monsters.jpg?itok=n6GAShfQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hytale-canceled-dev-shutting-down-monsters.jpg?itok=hxGeTByO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>is shutting down, and its developer is no more, unfortunately.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>team looked at "reducing scope, adjusting timelines, and finding new angles to keep moving forward", according to Noxy, but each option "would have meant compromising on what made&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>special in the first place" and would have meant the game was not "the game [fans] deserve".</p>

<p>As for Riot Games, which acquired&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>and Hypixel (the studio, rather than the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>server; more on that in a moment) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-hytale-acqusition-adds-blocky-adventure-to-roster" rel="nofollow">back in 2020</a>, Noxy says the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>studio is supporting Hypixel during the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>.</p>

<p>According to Noxy, Riot is "ensuring [the] team is supported with generous severance and resources to help them find what's next", a move Noxy describes as "not just thoughtful", but also "human".</p>

<p>When it comes to the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>Hypixel server, Noxy assures fans that said server won't be affected by&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>'s cancellation; that server is run separately from the studio, even though they share a name, so it'll "continue to operate as usual".</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>was, its creators describe it as a game that "combines the scope of a sandbox with the depth of a roleplaying game".</p>

<p><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>would have taken place in a procedurally-generated world in which players could construct buildings and other structures, embark on adventures, and even use script to create minigames and much more. Sadly, of course, none of that will be possible within the game now.</p>

<p>The shutdown of Hypixel and the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>comes among a wider wave of studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-studio-making-it" rel="nofollow">closing down</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jagex-layoffs" rel="nofollow">reducing their headcount</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/people-can-fly-layoffs-projects-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceling projects</a>, with companies both big and small among the affected.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in March this year, game industry veteran Masahiro Sakurai received a lifetime achievement award at the 30th AMD awards. In an interview by <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/business/articles/2504/18/news061.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ITMedia Business Online</u></a> conducted at the time (recently republished on <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/8d4c8cadd4d5df79bfdb3590e6447a33d9e66434" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Yahoo Japan</u></a>), Sakurai revealed why he doesn’t hire people, reflected on how the games industry has changed, and touched on the potential use of generative AI in development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai is best known as the creator behind two of Nintendo’s big franchises, Kirby and Smash Bros. After working at game dev studio Hal Laboratories from 1989 to 2003, Sakurai became a freelance game creator, founding his own company Sora Ltd. in 2005. In 2022, he created the award-winning YouTube channel “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games</u></a>,” in which he shared insight and advice on all aspects of making a game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai’s approach differs from that of many game creators who have gone on to form their own companies. “When a game creator becomes the president of a company, it is difficult for them to fully engage in creative activities,” explained Sakurai. “There was a conflict between making interesting games and making management decisions — the problem was that being overwhelmed by the duties of being a president made it hard to focus on the vital part, game creation.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This led Sakurai to his current approach, which involves creating games without directly hiring or managing any employees. “Basically I work together with other game companies to avoid having to manage a company,” Sakurai explained. “This method has worked well so far. I am able to continue being creative and concentrate on making things without becoming extremely busy running a company.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Sakurai noted that his method is not without its challenges. Working with different game devs means that Sakurai has to “build up trusting relationships and working styles from scratch every time. So, I think it is necessary to have a certain degree of flexibility.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Sakurai, one of the most important elements when working with a team on a new project for the first time is to make sure everyone is on the same page and has a clear, shared vision of the game. “I make sure that many members of staff can share the same information at the same time, regardless of their job or whether they are designer or programmer.” Although this takes more time and planning, Sakurai said that in his experience, this approach “reduces the risk of information gaps” and misunderstandings. “Conversely, if I just conveyed my ideas to the producer, and then they assign work to various other people, then some kind of misunderstanding would occur, or even a 180 degree difference (in what was intended).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, when asked whether his approach would be the best for the game industry as a whole, Sakurai was hesitant. “It depends on the person. As for me, I had built up a track record and trust through working on Kirby and Smash Bros. titles in the past. If you don’t have this, if you don’t have any track record at all, then the work won’t come to you. This is a way of working that becomes possible through gaining more allies by continuing to make good games, and it is not a style of working that works well for everyone.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/24/gettyimages-1346038907-1750764035196.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Masahiro Sakurai has a long history of working with Nintendo. Photo by Bob Riha, Jr./Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai went on to highlight another issue in the current game industry that could make it difficult for individuals to break through as auteurs in the same way as they did in the past. “I feel like the position of game director itself is becoming rarer these days. As in, it is rather rare to find someone who, as a director, can take charge of a studio with hundreds of people,” Sakurai stated. “There are plenty of people who want to make games or who are making games, but there is a shortage of game directors who can manage projects with a large number of staff.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Sakurai’s opinion, the increased segmentation of game development into specialized roles is the reason for this lack of game directors with the “all-rounder” background necessary to oversee large-scale projects. “In the past, there was a trend by which people would go from being a graphics artist to a planner, and then become a director.” Sakurai explained. “However today, graphics alone, for example, are divided into models, effects, textures and so on. I feel it is very difficult to develop into an all-rounder in such an environment. I feel like this increasing specialization and segmentation has resulted in a lack of directors who can see things from a broad perspective.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai advised that it is important for people to understand their own individuality, and develop that accordingly. “I don’t think anyone will follow the same path that I did, but I’m sure that there will be people who break through in other directions,” said Sakurai. In other words, rather than trying to match or compete with the work and achievements of creators who have come before you, it is important to hone your own strengths and focus on what you can bring to the table. “I believe each creator should carve out their own path.” Sakurai insisted.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Top 25 Switch Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai concluded that both AAA projects and indie games are facing difficult situations. “I think it is becoming unsustainable to continue producing large games on the scale that companies currently do, as it requires too much work.” he said, before suggesting generative AI as a potential tool for helping to solve this problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“(...) the only effective breakthrough I can think of at the moment is generative AI. I think we are getting to the point where (AAA studios) have to change their way of working by using gen AI to improve work efficiency. I think we are in an era where only the companies that successfully respond to these changes will be able to survive.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai noted that indie titles have their own challenges, one being the sheer amount of competition. “Indie games are appealing for their freedom and creativity, but they also need a lot of luck, effort, polish and stand-out elements to succeed in the market.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai is currently working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> for Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>, the Minecraft competitor announced in 2018, is canceled and its developer is shutting down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hypixel Studios announced that the ambitious, Riot Games-backed Minecraft-style game had ended development, and the studio itself was in the process of winding down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale was announced in December 2018 with a trailer that has an incredible 61 million views on <a href="https://youtu.be/o77MzDQT1cg?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>. Here’s the official blurb, as it was back then:</p><blockquote>Hytale combines the scope of a sandbox with the depth of a roleplaying game, immersing players in a procedurally generated world where teetering towers and deep dungeons promise rich rewards throughout their adventures. Hytale supports everything from block-by-block construction to scripting and minigame creation, delivered using easy to use and powerful tools.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Excitement around Hytale was fueled by the experience of the developers themselves, who co-founded Hypixel, one of the most influential Minecraft servers in the world. Riot Games, maker of League of Legends, invested in the project and eventually bought the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the Hytale dream is now over. “This is not the outcome any of us — at Hypixel or at Riot — wanted,” a statement attributed to co-founder Noxy <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published to the Hytale website</a> reads. “But after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what went wrong? According to Noxy, Hytale’s technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a reboot of the game engine, the team “found that Hytale still wasn’t as far along as it needed to be.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game,” Noxy continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Options such as reducing scope and pushing the game back were rejected as they “would have meant compromising on what made Hytale special in the first place.” “It wouldn’t have been the game we set out to make,” Noxy explained. “And it wouldn’t have been the game you deserve.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Riot, it tried to find investors to save the project, but it sounds like those efforts failed to go anywhere. The affected staff are getting “generous severance and resources to help them find what’s next.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Confirmation of the cancelation comes just a few months after <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/3/spring-2025-development-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hypixel issued a spring 2025 development update</a>, where the studio revealed some of the progress it had made in the first few months of the year. It even finally revealed a new character that it had teased at the end of 2023. New engine progress was called out, with improvements highlighted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p>The timings for the event are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6pm (Thu) PDT / 7pm (Thu) MDT / 8pm (Thu) CDT / 9pm (Thu) EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2am BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3am CEST / 4am EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 10am JST / 9am AWST / 11am AEST</li></ul><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nlqust&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The official video description reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ARC SYSTEM WORKS Showcase will be broadcast, delivering the latest information on Arc System Works, including the announcement of new titles!</p>
<p>"In addition to the latest information on various game titles, including completely new titles developed and published by Arc System Works, we will also be announcing a new project that Ishiwatari Taisuke is working on."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we can probably expect to see a bit more from the studio's upcoming project with Sony Interactive Entertainment, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a>, which is scheduled to launch on PS5 and PC next year. Since Switch / Switch 2 owners won't be partaking in this release (yet), however, we're far more interested in the "announcement of new titles".</p>
<p>Arc System Works has developed and published a few key Switch titles in the past, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear: Strive</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/blazblue_cross_tag_battle">BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle</a>, so we wouldn't be surprised to see something new for Nintendo platforms in the future.</p>
<p>Specifically, Taisuke-san is tied closely to the Guilty Gear series, and with Strive originally launching four years back, it could well be time to see what's next in the long-running fighting franchise.</p>
<p>Either way, we'll be keeping a close eye on the upcoming showcase and will share any relevant news with you as soon as it happens.</p>

            <p>Yep, that sound you can hear is the pounding footsteps of a certain <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> minutefellow. He's coming to tell you that another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> settlement may soon need your help, as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-mods">modder</a>'s figured out how to let folks build stuff using the likes of rocks and beams as they play.</p>
<p>It's not quite got all the bells and whistles of a full settlement building system yet, but its creator is hoping to find someone to collab with on putting together exactly that.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Right now, MadAborModding's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4648?tab=description">settlement building proof of concept</a> lets you spawn in world objects, adjust where they're placed on the fly, and then save them in place to make permanent additions to the world. It's a bit rudimentary at current, but there are "over 12,000 spawnable objects" at your fingertips, plus the ability to put 'em wherever you like and have them be there whenever you load up the game.</p>
<p>To build, you start by either using your left and right arrow keys to scroll through the spawnable objects in a random order or save time by adding the exact ones you want to one of the mod's LUA files. From there you look at and use the up arrow on the stone wall, beam or rock you're adding in to pick it up. You'll need to put it down once to enable its collision physics, then pick it up again to place it where you want.</p>
<p>V and B move it up and down, while Z, X, and C rotate it. Once you're done, you press backspace to save your placed stuff, with the mod recording these as ini files it'll then load up next time you start the game. These ini files are also able to be copied out of the game files if you want to share a creation with other people and let them load it into their game.</p>
<p>"I hope someone expands this into an actual settlement system," the modder wrote, "My goal with uploading this is hopefully to bait someone into doing that." They added that they're open to working with other interested parties to make that happen, with categorising objects and making menus being the aspects they'd need the most help pulling off.</p>
<p>What makes his so cool is that Oblivion Remastered still lacks official modding tools, with modders left to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remastered-potential-pinnacle-of-elder-scrolls-modding-reckons-pioneer-modder">push boundaries and experiment</a> with the tools they do have. That often means there's more to install on the player's end to account for the processes at play behind-the-scenes being <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remastered-coldtyrant-modder-interview-evil-faction-quests">less straightforward</a>, which makes it impressive that all MadAborModding's creation looks to require is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS for OblivionRemastered</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-fallout-4-style-building-from-modder-who-wants-to-collaborate-on-a-full-settlement-system]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A man has been arrested after being accused of stealing "approximately $10,000 worth" of Nintendo Switch video games from US libraries.</p>
<p>The man in question is Jamal Reed-Obafumi, who is said to have targeted multiple public libraries in Northern California. As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/man-accused-of-stealing-10000-worth-of-switch-games-from-libraries/1100-6532651/">GameSpot</a>, the Marin County Sheriff's Office said on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MarinCountySheriff/posts/pfbid0ooLynurh5d2koiZcGqVUTRTvGhHYRgsDuQXGaLaHtHihBZ4Y9kiY5BhEyxoUGdDpl">Facebook</a> it had arrested 45-year-old Reed-Obafumi earlier this month, on 17th June.</p>

<p>The Office alleged Reed-Obafumi was "connected to a string of at least seven different burglaries of Marin County Libraries". These incidents took place between April and June of this year, although specific libraries were not mentioned.</p>
<p>According to the Facebook post, Reed-Obafumi now faces 12 felony charges. These include multiple "counts of burglary", in addition to "committing a felony while out on bail", the Marin County Sheriff's Office said, before closing:</p>
<p>"Our libraries are pillars of the community and must be safeguarded for everyone to enjoy!"</p>
<p>It is currently unclear if any of the stolen Switch games have been recovered. Eurogamer has contacted the Marin County Sheriff's Office for comment.</p>

<figure><a title="Fast Fusion - PURE Update 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4d6772b28bbdb/fast-fusion-pure-update-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Shin'en Multimedia</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shin'en Multimedia has been hard at work on the first major update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> on the Switch 2, and we can now exclusively reveal that it will launch this week on <strong>26th June 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>But what do you get with it? Well, Shin'en has confirmed to us that the 'Pure Update' – which is completely free, by the way – will contain three new tracks based on classics from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>. These will be largely faithful recreations of fan favourites from the original 2017 Switch launch title, but with small tweaks to make use of the new 'Hyperjump' feature along with all new visuals and effects.</p><p><figure data-videoid="NK1xJVeVTDM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5b9621oxwmgr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK1xJVeVTDM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<h2>Carbium Cup</h2>
<p>- Alpine Trust<br>
- Sunahara Plains<br>
- Zenshoh Habitat</p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to the new tracks, the Pure Update will also include a new performance mode simply called 'Pure', which renders at 1440p dynamic resolution with no upscaling applied. Fan feedback from the game's release was that the visuals could often look a little blurry due to the application of DLSS, so hopefully this new option will completely erradicate this.</p>
<p>That's not all, though. Shin'en has also shared that the Alpine Trust track will implement a new GPU particle system for the snowflakes effect, and we honestly can't wait to see this in action. We're also getting two new Jukebox entries, tweaks to make progression slightly easier (specifically a lower price for the third cup), a bug fix to resolve a rare crash when switching rendering modes often, and several smaller fixes and corrections.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a closer look at the new tracks:</p>


<p>Fast Fusion is a real showstopper launch title for the Switch 2, earning a well-deserved score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">9/10 in our review</a>. We said that it's "easily the most accomplished entry in Shin'en Multimedia's series so far" and is "an absolute must-buy" for new Switch 2 owners.</p>
<p>If, however, you thought the overall content was a little slim, then hopefully this first major update will help alleviate this with the addition of three new tracks.</p>

            <p>Anticipation for the next mainline entry in the Resident Evil series is evidently high.</p>
<p>Capcom has today announced that Resident Evil Requiem has already had "over" one million of us add the upcoming game to our wishlists.</p>
<p>"Thank you," <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/1937289617008427060">Capcom wrote on social media</a>, with a little infographic showing the figure alongside Grace Ashcroft.</p>

<p>While this does not equate to actual games sales, we are all clearly very keen for the next Resident Evil release. And, it seems rightly so. Our Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>, which bodes well!</p>
<p>Back in April, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-remake-becomes-fastest-game-in-the-series-to-sell-10m">the Resident Evil 4 Remake has now sold more than 10m copies</a>. It managed to hit that milestone faster than any other game in the Resi series to date. Could today's wishlisted figure for Resident Evil Requiem mean that Resi 9 will potentially take that milestone crown on its release next year? Time will tell.</p>
<p>We got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem earlier this month, when the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>. We can expect yet another look in just a couple of days' time, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-spotlight-announced-for-next-week-with-resident-evil-requiem-pragmata-and-more-to-feature">Capcom hosts its Spotlight showcase on 26th June</a>.</p>

<p>Along with Resident Evil Requiem, the developer will also give us another look at its astronaut and small girl-starring game Pragmata, as well as existing titles <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>During this stream, the developer will delve further into the newest update for Monster Hunter Wilds. As our Dom wrote yesterday, after a strong start for Wilds the game has suffered an influx of overwhelmingly negative Steam reviews. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">Can Capcom turn things around with Monster Hunter Wilds' upcoming Title Update 2</a>?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-already-looks-set-for-massive-success-as-it-hits-significant-wishlist-milestone]]></content:encoded>

<p>"About 3 times slower than the original Steam Deck LCD"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="slow lcd df switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1fbd80acc0dfd/slow-lcd-df-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We already <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic">reported a few days back</a> that the boffins over at Digital Foundry were less than impressed with the Switch 2's LCD screen after running various tests on it.</p>
<p>Now, however, DF's John Linneman has <a href="https://x.com/dark1x/status/1937199770788901151">weighed in on social media</a> to confirm that the new screen is more "problematic" than had first appeared—and then some.</p>
<p>On his social media, Linneman pointed to tests run on the Switch 2 LCD on a specialist PC Monitor site, <a href="https://chimolog.co/">Chimilog</a>:</p>

<p>As you can see, the Switch 2's screen is at the bottom of the list of LCDs when put through a gauntlet of technical tests to measure its performance. The image in his post, on the left, shows average response times of 32 LCDs, and the Switch 2 lands with the worst time here.</p>
<p>Linneman also compares the performance to being "about three times slower than the original Steam Deck LCD" and states once again, as we'd covered in our previous article, that it's actually <em>worse</em> in some ways than the 2017 Switch LCD.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, we (or this writer at the very least) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/weve-seen-switch-2s-lcd-screen-in-the-flesh-and-it-really-doesnt-feel-like-a-downgrade">have been very happy with our screens thus far</a>, and judging by the general reception to it, most gamers perhaps don't need to sweat this stuff.</p>
<p>Still, it's a shame that the screen just doesn't seem to be up to the standard it perhaps could, and should, have been as part of a brand new console circa 2025. There's always the Switch 2 OLED Model though, right?</p>

			<p>PlayStation has been sued in the Netherlands over the high prices of digital games and in-game content, which the company can force upon users with its dominant position in the market.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-playstation-sued-in-the-netherlands-in-class-action-lawsuit-over-artificially-high-playstation-prices.1226472/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument, a Dutch non-profit consumer foundation representing large groups of consumers in class action lawsuits, confirmed today on its<a href="https://www.massaschadeconsument.nl/nieuws/2025-06-24-sony-gedagvaard-in-collectieve-rechtszaak-om-kunstmatig-hoge-playstation-prijzen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> official website</a> that it has summoned Sony in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Dutch PlayStation players over the company exploiting its dominant position in the console market, and denying potential app stores access to its gaming systems. The class action lawsuit is the culmination of the Fair PlayStation campaign launched back in February, which highlighted how, in the PlayStation 5 generation, consumers are being pushed more and more towards digital-only consoles, where games and in-game content can only be purchased exclusively via the PlayStation Store. This dominant position led to the establishment of the so-called Sony tax, artificially high prices that make gamers pay much more for digital games and in-game content than they would in a free market.</p>
<p>In its summons, the Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument foundation accuses PlayStation of excluding competition and exploiting consumers and game developers, utilizing its dominant position in the market. By removing consumers' and third-party publishers' choice, Sony greatly profits from the situation, making more than twice as much margin on digital sales as on retail copies. As such, the advantages of digital distribution go entirely to the Japanese company. Since 2013, the damage to Dutch consumers has amounted to 435 million euros.</p>
<p>The next step in this class action lawsuit will be the first hearing, which may already take place this year. The Dutch court will evaluate its jurisdiction on the matter and the admissibility of the foundation. If the court grants the claim, the foundation expects Sony to be forced to open the market for selling digital PlayStation content to other providers, which is extremely unlikely to happen, at least not directly via PlayStation consoles.</p>
<p>With the pricing of digital games on PlayStation 5 being extremely high and the market being pushed more and more towards an all-digital future, there's definitely some merit to the Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument class action lawsuit. Hopefully, this will lead to some much-needed changes, especially at a time when gaming is becoming an increasingly more expensive hobby, with prices of <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">consoles</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">games</a> rising across the board.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Six or so years on from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hypixels-riot-backed-hytale-announced">an announcement trailer</a> that made it clear people had an appetite for their game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y building and survival shenanigans (it's got 61 million views to date), Hypixel Studios have announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has been cancelled. On top of that, the studio themselves are gearing up for closure.</p>
<p>Hytale's development kicked off all the way back in 2015, with its devs being the folks behind the huge <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecraft-biggest-servers">Hypixel Minecraft server</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> publisher Riot Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-have-bought-hytale-developers-hypixel-studios">bought the studio</a> in 2020, not long after we learned that Hytale would have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-will-have-undead-chickens">undead chickens</a>, and not long before the game's target release year started being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-wont-be-launching-until-2023-at-the-earliest">pushed</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-devs-are-redeveloping-its-engine-say-no-release-in-2023">back</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This is not the outcome any of us - at Hypixel or at Riot - wanted," Hypixel co-founder Noxy wrote in <a href="https://www.hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale">an update post</a> on the studio's website, "But after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise."</p>
<p>He went on to paint a picture of feature creep lining the road to the game's demise, explaining:</p>
<blockquote>Over time, as our vision evolved and the genre matured around us, the bar kept rising. Our technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a major reboot of the game engine, the team found that Hytale still wasn’t as far along as it needed to be. It became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game. We looked at reducing scope, adjusting timelines, and finding new angles to keep moving forward. But each of those options would have meant compromising on what made Hytale special in the first place. It wouldn’t have been the game we set out to make. And it wouldn’t have been the game you deserve.</blockquote>
<p>Noxy added that the studio did try to seek out "investors or acquirers who could continue to help carry Hytale forward" once Riot had made the call to pull its backing, but this looks to have come to nought. With Hypixel Studios now "winding down", the co-founder thanked the publisher for providing "generous severance and resources" to staff who're being laid off.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that Hypixel's Minecraft server will continue to run as normal despite the cancellation and impending closure.</p>
<p>It's a really unfortunate end for Hytale, assuming the game isn't able to be resurrected in some way further down the line, especially given the decade Hypixel put into developing it. "We’re proud of what we built, and we’ll carry those lessons forward into whatever comes next," Noxy wrote to close out his post.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a massive improvement over the original in terms of visuals and a very effective showcase of the Decima Engine.</p>
<p>A new video shared on YouTube by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Nick930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick930</a> puts the second entry in the series side-by-side with the Director's Cut release of the first entry in the franchise by Hideo Kojima running on PlayStation 5 Pro, comparing character models, environments, animations, and more. By all metrics, the new entry in the series is a massive improvement over its predecessor, and a great showcase of what can be achieved using the Decima Engine, so much so that the two games don't feel like they are only five years apart.</p>
<p><iframe title="Death Stranding 2: On the Beach vs Original | Direct Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nyMDgwTET2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach doesn't just look better than its predecessor, but it's also a better game, and the culmination of Hideo Kojima's best and worst ideas, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">review-in-progress</a>.</p>
<p><em>As impossible to describe as the first, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a culmination of some of Kojima's best (and worst) ideas all in one package that's more cohesive and less coherent than anything his team has done so far.</em></p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launches on PlayStation 5 on June 26th worldwide. Owners of the Deluxe Edition can play the game already, thanks to the included 48-hour early access perk.</p>

Hypixel Studios, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223667/riot-games-league-of-legends-hypixel-studios-minecraft-hytale">Riot acquired in 2020</a> for an undisclosed sum, is shutting down “over the next few months,” according to Hypixel CEO Aaron “Noxy” Donaghey.</p><p>“After years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring <em>Hytale </em>to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise,“ says Donaghey in a <a href="https://x.com/noxywoxy/status/1937180229031940439?s=46">post on X</a>. ”This is a painful decision. We still believe in <em>Hytale</em>. We believe in the team, and are forever grateful to every member, past or present, who poured their love into the game.“</p><p><em>Hytale</em> has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/14o3p7n/the_slow_development_of_hytale_a_timeline/">been in development</a> since 2015, when Hypixel was founded as a small indie studio by members of a popular <em>Minecraft </em>server network. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o77MzDQT1cg">trailer was released</a> in late 2018, and Hypixel was supposed to deliver a beta of <em>Hytale</em> in 2021 following the Riot acquisition a year prior. That beta never arrived, and in 2021 there was a major change to the game engine powering <em>Hytale</em> that set development back.</p><p>“Our technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a major reboot of the game engine, the team found that <em>Hytale</em> still wasn’t as far along as it needed to be,“ says Donaghey. ”It became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game.“</p><p>The Hypixel closure won’t affect the Hypixel server on Minecraft, which is run separately from Hypixel Studios. Despite the studio closure, Donaghey says he’s “deeply grateful to Riot” and that the team is being “supported with generous severance and resources to help them find what’s next.”</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/691791/riot-games-hypixel-studios-hytale-closure]]></content:encoded>

Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We still believe in the core concept of the Deep Desert — an endlessly renewing location that resets every week and creates an activity loop for great rewards. The tension of heading out there, head on a swivel, eyes peeled for foes as you enter the most dangerous part of the most dangerous planet in the universe, Our wish was that players would embrace this loop, forming guilds to work together to overcome the bleakness of the Deep Desert. But as Stephen King says, 'Wish in one hand, sh*t in the other, see which one fills up first.' One of my hands is overflowing right now and sadly not with wishes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bylos admitted that the "extremely competitive nature" of the Deep Desert was forcing players to engage when they may prefer PvP, and consequently, some areas of the Deep Desert will now be flagged as "Partial Warfare (PvE)" where players can grab rare resources without getting ambushed. The largest spice fields, shipwrecks and Landsraad control points will remain "War of Assassins (PvP)" as "high reward, high risk" areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the whole game is balanced around guilds and groups, so if you prefer to be a lone wolf, you can expect it to be "grindy if [you] play solo."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Orni griefing? "Thopters will always be incredibly important for crossing the desert, but they shouldn’t also be the dominant force in actual battles," Bylos said, adding that the following will be implemented "shortly": </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Scout Ornithopters with rocket launchers attached will have their speed maneuverability reduced</li><li>Rockets fired from Scout Ornithopters will have increased heat generation</li><li>Thrusters will provide a max speed bonus regardless of wings, ensuring that thruster equipped scouts will be the fastest vehicles in the game </li><li>A new T5 infantry rocket launcher will be added to help improve the dynamics of vehicle/ground combat </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the Landsraad. Bylos defines it as "an umbrella for all endgame activities," such as dungeons, contracts, and "more specialized delivery tasks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As a system it is an activity driver that is designed to promote the conflict between the factions, internal politics between the guilds, while providing goal thresholds for individuals and groups to work towards getting personal rewards," the director explained. "And the Landsraad should be doing that for everyone who wants to participate in the elder game, be they PvEer or PvPer. The Landsraad should be giving you things to do every day and every week. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s nothing new, from a design perspective, we’ve seen daily/weekly quest systems in games for a long time. Our approach was to try and frame this system around the greater politics of the Dune universe, by having players engage in activities to earn the votes of the various Landsraad houses." Consequently, Funcom will shortly be addressing "key flaws" in the Landsraad design, too, including stockpiling, which is currently rewarded but was not designed to be that way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Once a live game launches, it becomes a collaborative effort between the developers and the players to make it something amazing," Bylos concluded. "We appreciate your feedback on what we hope is the beginning of a long journey together. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Bear with us — our intention is to be clear and open in our communications and to make Dune: Awakening a game that everybody can enjoy."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dune: Awakening Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-dev-working-on-pvp-and-deep-desert-issues-as-new-concurrent-user-peak-record-is-set"><u>Dune: Awakening a Great 8/10 in our review</u></a>, writing: "Dune: Awakening is an excellent survival MMO that captures Frank Herbet’s sci-fi world incredibly well, mostly to its advantage and occasionally to its detriment.
