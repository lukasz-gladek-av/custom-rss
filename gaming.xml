<figure data-uuid="6b57afb47ef56"><a title="AC Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b57afb47ef56/ac-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft has announced a major organisational restructure to refocus its initiatives and improve efficiency.</p>
<p>In a press release, the company confirmed that it plans to "close several studios" and "continue restructuring throughout the Group" in order to achieve its goals. It reconfirmed the closure of its Halifax studio, along with restructuring at Abu Dhabi, RedLynx and Massive. It will also reinforce a working structure of five days in office environments, which will be supported by yearly allowances to work from home.</p>
<p>Naturally, news of studio closures also means that several games – six, to be precise – have been discontinued. This includes <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/prince_of_persia_the_sands_of_time_remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a> along with three brand new IPs and a mobile game. Yes, we know that totals five, so who knows what the sixth is.</p>
<p>On the flip side, seven unspecified titles will be granted additional development time to ensure they meet the quality standards set by Ubisoft. One of these games, originally scheduled to launch in fiscal year 2026, has been pushed to fiscal year 2027.</p>
<p>Ubisoft will primarily focus on open-world games and 'Games as a Service' titles, which it says will be supported by "targeted investments, deeper specialization, and cutting-edge technology, including accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI." Good lord...</p>
<p>Starting from April, Ubisoft's operating model will centre around five "creative houses", each of which will be wholly responsible for the games it creates, including development and marketing. Each house will focus on specific genres, and the general outline looks a little like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>CH1 - Flagship (<strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong>, <strong>Far Cry,</strong> <strong>Rainbow Six</strong>)</li>
<li>CH2 - Shooters/Competitive titles (<strong>The Division</strong>, <strong>Ghost Recon</strong>, <strong>Splinter Cell</strong>)</li>
<li>CH3 - Live Service Games (<strong>For Honor</strong>, <strong>The Crew</strong>, <strong>Riders Republic</strong>, <strong>Brawlhalla</strong>, <strong>Skull &amp; Bones</strong>)</li>
<li>CH4 - Narrative Adventures (<strong>Anno</strong>, <strong>Might &amp; Magic</strong>, <strong>Rayman</strong>, <strong>Prince of Persia</strong>, <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</strong>)</li>
<li>CH5 - Family Friendly Games (<strong>Just Dance</strong>, <strong>Idle Miner Tycoon</strong>, <strong>Ketchapp</strong>, <strong>Hungry Shark</strong>, <strong>Invincible: Guarding the Globe</strong>, <strong>Uno</strong>, <strong>Hasbro</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, Ubisoft will be taking the next three years or so to completely refocus its portfolio and effectively reallocate its resources.</p>
<p>It's likely that we'll see the effects of this major announcement come to fruition over the coming days and weeks, so we'll be sure to let you know of any future developments. Ubisoft itself will be sharing additional information on <strong>12th February 2026</strong>.</p>

              <p>The very first design for Pokémon mascot Pikachu was a delightfully chubby little fellow. Chunkachu, as it’s lovingly known, was Mitsuhiro Arita’s original drawing for the 1996 Japanese Pokémon card, and it gave the yellow mouse a lot more to love than he has in most modern renditions. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of <em>Pokémon</em> this year, Takara Tomy is releasing a proper chungus of a plushie in that original design.</p> <p>It’s going to be a very busy year for&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em>. 2026 is the 30th anniversary of not only the release of the very first&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> games, Japan’s <em>Pocket Monsters </em><em>Red</em> and&nbsp;<em>Green</em> on February 27 of 1996, but also the very first Japanese <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards with October 20, 1996’s 1st Starter &amp; Expansion Pack, meaning the celebrations are going to last the whole year. And that’s a very good excuse to remember how Pikachu used to look, both in the game and on the cards, before he got the Mounjaro.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661887" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661887"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661887">© Tomy / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The new plush comes not from The Pokémon Company and isn’t available on its various Pokémon Center stores, but rather is being sold by toy giant <a href="https://takaratomymall.jp/shop/g/g8202602097181/">Takara Tomy</a>, and currently only in Japan. The extremely cuddle-able stuffed toy is 7,480 yen, or about $47, which isn’t too bad for a 40 cm tall cuddly. At the time of writing it’s sold out on Tomy’s site, though more expensive options for purchase still seem to pop up on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0GG8Y6125?th=1">Amazon’s Japanese site</a>.</p> <p>Chunkachu has been celebrated across the decades in <em>Pokémon</em>, not least with the design of the monster’s <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/vmaxclimax/46.jpg">VMAX incarnation</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/25thanniversarycollection/1.jpg">updated versions of the original artwork</a> appearing during the 25th anniversary celebrations. But for the most part, the far more slimmed-down rendition of Pikachu is the recognizable emblem of the entire franchise. And fair enough—name a beloved cartoon character that didn’t look all kinds of weirdly different in their first form than the version we got used to. Oh my dear god, original Garfield.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000661873" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661873"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661873">© Jim Davis</figcaption></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has announced that its new operating model features 5 Creative Houses, supported by a Creative Network. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Ubisoft has just announced a major restructure to the organization, with the new model focusing on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world adventures and GaaS-native experiences</a>. This has led to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of the Prince of Persia Remake</a> and several other titles. Moreover, several studios will be closed, and layoffs are expected across the company. Check out how the new model will function below. </p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-s-5-creative-houses-are-built-on-a-decentralized-model">Ubisoft’s 5 Creative Houses Are Built on a Decentralized Model </h2>



<p>As revealed in the latest <a href="http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, the new operating model for Ubisoft features 5 Creative Houses and will start from April 2026. It is supported by a Creative Network that will provide development resources, shared Core Services, and a reshaped HQ. The new decentralized model will lead to 3 significant changes: </p>



<ul>
<li>Firstly, the game development and go-to-market functions will be combined for a gamer-centric approach, and they will be fully responsible for brand development, content strategy, and editorial direction. </li>



<li>The new Creative Houses have been shaped by distinctive genres, which are led by “high-profile, incentivized teams with a unique set of expertise in those genres.”</li>



<li>Lastly, the teams will have full financial ownership and account for economic performance.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-s-creative-houses-have-been-divided-by-genre">Ubisoft’s Creative Houses Have Been Divided by Genre</h2>



<ul>
<li>The first Creative House is the newly formed Vantage Studios, which will work on Ubisoft’s largest established franchises, aiming to turn them into “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-assassins-far-cry-rainbow-six-billionare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual billionaire brands</a>“: Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. </li>



<li>Creative House 2 will focus on competitive and cooperative shooter experiences: The Division, Ghost Recon, and Splinter Cell. </li>



<li>The third Creative House will be centered around live experiences: For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla, and Skull &amp; Bones. </li>



<li>Creative House 4 will feature immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes: Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, and Beyond Good &amp; Evil. </li>



<li>The last and final Creative House will be dedicated to casual and family-friendly titles: Just Dance, Idle Miner Tycoon, Ketchapp, Hungry Shark, Invincible: Guarding the Globe, Uno, and Hasbro. </li>
</ul>



<p>On top of these, Ubisoft is working on 4 new IPs, including March of Giants. The division of these IPs across the Creative Houses will be revealed at a later stage. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Ubisoft is canceling six games in development, including its troubled remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. The publisher is also delaying seven other games in its development pipeline.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-has-cancelled-6-games-including-the-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/"><em>Video Games Chronicle</em></a>, Ubisoft held a call with select media to announce it is undergoing a “major organisational, operational and portfolio reset.” It plans to accomplish this via three pillars: new operating model, a “refocused portfolio with a meaningfully revised 3-year roadmap," and “the rightsizing of the organization.”</p><p>A <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">press release</a> states:</p><p>“Ubisoft's strategic decision to undertake this major reset is driven by the continued shift toward a persistently more selective AAA market and an increasingly competitive shooter landscape, combined with the growing challenge for publishers to create brands in a context of higher costs. Nevertheless, when successful, exceptional AAA content has more financial potential than ever. While last years’ progress with its production processes translated into improved levels of quality for Ubisoft games in 2025, today’s market environment requires that the Group step-changes how it is organized and operates with a view to delivering exceptional games quality at more competitive costs.”</p><p>This new operating model will center on five creative houses, each responsible for various Ubisoft IPs and possessing expertise in distinct genres (including its <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-creates-new-subsidiary-for-its-biggest-franchises-with-tencent-as-minority-owner">new subsidiary Vantage Studios</a>). This simplified structure is designed to facilitate execution of the company’s strategy to focus more on “Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences, supported by targeted investments, deeper specialization, and cutting-edge technology, including accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI.” This new organizational structure will begin in early April.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdhrdKu1SCA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdhrdKu1SCA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>After conducting a thorough portfolio review, it was decided that Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake will be canceled. The game was<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2020/09/10/ubisoft-remakes-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time"> first announced</a> in September 2020 with a 2021 launch date and was originally helmed by Ubisoft's Indian studios in Mumbai and Pune. After suffering <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/02/05/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-indefinitely">a pair of delays</a>, development shifted to Ubisoft Montreal in 2022. During Ubisoft Forward in 2024, The Sands of Time remake <a href="https://gameinformer.com/ubisoft-forward/2024/06/10/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-is-coming-in-2026">resurfaced with a 2026 launch window</a>. Its most recent update came in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/16/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-shows-signs-of-life-with-small-update">June 2025</a> with a social media post reconfirming the game's continued development.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft has also ceased development of four unannounced games, which consisted of three new IPs and a mobile title, stating these titles, along with Prince of Persia, “do not meet the new enhanced quality as well as more selective portfolio prioritization criteria”.</p><p>Additionally, Ubisoft is delaying seven unannounced games “in order to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation.” One of the games was slated to launch in Fiscal Year (FY) 26 and will now arrive during FY 27. While we don’t know what these projects are yet, one of them is reportedly the heavily rumored (but not officially confirmed) remake of Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, which appeared on PEGI’s website in December as<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-has-been-listed-on-pegis-website/"> Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced</a>. Ubisoft also states it has four new IPs in development, including March of Giants, an upcoming MOBA it <a href="https://www.amazongamestudios.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-march-of-giants">acquired from Amazon Games</a> last month.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft has been undergoing a restructuring over the past year following disappointing launch performances for some of its recent AAA titles, such as Star Wars Outlaws. It created its Vantage Studios subsidiary in 2025 to oversee the Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry franchises. Earlier this month, it <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/07/ubisoft-shuts-down-recently-unionized-halifax-studio">shuttered Ubisoft Halifax</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/13/ubisoft-proposes-to-lay-off-55-employees-at-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-developer">proposed layoffs to The Division developer Massive Entertainment</a> after conducting similar restructurings at its <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-redlynx-says-up-to-60-positions-could-be-cut-in-restructuring-proposal">RedLynx</a> and Abu Dhabi studios.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/21/ubisoft-cancels-prince-of-persia-remake-and-5-other-games-as-part-of-major]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ubisoft has closed two studios and cancelled six projects - including its much-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake - as part of a major restructuring effort that will also see delays for seven games.
</p>
<p>
The moves are part of what Ubisoft calls a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset" as it looks to respond to a "persistently more selective AAA market and an increasingly competitive shooter landscape". The restructuring will see the publisher split its efforts across five "creative houses", respectively focused on "scaling and extending" its biggest properties (including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six); on competitive and cooperative shooter experiences (The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell); on live experiences (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>, The Crew, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/riders-republic">Riders Republic</a>, Brawlhalla, Skull &amp; Bones); on immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes (Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, Beyond Good &amp; Evil), and on casual and family games.
</p>
<p>
The first major impact of this significant organisational shift is the closure of Ubisoft's Halifax mobile studio and Stockholm studio, with "restructuring" also confirmed for the publisher's Abu Dhabi, RedLynx, and Massive teams. It's unclear how many employees will lose their jobs as result of these changes, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">IGN reports</a> the move is also being accompanied by a mandate for all remaining staff to return to in-office work five days a week, albeit with an annual allowance of remote-working days.
</p>
<p>
Amid this major shake-up, Ubisoft has confirmed the cancellation of six in-development games it says "do not meet the new enhanced quality [and] more selective portfolio prioritisation criteria". Four of these titles have never been announced (three being new IPs and one a mobile game), and the only cancelled title it has explicitly named is its embattled Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">unveiled in 2020</a>, and which has suffered multiple delays in the years since then. When last we heard of the remake, Ubisoft had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">narrowed its release window</a> down to between 1st January and 31st March 2026. As such, it cancellation is unexpected.
</p><p>
Alongside these cancellations, Ubisoft is delaying seven  unspecified games "to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met" and to "maximise long-term value creation". Notably, this includes the unannounced game widely believed to be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">much-rumoured Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake</a> - which will now launch in Ubisoft's next financial year, starting April 2026, rather than the current one it was previously announced for. All this has lead Ubisoft to revise its guidance for the full financial year, saying it now expects net bookings of around €1.5bn - a reduction of €330m.
</p>
<p>
"These measures mark a decisive turning point for Ubisoft and reflect our determination to confront challenges head-on to reshape the Group for the long term," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot wrote in a statement accompanying today's announcement. "The portfolio refocus will have a significant impact on the Group’s short term financial trajectory, particularly in fiscal years 2026 and 2027, but this reset will strengthen the Group and enable it to renew with sustainable growth and robust cash generation. Ubisoft is entering a new phase – one designed to reclaim creative leadership and build value for players and stakeholders over the long term."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Every new season of anime always asks the beleagured adult anime fan to sort the wheat from the chaff, or the new josei from the glut of shonen isekai slop. As the most <a href="https://aftermath.site/green-yuri-nana-shojo-girls-love/"><u><em>Nana</em>-pilled blogger</u></a> you’ll ever have the pleasure to read, this is my burden each season.&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josei_manga?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Josei</u></a> is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Djo_manga?ref=aftermath.site"><u>shojo </u></a>what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinen_manga?ref=aftermath.site"><u>seinen </u></a>is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dnen_manga?ref=aftermath.site"><u>shonen</u></a>; it's an adult-oriented genre marketed primarily toward older women rather than men. Likewise, their narratives leave a helluva lot more to stew on with their heavier themes than your ragamuffin anime. While I don’t often get my josei prayers answered, this <a href="https://gizmodo.com/there-is-almost-too-much-anime-to-watch-this-month-2000704345?ref=aftermath.site"><u>year's crop of anime</u></a> has yielded promising fruits through a new Crunchyroll show I’ve been digging called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_with_Witch?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Journal With Witch</u></em></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DX6mmkoByyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Journal with Witch | Official Trailer | Crunchyroll"></iframe></figure><p><em>Journal With Witch</em>, originally created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoko_Yamashita?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Tomoko Yamashita</u></a> and animated by studio Shuka, is a drama set at a deeply emotional point in the lives of two women. The first is Makio, a relatively successful 35-year-old author whose relationship with her sister, Minori, was so toxic that they cut off all ties. That decision rears its ugly head in the worst possible way when Makio is called in to identify the bodies of her sister and her husband, who died in a car accident. Although Makio doesn’t appear at any stage of the grieving cycle after identifying her sister, that act leads to a sudden reunion with the other woman at the center of this story: Asa, her 15-year-old niece, whom she hasn’t seen in years. Their tragic meeting triggers a new relationship between the two, as they wrestle with mourning the loss and figuring out how to continue together, making up for what the other lacks to get there.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s got me so geeked about <em>Journal With Witch</em> isn’t the big sads in store from its premise but how it showcases its two heroines’ mourning without ever letting the story collapse into agonizing wallowing. This tonal balance is lampshaded with pretty stark clarity from its opening scene.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than opening with their first meeting, the show jumps to some unknown point in the future of their relationship. Here, we see Makio clanking away at her littered desk, writing, while Asa hums a tune nearby as she does the dishes. Makio interrupts Asa with a deadpan request for her to sing a different Justin Bieber bop, prompting Asa to belt out the first syllables of “Baby” before the story abruptly snaps back to the beginning. It’s a cute, disarming moment that makes the show’s thesis plain. This anime is just as much about the relationship these two forge together as it is about how they cope with the death that inadvertently casts them into each other’s orbit.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Crunchyroll/Shuko</span></figcaption></figure><p>This framing also clarifies who these women are at the outset by giving viewers a peek at where they’ll ultimately wind up in their relationship. Asa, for instance,&nbsp; is a girl who just wants to graduate middle school without being labeled as “the girl whose parents died.” Makio, on the other hand, is an isolated writer who—at least as far as she’ll admit—feels nothing upon hearing that her sister and brother‑in‑law passed away, on account of their relationship having been FUBAR for years. Yet Makio never projects her own hard feelings toward her sister onto Asa. Instead, she allows her niece to feel her emotions, however big or small they may be, treating them as wholly her own and never something to be ashamed of.</p><p>Throughout the show, <em>Journal With Witch</em> traces how Makio and Asa gradually become a safe harbor for each other, even though both arrive in this new arrangement carrying their own emotional baggage. Makio, for instance, routinely offers Asa blunt, matter‑of‑fact guidance—an unexpected role for someone who’s otherwise shy and who never loved Asa’s mother. Makio suggests that Asa journal her feelings in a diary with full confidence that Makio will never read what she writes. <em>Journal With Witch</em> also grounds their collective healing in the mundanity of routine as they re-establish a new normal: low‑effort meals, slow walks, and long conversations about the finer points of literary techniques can work as a way to cope with loss.&nbsp;</p><p>While it's too early to see what impact Asa has on Makio, who is still guarded around her toxic sister’s child, it’ll surely be a watershed moment for both of them whenever they grow close enough to cross that bridge.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLZhRSC1gjs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Jaadugar: A Witch in Mongolia Teaser PV |July 2026"></iframe></figure><p>My only wish is that the rest of the anime seasons in 2026, save for Science Saru’s<a href="https://x.com/sciencesaru/status/2006380076749734037?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u> <em>Jaadugar: A Witch in Mongolia</em></u></a>, bring about a resurgence of josei in the anime landscape. Lord knows we could use a few fewer stories about bombast and more about pensive reflections on the human condition and the relationships we make and leave behind. And from the few episodes I’ve seen of <em>Journal With Witch</em>, it's starting to feel like the josei era is so back. </p>

			<p>Ubisoft has cancelled <strong>six games and delayed seven more </strong>as part of a "<strong><em>major reset"</em></strong> for the company. The cancelled projects include the long-awaited and much-troubled <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong>, while the other cancelled projects were all unannounced titles. One of them was an unannounced mobile title, and out of the remaining four, three were brand new IPs. While the seven delayed projects reportedly include the unannounced <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remake</a></strong>.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a press release sent to Wccftech that outlines how Ubisoft is entirely reorganizing itself into "<em><strong>five creative houses</strong>," </em>all built to support a new strategic focus for the company. It adds that the previously announced closure of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/"><strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong>,</a> layoffs at <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/"><strong>RedLynx</strong>,</a> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-ubisoft-abu-dhabi/">Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/">Massive Entertainment</a></strong>, and the now-confirmed closure of <strong>Ubisoft Stockholm</strong> are all part of this reset.</p>



<p>"<em>Today, Ubisoft announces a major organizational, operational, and portfolio reset designed to reclaim its creative leadership, regain agility and drive a sharp rebound, renewing the Group's trajectory toward sustainable growth and robust cash generation</em>," the press release begins.</p>



<p>"<em>The new operating model will further empower the execution of the Group's strategy, centered on Open World Adventure and GaaS-native experiences, supported by targeted investments, deeper specialization and cutting-edge technology, including accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI.</em>"</p>



<p>It's quite the shift, especially for fans who were waiting on the Sands of Time Remake, which has gone from <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-rumored-to-release-in-january-2026/">being rumoured to release sometime in early 2026,</a> to not at all. As to why it was cancelled, the company claimed that the remake, and the five other cancelled projects did "<em>not meet the new enhanced quality as well as more selective portfolio prioritization criteria at Group level</em>."</p>



<p>As for the seven delayed games, while Ubisoft doesn't name any of them as they are all officially unannounced, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mcx4n6jqds2c">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, one of the delayed projects is the long-rumoured Black Flag remake. The seven projects are being given more time "<em>to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation</em>." They're also getting updated revenue expectations, to go along with the delays.</p>



<p>The five creative houses break down all of Ubisoft's IPs into their own categories. The first is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/"><strong>Vantage Studios</strong>, its new <strong>Tencent-backed</strong> subsidiary,</a> which houses the <strong>Assassin's Creed, Far Cry</strong>, and <strong>Rainbow Six</strong> franchises. The rest of the creative houses don't have official titles other than 'Creative House' two through five, though each of them will have "<em>dedicated leadership with a clear creative mandate and accountability.</em>" Each creative house will also have "<em>end-to-end</em> <em>responsibility for its portfolio, overseeing the full creative and brand scope from development to publishing (brand, marketing and sales go-to-market strategy).</em>"  </p>



<p>The second creative house will focus on "<em>cooperative shooter experiences</em>" and be the home for <strong>The Division, Ghost Recon, </strong>and <strong>Splinter Cell</strong>. The third creative house is focused on <em>"a roster of select, sharp live experiences</em>," including <strong>For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla,</strong> and <strong>Skull &amp; Bones.</strong></p>



<p>The fourth creative house is dedicated to "<em>immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes</em>," and it'll be the home for <strong>Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia,</strong> and <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</strong>. Finally, the fifth creative house will be its home for "<em>casual and family-friendly games</em>," including <strong>Just Dance, Idle Miner Tycoon, Ketchapp, Hungry Shark, Invincible: Guarding the Globe, Uno,</strong> and <strong>Hasbro.</strong> Ubisoft also confirmed that part of this restructure includes the development of <strong>four new IPs</strong>, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-acquires-march-of-giants-moba-from-amazon/">the recently acquired <strong>March of Giants</strong>.</a></p>



<p>"<em>On the one hand, the AAA industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands</em>," began chief executive officer <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>, in a press release. "<em>On the other hand, exceptional AAA games, when successful, have more financial potential than ever. In this context, today we are announcing a major reset built to create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth over time. We are transforming Ubisoft’s operating model to produce exceptional quality games on the two core pillars of our strategy, Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>To put the Creative Houses in the best conditions to succeed, we decided to refocus our portfolio with a meaningfully revised 3-year roadmap and accelerate our cost reductions initiatives to rightsize the organization</em>...<em>While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organization over the long term</em>."</p>

</figure>
<p>According to Ubisoft, the project's cancellation is part of what the studio refers to as a "major organizational, operational, and portfolio reset" which is "designed to reclaim [Ubisoft's] creative leadership" and renew the publisher's "trajectory towards sustainable growth".</p><p>Said initiative will consist of three pillars, namely a new operating model, a "refocused portfolio", and the "rightsizing" of the company as a whole. Naturally, this reorganization will also include increased investment in generative AI.</p><p>Ubisoft also reiterates its commitment to restructuring <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="acd9f3a1-9a63-4e42-9b91-122a243964e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">into Creative Houses</a>, each of which will steward a set of the studio's IPs, including Vantage Studios, which will oversee <em>Assassin's Creed </em>and <em>Far Cry</em>.</p><p><em>Prince of Persia</em>, meanwhile, will fall under the watchful eye of Creative House 4, which, according to Ubisoft, is "dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes". That's also the Creative House that will look after <em>Rayman</em>, which Ubisoft says it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rayman-remake-2026-rayman-4-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="781293f6-dc00-4c8e-aa6f-0f302cc5b8b6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">currently working on</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, Creative House 4 is also responsible for <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>, and Ubisoft doesn't say anything about the status of the long-awaited <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em>, although if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-new-job-postings" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3c16fa0c-81d9-45f0-9b15-3df2fe6adb4a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">recent job listings</a> are to be believed, the project is still in development.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see what this new restructuring effort means for Ubisoft and for those who play its games.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>As someone of a nervous disposition, I am not a fan of the Shredder, one of the latest enemies added to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>. First appearing after November's North Line update, these floating bollards buzz about the halls and corridors of the mountainside facility, Stella Montis. Cross their path and they emit a mechanical shriek before releasing an explosive wave of shrapnel. Anyone caught in the blast is cut to shribbons.</p>
<p>Currently, like a Dalek left at the top of a staircase, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shredders">Shredders</a> haven't found a way down the mountain and out into the world. So, if I want to avoid being screamed at and eviscerated by a hovering cigar tube, I can just avoid the hilltop base. According to Arc Raiders' design lead, that relative safety may not last much longer.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"They'll figure out how to get out of there eventually," Virgil Watkins told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/will-this-blow-up-the-server-arc-raiders-players-are-so-good-at-killing-arc-that-embark-is-considering-how-to-escalate-pve-dev-teases-a-shredder-escape-and-the-giant-walking-ones-in-the-background/">Gamesradar in a recent interview</a>. Promising that Shredders will start popping up in Arc Raiders other maps.</p>
<p>I do wonder if Shredders will have the same hold over me on other maps. Despite several large halls, Stella Montis is a claustrophobic map, largely made up of winding corridors. When you come across a Shredder, you are trapped inside with it and its cloud of shrapnel is an all-encompassing threat. Arc Raiders other maps are a mix of interior and exterior, and you are rarely far from an open space to flee to.</p><p>Obviously, this will all come down to placement. A Shredder mooching about in Dam Battleground's swamps won't offer much of a threat, but if you were to come across one on the platform of the train stations in Buried City, waiting to mulch you when you are moments away from safety… Well, that could be a different story.</p>
<p>In this way, a Shredder could become a much more deadly indoor threat than Pops and Fireballs, the ball-shaped robots that bomb around inside buildings. While a Pop's self-destruct and a Freiballs flamethrower can cause significant damage, they aren't as well armoured as a Shredder, nor able to put out quite as much damage.</p>
<p>Where Shredder's appearing on other maps may be extra threatening, is when they can act in tandem with exterior enemies. A Shredder can be an effective area denial tool for the Arc, pushing you to remain outdoors where a Bombardier has you in its sights. The quickest way out of danger when the artillery mech is attacking you is to seek shelter indoors. Working together, Shredders and Bombardiers could be deeply frustrating.</p>
<p>Watkins didn't say when Shredders would start cropping up in other maps, so you still have time to fill your inventory with heavy shields.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Announces A Brutal New Restructuring With More Investment In Gen AI And Further Job Cuts]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869</link>
            <guid>1412194</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The French publisher behind <em>Far Cry</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> is planning <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-layoffs-division-3-massive-tencent-2000659368">even more cuts</a>, delays, and pivots as part of a brutal new restructuring. Ubisoft announced on Thursday that a company-wide reset will include a new creative structure, “rightsizing of the organization,” and more investment in things like “player-facing Generative AI.”</p> <p>The latest shifts come amid challenging five-year stretch for Ubisoft where big blockbusters like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Far Cry 6 were few and far between while big bets like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and <em>xDefiant</em> failed to pay off. In <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">its January 21 earnings press release</a>, the company promised a “radically new value-creation model” based around a “more gamer-centric organization.” This will include “business units with faster, decentralized decision-making and a greater ability to quickly adapt to players’ expectations” and a “rightsized and more agile organization, delivering improved structural efficiencies over time.”</p>

 <p>A management consultant company like McKinsey &amp; Company couldn’t have written it better. For those not versed in 21st century corpo-speak, that means a slow disassembly of the global AAA factory Ubisoft spent the 2010s building up and more studio closures and layoffs.&nbsp;The move will also include delays of many big games and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-2000661866">cancellation of others like the<em> Prince of Persia</em> remake</a> that’s been in development for years. Ubisoft says it will double-down on open-world games and games-as-a-service while boosting investments in things like “player-facing Generative AI.”</p> <h2>Ubisoft fragmented into “creative houses”</h2> <p>Instead of an integrated co-development model that has led the company to churn out massive games with armies of studios from around the world contributing to them, the new model suggests a series of siloes within the company based around individual IPs and genres. The first is a Tencent-backed subsidiary called Vantage Studios that owns <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. The second will own <em>The Division</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, and<em> Splinter Cell</em>. The third will own<em> For Honor</em>,<em> The Crew</em>, <em>Riders Republic</em>,<em> Brawlhalla</em>, and <em>Skull &amp; Bones</em>. The fourth will own <em>Anno</em>, <em>Might &amp; Magic</em>, <em>Rayman</em>,<em> Prince of Persia</em>, and <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>. The fifth will own<em>&nbsp;Just Dance</em>, <em>Idle Miner Tycoon</em>,<em> Ketchapp</em>, <em>Hungry Shark</em>, <em>Invincible: Guarding the Globe</em>, <em>Uno<span>,</span> Hasbro</em>.</p>

 <p>“Each Creative House will benefit from dedicated leadership with a clear creative mandate and accountability,” Ubisoft claims. “These leadership teams will include high-profile talent coming from the industry. They will be tasked with attracting and developing top-level, specialist talent, and supported by incentive schemes aligned with creative success, player engagement and long-term value creation.</p>

 <h2>More closures, cuts, and layoffs</h2> <p>No restructuring is complete with out firings. The company cites recently announced closures of its Halifax mobile studio and Ubisoft Stockholm, as well as layoffs at Abu Dhabi, RedLynx and Massive. This is part of an ongoing $117 million cost-reduction, but the company has now also committed to an additional $234 million of cuts over the next two years.</p> <p>“We will also selectively close several studios and continue restructurings throughout the Group,” CEO Yves Guillemot confirmed. “While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organization over the long term.” He’s also open to selling more IP and studios if buyers are interested.</p>

  <p>This reset has basically exploded Ubisoft’s upcoming game release pipeline. Six games have been canceled outright. Outside of the Sands of Time remake, which was rumored to be coming early in 2026, the company ended development on five other games that didn’t meet quality standards. Those include “four unannounced titles” of which three were “new IPs” and one was a “mobile title.” For those counting at home, that’s one game short of the total six that were canned. What’s the mystery cancelation?</p> <p>Ubisoft also delayed seven of its upcoming games “to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation.” The company didn’t clarify which of those are announced or unannounced, but did specify that one of the delays was an unannounced game planned for launch in the next two months. That was previously rumored to be a remake of<em> Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em>.</p> <p>Other big games that remain MIA are the next <em>Ghost Recon</em>, a multiplayer game called <em>Assassin’s Creed Invictus</em>, and, of course, <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em>.</p>

 <h2>More gen AI NPCs?</h2> <p>Ubisoft revealed a lot of upcoming pain to shareholders on Wednesday, like a $386 gross margin reduction for its current fiscal year ending March 31. So it’s hard to know whether it’s tease of more gen AI investment is just an attempt to throw them a bone or something it’s serious about as an actual exercise in “value creation” for gamers. The company promised “accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI.”</p> <p>After failing to cash-in on emerging technologies like cloud streaming and blockchain NFTs, Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs">promoted LLM chatbot NPCs at GDC 2024</a>. It then returned to the idea late last year with AI-powered squad mates in <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-fps-temmates-genai-nfts-gameplay-snowdrop-reveal-2000646251">a tech demo that looked very Tom Clancy-ish</a>. “Games of tomorrow will listen, understand, and react to players far more than today, and our research gives a glimpse of what adaptive, generative play could add on top of proven game systems,” Ubisoft director of GenAI gameplay Xavier Manzanares <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/ubisoft-generative-ai-game-teammates-neo-npc-developers-1236588038/">told&nbsp;<em>Variety</em></a> at the time. “It’s the first time we’ve shared an experiment this early with players, but our goal is to pave the way with a strong technology layer so our creators can start imagining the value it could bring to their project and players.”</p>

 <p>Whether that value becomes real or stays imaginary, things seem likely to get tougher for Ubisoft before they get better.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Flag Remake Likely Delayed By Up To One Year]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/</link>
            <guid>1412188</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft published a document earlier today bursting with information regarding an ongoing restructuring effort at the titanic gaming company. This document included an outline of the new Creative Houses that have been established to drive forward the development of various categories of games.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the release also came with news of layoffs, cancellations, and delays. The Prince of Persia remake has been shut down, and according to a somewhat vague statement, the Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag remake has likely been delayed by <strong>up to a year</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-flag-to-remain-in-port-for-a-while">Black Flag To Remain in Port for a While</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag emerged in 2013 and is still widely considered one of the best games in franchise history. It plants players in the Caribbean at the height of the pirating buzz, giving them a ship, a crew, and a couple of assassins’ blades to boot. It remains unsurpassed in some areas, and the nature of the remake has been one of the most talked-about topics in gaming for years.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new release</a> published today by Ubisoft seems to contain critical information that fans who are waiting for the Black Flag remake will mourn:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In parallel, the Group will allocate additional development time to 7 games inorder to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation. This includes the unannounced title initially planned for FY26, that has been delayed to FY27.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From what we know, the Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag remake is the <strong>only game </strong>that fits that criteria. Information published exclusively by Insider Gaming last year stated that the project was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/">set to be released this March</a>, before the end of FY26. The game also remains unannounced, which further aligns it with the description above.</p>



<p>As the delay is pushing the game back to FY27, it could be <strong>up to a year </strong>before it surfaces. Of course, that also means it could be as early as May or June, depending on how long the pushback is. That detail hasn’t been established by Ubisoft or Vantage Studios.</p>



<p>This blow to Ubisoft fans is joined by the news that three new and unannounced IPs were also cancelled, alongside an unrevealed mobile game. It’s not a good time for Ubisoft, but this is fast becoming par for the company’s course.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has announced a major restructuring, with a new operating model centered on open-world adventures and GaaS-native experiences, supported by player-facing generative AI. </p>



<p>The news about Ubisoft’s organizational, operational, and portfolio reset was revealed, bringing bad news for fans. The restructuring has led to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of the highly anticipated Prince of Persia Remake</a>, along with five other games. Learn more about their new focus below.</p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-is-looking-to-create-a-more-gamer-centric-organization">Ubisoft is Looking to Create a ‘More Gamer-Centric’ Organization</h2>



<p>According to a recent <a href="http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a>, Ubisoft’s significant reset has been prompted by a more selective AAA market, increased competition in the shooter genre, and the challenges publishers face in creating brands amid rising costs. This has resulted in a new value-creation model designed to make Ubisoft “a more gamer-centric organization, structured around creative genres.”</p>



<p>The revamped Ubisoft model focuses on open-world adventures and a Games-as-a-Service (GaaS) approach, bolstered by targeted investments, deeper specialization, and cutting-edge technology. This advanced technology includes “accelerated investments in player-facing Generative AI.”</p>



<p>Yves Guillemot, the CEO, has announced that the company will shift its focus to a new three-year roadmap aimed at achieving cost reductions. As a result of this decision, several games will be canceled, multiple studios will be closed, and layoffs will occur throughout the organization.</p>







<p>In other news, Ubisoft wants Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six to become ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-assassins-far-cry-rainbow-six-billionare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual billionaire brands</a>‘. Additionally, the former Assassin’s Creed Boss is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-million-damages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suing the company</a>.

            <guid>1412179</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has canceled the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake.</p>



<p>The decision comes as the company has announced <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a major restructuring</a> for the company. It also means five other games were cancelled, including three new IPs and a mobile game. </p>







<p>Ubisoft says that the cancelations were a result of the games not meeting “the new enhanced quality as well as more selective portfolio prioritization criteria at Group level.”</p>



<h2 id="h-a-complete-ubisoft-restructure">A Complete Ubisoft Restructure</h2>



<p>The restructuring will see the company form five “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-to-staff-on-new-creative-houses-ubisoft-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creative houses</a>“, the first of which being the recently formed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-company-officially-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vantage Studios</a>. That studio oversees the Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises. </p>



<p>The other four creative houses will hold franchises like The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, Rayman, and others. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had reported</a> that the marketing plans for the game suggested a release in Mid-January. Even public company documents stated that the game was set to release by the end of the fiscal year.</p>



<p>The Sands of Time Remake was first announced in 2020, the game had an up and down development cycle. It was originally scheduled to release in January 2021 before being delayed to March 2021 in December 2020. Then, just a month before its March release, the game was delayed again to an unspecified date.</p>







<p>After that, Ubisoft went silent until it was announced that development was being moved to Ubisoft Montreal. When Ubisoft Montreal took over, development on the game&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was completely restarted</a>, which included a more ““realistic approach”. That included a graphical overall, new animations, and new mechanics for both combat and parkour.</p>



<p>In the announcement of the cancelation, the game’s developers said that although the game had potential, they never could reach the level of quality players deserved. Continuing the development, they said, <strong>“would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Prince of Persia as a universe and a legacy continues to matter deeply to us, and this decision does not mean we’re stepping away from the franchise,”</strong> the team said.</p>

This includes an unannounced title originally planned for release in fiscal year 2026, that has now been delayed to fiscal year 2027.</p><p>All of this is part of a major organization, operational, and portfolio reset at Ubisoft that aims to “reclaim creative leadership and restore sustainable growth.” The reset includes canceling and delaying multiple projects, closing or restructuring studios, accelerating cost reduction, and resetting short-term financial expectations to prioritize long-term quality, profitability, and cash generation.</p><div><p><strong>■ Ubisoft Announces a Major Organizational, Operational, and Portfolio Reset to Reclaim Creative Leadership and Restore Sustainable Growth</strong></p><p>Today, Ubisoft announces a major organizational, operational and portfolio reset designed to reclaim its creative leadership, regain agility and drive a sharp rebound, renewing the Group’s trajectory toward sustainable growth and robust cash generation. This will be delivered through three main pillars:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>A new operating model;</li><li>A refocused portfolio with a meaningfully revised three-year roadmap;</li><li>And the rightsizing of the organization.</li></ul><p>Ubisoft’s strategic decision to undertake this major reset is driven by the continued shift toward a persistently more selective AAA market and an increasingly competitive <a title="Genres > Shooter [4,375 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> landscape, combined with the growing challenge for publishers to create brands in a context of higher costs. Nevertheless, when successful, exceptional AAA content has more financial potential than ever. While last years’ progress with its production processes translated into improved levels of quality for Ubisoft games in 2025, today’s market environment requires that the Group step-changes how it is organized and operates with a view to delivering exceptional games quality at more competitive costs.</p><p>Against this backdrop, today’s announcement introduces a radically new value-creation model: a more gamer-centric organization, structured around creative genres, relying on integrated business units with faster, decentralized decision-making and a greater ability to quickly adapt to players’ expectations. This transformation will be supported by a rightsized and more agile organization, delivering improved structural efficiencies over time.</p><p>The new operating model will further empower the execution of the Group’s strategy, centered on Open World <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,823 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>s and GaaS-native experiences, supported by targeted investments, deeper specialization, and cutting-edge technology, including accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI.</p><p>Yves Guillemot, Founder and CEO of Ubisoft, said: “On the one hand, the AAA industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands. On the other hand, exceptional AAA games, when successful, have more financial potential than ever. In this context, today we are announcing a major reset built to create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth over time. We are transforming Ubisoft’s operating model to produce exceptional quality games on the two core pillars of our strategy, Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences.</p><p>At the center of this transformation are our Creative Houses, integrated business units now combining production and publishing and therefore unifying the gamer relationship. Each one is built around a clear genre and brand focus, with full responsibility and financial ownership, led by dedicated leadership teams. It is a radical move, relying on a more decentralized creative organization with faster decision making and best-in-class cross functional core services supporting and serving each Creative House.</p><p>To put the Creative Houses in the best conditions to succeed, we decided to refocus our portfolio with a meaningfully revised three-year roadmap and accelerate our cost reductions initiatives to rightsize the organization. We will discontinue several projects currently in development and provide additional time to certain games, to ensure enhanced quality and maximize long term value. We will also selectively close several studios and continue restructurings throughout the Group. While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organization over the long term.</p><p>Taken together, these measures mark a decisive turning point for Ubisoft and reflect our determination to confront challenges head-on to reshape the Group for the long term. The portfolio refocus will have a significant impact on the Group’s short term financial trajectory, particularly in fiscal years 2026 and 2027, but this reset will strengthen the Group and enable it to renew with sustainable growth and robust cash generation. Ubisoft is entering a new phase—one designed to reclaim creative leadership and build value for players and stakeholders over the long term.”</p><p><strong>A New Operating Model to Support Ubisoft’s Strategic Focus</strong></p><p>Ubisoft’s new operating model will be structured around five Creative Houses. These will be supported by a Creative Network providing development resources, shared Core Services and a reshaped HQ. This new organization will start operating early April.</p><p>By simplifying the organization and placing creative and financial accountability closer to where value is created, the Group is strengthening its ability to innovate and execute with greater discipline, flexibility and speed. The new model will allow Ubisoft to better deploy its creative and technical resources on a refocused portfolio.</p><p>To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to five days per week on site for all teams, complemented by an annual allowance of working-from-home days. This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams. In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity and success in a persistently more selective AAA market.</p><p><strong>Five Creative Houses, Built on a Decentralized Model</strong></p><p>At the heart of this reset is a new and decentralized operating model structured around five Creative Houses. These integrated business units will feature three major changes:</p><ol><li>They will combine game development and go-to-market functions with a gamer-centric approach, and be fully responsible for brand development, content strategy as well as editorial direction;</li><li>They will be shaped by distinct creative ‘genres’ led by dedicated high-profile, incentivized teams with a unique set of expertise in those genres;</li><li>They will have full financial ownership and account for economic performance.</li></ol><p>They will be driven by clear objectives and guiding principles:</p><ul><li>A gamer centric approach, shaped by a unique set of skills and expertise towards a distinct creative ‘genre’ and a dedicated leadership team incentivized for long-term, cash generating revenue growth.<ul><li>Each Creative House will be organized around a distinct creative genre and designed to concentrate deep expertise in specific types of player experiences. Each Creative House will be responsible for fully owning the gamer relationship, developing must-play experiences for specific audiences and engaging player communities earlier and constantly throughout the development process.<ul><li>CH1 (Vantage Studios), focused on scaling and extending Ubisoft’s largest and established franchises to turn them into annual billionaire brands;<ul><li>Brands: <em><a title="Series > Assassin's Creed [29 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/assassins-creed">Assassin’s Creed</a></em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>Rainbow Six </em></li></ul></li><li>CH2 dedicated to competitive and <a title="Genres > Co-Op [367 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> shooter experiences;<ul><li>Brands including <em>The Division</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, <em>Splinter Cell </em></li></ul></li><li>CH3 designed to operate a roster of select, sharp Live experiences;<ul><li>Brands including <em>For Honor</em>, <em>The Crew</em>, <em><a title="Games > Riders Republic [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/riders-republic">Riders Republic</a></em>, <em>Brawlhalla</em>, <em>Skull &amp; Bones </em></li></ul></li><li>CH4 dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes;<ul><li>Brands including <em>Anno</em>, <em>Might &amp; Magic</em>, <em>Rayman</em>, <em>Prince of Persia</em>, <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em></li></ul></li><li>CH5 focused on reclaiming position in casual and family-friendly games.<ul><li>Brands including <em>Just Dance</em>,<em> Idle Miner Tycoon</em>, <em>Ketchapp</em>, <em>Hungry Shark</em>, <em>Invincible: Guarding the Globe</em>, <em>Uno</em>, Hasbro</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>In addition, there are four new IPs currently in development, including <a title="Games > March of Giants [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/march-of-giants">March of Giants</a>. Ubisoft will communicate on their respective creative home at a later stage.</li><li>Each Creative House will benefit from dedicated leadership with a clear creative mandate and accountability. These leadership teams will include high-profile talent coming from the industry. They will be tasked with attracting and developing top-level, specialist talent, and supported by incentive schemes aligned with creative success, player engagement and long-term value creation.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Full Creative and Brand Responsibility as Well as Financial Ownership</strong><ul><li>Each Creative House will have end-to-end responsibility for its portfolio, overseeing the full creative and brand scope from development to publishing (brand, marketing and sales go-to-market strategy). They will also be financially accountable, both in terms of P&amp;L and cash generation. This structure will sharpen strategic focus, reinforce execution discipline and ensure that investment decisions will be taken closer to where value is created.</li><li>The model also enhances visibility into development pipelines, milestones and key risks, supporting more informed decision-making throughout development cycles.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>At Group Level, A New Organization Supporting Each Creative House</strong></p><p>The Group will set up a streamlined organization designed to serve all the Creative Houses, while preserving scale benefits and reducing complexity. The new organization will be composed of:</p><ul><li>The Creative Network, which will bring together a powerful set of studios providing best-in-class production capacity and cross-functional creative expertise serving the Creative Houses. Operating within a structured, project-by-project collaboration framework, the Creative Network studios can deliver both co-development or endto-end mandates under the strategic direction of each Creative House.</li><li>Core Services providing the backbone of Ubisoft’s ecosystem and acting as an enabler for the Creative Houses and the Creative Network. They will focus on delivering scalable technology, production capabilities and operational excellence across the Group and will notably be responsible for:<ul><li>Production services including production standards and tools, localization, playtests, game analytics, QA/QC.</li><li>Technology and infrastructure including game engines, online services, GenAI initiatives, IT infrastructure.</li><li>Business operations and services including media planning execution, influencer and direct-to-player capabilities, pricing and distribution management, customer support.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>A Reshaped Headquarters , Focused on <a title="Genres > Strategy [309 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">Strategy</a>, Governance, Performance <a title="Genres > Management [36 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a> and Capital Discipline</strong></p><p>The new operating model will be underpinned by a reshaped headquarters1 , which will set the Group’s strategic priorities, ensure support for all Creative Houses and maintain a forward-looking view on industry trends, including technological developments and market innovations. It will notably oversee the Group’s talent management strategy, corporate communication strategy, legal services, capital allocation framework and financing, ensuring alignment between long-term strategy, financial performance and value creation.</p><p><strong>Introducing a Refocused Portfolio With a Meaningfully Revised Roadmap</strong></p><p>In the context of a persistently more selective market as illustrated by the last quarter, and as part of the finalization of the Group’s new operating model, Ubisoft has conducted a thorough review of its content pipeline over December and January. This has led to the strategic decision to refocus its portfolio, reallocate resources and comprehensively revise its roadmap over the next three years. This will support the objective to return to exceptional levels of quality on the <a title="Genres > Open-World [814 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">Open-World</a> Adventure segment and step-change the Group’s position in the GaaS-native experiences segment, as illustrated by the recently acquired project, March of Giants. The reshaped portfolio is designed to best position the Creative Hous.s for success. As a consequence, the measures taken are:</p><ul><li>Ubisoft has discontinued six games that do not meet the new enhanced quality as well as more selective portfolio prioritization criteria at Group level. These include <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em> remake as well as four unannounced titles, including three new intellectual properties, and a mobile title.</li><li>In parallel, the Group will allocate additional development time to seven games in order to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation. This includes the unannounced title initially planned for FY26, that has been delayed to FY27.</li></ul><p><strong>Acceleration of Cost Reduction Initiatives to Rightsize the Organization and Improve Structural Efficiency</strong></p><p>Ubisoft is accelerating its cost reduction initiatives as part of the transformation of its operating model, with the objective of improving structural efficiency, restoring a much higher level of organizational agility and better aligning its cost base with its strategic and creative priorities. This includes rightsizing the organization and focusing resources on core value-creating activities, notably through further restructuring1 and strict hiring discipline across all functions. The Group also continues to consider potential asset divestitures.</p><p>As part of this effort to streamline operations and adapt to evolving market conditions, the Group has already taken decisive <a title="Genres > Action [3,334 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s to adjust its studio footprint. This includes the closure of the Halifax mobile studio earlier this month and the Stockholm studio, as well as restructurings at Abu Dhabi, RedLynx, and <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>sive.</p><p>The current cost reduction program of at least €100 million in fixed cost savings2 versus FY2024-25, is now expected to be fully achieved by March 2026, one year ahead of the initial FY2026-27 target.</p><p>Building on this momentum, the Group is defining a 3rd and final phase of its program by setting a new objective to reduce its fixed cost base by an additional €200 million over the next two years. This brings the total reduction in fixed costs since FY2022-23 to around €500 million. This new objective is expected to bring total fixed costs to approximately €1.25 billion on a run-rate basis by March 2028, compared to €1.75 billion in FY2022-23.</p><p><strong>Reset of Short-term Financial Outlook Reflecting a Major Portfolio Refocus and a Meaningfully Reviewed Three-Year Roadmap</strong></p><p>As part of its transformation, Ubisoft has taken a number of decisions impacting the Group’s release schedule and portfolio composition. As a consequence, the Group no longer considers its previously communicated FY2026-27 guidance to be an appropriate reference and will therefore update it in May 2026.</p><p>For FY2025-26, Ubisoft now expects:</p><ul><li>Net bookings of around €1.5bn, translating into approximately -€330m gross margin reduction vs. guidance, mainly reflecting:<ul><li>Changes to the current FY26 quarter release pipeline following the updated roadmap</li><li>Decision to postpone negotiations on certain partnerships in the context of the Group’s new operating mod</li></ul></li><li>Non-IFRS EBIT of around -€1bn, mainly reflecting both the impact of the updated FY26 net bookings assumptions described above and the following transformation-related decisions that led to a one-off accelerated depreciation of around €650m:<ul><li>The discontinuation of six games</li><li>The allocation of additional time to seven titles with updated revenue expectations reflecting a persistently more selective market</li></ul></li><li>Free cash flow of between -€400m and -€500m</li><li>Non-IFRS net debt of between €150m and €250m as of year-end FY26, with a cash and cash equivalents position of between €1.25bn and €1.35bn vs. prior guidance of around €1.5bn</li></ul><p>In addition, ahead of the publication of its Q3 FY2025-26 net bookings scheduled for February 12, Ubisoft is providing an indicative net bookings figure of approximately €330m, primarily driven by an overperformance linked to partnerships and reflecting a robust back-catalog. The quarter notably saw the releases of <em><a title="Games > Anno 117: Pax Romana [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/anno-117-pax-romana">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a></em> and the <em><a title="Games > Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></em> “From the Ashes” expansion that were praised by players and critics alike. Further details will be provided on February 12.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-as-part-of-company-wide-reset]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Digital Foundry Delivers Its Tech Review Of Final Fantasy VII Remake On Switch 2]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/digital-foundry-delivers-its-tech-review-of-final-fantasy-vii-remake-on-switch-2</link>
            <guid>1412155</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>With the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on the Switch 2, Digital Foundry has once again delivered its technical review of the port, detailing how it stands up next to the PS4 and, perhaps more importantly, the PS5.</p>
<p>The good news is that, as detailed in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">our review</a>, FF7 Remake is a technical triumph on the Switch 2. We won't go into <em>too</em> much detail here, as it's worth checking out the full rundown over on <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/features/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-a-ps5ps4-hybrid-boosted-with-dlss">Digital Foundry</a>, but this is a port that's essentially described as a hybrid of PS4 and PS5, beating out the former in multiple ways.</p>
<p>So for example, environmental textures are a lot closer to that of the PS5, with things like the infamous doors in the Sector 7 Slums looking a lot more detailed when compared to the game's original release on PS4. Ground textures are similarly improved, and sign readability is a lot better. It's not a total match everywhere though, with some textures leaning closer to PS4.</p>
<p>This is the same for shadows and character pop-in too, which are noted to be much closer to the PS4 than the PS5. In terms of lighting, however, Square Enix strived to emulate the PS5 Intergrade release, and it makes for an incredibly handsome game on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Performance is solid in docked and handheld modes, with very minor dips in handheld mode when panning the camera around areas such as Aerith's house. Otherwise, you're looking at a stable 30fps throughout. Resolution is 1080p in docked mode, though its noted that clarity is, again, a step up from the PS4.</p>
<p>Pretty good then, huh? We reckon the real test will come with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, since it's a pretty vast, open-world game. Given that it runs reasonably well on the Steam Deck, however, we're expecting similar results with the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Now go ahead and announce the release date, Square Enix.</p>

			<p>Your <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arm-to-establish-a-semiconductor-design-school-in-south-korea-to-train-1400-world-class-chip-design-professionals/">ARM-based</a></strong> Windows 11 device is now an <strong>Xbox</strong> too, as the Xbox App is now live on all Windows 11 ARM-based devices, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2026/01/21/play-more-xbox-app-is-now-available-on-arm-based-windows-11-pcs/"><strong>Microsoft</strong> announced today</a>. It's Microsoft's latest push to make every screen, no matter how big or small, an 'Xbox' - even if the device can't actually fulfill the definition of what we've known an Xbox to be for the last 20+ years.</p>



<p>Those with an ARM-based device can download the Xbox PC app and play most of their Game Pass library, with Microsoft confirming that "<em><strong>more than 85% of the Game Pass catalog is compatible with these PCs</strong></em>," and that it is working to add support for more games, so you don't have an issue playing any of your titles locally. </p>



<p>That said, for what you can't play locally, Microsoft is quick to add that there's always the Cloud Gaming option, a choice that is growing in popularity, according to Microsoft, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-expands-more-countries-is-increasingly-popular-game-pass-users/">which recently added the service to more regions</a>. A result that's no doubt helped by the fact that Cloud Gaming is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">now available at <strong>every tier</strong> of a Game Pass subscription</a>, instead of being locked behind the most expensive Ultimate subscription, as it was for years.</p>



<p>"<em>Windows and Xbox continue to collaborate across the gaming community, OEMs, silicon innovators and game studios to expand catalog compatibility and deliver a consistently great Windows gaming experience—whether you’re on a powerful desktop, a purpose‑built handheld, or an ARM‑based Windows 11 laptop</em>," writes the principal program manager for Windows silicon and system integration, <strong>Brynnan Fink</strong> and senior director of Xbox Next Generation, <strong>Nicole Allen</strong>, in a blog post.</p>



<p>"<em>Our focus remains on improving compatibility, enhancing performance and delivering experiences that make it easy to jump in and play.</em> <em>We’re grateful to be building this with you. Every update we deliver and every title we bring to ARM-based Windows 11 PCs is shaped by what we hear from players. We’re excited about what’s ahead and look forward to bringing even more improvements, features and games to players everywhere in the coming year</em>."</p>

            <p>Following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">mod</a> which provides VR support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-flatlines-after-cd-projekt-file-dmca-strike-and-request-its-creator-drop-their-paywall">hit with a takedown request by CD Projekt</a>, its creator has now said that they've not ruled out the possibility of releasing it for free. However, they've painted that as an unlikely road to go down, arguing that it's "kind of become a moot point" due to piracy of their work following the strike.</p>
<p>The fact Luke Ross' R.E.A.L VR mod for Cyberpunk, which is one arm of a wider VR support framework for a wide range of games, was behind a paywall appeared to be the crux of CD Projekt's decision to strike it. The studio's business development vice president Jan Rosner claimed in a post that they offered Ross the option of making it free and switching the paywall for optional donations, in line with their <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/fan-content">guidelines for fan-made content</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-dmcad-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-says-people-are-now-pirating-it-to-punish-him-for-breaking-cd-projekts-terms-of-service">IGN</a>, Ross has now offered a bit more of their side of the story. According to the modder, they had "absolutely no say" in pulling the Cyberpunk VR mod from Patreon, instead claiming the platform yanked it down automatically in response to the strike being filed. Ross said he reached out to CD Projekt to try and "negotiate" with the studio about the takedown, to which he alleges CD Projekt simply replied telling him he needed to comply with their terms of service.</p>
<p>There was "no negotiation, no comments on my proposals, no interest for instance in knowing how many of their users would be affected by the sudden removal," according to the modder. Interestingly, Ross also claims to have reached out to CD Projekt back in 2022 to ask if the Cyberpunk developers would be interested in turning the mod into an official VR port for the game, an offer the studio declined according to the modder.</p>
<p>I've reached out to CD Projekt for comment.</p>
<p>As for the situation as it stands, Ross told IGN he's not ruled out releasing the mod for free, but "it would take time, because my software supports 40+ games and various completely different engines, which makes creating a version that specifically supports only Cyberpunk 2077 a non-trivial task". The modder also cited the potential for such a move not being popular with people who've already paid to support their work on the R.E.A.L VR framework.</p><p>"Anyway, it's kind of become a moot point," Ross continued. "Because following to the unexpected DMCA strike, after the mod was forcibly removed from my Patreon, people afraid of losing VR support for their favorite games have started pirating and illegally exchanging the mod all over the Internet, brazenly saying that since I was not complying with CDPR's terms of service, my work is now fair game and I should be punished by having it stolen."</p>
<p>For now, it seems Ross' Cyberpunk VR mod is set to remain taken down, and we'll have to see whether in the wake of alleged piracy and a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/another-one-dust-148437771">visible number of negative comments</a> directed at the modder, they decide to change that further down the line.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mio: Memories In Orbit: The Kotaku Review]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mio-memories-in-orbit-review-metroidvania-ps5-switch-2000661850</link>
            <guid>1412137</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Mio: Memories in Orbit</span></i><span> is a reminder that games can be all killer, no filler, for better or worse. A stylish side-scrolling Metroidvania, </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>marches to a familiar beat and wraps things up well before it could potentially grow tiresome. Its world is alluringly illustrated, and its gallery of rogues and weird little robots have their charms. Despite that, I do wish there was a bit more going on in its composition. I wish it felt denser and more layered. I’d have appreciated a bit more variety in instrumentation. I wish its lyricism hooked me more. And in the absence of these things, I found I kind of missed the filler, the noise that could have been constructed around that central, thrumming beat.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The first thing one is likely to clock about </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>is how gorgeous it is. It’s </span><i><span>very </span></i><span>easy to stop and stare at the landscapes in the background of nearly every one of its scenes. The Vessel, the spaceship on which </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>takes place, recalls the hostile and beautiful alien world of </span><i><span>Scavengers Reign</span></i><span>. It’s (almost) never as trippy, but it does often feel as dangerous. One second you’ll be in a lush, vegetative, and deadly jungle with strong purple hues and the next you’ll be in an azure metropolis that appears to have frozen over. Regardless of where you are, though, </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>is a stunner to look at, and its visuals are half the reason I explored the Vessel as deeply as I could.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><em>Mio</em>‘s movement: Solid fundamentals, not enough evolution</h2> <p><span>The other reason to play </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>is because it feels really damn good. Metroidvanias emphasize exploration, but it’d be no fun to move and fight through them if the game felt sluggish and if the combat were so-so. Luckily, </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>nails the fundamentals out of the gate. It’s got all the tricks one might hope for up its sleeve: a double jump that looks more like an elegant mid-air pirouette, a hookshot used for both platforming and shooting yourself across arenas in combat, an instantaneous dodge move that feels almost as satisfying as a </span><i><span>Sekiro </span></i><span>parry, a reliably weighty (and expressively animated) combo string, and more.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This mixture of silky-smooth movement and combat abilities most prominently figures into </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>‘s solid boss battles. Though none of the ones I ran into ever ran away with the show–there are plenty of hidden encounters along the game’s periphery, as well as the route to the game’s secret ending–I still had plenty of fun with each of them. Whether they were a drill-nosed mole creature burrowing into the arena or a mechanical murder doll complete with a saber and laser gun, each was stylistically distinct and demanded that I learn how to best use </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>‘s movement tech to navigate their numerous hazards long enough to see and capitalize on an attack window.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661853"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661853">©Douze Dixièmes</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I did, at times, find myself wishing that some of these encounters and arenas stood apart more. While the bosses never tread the same ground aesthetically, most of the stages themselves felt pretty same-y and the fights hit a lot of the same notes. At the end of the day, most of the arenas were square rooms with a few grapple points (save for one notable exception that breaks from this rhythm of boss fights) and most of these fights were one-on-one duels. Very few of the boss fights I did see featured environmental hazards and traps that could complicate matters and present interesting new wrinkles, and I would’ve preferred more of that variation throughout.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Maybe I’m just a masochist who really likes punishing games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568"><i><span>Silksong</span></i></a> <span>and its ilk, but one thing those games I love get </span><i><span>really </span></i><span>right is their variety and breadth of enemies and encounters, and that sort of spice is sadly missing from </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>. Considering the lengths that </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>goes to in order to feel adjacent to the </span><i><span>Souls </span></i><span>lineage–there are bonfire-like checkpoints here,</span> <span>and more than enough enigmatic worldbuilding to go around–it’s a bit of a shame it doesn’t go that step further, especially on the game’s most obvious and critical path.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking of a lack of variety, I was disappointed in how little </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>‘s combat ever grows. There are modifications you can make that alter certain attributes, like one upgrade that allows Mio to do a heavy attack immediately after landing a hookshot, but besides that, you never earn new techniques or weapons. There is no additional</span> <span>combo to learn by traveling off the beaten path. There is no projectile with which to occasionally pepper an enemy from afar.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Samus has missiles to complement her pea shooter. </span><i><span>Castlevania</span></i><span>‘s numerous protagonists can begin the game with a great variety of weapons, like axes, swords, or whips. Mega Man absorbs the powers of the robot masters he defeats. Juan of </span><i><span>Guacamelee </span></i><span>gains entirely new wrestling techniques and Ori regularly picks up stunning new magical powers. The Knight of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> can use charge attacks as well as a highly-effective magic blast and a dive move with a massive area-of-effect, and Hornet gains new traps, tools, and crests that fundamentally alter her moveset.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>By comparison, </span><span>Mio </span><span>is stuck with their same little saber and three-attack combo for the entirety of the game. The lack of imagination here doesn’t significantly take away from the game, but I did find myself less enthused with the prospect of combat in </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>‘s late stretches, in large part because it had plateaued so early.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>A mystery without mystique</h2> <p><span>And while I’m speaking of aspects of the game that regrettably fall flat, I really wish </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>’s narrative went…anywhere. The Vessel is an ark ship meant to ferry a colony and their robots (who look a </span><i><span>lot </span></i><span>like Pascal from </span><i><span>Nier: Automata</span></i><span> and fill the ranks of the game’s cast) across the stars in search of a new world. Partway through the journey though, the Voices—AI that served as deities and guides to the robots and are named after body parts like the Spine and the Hand—cease function, allowing the Vessel and its inhabitants to fall into disrepair as the ship drifts. The great mystery of the game is figuring out what exactly happened to cause the AIs to stop and go quiet.</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite its early promise, though,</span><i><span> Mio</span></i><span>‘s writing just didn’t hook me. The game’s story is largely explained in lore tomes found through exploration and following the game’s main story path, but even these missives fail to inject the proceedings with a sense of urgency or dramatic tension. Normally, I’d fear that I just don’t get the story, but in the case of </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>, I do, save for whatever revelations the game’s out-of-the way “true” ending might hold. However, the morsels of story that </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>delivered never quite lived up to the mystique that it spent so long building up, and I found myself quite disappointed in the answers and resolutions afforded to the conflicts and characters by the tale’s end.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Lo-fi beats to Metroid to.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>developer:</p>                 <p>Douze Dixièmes</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>type of game:</p>                 <p>Metroidvania</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Arresting visual style, fluid combat and movement, really fun boss battles.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Story fails to build any momentum, lack of variety in combat.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p> PC (played on), PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch.  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date: </p>                 <p>January 20, 2026</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Rolled credits at about 17 hours, but spent about 20+ hours working towards the secret ending before moving on.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Its characters, what little there are in settings like Metropolis and the Haven, feel like one-note bit players in the game’s grander machinations. The Voices themselves are less pronounced throughout the story than I’d hoped for. Even</span><i><span> Mio</span></i><span>‘s allies fail to leap off the page. Despite my initial efforts to see as much of the game as possible and give it the chance to change my mind, I simply could not feign any more interest in securing a more hopeful resolution to the ills of a cast that felt so amorphous and under-developed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Suffice it to say, </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>doesn’t quite tick off all the boxes of what I’m looking for in a Metroidvania. It’s got mystery and intrigue enough to incentivize you to look in corners and dart around its imaginatively rendered sci-fi utopia gone awry, but not quite enough to pay off the threads it establishes early on.</span><i><span> Mio</span></i><span>’s middle action is defined by a great run of abilities that make cutting a path through the Vessel a joy in the moment, as well as bosses that pose an admirable challenge despite their humdrum layouts. But as the journey comes to a close, the sameness of its encounters and simplistic combat closes out the story on a bit of a whimper where a bang might’ve felt more appropriate.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>is stylish and elegant to boot, but that and a decent grasp of the fundamentals are not enough to deepen my appreciation of what’s ultimately a pretty by-the-numbers Metroidvania. It’s an adherent to the form, but I rarely like the tune it sings, and don’t quite love it despite my efforts to.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Esports World Cup is shaping up to be a memorable event in 2026. In recent days, the Esports World Cup Foundation has unveiled an enormous $75 million prize pool and a roster of twenty-four games that promise unparalleled levels of competitive gaming entertainment.</p>



<p>This is the latest evolution of the biggest event in esports, but it doesn’t end here. During a recent press conference, the team at the Esports World Cup revealed that they’d love to expand their lineup further going forward and would especially appreciate hosting more women’s tournaments in Saudi Arabia.</p>







<h2 id="h-more-women-s-representation-in-riyadh">More Women’s Representation in Riyadh</h2>



<p>During a recent press conference, the Esports World Cup Foundation’s COO, Mike McCabe, and Chief Games Officer, Fabian Scheurmann, spoke about LGBTQ+ and women’s representation. In a straightforward statement, McCabe suggested outright what they want to see in the future:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Everybody is welcome. Everyone who competes at EWC is welcome to the Kingdom. What Saudi Arabia is trying to do to shift the culture is to support competitive play.</p>



<p>As for the tournaments we have, we would love to have more competitive tournaments for women in EWC.</p>



<p>What we need to do is work with publishers to build the circuits and pathways for those competitions to get onto the big stage. We hope that we have more and more women’s competitions in the future.</p>

<p>In 2024, the CEO of the EWCF, Ralf Reichert, went on record saying that ‘everyone is welcome’ in Riyadh for the Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>He reiterated that statement when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-ralf-reichert-esports-world-cup/">Insider Gaming sat down with him</a> later that year:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Everyone is welcome at the Esports World Cup, and we’ve worked hard to create an inclusive environment where gaming fans from all over the world can congregate and share their passion.</p>



<p>It’s exactly the kind of celebratory atmosphere we wanted for such a massive event, and I encourage everyone who is interested in gaming and esports to make the trip, attend a tournament, enjoy one of the many concerts, check out the festival and take in the atmosphere. I believe people’s perception will change once they’ve experienced this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Women’s esports have been coming up in recent years, with some organizers standing up tournament circuits specifically for females and LGBTQ+ competitors. The likes of VALORANT’s Game Changers scene have blossomed immeasurably of late.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The British are coming. Specifically, IGN can exclusively reveal that action man Jason Statham - star of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Hobbs and Shaw and The Meg - is coming to Fortnite today. He lent his chiselled jawline and voice to the game to promote his new movie Shelter as part of a new in-game experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Stath appears as his character from Shelter, Michael Mason. In the movie Mason is a former assassin who is forced to dust off his guns (aren't they always?) to protect himself and a girl - Jessie -  that he rescued from the sea surrounding the remote Scottish island he calls home. Players can fight alongside him on a new custom map inspired by the movie, taking on waves of enemies in order to protect Jessie. If that wasn't enough, a huge storm is on the way, which is actually pretty accurate for the Scottish highlands. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The custom map comes with some additional game features to heighten the roguelike experience the creators are going for, with a combination of permanent upgrades, random weapon loadouts and a 'Rebirth system' that will give you permanent buffs for resetting your progress. It's vital to mention that the weaponry is given out by a dog. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There'll also be a community tournament featuring top streamers that will let viewers vote on the specific conditions for the matches, like weapon restrictions or inverted controls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The experience was created by Sawhorse and Chartis Interactive, with contributions to the design of the map from Fortnite creators like Jayth, the guy behind Fortnite's Zombie Escape Tag. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s been exciting to combine the roguelike genre—one of Fortnite’s most popular modes—with a unique film like Shelter, especially with Jason Statham involved," he said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Shelter experience is available in Fortnite now. <em>"Become the #shelter. survive the storm. play the official 'shelter' fortnite experience now! island code: 2883-8391-6703. see @jasonstatham in shelter. only in theaters january 30. get tickets now"</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Head of Editorial Development at IGN and an elder millennial. She's been a professional nerd since 2006 when she got her start on Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK, and has since worked for GamesIndustry.Biz, Rolling Stone and GamesRadar. She loves horror, horror movies, horror games, Red Dead Redemption 2, and her Love and Deepspace boyfriends. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-gets-a-new-roguelike-map-and-a-visit-from-jason-statham]]></content:encoded>

That’s across PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and Mac.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Pearl Abyss described going gold as a “major development milestone” for the open-world action-adventure game. It thanked fans for their continued support, acknowledging what it called “strong anticipation” that has built up over the course of the last year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb on Crimson Desert:</p><blockquote>Set in the vast continent of Pywel, Crimson Desert is an open-world action-adventure game that follows the journey of protagonist Kliff and his Greymane companions. The title has been praised for its realistic, high-fidelity graphics, dynamic combat, and the freedom and interactivity of its open world, delivering a heightened sense of immersion and intensity.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-open-world-is-at-least-twice-as-big-as-skyrims-and-larger-than-the-red-dead-redemption-2-map">Pearl Abyss called Crimson Desert’s open world “absolutely massive,”</a> bigger even than that of Bethesda’s Skyrim and Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/aEX6hjTSlOk?si=Ei_PQfEUiBEH5A6F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the Gaming Interviews YouTube channel</u></a>, Pearl Abyss’ Will Powers said that describing the size of Crimson Desert’s world in terms of numbers doesn’t do it justice, because doing so fails to capture the scope and scale of the game. But he did go as far as to compare it to two of the biggest open world games around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think numbers really do it justice because, how big is that in terms of scope and scale?” he said. “But what we can say is that the world's at least twice as big as the open world, the playable area, of Skyrim. It's larger than the map of Red Dead Redemption 2."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Powers went on to insist that the size of Crimson Desert’s open world won’t determine its quality. Rather, what you actually do in it is the key factor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The continent of Pywel is absolutely massive, but size doesn't really matter if there's nothing to do,” he said. “Open-world games are about doing things, having activities, having distractions. So we wanted to create a world that's not only massive, but is also incredibly interactive."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Crimson Desert IGN First - Combat and Mounts Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Skyrim and Red Dead Redemption 2, in Crimson Desert you can fly around on a dragon, so despite the size of its world, you’ll be able to get about quickly. And don’t expect RPG elements in terms of decision-making and choice and consequence as it relates to your character, either. The sheer amount of things to do in the world will facilitate the role-playing part of Crimson Desert, which players will form through “head canon.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You choose the type of character you want to play as in terms of your progression within the systems in the game,” Powers explained. “And then through head canon you’re having this very different experience than other players because of the scope and scale of the game. You’ll be distracted by something, you’ll go on this quest line, you’ll have an experience that’ll be radically different than someone else, even though they’re playing the same game and the same canonical storyline that you both are going through.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>2XKO is out properly on PC and consoles, bringing with it a slew of new features and Caitlyn as its 12th fighter. However, inquisitive players quickly found a fun easter egg tied to Caitlyn that significantly changes the character's appearance in game.</p>
<p>By holding down both special buttons during the loading screen before a match, players who have chosen Caitlyn as one of their two fighters will be able to remove the hat present on her default costume. With that, her iconic top hate is gone, replaced with absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>This is not the first time such an easter egg has been included in 2XKO. When the season 0 Arcane skins were added to the game last year, players discovered that very specific button combinations prior to a match could remove the mask from Ekko's Arcane skin, pull down Jinx's hood, or remove Vi's jacket.</p>

<p>This is a style of secret with a rich history in fighting games, with games including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-v">Street Fighter V</a> offering similar easter eggs on specific costumes. What's great about Caitlyn's secret costume alteration is that, unlike the Arcane skins, you don't need to spend a dime to use it yourself.</p><p>If you're curious about 2XKO and want to learn more about it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-review">why not read Eurogamer's 2XKO review</a>! In it, the game is described as: "2XKO is a tag fighter like no other, with a bold aesthetic and superbly crafted core gameplay experience. Beloved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> characters are revitalised in a new light in a truly stunning free-to-play experience."</p>

			<p>No matter whether it’s a book, movie or video game, there’s a special, deep-seated satisfaction to returning to a world that you know and love. Pandora is such a world. Home to the Na’vi, and bursting with neon flora and fauna, incredible creatures and the iconic floating islands, James Cameron’s fictional planet remains amongst the most vibrantly-realised sci-fi settings of the modern era. From the Ashes takes us back to this place, a new expansion for Ubisoft’s excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Frontiers of Pandora</a>, while tying in with Avatar: Fire and Ash, the brand-new cinematic outing for the franchise. It’s a return that’s well worth making.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes: LAUNCH TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xe30wUKlV8o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This time out, you play as So’lek, the Na’vi warrior who you fought alongside in the first game. Your original character is here as well – initially referred to as simply ‘The Sarentu’ – but So’lek makes for an interesting new central character that is brusque and thoughtful in equal measure. Set two weeks after the events of Avatar: Fire and Ash, you come face-to-face with the Mangkwan, the new Na’vi clan of brutal, vicious warriors who’ve aligned themselves with the RDA, here led by Major Bukowski, against the peace-loving groups we’ve come to know.</p>



<p>I held off working on the later portion of my review so that I could see the movie without ruining it, but I really didn’t have to. There’s nothing in From the Ashes that you can’t parse from watching one of the trailers for Fire and Ash, and the events here happen within their own pocket of Pandora, just as in the original game, the narrative fitting within and alongside that of Jake Sully and his extended family.</p>

<p>The world is on fire. The beauty of Pandora has been marred by flame, smoke and ash, and it makes for a striking point of difference from the main game. It still looks incredible, the beautiful landscapes punctuated by destruction making for an evocative and painful change to the setting, and it still stands as a huge technical achievement.</p>

<p>From The Ashes is also the perfect chance to check out the technical improvements that have been made to the game since its release. There’s the addition of both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/21/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-patch-is-coming-in-december/">a third-person mode and a 40fps graphical option on console</a>, for use with 120Hz supporting screens and TVs, which strikes a midpoint between the previous quality and performance settings. Both of these improvements serve to give players a greater variety of ways to experience both Frontiers of Pandora and its new expansion.</p>
<p>As someone who played across PC and PS5, the 40fps option definitely lifts the console experience, bringing an improved level of fidelity over the performance mode, while still giving players a smoother and more fluid feeling experience over 30fps play. It’s not quite perfect – there were definitely occasional hiccups here and there – but overall, I found it a major improvement, and it became my preferred way to play through From The Ashes.</p>

<p>The third-person view, however, isn’t as successful. Having played the game in first person, shifting to third person actively reduces one of the game’s greatest strengths: its visuals. You lose the immediacy, and the wider field of view when in third-person, and while it does serve to cement your place as a Na’vi, it’s not a strong enough payoff when compared to first person play. Still, having the option is ideal, and you can switch at any point if there are sections that you think would be easier or better from a particular viewpoint, just as the game already did when you hopped on your flying companion to get around.</p>
<p>All of the overt strengths of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora are here too, from the exceptional visuals to the enjoyable traversal and high-octane flight. From the Ashes is a bit less open-ended, though that affords for some tense and well-paced narrative moments. For all that, you can still wander off into the jungle and lose yourself to hunting and exploration for as long as you like. For returning players, though, it’s all going to be about the continuing story.</p>

<p>And that story is a real success. The tighter, more personal focus is arguably even better than the one from the main game. You begin exploring through areas that you previously experienced, marred by both the unstoppable power of Pandora’s flora and fauna, and the arrival of the Mangkwan, before settling into exploring and fighting your way through the smoking forest. It gives you more context and understanding of the new faction, and the villainous RDA, and frankly, it makes them even more imposing, with some great encounters and narrative moments across the DLC’s significant 20-hour runtime.</p>

			<p><strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> will launch its eleventh <strong>World of Warcraft</strong> expansion pack, <strong>World of Warcraft: Midnight</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-officially-launching-march-2-2026/">this coming <strong>March 2, 2026</strong></a>. To prepare for that expansion, the studio has pushed a <strong>pre-expansion update</strong> live, which will feature access to some of the features coming in Midnight ahead of its full release. </p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/">housing was added in an earlier update last month</a>, this update introduces a couple of additions to housing, including <strong>Endeavours</strong>, a new optional neighbourhood activity for players to engage in to unlock more décor for the homes they're building and some extra housing experience points.</p>



<p>There's also a new class specialization in the <strong>Devourer Demon Hunter</strong>, a new mid-range caster specialization that uses the power of the Void to fight the Void's own champions that threaten Azeroth. You get all the mobility of Demon Hunters while also gaining a new Annihilator hero talent tree, shared between Vengeance and Devourer Demon Hunters.</p>

<p>The update also introduces an overhaul to the Transmorgification system, letting players change appearance to gear slots instead of individual items, so you can keep your transmogs even when swapping gear. You're also now able to establish set outfits, with every player starting with two free outfits, though you can purchase additional outfit slots with gold.</p>



<p>You can even set your outfit to change based on specific scenarios now with the new '<strong>Situations</strong>' system, if you want to have specific looks for dungeon running, exploration, or just chilling at home.</p>



<p>Beyond the housing updates and the new class specialization, the pre-expansion update also adds several key UI changes, with new 'Boss Warnings' and 'Damage Meter' changes. You can see the highlighted changes in the images below.</p>

<p>There are several more changes, tweaks, and, of course, bug fixes in the pre-expansion update as Blizzard prepares for the full weight of the Midnight expansion when it arrives this coming March. There's a full, expansive list of everything in <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24244455/midnight-pre-expansion-content-update-notes">a new blog post from Blizzard</a> that goes through all of the details.</p>



<p>So far, Midnight is looking like it'll be the biggest expansion in World of Warcraft's long history, a history that, for now, remains entirely PC-based, as it's one of the most popular games ever to not come to consoles. The last word on a potential console port from Blizzard was that <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-director-denies-console-rumors-wed-just-say-it/">if it was happening, the team "<em>would just say it</em>" was happening</a>. So, for now, take any rumours on an imminent console launch with a grain of salt. Once the team is working on bringing it to consoles, it'll let us know.</p>
