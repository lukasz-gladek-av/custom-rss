The map in question also looks similar to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-players-think-theyve-discovered-the-next-warzone-map/1100-6527488/">rumored Avalon map</a> found in Black Ops 6's spectator mode, with both featuring a cluster of islands connected by bridges. This specific scene was saved for the end of the trailer and shown alongside a brief tease of Treyarch's Zombies mode for Black Ops 7, so it is possible Activision is teasing Avalon for Warzone.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">However, fans shouldn't get their hopes up too soon. Black Ops 7 is revealed to be a co-op campaign, so it is possible the scene in question is just a section of the campaign used to show off four-player co-op. Additionally, known Call of Duty insider "The Ghost of Hope" <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1931779343421677956" rel="nofollow ">claims the Avalon map was scrapped</a> for battle royale and would be used for campaign and Outbreak Zombies mode for Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, we'll likely learn more about Black Ops 7 and Warzone in the coming weeks, as Activision says more details will be revealed later this summer.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 4 is currently live in Black Ops 6 and Warzone. The season features a crossover event with the Ballerina movie, which is part of the John Wick universe. Players can earn free cosmetics and unlock a new marksman rifle during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-how-to-unlock-essex-model-07-and-all-ballerina-event-rewards/2900-6642/#2">Ballerina event in Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a>.</p>

            <p>Don't Nod - the studio behind the likes of Jusant, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> 1 and 2, and Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - has revealed its next game.</p>
<p>It's known as Aphelion, and, in a change for the studio, will be Don't Nod's first human story in space. The developer promises a "powerful" experience on the game's 2026 release, across Xbox Series X/S, Steam, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>"Set in a near-future where Earth is on the brink of collapse, Aphelion is an emotional journey to the edge of our Solar System to survey a planet that may be humanity's last hope," reads the official blurb. "As astronaut Ariane Montclair, crash landed on the newly discovered Persephone, players must brave harsh landscapes, master survival tools, and navigate reality-bending phenomena on a desperate mission to reunite with her wounded partner, Thomas Cross." You can check out a trailer below.</p>

<p>The game is being developed in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), which will help ground Aphelion and its depiction of space exploration in "real scientific knowledge and humanistic values", Don't Nod has said.</p>
<p>"For fifty years, ESA has combined rigorous space science with the boundless imagination of science fiction to explore solutions to our planet's greatest challenges. Aphelion captures that spirit - where research meets imaginative vision - to inspire the next generation to carry Europe's space ambition into the future," said Nadia Lüders, ESA Partnership &amp; Brand Licensing Officer.</p>

            <p>
An extended look at Clockwork Revolution was shown at today's Xbox Games Showcase, which is "coming in due time".
</p>
<p>
The steampunk RPG shooter has already drawn comparison to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> games and in this new gameplay trailer we see plenty of gadgets and time-bending powers.
</p>
<p>
There's also a good look at its clockwork steampunk aesthetic, with plenty of humour too. Characters include "the pissed-off doll" and "the knob", among others.

<p>
The game is being developed by inXile Entertainment, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-saints-row-developers-join-clockwork-revolution-development">help from former Volition developers under the studio name Shapeshifter Games</a>. Volition - known for the Saints Row series - was closed in 2023 due to the poor performance of its most recent game.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date yet for Clockwork Revolution, though it'll be out on Game Pass from day one. It's coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S.

Shadow dropped during today’s Xbox Games Showcase, players will be able to experience <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/23/23180709/final-fantasy-16-eikons-naoki-yoshida-interview"><em>FFXVI</em>’s slick-ass kaiju monster battles</a>, incredible voice acting, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5">ho-hum story</a> (because, hey, you can’t expect Square Enix to be perfect at everything). In addition to the base game, players will also get access to <em>FFXVI</em>’s two story DLCs <em>The Rising Tide</em> and <em>Echoes of the Fallen</em> which adds more story and a new Eikon (the game’s version of summons) Leviathan.</p><p>But that’s not all as the partnership between Xbox and Square Enix continues apace. Last year, Xbox brought the critically acclaimed MMORPG <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> to the system. Later it was rumored, due to Square Enix’s stated desire to expand their games beyond the PlayStation ecosystem, that it would bring the <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> remake project to Xbox as well. That rumor has been proven true. The absurdly titled <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em>, which is the first entry in the <em>FF7</em> reimagination project combined with the Yuffie-centric DLC, is coming to Xbox this winter.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2023/06/11/clockwork-revolution-is-a-time-bending-steampunk-rpg-from-the-makers">first announced</a> at this same Xbox Games Showcase back in 2023, but today’s presentation offered a much deeper look at what we can expect.&nbsp;</p><p>In Clockwork Revolution, players take on the role of a customized character named Morgan Vanette, who lives in a seemingly steampunk-inspired alternate history of 1895, in the city of Avalon in a neighborhood called The Tangle. Part of a gang known as the Rotten Row Hooligans, Morgan navigates a world populated both by people and clockwork individuals, and some that seem halfway between the two.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l421zRNnivo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l421zRNnivo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Gameplay shows off plenty of sneaking and combat, as well as some extensive customization tools for both character visuals and weapons. But the most intriguing gameplay shows off special time powers that let Morgan do things like rewind time, rebuild destroyed structures, slow down enemy bullets, and in a larger sense, rewrite the flow of history.</p><p>There’s no word yet on when we can expect Clockwork Revolution to arrive, but the game is targeting a launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We can't wait for players to join our dynamic duo once again, and unravel the mysteries of Novo's world."

            <p>
With its July arrival almost upon us, Activision has announced a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> demo, but it's a pre-order exclusive, making it very much the opposite of 'try before you buy'.
</p>
<p>
As we learned previously, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is a ground-up remake of the beloved skating games, and brings a range of "modern upgrades" - including "new skaters, gnarlier tricks, an even sicker soundtrack", alongside new parks (a water park, pinball table, and movie studio are confirmed), plus cross-platform online multiplayer for up to eight skaters.
</p>
<p>
Multiplayer includes the new HAWK mode, which sees players dropping letters in hard-to-find spots then racing to find as many as they can within the time limit. There's also the sandbox-y Free Skate mode, plus a range of different activities within the Competitive playlist: Trick Attack, Score Challenge, Combo Mambo, Combo Challenge, and Graffiti.

<p>
As for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4's expanded playable roster, it now includes Rayssa Leal, Chloe Covell, Zion Wright, Jamie Foy, Nora Vasconcellos, Margielyn Didal, Yuto Horigome, Zion Wright, Aurélien Giraud, and Andy Anderson. Additionally, there's an appearance from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle's Michelangelo, who arrives as an unlockable "secret" skater.
</p>
<p>
Actvision has also confirmed the return of Create-A-Skater, alongside an upgraded version Create-A-Park, which introduces new props - including speed boost pads and musical notes - and the ability to add custom goals. Players fond of documenting their skating highlights can also make use of a new photo mode.
</p>
<p>
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be available for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Game Pass when it launches on 11th July, with a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> release date to be announced "later".
</p>
<p>
As for that demo, it's out today on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, and features the Foundry and College parks, skaters Tony Hawk and Rayssa Leal, plus a limited selection of songs. However, you'll need to pre-order the full game in order to access it.

		<p>The Sunday of not-E3 is renowned as Microsoft’s time to shine. It’s fair to say that recent years haven’t quite set hearts racing, no matter how good Xbox output like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Avowed have been, so it’s a welcome surprise to find that Xbox haven’t just rolled out a few smart-looking trailers, with the earth-shattering announcement that they’re set to release the very first Xbox handheld. It’s not even just one, with the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X providing two different tiers of Xbox handheld. This is a great day for Xbox gamers.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROG Xbox Ally World Premiere Reveal Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIVmyOIV1MQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The quickest among you will note that the ROG Ally is a thing that already exists. ROG’s Ally, and it’s more powerful follow-up the Ally X, are PC handhelds that have spent the last few years competing with Valve’s Steam Deck for portable PC gamers’ hearts. There’s a very strong argument to say that they’re the better option, though they’ve been hamstrung by Microsoft’s own Windows platform which was never made specifically for a handheld format. </p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X are the best of both worlds, the partnership between the two companies giving you access to your entire Xbox library as well as opening up the world of PC gaming to you as well, including all of the PC based stores like Steam and the Epic Game Store. </p>
<p>The Xbox Ally and Ally X have had some obvious physical changes made to them over ROGs older versions of the Ally, most noticeably in the extended, and presumably far more ergonomic hand grips. The Steam Deck’s comfort levels were the last bastion of defence that Steam Deck owners had over Ally owners, and we can’t wait to see if the Xbox Ally and Ally X trounce them, becoming the most comfortable PC handheld out there. </p>


<p>They’ve got some pretty impressive specs under the hood. Both have AMD processors, with the Xbox Ally toting an AMD Ryzen Z2 A Processor, alongside 16GB of RAM and a 512GD SSD. The Xbox Ally X meanwhile has a Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor as well as a massive 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. They’re both going to be serious gaming machines – the original Ally has been a fantastic option, with a less powerful chipset, so we can’t wait to see how the new pair will perform. </p>
<p>Both have 7″ 1080p full HD screens, with a 120Hz refresh rate, and Freesync Premium onboard, which should mean everything will look super smooth and bright.</p>

<p>Indeed, usually nothing is fighting back against you as you clean, but in&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky</em>, a deadly fungus seeks you out. A so-called first-person, immersive "clean 'em up" from developer Soft Rains,&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky's&nbsp;</em>fungal foe is truly terrifying.</p>



<h2>It's Time for Cleanup&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Let's set the stage. It's far into the future and you're a "Scarab," essentially an undertaker that helps the deceased pass on. She's also something of a space "disaster specialist," armed with tools to clean up the contamination.</p>

<p>We begin the demo in a space station. The aim is to find a body and help it pass on, but this fungus is everywhere. Working our way through the space station, going past deadly fungus some of it is electric, and other variants literally&nbsp;<em>seek you out</em>.</p>



<p>This is where&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky&nbsp;</em>really impressed me. This fungus is forming around you quickly, and it's so fast that you become surrounded. Just seeing this amalgamation build up around you is an impressive technical feat.</p>

<p>Not only that, it's how you can clean up this fungus that is equally impressive. Soft Rains has developed a technology called "Quantized Impact Field." It's a mouthful, but hey, it works quite well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fungus are voxels, but the tech hides it very well. Cleaning the fungus with various sprays at your disposal break it down; in other words, volumetric cleaning.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Spray it All Away</h2>

<p>The sprayer you have is a cool tool. Like I said, cleaning is satisfying, and so is spraying down the fungus and having it crumble away. There are various sprays, like the basic, which is great for cleaning, but also others like fire and electric.</p>

<p>Fire can spread, by the way, and I haven't found a good use for it yet. Electric spray, on the other hand, allows players to activate doors without a direct line to power. Shoot spray at the top of the door and keep spraying until it hits an active power source, and there you go, it's on!</p>

<p>You can also change the nozzle, so the spray can go straight, vertical, or horizontal. In one segment, the gravity in the space station is turned off. Because of that, the spray no longer arcs due to gravity and allows you to clean all the more effectively.</p>



<h2><em>Ambrosia Sky</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's also worth nothing, the developers aren't necessarily aiming for a highly detailed art style, but the Quantized Impact Field makes up for a lot of it. Combined with excellent use of lighting,&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky</em>&nbsp;is a promising game.</p>

<p>While it'll likely take several more years to develop, a demo is available today on Steam, so if cleaning up some deadly shrooms tickles your fancy, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3716830/Ambrosia_Sky_Demo/" rel="nofollow">check it out</a>!</p>

            <p>Ubisoft are nowhere to be found during this year's not-E3 season, meaning there's no opportunity for the French publisher to announce six new games they'll never release. I still crave a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> fix, however, and Mudang: Two Hearts delivered, kinda. It's Korean, it's got fast-moving rage zombies, but it's also got men shimmying up pipes, cinematic brawls, and a rapid-cut montage of knife crimes. You should watch the trailer.

<p>"In the not-too-distant future, the divided nations of South and North Korea are on the verge of reunification," begins the game's blurb. "On the day when the historic bill was set to pass, a mystery terrorist group attacks the South Korean National Assembly, throwing the entire nation into chaos. Sent to uncover the truth, a North Korean soldier stumbles upon a K-Pop star and is given a new mission: protect the girl who can unravel it all."
</p>
<p>Hard to say which part of that seems less realistic, but the important thing is it's described as a stealth action thriller. Whether I'm a Fisherlike or a K-pop star, all I want to do is shimmy along ledges and press some QTE prompts during hand-to-hand combat with a man whose head is magnetically drawn towards the nearest mirror.
</p>
<p>That's about all we know for now, but Mudang will apparently launch sometime in 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A 3D sequel to the masochistic 2010 platformer Super Meat Boy was announced at the Xbox showcase. It's simply called Super Meat Boy 3D and it basically looks exactly how you'd expect in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Note to meat marketers: the green pipe fakeout only works for anyone watching the showcase live. Everyone else knows this is about the little bleedy guy by the time they click on the video. But good effort. </p>
<p>As you can see, the trailer shows a lot of bear traps, chainsaws, sawblades, lasers, slime blocks, molten steel, and angry robots. I can't really stand a 3D platformer, to be frank. Not since Gex. But I'm sure plenty of Super Meat Stans will get stuck in. </p>
<p>A sequel to the original platformer, Super Meat Boy Forever, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/super-meat-boy-forever-is-out-now">released in 2020</a> but it was an auto-runner and maybe didn't hit the previous game's sweet spot of tough-but-fair fatality that some precision platforming nerds loved. This sequel is made by the same studio, Team Meat, but the original developer of the little red eejit, Edmund McMillen, is off making something else entirely: an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-trailer-for-the-binding-of-isaac-devs-next-game-mewgenics-answers-none-of-the-many-questions-i-have">"endless cat-breeding RPG"</a> called <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>.

While there was no footage to debut, the executive quietly let slip that a new <em>Forza </em>is coming next year as well as the “return of a classic” that’s been with Xbox from the beginning. It’s hard to imagine that’s anything other than the previously reported <em>Halo: Combat Evolved </em>remaster.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196915" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Halo’s Joseph Morgan On Playing Nuanced Characters And The Flaws of Season 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="158" data-playlist="196915,196917,197533" data-current="196915"><div><p>Halo’s Joseph Morgan On Playing Nuanced Characters And The Flaws of Season 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22479.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“As we think about bringing a new generation of players to these iconic franchises I’m excited to share that players will get to celebrate 25 years of Xbox with a new <em>Fable</em>, the next <em>Forza</em>, <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, and the return of a classic that’s been with us since the beginning,” Spencer said near the end of the livestream. </p><p>That tiny, innocuous-sounding snippet was full of news. The <em>Gears of War</em> prequel didn’t previously have a release window and the newest <em>Forza </em>hadn’t previously been mentioned at all (will it be <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> or something else?) But the detail most fans will be glomming onto is the hint at the original <em>Halo</em>’s return.</p><p>That game, previously reported by <em>The Verge</em>’s Tom Warren to be a remaster of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved </em>in Unreal Engine 5, will presumably follow in the footsteps of the recent remaster of<em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,&nbsp;</em>which Microsoft shadow-dropped last month. If that ends up being the case, the <em>Halo</em> remaster will likely be the original game running with overhauled graphics and some tweaked systems, though unlike <em>Oblivion</em>, there is already an HD<em> Master Chief Collection</em> players can use to access Bungie’s hit 2001 shooter. We’ll have to wait to learn more to see if <em>Combat Evolved</em> gets a more fundamental reworking to make it stand out on modern platforms. </p><p>Whatever it ends up being, it’s almost a guaranteed thing that a <em>Halo </em>remaster will be coming to PlayStation 5 as well, potentially serving as the perfect starting point to bring the iconic Xbox exclusive to Sony’s console for the first time ever. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-playstation-xbox-fans-react-angry-1851752763&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-playstation-xbox-fans-react-angry-1851752763">And while that multiplatform push has left some fans wondering</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-fans-content-creators-ps5-ports-starfield-rumors-1851230962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-fans-content-creators-ps5-ports-starfield-rumors-1851230962">why they bothered buying an Xbox console at all this generation</a></span>, Spencer’s last-minute sound-bite suggests next year will be full of nostalgia for those who have been with the platform for decades.

                <p>Keeper, the newest game from acclaimed adventure-game developers Double Fine and veteran designer Lee Petty, was revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase. As the name implies, the game involves a moving lighthouse--though whether you're playing and the lighthouse or a being managing it (a "keeper") isn't quite clear. A green bird appears frequently alongside the lighthouse, seeming to aid and guide the lighthouse as it travels through a variety of colorful environments including gemstone-adorned caves, treacherous cliffsides, ancient ruins, and a desolate plain. The bird also seems to be important for solving puzzles, as the trailer demonstrates.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWAwVgTsFfk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AWAwVgTsFfk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We also get a brief look at some very large beings that could either be mechanical monstrosities or organic giants. How the lighthouse will deal with these obstacles, or if they're even threats at all, remains unclear. Keeper will release on Xbox Series X and PC on October 17, 2025.</p>

The difficult 2D platformer was a popular game on the platform, and though it has never received a proper numbered sequel, it has been given a few spin-offs like Super Meat Boy Forever and Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MtXRCarKd9A"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MtXRCarKd9A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Super Meat Boy 3D, however, looks to be its biggest follow-up yet. The game is fully 3D and looks every bit as challenging as the games that preceded it. It also features the ghosts of previous attempts, which is a staple for the series.</p><p>The game is apparently being developed by Sluggerfly (Hell Pie), Headup Games (Casual Loop), and Team Meat.</p><p>The game is coming coming Xbox Platforms early next year.</p>
