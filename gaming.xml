		<p>While online gaming really thrown esports and competitive gaming into the spotlight over the past 15 years, the battle to be the very best gamer in the room goes back much, much further. Ardent gamers have been at it since the “Intergalactic Spacewar Olympics” were held by Stanford University students in 1972, but there’s been the rise and fall of countless gaming competitions in the decades since. While far from being a part of the yearly gaming landscape like Evo or QuakeCon, there’s still a special place in gaming lore for the Nintendo World Championships. And now you can bring that competitive spirit home with Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition – Survival Mode &amp; Legend Challenge – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBhA0XdNb94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s actually a little surprising that there’s only been three Nintendo World Championships, with a 25 year wait from the 1990 inaugural event to the anniversary to its anniversary revival in 2015, and then another entry two years later just as the Nintendo Switch was coming to the fore. It’s similarly surprising that it’s taken Nintendo seven years to decide to release a branded tie-in game, but it’s better late than never, right?</p>


<p>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition, much like Nintendo World Championships Remix on the Wii U and the original Nintendo World Championships 1990 Game Pak that went before it, is all about taking classic NES games and breaking them down into mini stages and tasks for you to try and speed run your way through. That factor alone adds a huge compulsive urge to play, replay, better yourself and best the other names on leaderboard, or rivals who are closer to home.</p>
<p>It starts with 1-1, and a challenge that’s barely 5 or 6 seconds long (if you’re doing things right), to go left to right, hop over a Goomba, hit the second question block, and grab the mushroom that emerges. Seriously, I could play this time and time and time again trying to master it, and getting an S rank is going to require pixel precise jumping. There’s similarly miniscule, but addictive challenges to get you started in The Legend of Zelda, Balloon Fight, Donkey Kong, Metroid, Kirby’s Adventure, Excitebike and all of the 13 games featured here, before building up into longer slices of levels and more varied challenges to test yourself against.</p>


<p>The UI wrapped around this is pretty neat in the Speedrun mode. You always get to see a preview of the task you have before you, to get your eye in, and then you have your current attempt on the left side of the screen and your previous best on the right, and showing your button inputs on screen. Arguably it’s not that important for a six second level, but when you get to a longer challenge, this will let you see how you’re stacking up as you chase down a better time and ranking.</p>
<p>It all builds up to the Legend Challenges, which will really put your skills to the test through minutes, not seconds. These could be clearing the first three Donkey Kong levels, racing through the whole of Super Mario Bros. (using Warp Pipes), or doing the most ridiculous thing imaginable: speedrunning a Kirby level. Legend Challenges come with ‘Classified Information’ pages, styled after classic game guides as they give you a rundown of all the specific tips and tricks that you’ll need to beat the challenge.</p>

<p>Putting a different spin on things are things like Survival Mode, where you face off against ghost data plucked from the internet. It’s a small three round knockout format that drops you in against seven other players and then ditches the bottom half after each level. The three levels are known in advance, with a Silver and Gold ranked competition to enter, but they can appear in a varying order that potentially gives you a better chance of coming out on top. While you have just a single shot for success on each attempt, you can play these over and over, just like pretty much everything else in the game.</p>
<p>And then there’s the Party Mode for local multiplayer with up to eight players, in which you can take on individual levels or curated sequences set to different difficulty levels, with each round awarding points for your finishing position. It’s another fun competitive twist to play side-by-side, especially with some of the game crutches like an automatic rewind meaning that less skilled players can still compete despite the odd mistake. Another nice tweak is that, in addition to the video preview before a challenge, you can also dive into a full practice session to get everyone up to speed.</p>

<p>It’s a bit of a mystery why Nintendo hasn’t made the Nintendo World Championships a more regular event, but it’s neat to see them bringing it back to the living room with Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition, filled with around 150 challenges and a bunch of different ways to play them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-witcher-tomb-raider-crossovers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>24 Entertainment and publisher NetEase have announced that&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint&nbsp;</em>is getting three new high-profile collaborations to celebrate its third anniversary, as well as a new map, a new weapon type, and more.</p>
<p>In an anniversary livestream, it was revealed that the worlds of&nbsp;<em>The Witcher&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>will be joining&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint&nbsp;</em>soon, and the game is also getting a crossover with Chinese novel series&nbsp;<em>Daomu Biji</em>, also known as&nbsp;<em>Time Raider&nbsp;</em>in its movie form.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>collab is coming this summer and will add a new outfit inspired by heroine Lara Croft. First&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover">Dead by Daylight</a>&nbsp;</em>and now this? She really is a true globetrotter. This summer will also see&nbsp;<em>Daomu Biji&nbsp;</em>hero Kylin Zhang joining the cast of&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint&nbsp;</em>as a playable hero.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-naraka-bladepoint.jpg?itok=jspPQ2t1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-naraka-bladepoint.jpg?itok=l8voMeRd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lara Croft will soon join the world of&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The second collaboration is with&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>, whose hero, Geralt, will be appearing in&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint&nbsp;</em>later this year. It's not exactly clear what form the collaboration will take; it could see Geralt join as a hero, or it could simply involve new outfits to collect. We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>That's not all&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint&nbsp;</em>is getting for its birthday, though. A new map, Perdoria, will be introduced "after the July 2nd update", and it will take you into a subterranean city with platform areas designed for combat.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to the Fistblades, a new hand-to-hand combat weapon. It's not quite the "hands" the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2024-gaming-roundup">promised on April Fools' Day</a>, but it's as close as you're going to get.</p>
<p>Tantalizingly, 24 Entertainment also promises an Easter egg to discover in the new Perdoria map, and it's designed to "provide players with a more immersive adventure experience". Exciting! I wonder what it could be?</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, it's a melee combat-focused battle royale game in which up to 60 players duke it out while playing as a variety of colorful heroes.</p>
<p>Since the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-release-date-announced">launch in 2021</a>, it's been updated with a variety of new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-new-hero-skill-changes">heroes</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-heng-sword-season-11">weapons</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-anniversary-celebrations-adds-new-campaign-mode">game modes</a>, and it's also enjoyed crossovers with the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-wo-long-naraka-crossover">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-nier-crossover"><em>NieR&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>.</p>

            <p>PC-playing survival horror fans, I have good news for you. The original version of Resident Evil is now available to purchase via GOG, with "even more blood, graphic violence and gory scenes than the worldwide monster hit version on PlayStation".</p>
<p>This PC release is fully compatible with Windows 10 and Windows 11, and promises new rendering options as well as other Quality of Life improvements, such as improved cutscene timing, an improved game video player and "issue-free" game exit.</p>
<p>At present, Steam only has the HD remake of Resident Evil, rather than this original release.</p>

<p>In addition, GOG's Resident Evil port supports modern controllers.</p>
<p>"Your Special Tactics and Rescue Squad has been choppered to a remote mansion to investigate a biotechnical experiment gone hideously wrong. Before you can say 'mass murder', you're plunged straight into a deathtrap writhing with man-eating freaks, swarming crows and rabid dogs," reads the official blurb.</p>
<p>"Arm yourself with knives and flame-throwers scavenged from dead teammates. Solve puzzles, disarm traps and unearth mysteries. But beware: every move you make draws you deeper into the deadly embrace of Resident Evil."</p> <div>

			<p>A good free-to-play action shooter is always on my radar, even if I'm reviewing a dozen other titles at a given time. However, when you're as much of a looker as The First Descendant, then you really have my attention. Showcasing the power of Unreal Engine 5, Nexon Games' upcoming third-person looter shooter has a lot to show for itself in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-qa-on-the-game-ue5-implementation-and-future-dlss-3-support/">The First Descendant</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/First-Descendant-Assault-Rifle-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Rather than starting from scratch and having to sit through tutorial after tutorial, Nexon Games' opened our session with a brief pitch deck on the general systems and overall vibe of The First Descendant before letting us run free in the open environments. With a wide list of characters unlocked to play through, I opted for the Ultimate variant of one of the fourteen available characters: Ultimate Bunny. With a thigh gap that even the Evergreen could pass through and more skin than Metal Gear Solid V's Quiet, I went with the most photogenic character on the roster. The fact that she came with chain lightning abilities and multiple sniper weapons was just the icing on the peach cake.</p>
<p>In talking with one of my colleagues that also demo'd The First Descendant, they didn't quite understand where to go after being set free in the demo. Truth be told, in the span of 30 minutes, I didn't really have the freedom to explore the hub city and get my bearings straight. Instead, I popped out to the minimap, got a good look at the nine available regions, and then jumped straight into some Void Intercept Battles. Here, instead of learning about the game through tutorial after tutorial, I took my level 40 Ultimate Bunny and challenged a level 34 Executioner Colossus. If I had the foresight, I probably would have picked an enemy that didn't have electric attribute resistance, but it was still a good place to grasp the combat.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-FIrst-Descendant-Ultimate-Bunny-Hop.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The First Descendant is a very mobile type of third-person shooter. Staying grounded in one spot and even strafing from side to side won't prevent players from catching a stray bullet to the face. Instead, adding in jumps and a sleek grappling hook helps the player bounce around the battlefield and circle to the backside of an oversized boss and escape attacks coming their way. Having the grappling hook set to the middle mouse button took some getting used to, but with a very short cooldown and a generous range, I could unload a full clip into the boss' weak point, grapple onto a nearby pillar, and hide behind it as cover while I reload. The first Void Intercept battle lasted barely more than a minute even as a first-time player but it certainly helped that I had a sniper rifle that could hit for over 250k damage and killed the boss before I even needed to reload the five-round magazine. All character abilities are cooldown-driven, so there are no extra resources to juggle beyond just having enough bullets on hand. Fodder enemies will occasionally show up in combat, acting as loot pinatas that burst open with recovery items and spare ammo.</p>

<p>Gunplay is quick and snappy in The First Descendant and would be the main draw as a casual non-IAP, or truly free-to-play, player. Nexon granted us level 100 gear that would far exceed what the common player would have access to for hours in the game and the power difference was quite noticeable as the second Void Intercept, a level 54 Devourer, took a bit longer (almost three minutes) to down but without having to break a sweat or even retreat to recover health and shields. That fight took longer simply for the shield mechanics on the boss where I had to seek down these green bubble-covered nodes and destroy them to remove the boss' shielding. I do enjoy when bosses implement new mechanics beyond simply being a bullet sponge and at least this was a challenge to break away from the DPS phase and do something different in the fight. My third Void Intercept was against a level 118 Swamp Walker which kept summoning a bunch of adds and despite my best attempts, couldn't even break its shielding before the 10-minute quest timer elapsed.</p>
<p>For the second portion of my gameplay session, I picked one of the playable regions at random and delved into the arctic region, thinking it to be a good change of pace from the boss arenas although my bunny girl was quite underdressed for the occasion. I had just enough time to eke out a zone recon mission and jump into a few shootouts for loot and glory before my session came to an end. One thing that I'll have to give Nexon praise for is continuing the trend of implementing Korean vocal tracks into your open world exploration. It's a thing I thoroughly enjoyed in Stellar Blade, and I earnestly want the trend to continue.</p>
<p>The First Descendant has had its share of beta test phases and hands-on opportunities but this was one of the last events that Nexon will be showing off the title ahead of its launch next month. Officially launching on July 2nd, 2024, The First Descendant will be available across PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074920/The_First_Descendant/">PC (Steam)</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The First Descendant Preview - Nexon's Answer to Destiny]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/first-descendant-preview-nexons-answer-to-destiny</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-first-descendant-preview-nexons-answer-to-destiny.911649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/first-descendant-preview-nexons-answer-to-destiny<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm always on the search for the next "podcast game," as I like to call them. You know the type of game you can just have going on one screen, with videos, music, or podcasts rolling in the background? It might be terrible for the attention span, but <em>The First Descendant</em> fits that criteria to a tee.</p>
<p>Developed in-house by <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nexon">Nexon</a> is the soon-to-launch <em>The First Descendant</em>, which we saw a fancy new trailer for at Summer Game Fest. I also had the chance to test it out in LA a few short weeks ago, and further access to a pre-launch build was also granted to me. Needless to say, I've already put several hours into <em>The First Descendant</em>, and I might just be hooked.</p>

<h2>Becoming a Descendant</h2>
<p><em>The First Descendant</em> is a massive game, and Nexon is going all gas, no breaks to make it their next hit. Using Unreal Engine 5 to power this beast, <em>The First Descendant</em> boasts top-of-the-line visuals and the polish. It's a looter shooter that has to contend with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/destiny-2-final-shape-end-to-light-and-darkness"><em>Destiny</em> <em>2</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tom-clancys-division-2"><em>The Division 2</em></a>, so those are big shoes to fill.</p>
<p>During my play session at Summer Game Fest, I had unrestricted access to pretty much every item, character, and upgrade in the game; likewise, I was able to test this out more in depth using a preview build. There's also a mode that started me fresh, so I got a taste of both the beginning of the game, and end-game.</p>

<p>The beginning of <em>The First Descendant</em> tasks me with choosing a hero, dubbed Descendant, to control -- these are pre-made characters that have a unique set of abilities. I went with Ajax, a tank/bruiser-type hero that specializes in shielding and disrupting foes.</p>
<p>I'm taken through a linear beginner mission to get acquainted with the gameplay of <em>The First Descendant</em>. Here, I learn about my abilities as Ajax and I get familiar with the gunplay and traversal system. Every Descendant is equipped with a grappling hook (because every game needs one, duh), but I can't complain because it's really fun to use.</p>

<h2>Lootin' and Shootin' in <em>The First Descendant</em></h2>
<p>Like any live service game, you're hit with a deluge of information explaining the various systems at play. Don't get too stressed by <em>The First Descendant</em> -- it might not necessarily <em>ease</em> you into things, but you're able to intuit most of the mechanics even if some aren't explained all that well.</p>
<p>You have open-world missions you can partake in these hub areas, as well as more linear dungeon experiences. These can be tackled with friends or others online, so there's a communal element to <em>The First Descendant</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, what I gravitate towards the most is loot and progression, of which there is a <em>lot</em> in this game. First, you level up your descendants and gain more power as you do so, all the while gaining new abilities and looting new weapons and modules to upgrade them with.</p>

<p>Loot is actually my biggest gripe with <em>The First Descendant</em>. There's a decent amount of weapon types, approximately a dozen or so. Weapons within each type feel almost if not exactly the same as the last. The only difference is, you'll have modifiers that make a gun more powerful, but it's not like <em>Borderlands</em> where guns can vary wildly.</p>
<p>Even the modules, which you use to upgrade the stats of your guns, are bland. You get percent increases like increased damage or fire rate, but it's hard to notice a difference. Even modules like "Electric Enhancement," which makes your guns shoot electric-based attacks, doesn't seem to look or feel individualized.</p>
<p>When I tried out a late-game, fully equipped character with the very best weapons and upgrades, I felt more powerful, sure, but weapons behaved the same as they did at lower levels. Looter shooters are so fun because of this unknown element of what the next gun might be, but I'm not really feeling it here.</p>
<p>That said, the guns do feel punchy and enemies go down relatively easy, so you feel powerful. Combine the gunplay with some Descendant abilities, and combat is just enticing enough to keep me engaged. Moving forward, though, I hope for more weapon types and variation in gunplay.</p>

<h2>Will <em>The First Descendant </em>Keep You Hooked?</h2>
<p><em>The First Descendant</em> plays it very by the books, which means it's a safe bet for a fun time, but I do fear for its longevity. Is it unique enough to distinguish itself from others on the market? How long will it take for me to get bored of it?</p>
<p>Because my progress was fast-tracked in the demo, I'm not sure how progression will be, but I hope that core gameplay loop of going out on missions, grabbing materials, and upgrading my descendant is enough to justify playing a game that demands a lot of time.</p>
<p>For now, I'm pretty impressed by the overall package. It's polished, runs decently well (and the implementation of DLSS is appreciated), and I like how individualized the Descendants are with their abilities. We won't have to wait very long to see the final product, which will be available on July 4, 2024.</p>

  <p id="sdPJyZ">Back in the early 1990s, the creators of <em>Myst</em> had a problem with their testers. Players would wander around the initial island, poking at the rocket ship, flipping the levers on the podiums up and down, and watching as none of it did anything. The quantity of puzzles was overwhelming, the solutions inaccessible. They’d get bored, and then get frustrated, and then too many of them would give up. </p>

<p id="gKFQRF">The solution was to add a hologram, near the starting point of the game, which contained a recorded message from <em>Myst</em>’s guiding figure, Atrus. And if players missed that room, there was a piece of paper — a piece of paper, <em>loose on the ground — </em>with a note on it that told players — with, like, <em>words</em>! — to go check that room.</p>
<p id="bSsnXa">Today, this would be fixed by making the message room more obvious. Or by starting with the player <em>facing</em> the door, or by putting the room in a privileged position. In the genre of puzzle games in which you explore a series of freaky li’l rooms, environmental storytelling is king. Except the phrase “<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/environmental-storytelling-creating-immersive-3d-worlds-using-lessons-learned-from-the-theme-park-industry">environmental storytelling</a>” wouldn’t be coined until years after the release of <em>Myst</em> and its expectation-shattering sequel, <em>Riven</em>. </p>
<p id="888JHj">To unpack the legacy of those two games would take another article on its own, but suffice it to say, the genre that developer Cyan Worlds put on the map has done some significant evolving in the 30 years since <em>Myst</em> and <em>Riven</em> were first released. Which is exactly why it’s so fascinating to play this week’s 3D remake of <em>Riven</em>, in which Rand Miller and the rest of the folks at Cyan return to a masterpiece with three decades of environmental puzzle games at their backs. </p>

<p id="BWCTgr"><em>Riven </em>(2024) is a compelling work of preservation. The game’s earliest life began as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23432662/riven-remake-myst-sequel-cyan-worlds-release-date">the Starry Expanse Project</a>, a fan-run effort to faithfully convert the three hours of video and nearly 5000 images that make up the original <em>Riven</em> into a traversable 3D environment. The final result, after Cyan officially absorbed the Project’s assets and even hired some of its contributors, is — in a word — gorgeous. </p>
<p id="HbVXwe"><em>Riven</em>, after all, is a game of stone, metal, and wood, textures that the Unreal Engine can simulate with its eyes closed, and there are vistas in the remake that, so long as you don’t move your view, you could <em>almost</em> convince yourself are photographs. The other good news for the pleasure centers of fans’ brains is that the original game’s sound design is intact. The meaty thunk-griiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind-LATCH of Temple Island’s rotating room, the keening screech of metal as a maglev car turns around, the bone-vibrating slam of a fire marble turning over — all are just as you remember them. </p>
<p id="nTNXjF">Also familiar: The loading screens take forever. But for a game that originally prompted you to insert one of five different CD-ROMs every time you moved from one island to another — a core, frequent, and intended part of the gameplay — sitting through a gently disguised loading screen, however long, is a palpable advancement. </p>
<p id="CTh1ZQ">Other parts will <em>not</em> be familiar.</p>
<p id="kbgWAA">Some solutions that remained the same from playthrough to playthrough in the original are now randomized for each save, so cheeky players can’t just look up the answers. The full-motion video actors have been replaced with animated figures, synced to both original and re-recorded dialogue, from necessity. Those 30-year-old recordings simply don’t scale up to modern screens. </p>

<p id="ZdTX49">The transition from static images with no need for consistency of euclidean space to a full 3D environment has had a myriad of effects. Some rooms aren’t where they used to be; some modes of travel simply turned out not to work in 3D space. But some tweaks seem fully considered on the part of the developers — and well-chosen. </p>
<p id="rmVuI2">The <em>Riven</em> remake gently gates areas of the game that were originally fully accessible to a new player, yet unsolvable until much later in their playthrough, so as to prevent exactly the kind of overwhelmed frustration that early <em>Myst</em> playtesters experienced. Two of the game’s most involved puzzles have also been completely reworked in ways that were simply not technologically possible in 1997.</p>
<p id="7axwuY">These are not small changes, and I expect some of them may tweak at the nostalgia of longtime fans. But on the other hand, <em>Riven</em>’s most finicky, tedious, time-consuming stumper is here converted into something visually jaw-dropping and engaging to manipulate. </p>
<p id="3zOXlU">If you’re a <em>Riven</em> fan, you simply must play this version. If you’ve never played <em>Riven</em>, there’s no better opportunity. Escaping into another world is not just the external promise of the Myst games, but the actual premise, and <em>Riven</em>’s update brings those two things closer than ever before. </p>

One of the huge strengths of the games as a service model is you can be long term, you can think long term in terms of what is best for the player, and how does that overlap with what is best for the company. I think it allows you to make much, much, much better decisions overall."</p><p>Tung referenced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/e3-is-dead-for-good">the now defunct E3</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-responds-to-report-about-fake-e3-demo-and-development-issues">the trailers and gameplay clips which premiered there</a>, promising what he called "bulls**t vaporware" that players would never actually get to experience, because all developers had to do was convince them to spend $60.</p><p>"I would wager that any developer who has ever worked in the $60 box product model, up until the point where E3 was cancelled, has a story about the E3 build," he said. "It's like, let's jam as much bulls**t vaporware into the build as we can in the next three months because we have to have a huge showing at E3, because it's our one opportunity to talk to our audience before we launch the game."</p><p>"I would have to wager that some hugely significant percentage of those E3 efforts ended up on the cutting room floor because they were half-baked and caused people to crunch and really make huge sacrifices to get it in," Tung added. "That's my favorite example of hugely impactful decisions that were not about what is best for the player."</p><p>Live service, on the other hand, allows developers to continue working on games after launch, communicate with their audience to see what players actually want, and so on. Tung therefore believes "the games as a service model is so much better for developers and players."</p><p>The topic has proved controversial amongst gamers, with many frustrated that even single player games now have microtransactions, preorder bonuses, early access periods, and so on, and as a result the $60 purchase, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-70-dollar-price-point-aaa-games">which is more commonly $70 in 2024</a>, no longer grants everything a game has to offer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-responds-to-star-wars-outlaws-season-pass-backlash-insists-jabba-the-hutt-is-part-of-the-experience-for-all-players">Ubisoft titles Star Wars: Outlaws and Assassin's Creed Shadows have both faced criticism for this</a> recently, as both have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-has-day-one-missions-only-available-through-season-pass-or-by-preordering">missions locked behind more expensive editions</a> and can't be played on their true launch date unless players spend upwards of $100.</p><p>Some developers have seemingly managed to thread the needle between one-off purchase and live service, however, with PlayStation and PC hit Helldivers 2 being the best recent example of a successful game balancing both models.</p><p>It launched for a lesser $40 and still features microtransactions, but its live service components feature incredible depth as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2s-latest-major-order-presents-players-with-a-moral-dilemma-save-sick-kids-or-unlock-a-new-stratagem">the game's story is weaved around them and changes depending on what players can and can't accomplish</a> in timed events.</p><p>This combination appears to have worked as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2 wasn't just received well by critics</a> but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">had sold more than 12 million copies by May 14, 2024</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

The developers, aside from the historical backdrop, decided to realistically depict the interior of the submarine and other locations. To achieve this, they relied on the few available photographs taken on sister submarines. The situation was complicated by the fact that most of the materials were available exclusively in Russian, making access to sources significantly more difficult. At this stage, one can identify the first problem of creating realistic games—the insufficiency of materials, sources, and information.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The true causes of the disaster and its sequence of events are also unknown, so this gap had to be filled with an abstract scenario. In a situation where a significant portion of individuals who experienced the event, either directly or indirectly, are still alive, crafting an interpretation of reality poses several challenges. The first is the possibility of new information emerging that may reveal inconsistencies or illogical aspects between the presented scenario and the actual events. The second challenge is the risk of offending individuals emotionally involved in the event, which was very apparent during the production of "KURSK."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The third observed problem is the right to use specific materials. Access to military documents of the submarine's crew was possible—in a realistic approach, the ideal solution would have been to create characters with the same names and appropriately modeled appearances. However, licensing issues, the right to likeness, and the feelings of the families of those who perished on the submarine stand in the way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fourth, more obvious aspect is finding a balance between depicting the truth and what will be interesting for the player. Game design has its own rules; players have become accustomed to certain patterns and solutions and have specific expectations regarding the tasks presented to them. Reality usually appears much simpler and duller—there is no point in engaging the player in several days of observing maneuvers from the submarine's perspective before the disaster occurs. In a realistic approach, they would spend most of the game standing next to the captain, listening to orders being given and received communications, only to later experience a brief episode with the disaster.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fifth encountered problem is, of course, the budget. Faithfully recreating realism is associated with significantly higher costs—primarily, there is no possibility of using ready-made assets, or this possibility is very limited. More time needs to be devoted to gathering source material, verifying facts, and adjusting mechanics and storyline to them. Often, it will be necessary to purchase additional licenses, such as music from a given period or the rights to use trademarks or specific models.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Truck Simulation 19">Truck Simulation 19</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Continuing the discussion on licensing rights, it is worth looking at another game from the studio—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.astragon.trucksimtwo&amp;hl=en_US">Truck Simulation 19</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The idea behind this production was to create a mobile truck simulator. To maximize realism, it was necessary to obtain licenses to use real truck models in the game. Besides the obvious financial considerations, it is important to remember that such licenses can come with additional requirements. For example, all trucks must have the same parameters to avoid presenting players with better and worse options. Only customization offered by the manufacturers is allowed—meaning all additional stickers, paint jobs, or super-tuning are excluded. Trucks cannot be shown in a negative light, which means forgoing damage systems or vehicle dirt. Moreover, using the vehicles for illegal purposes, such as street racing or transporting prohibited cargo, may also be disallowed. Licensing issues can thus force the abandonment of certain gameplay ideas but can also block some realistic aspects in games.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Take Off Flight Simulator">Take Off Flight Simulator</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second simulator released for mobile devices is the flight simulator </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/take-off-the-flight-simulator-switch/">Take Off</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In this game, the player takes on the role of a pilot building their airline company in the Hawaiian Islands. In this case, budget considerations led to the decision to forgo accurate representation of real aircraft, and instead, planes were created solely inspired by real models.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Originally, the game's idea was to enable the most faithful feeling of controlling an aircraft, with accurate physics and the behavior of the machine during winds, weather changes, and altitude differences, considering the size and type of the aircraft and its parameters. The problem encountered here was the computational power of mobile devices. Developing a game for mobile devices involves significantly less computational power than for PCs, so it was necessary to greatly simplify the physics and abandon realism in favor of accessibility on a larger number of devices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another realistic element that had to be abandoned was the realistic number of parameters that the pilot must control and the handling of individual mechanisms in the aircraft. Creating a true-to-life simulator that faithfully reproduces a pilot's work would significantly reduce the player base—few possess the skills that would allow them to enjoy such a game.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Deep Diving Adventures">Deep Diving Adventures</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990030/Deep_Diving_Simulator/">Deep Diving Simulator</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, also known as Deep Diving Adventures, is a deep-sea diving simulator. A significant emphasis in this game was placed on realistically portraying the ocean floor with its flora and fauna, realistic aspects, problems and dangers of diving, and environmental conservation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first reason for deviating from realism here was age-related requirements and associated restrictions. In many markets, there are varied requirements for games aimed at children, making it impossible to include real weapons in the game—which were intended for fighting predators or removing obstacles. It was necessary to create a sound gun that only scared away aggressive fish with ultrasound and disintegrated obstacles with a laser without any shots.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lack of weapons also ties into social issues and expectations for this type of game—we have all heard about the problems Assassin’s Creed faced related to hunting endangered fish species. Society is more accepting of killing monsters and humans in games, but when it comes to animals, especially rare ones, there is an outcry. Social expectations for environmental care are very high, and in the case of realistic games, there are expectations to align with this narrative.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The third aspect that had to be considered when deciding on the level of realism in this game was player knowledge. People entirely unfamiliar with diving will not understand why rapid changes in depth cause a decrease in health points, why the player automatically receives cold damage at lower levels, or that some marine creatures, though seemingly harmless, can be dangerous. It was necessary to decide what the player would be able to grasp or how to explain it effectively and quickly.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Covid the Outbreak">Covid the Outbreak</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1287000/COVID_The_Outbreak/?l=polish">Covid the Outbreak</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or Virus the Outbreak, is a strategy game that was created as an artistic and social manifesto by the developers confined to their homes. The very short production period allowed for the release of a game created during the pandemic, about the pandemic, and for the pandemic. In this game, the player assumes the role of the director of the Global Health Organization, who can persuade all countries around the world to take specific actions in the fight against the virus. The game's goal was to show why governments make certain decisions and what impacts they will have—how to balance social, economic, tourism, and cultural issues in the face of combating the disease.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This type of game faced significant resistance due to its subject matter—once again highlighting the prevailing belief in society that games should not touch on important topics and are considered a lesser, less responsible medium.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another problem encountered during this production was emotions—the aversion to the pandemic and the negative feelings associated with it carried over to the game's reception. The game caused a great stir—for example, the thread dedicated to it on the GOG store became one of the most popular topics, surpassing the biggest releases in terms of the number of comments.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The third problem related to this production was differing opinions. The developers tried to take a neutral approach—explaining the arguments of both sides, such as stating, “Lockdown is necessary to limit the spread of the virus, but the longer it lasts, the greater the socio-economic problems it may cause.” Extremist supporters did not appreciate this centrist approach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fourth problem was the prohibition and banning of certain words and topics. To release the game on some consoles, it was necessary to change the title to “VIRUS” and remove all references to COVID (even though the game depicted a completely different disease variant set in the future). For some sales platforms, even this change was insufficient, and they refused to publish a production concerning even an abstract pandemic—resulting in the game not being released on all devices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fifth problem was marketing issues and large corporations reducing the reach of certain keywords. As a result, not only did official materials and sponsored content have significantly lower reach, but gameplay videos from independent influencers were also demonetized, causing reluctance to record the game.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Realpolitiks Series">Realpolitiks Series</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1248060/Realpolitiks_II/">The Realpolitiks</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> games represent the cornerstone series for the company. As a grand strategy game set in real-time and contemporary times, it fills a niche left by Paradox, which is reluctant to undertake such realistic titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first problem with realism in this series lies primarily in geopolitical conflicts—not just the delineation of borders, but also the names of countries, regions, and seas. For example, Japan does not recognize the name "East China Sea." Using this term not only resulted in threats against the developers but also led to the game being massively reported to Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Contemporary issues such as terrorism, wars, refugees, and political opinions evoke strong emotions, controversies, and aversion. Many publishers are hesitant to tackle such topics. A company that tries to include them in its productions, even while maintaining full neutrality, must be prepared for negative reactions from the media, influencers, and some gamer communities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another obstacle to realism in games is banned symbols. Contrary to appearances, this list is quite extensive and, in addition to swastikas, also includes the international red cross symbol and various local symbols. An example is the first installment of the series, where it was necessary to remove the flag of the Islamic State from the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The next aspect is the expectation to combat harmful attitudes, especially when it concerns contemporary times. For example, in Stellaris, a player can create a fascist state enslaving all other nations in the galaxy without negative reception. However, in a strategy set in our times, calling the Belarusian government authoritarian rather than totalitarian caused many expressions of dissatisfaction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is also worth noting that with realistic games, many people engage in personal crusades against a particular topic. Again, referring to the first part of the series, the inclusion of the Silesian nationality resulted in several negative reviews from opponents of this solution.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A problem with realistic games is also the changing narrative in mainstream media. What was acceptable at the beginning of production can become forbidden and unwanted after several years of developing the game. For instance, during the production of Realpolitiks 3, the perception of Palestine and Israel, as well as migration issues to Europe, changed significantly.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Punk Wars">Punk Wars</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A less problematic approach to realism can be observed in the fantastical game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1541790/Punk_Wars/">Punk Wars</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. According to the studio's philosophy, every game must reference contemporary issues, so here they decided to show the dangers that excessive faith in technology, corporatism, and continuous industrialization can bring—leading to an apocalypse and the takeover of power by fanatical corporations trying to rebuild humanity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, even such a large dose of speculative fiction must meet the expectations of realism among players—mainly in the form of certain patterns and beliefs already ingrained in the audience. If a faction wants to use steampunk technology, it must be consistent with the entire vision of that setting—meaning lots of clocks, gears, and specific colors. The same applies to dieselpunk, atompunk, and steelpunk. Players react negatively to breaking certain conventions derived from realism—real technological limitations or cultural sources different from those presented in the game.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Dark Moon">Dark Moon</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1105330/Dark_Moon/">Dark Moon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" is an upcoming survival strategy game set in the near future, during the early stages of moon colonization. The player takes on the role of an employee of a large corporation, who is caught by a solar flare during a lunar mission, leading to the destruction of all electronics exposed to sunlight. The player must expand their mobile base and stay on the dark side of the moon, racing against time and the encroaching sunlight.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To give the catastrophe a realistic touch, the studio consulted with a satellite constructor to learn about satellite safeguards and procedures for such disasters. However, finding experts with such specialized knowledge who were willing to share it proved challenging. Several times, they faced refusals from NASA employees and academic lecturers. Thus, the problem here is the availability of experts or consultants.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The Slavs">The Slavs</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The last production mentioned in this article is "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://jujubee.pl/?page_id=12">The Slavs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">," an unreleased turn-based strategy game focusing on the culture and beliefs of the Slavs compared to other ethnic groups in early medieval Europe. This game is fundamentally a cultural project, heavily based on realism, true sources, and history. Such productions enjoy great popularity in Poland and are strongly supported by the state. In this case, Jujubee received a grant to create a prototype of a strategic game about Slavic culture and history, funded by the Minister of Culture and National Heritage as part of the Creative Industry Development Center's "video game support program" under the task "creating prototypes of cultural video games" amounting to 261,678 PLN.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During the production, they encountered problems related to the scarcity of sources and studies. The topic of the Slavs is not very popular or overexploited in pop culture but has a dedicated fan base. Thus, there was a problem with satisfying two extremely different audiences—those with extensive knowledge and those with none at all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another problem with creating games based on such sources, which are often tales and legends rather than real chronicles written by historians, is balancing realism and gameplay with mythology. Mythological and legendary events often contradict basic historical knowledge, creating another problem in choosing the game's content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lastly, cognitive biases in players present a problem. Pop culture has taught us certain patterns, but in the case of realistic references, these are often incorrect patterns (e.g., Vikings wearing horned helmets). For the Slavs, the biggest culprit is the local "The Witcher" series—widely perceived as a model of Slavic culture, but in reality, it draws more from Germanic mythology. The challenge is to confront players' expectations and understanding of Slavic culture with a realistic portrayal of its elements.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Summary">Summary</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creating realistic games can take various forms. Realism does not always mean faithful representation in game mechanics but can also manifest as historical games, those based on cultural texts, or those reflecting current, real-world events. Realism can bring numerous benefits to a game, but it also entails additional challenges for developers—from the design phase, through production, to release, marketing, and product support. Often, it is only after years that it becomes clear whether the chosen approach was correct or not.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Examining 11 games

<p>Infogrames says it plans to "expand distribution" of the IP, as well as potentially developing new games in the series.

The first is&nbsp;<em>Totally Reliable Delivery Service</em>, the acquisition of which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-infogrames-publishing-revival">announced alongside the label's revival</a>.</p>
<p>The divestment of&nbsp;<em>Surgeon Simulator&nbsp;</em>fits with former publisher tinyBuild's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tinybuild-financials-2023">shift towards the purported "1000-hour game"</a>, i.e. live-service games or titles that can be played repeatedly rather than one-and-done affairs.</p>
<p>It's certainly true that players return to&nbsp;<em>Surgeon Simulator&nbsp;</em>time and time again, but it's not along the same lines as games like&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/level-zero-extraction-release-date"><em>Level Zero: Extraction</em></a>, the latter of which is one of tinyBuild's upcoming games.</p>
<p>This also isn't the first time Atari and tinyBuild have done business. Back in late December, Atari <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-tinybuild-investment">invested $2 million in the publisher</a>, meaning Atari currently holds around 7.5% of tinyBuild's total share capital.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Infogrames intends to do with the&nbsp;<em>Surgeon Simulator&nbsp;</em>IP, but it certainly sounds like we haven't heard the last of it. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
As Elden Ring players struggle with the high difficulty of Shadow of the Erdtree, the most popular mods since release focus on easing the challenge.
</p>
<p>
Over on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/popular/">NexusMods</a>, plenty of new mods have already been uploaded since the launch of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> last week, ready for PC players to enter the Land of Shadow.
</p>
<p>
Many of these mods provide a save file to ensure players are ready for the DLC. To access the new quest, two specific bosses in the base game must be defeated - unless you've got a mod to do that for you, like those from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5181">byDelamain</a> or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5241">Yticaya</a>.

<p>

Yet difficulty has proven contentious for Shadow of the Erdtree, with lots of mods aiming to make it easier. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5216">Syyyke's All in One Cheat Version</a>, for instance, includes free weapon and spirit upgrades, the ability to block all attacks without impacting stamina, and a Grand Merchant with access to any items. The mod is yet to be implemented on new DLC items.

</p>
<p>
Similar to that Grand Merchant, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5192">Tom Clark's Glorious Merchant</a> has free access to every item for whatever build you want to make, and it's DLC compatible.

</p>
<p>
Alternatives include <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5229">Sereenaty's Unlimited Power mod</a> that adds free levelling, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5240">MaliceKy's mod</a> that provides a character at level 713 with maxed stats, maxed Blessings, and the base game fully completed with all gear acquired. There's also <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5080">justcookie68's mod</a> to summon bosses for help, or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5178">GreyEnigma's mod</a> to reduce grinding.




</p>
<p>
And then there's Sereenaty's other mod, offering <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5244">Wolverine Mode</a>. Here players take 50 percent less damage, regenerate health and FP, do double damage, can recover runes immediately, and have infinite use of Blessing of Marika. "Punish the DLC instead of it punishing you!" they exclaim.
</p>
<p>
I'm also intrigued by <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5207">Noctis' Graceborne mod</a> that adds a Bloodborne-inspired overhaul for a "more grim and sinister experience". It includes trick weapons and firearms that parry, removes equipment load, and switches lighting to permanent nighttime. It's in the early stages, but ideal for those waiting for a Bloodborne sequel (good luck with that).

</p>
<p>
Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-revises-shadow-realm-blessing-balance">FromSoftware added a patch to Elden Ring</a> to adjust the balance scaling of the Blessings in Shadow of the Erdtree, after players found the difficulty too high.

</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-developers-have-big-opaque-plans-for-galactic-war-and-that-black-hole-you-made.911622/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-developers-have-big-opaque-plans-for-galactic-war-and-that-black-hole-you-made<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Game development studio and intergalactic war ministry Arrowhead have launched a new series of written update posts for players of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> to help keep the war record straight. Mostly, this is the usual case of somebody on the team gathering quotes as the developers batter their fingertips against keyboards to bring you, the video gamer, fresh cannons and what-have-you. But there is some insight into what the conflict-pushers at Arrowhead have enjoyed most about player actions over the last month, including bringing an entire planet to the liberated state of post-existence.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To sum it up, the government is pleased with its soldiers. They judge the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-major-order-turns-planet-into-black-hole-as-rumours-of-returning-illuminate-faction-intensify">recent destruction of the planet Merida</a> as fortuitous, and the appearance of the black hole that showed up to replace it as "a reminder of all the hard-won battles that brought us here." That's according to mysterious game master Joel, who is also pleased at the speculation surrounding this black hole. "Keep it coming!" he says.</p>
<p>Now that this planet (and its supercolony of bugs) is gone, the studio is redirecting its players' vitriol towards the robotic Automaton enemies. </p>
<p>"[We] have discovered that the Automatons are planning a massive terraforming project on Cyberstan," says the post. "Obviously, we cannot allow them to continue with this plan... it's finally time to launch a counteroffensive against them to dismantle their unjust and illegal occupation."</p>
<p>It's more of the classic war-chat that makes Helldivers 2 such a popular playable inside joke. If you enjoy this ongoing back and forth between player and developer, there are hints that the dev team is seeking to make some "improvements" to Joel's role in directing the wartorn universe. </p>
<p>"I’m very excited to see the future improvements we want to make to the Galactic War and all the tools we have planned for the Game Master," says production director, Alex Bolle. "One of our pillars for the future is to focus on playing with (or against) the community, and what I see so far tells me that we’ll have a lot of fun."</p>
<p>The director also reiterated the studio's reasoning for reducing the number of updates to the game, in favour of more infrequent and thorough patches.</p>
<p>"We see our relationship with players like being a showman, and [we want to] delight them with regular updates," said Bolle. "But we noticed that those hotfixes became too usual for us to focus on bigger content. Rethinking our cadence helps us reach the quality expected, and incorporate more thorough bug fixes... We want to extend our bug fixing periods so that we pick up the biggest flaws earlier."</p>
<p>You can read all the Helldiver histrionics for yourself in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4183362170401345632?l=english">the update post on Steam</a>. It's mostly a round-up of information players already know, but it's still a useful summary for anyone who doesn't tie themselves with patriotic fervour to every tweet and textbox. They'll do a similar post next month, they say, following whatever shenanigans are due to erupt in the meantime. Perhaps the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-cutting-edge-warbond-is-out-sparking-fresh-debate-about-the-illuminates-faction">long-rumoured third enemy faction, the Illuminate</a>, will have appeared by then? Who can say.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 is built upon a running gag of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-not-just-helldivers-2-plenty-of-games-owe-a-lot-to-the-films-of-paul-verhoeven">Verhoeven proportions</a>. It's funny! But I do find a joke gets stale when you keep telling it over and over. I very much enjoy the satire of Starship Troopers, its principal inspiration, but that movie has the benefit of being 2 hours long. A luxury not shared by a video game designed to be replayed mission after mission. It will be interesting to see how the developers aim to keep the japes fresh.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/26/the-latest-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-update-should-make-your-journey-a-bit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6JIclaNO84" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>This patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads "1.12.2" if it has – select "LOGIN" and that will apply the latest version of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only other thing this <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-1-12-2">update</a> contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/20/new-elden-ring-patch-adds-hairstyles-new-inventory-features-balance-adjustments-and">new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more</a> to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It looks like Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from the Terminator series may be coming to Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>According to dataminer <a href="https://x.com/interloko/status/1805357202481594595">Interloko</a>, six more characters will be coming to NetherRealm's fighter, likely as part of the next DLC pack, as well as two arenas and five new announcers.</p>

<p>Leaked Mortal Kombat 1 characters from <a href="https://x.com/interloko">Interloko</a>'s datamining efforts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cyrax</li>
<li>Sektor</li>
<li>Noob Saibot</li>
<li>Ghostface (Scream)</li>
<li>Conan the Barbarian</li>
<li>T-1000 (Terminator)</li>
</ul>
<p>The inclusion of Ghostface in this list isn't exactly a surprise. Last year, dataminers managed to <a href="https://twitter.com/thethiny/status/1703601270953513035">unearth evidence</a> that alluded to some unannounced DLC content, and Scream's masked slasher was included in a list of voice lines that were discovered in the game. Mortal Kombat's cyborg Cyrax was also included here.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in September, Mortal Kombat boss Ed Boon shared an image of some of media's most famous slasher-flick faces, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ed-boon-gets-tongues-wagging-with-ghostface-and-jigsaw-tease-for-mortal-kombat-1">Ghostface was present among them</a>. Many surmised this was a clue from the developer that these less than friendly foes would soon be making their way into Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the game's DLC.</p>
<p>I just wonder if this leak does prove accurate, Arnie will voice Conan... We will update you when we know more.</p> <div>

					<p>The wait for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a> was extremely long, but it was well worth it, as Remedy Entertainment put out something that wasn't just a simple survival horror game but an intense experience that is very difficult to forget.&nbsp; While another entry in the series won't be seeing the light of day anytime soon, especially with Remedy working on multiple titles (including the second entry in the Control series and remakes of the first two entries in the Max Payne series) the base Alan Wake 2 game isn't the last we will see of the tormented writer for a long time, thanks to the two planned expansions, Night Springs and Lake House. The former is already out and the subject of today's review.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Alan-Wake-2-Screenshot-2024.06.24-12.40.51.14-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Alan Wake 2: Night Springs DLC is a rather short expansion comprised of three episodes starring three characters of the Remedy Connected Universe: the waitress Rose Marigold, Control's main character Jesse Faden, and Shawn Ashmore, the real-life actor who plays the sheriff in Alan Wake 2 as well as Jack Joyce from Quantum Break. While they are somewhat separated from the main story, the three additional episodes are masterfully woven into the Alan Wake world, as they are part of the Night Springs TV show, an in-universe TV show that was mentioned in multiple Remedy Entertainment titles. Better yet, the TV show premise allowed the developers to bring back the amazing Mr. Door, played by David Harewood, who provides an introduction for the three episodes and has a central role in one of them.</p>
<p>Having been conceived as episodes of a TV show, the three additional scenarios included in Alan Wake 2: Night Springs are not particularly long, lasting between 30 minutes and a little over an hour. And while they don't really shake up the gameplay formula of the base game, they are extremely entertaining. Remedy went all out with the wackiness, presenting some scenarios that could have been, maybe, too much even for the main game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Alan-Wake-2-Screenshot-2024.06.24-12.51.27.40-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The first episode of the Alan Wake 2: Night Springs expansion is Number One Fan. Controlling the waitress Rose Marigold, players will have to save Alan Wake, who is holed up inside his mansion, an army of haters summoned by his evil twin brother (who is actually Mr. Scratch). Right from the start, it's clear how this scenario is, by far, the furthest in terms of atmosphere and gameplay from the base game. From receiving Alan Wake's distress signal from a Big Mouth Billy Bass to the banners and graffiti around town highlighting how the waitress and the writer are meant for each other and the 50s rock soundtrack, it's clear how the team wanted to go for a humorous, surreal tone. Needless to say, they succeed. The haters' comments are particularly funny and quite a bit meta, shouting to the world that Alan Wake is just a Stephen King knock-off, which I'm pretty sure is something that must have come to more than a few players' minds when experiencing the base game. Gameplay-wise, this episode does away with most of the survival-horror mechanics of the base game, including the flashlight mechanics, essentially offering the player infinite armor for two powerful weapons and, thus, the chance to go all out on enemies for a rather fun, and gory, romp.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Alan-Wake-2-Screenshot-2024.06.24-23.45.14.95-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The second episode of the Alan Wake 2: Night Springs expansion is North Star, starring Control's Jesse Faden. On her journey to find her brother, the young woman ends up in Coffee World, not knowing she will come into contact with a government conspiracy set around... coffee. While less in-your-face humorous and more in line in terms of mechanics and atmosphere with the base game, North Star is still pretty hilarious in its own way. Much like the previous episode, the one starring Jesse Faden is rather straightforward despite the inclusion of some simple puzzles and the return of the flashlight mechanics, though I was a little disappointed how none of her powers made even a brief appearance during the 40 minutes or so of her episode.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Alan-Wake-2-Screenshot-2024.06.25-00.20.06.01-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The third, and definitely the most interesting episode of the three, is Time Breaker. This episode stars actor Shawn Ashmore, who has been hired to star in Sam Lake's latest game, not knowing he will end up in the clutches of the mysterious Mr.Door, who will bring him on a psychedelic journey where realities collide and the surreal becomes very, very real. While the gameplay is pretty much in line with the North Star episode, this episode is considerably better than the other two and the one that feels the closest to the base experience. It is possibly even more daring than the base game in terms of visual presentation, masterfully blending together some very different styles, something that alone makes it worth the price of admission.</p>
<p>While it does not offer much in terms of gameplay, the Alan Wake 2: Night Springs expansion is a worthy DLC to experience for all fans of the base game and Remedy Entertainment's titles. Free from the limitations imposed by the base game's narrative, which was fairly loose to begin with, Sam Lake and his team have gone all out to provide some extremely entertaining scenarios that, unfortunately, are over way too soon and leave the player wanting more. Hopefully, the next expansion, Lake House, will offer something a bit meatier to complement the masterful storytelling that is as well showcased in Night Springs as it is in the base game.</p>

<p>With its three entertaining scenarios showcasing Remedy Entertainment's narrative and visual design prowess, the Alan Wake 2: Night Springs expansion is a more than worthy DLC for all fans of the base game and the Finnish developer, provided they can keep their expectations in check. The expansion's short length, a little over two and a half hours, and its stripped-down gameplay will inevitably disappoint those looking for something more substantial</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-ps2-emulation-issues/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-ps2-emulation-issues-don%E2%80%99t-bode-well-for-the-rumored-ps3-emulation.911604/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-ps2-emulation-issues/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A first round of PlayStation 2 games playable via a new PlayStation 5 emulator was made available recently, but they don't bode well at all for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-playstation-3-backwards-compatibility/">native PS3 backward compatibility</a> Sony is rumored to be working on.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri20Y6E89LE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at this first batch of games, which include Tomb Raider: Legend and Sly Cooper, highlighting how emulation is really poor for both games. For the game starring Lara Croft, the experience is marred by a blurry image, which isn't the result of a low resolution, which nonetheless saw a slight boost over the original release, but of bad choices in image treatment that lead to bad results. The available visual modes are also bad, such as those featuring some bad CRT filters that fail to recreate the feel of older televisions. At the very least, games feature both NTSC and PAL options sporting 60 Hz and 50 Hz modes, respectively, and some performance improvements.</p>
<p><iframe title="PlayStation 2 Emulation on PS5 Tested... And We've Got Issues" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ri20Y6E89LE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It is really baffling how Sony can't seem to get PlayStation 5 backward compatibility right, as even the previous PS4 emulator used to play PS2 games on the current generation console is extremely flawed, making other options, such as upscalers and emulators, much better in terms of image quality. With the PlayStation 3 being a notoriously more complicated system to emulate, Sony not getting PS2 emulation right is definitely concerning. Hopefully, things will be improved in the future to offer proper backward compatibility that can do justice to these classic titles.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24185973/fantastic-four-mcu-time-period-setting-kevin-feige</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-mcu%E2%80%99s-fantastic-four-will-be-a-period-piece-kevin-feige-confirms.911601/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24185973/fantastic-four-mcu-time-period-setting-kevin-feige<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="CFzEKc"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24072946/fantastic-four-movie-robot-herbie-marvel"><em>Fantastic Four</em></a> is the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s biggest mystery, and maybe its greatest hope. Beyond who’s playing each member of Marvel’s first family, we’ve been in the dark about most other details until now. On the first episode of the new Official Marvel podcast, president of Marvel Studios Kevin Feige appeared as a guest and revealed that <em>Fantastic Four</em> will in fact be a period piece, rather than taking place in the modern-day MCU. </p>
<p id="xUxhz5">Fans first started speculating that the series might take the universe back in time when its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23715214/fantastic-four-2025-cast-marvel-movie-pedro-pascal-joseph-quinn">first artwork was revealed, which was in a decidedly mid-century style</a>. While the primary purpose of the art was to reveal the actors behind each member of the team — with Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Ebon-Moss Bachrach as Ben Grimm, and Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm — it also suggested to many fans that the movie might take place in the ’60s, the same decade that the Fantastic Four debuted. </p>
<p id="DaIPSL">But while Feige seems to confirm in his podcast appearance that the movie will take place in the ’60s, he also can’t help but include a few mysterious details to make sure the movie’s intrigue is intact. </p>
<p id="gXHlb1">“So it is a period piece,” Feige said. “There was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24121000/marvel-fantastic-four-movie-hints-free-comics">another piece of art we released with Johnny Storm flying in the air and making a four symbol</a>, and there was a cityscape in the corner of that image. And there were a lot of smart people who noticed that that cityscape didn’t look exactly like the New York that we know, or the New York that existed in the ’60s in our world. Those are some smart, smart observations.” </p>
<p id="dtjhAs">This could mean that the movie takes place in an alternate dimension, and the Fantastic Four gang gets sent to the MCU’s Earth during the plot, or maybe it’s some other multiversal shenanigans, but either way Feige isn’t giving us any details just yet. </p>
<p id="B8fnP4">One other bit of news the Marvel boss shared that should be particularly exciting for fans is that the movie will start filming the day after Comic-Con 2024, which means that <em>Fantastic Four</em> will be in production in just about a month. </p>
<p id="Bzl5Rk">As for what we know for sure, <em>Fantastic Four</em> is due out in theaters on July 25, 2025. Along with the core cast, the movie will also star Ralph Ineson as Galactus, Julia Garner as Shalla-Bal (the Silver Surfer), as well as Paul Walter Hauser, Natasha Lyonne, and John Malkovich in unannounced roles.</p>

<article id="post-6431">
  
  <div data-hide-featured-media="0">
<p>Atari announced this morning that publishing subsidiary Infogrames has acquired the <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> series from previous owner tinyBuild Inc. This marks the second casual, physics-heavy multiplayer game Infogrames has absorbed this year following April’s move to grab <em><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-relaunches-infogrames-acquires-totally-reliable-delivery-service">Totally Reliable Delivery Service</a></em> also from tinyBuild. <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> has released numerous games in the franchise, including VR titles and the most recent <em>Surgeon Simulator 2: Access All Areas</em>, which released in 2020 for PC and 2021 for Xbox.</p>



<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> has the player performing numerous surgical tasks of escalating complexity and strangeness all while having to contend with realtime physics and other obstacles. With these additions to relaunched Infogrames label, it seems like the publisher might be a new bastion for chaos simulators popular on streaming platforms.</p>



<p>Officially, Atari says via press release that Infogrames will “acquire IP and publish games that fall outside the core portfolio of IP associated with the Atari brand.” They also note that, consistent with their parent company’s general ethos, Infogrames “sees game preservation as a core component of its mission.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>the Steelbook edition of <em>Atari 50: The Anniversary Collection</em> on Switch comes with this stuff</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> acquisition adds to an already busy week for Atari, who announced Tuesday they will add 39 games to <em>Atari 50: The Anniversary Collection</em>, an expanded version of the critically acclaimed game/interactive digital museum/documentary. The new version of the title will have its own digital release across all modern platforms and a physical release for PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch, the latter getting an additional Steelbook edition retailing for $49.99 with some fancy extras.</p>



<p>Folks who have already purchased <em>Atari 50</em> will be able to get the additions found in <em>The Anniversary Collection</em> in DLC later this year. <em>Atari 50: The Anniversary Collection</em> comes out on October 25.</p>



<p>Between this week’s developments and their acquisition of the Intellivision name and library in May, Atari is having an extremely busy year so far. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games">All of this and they’re not stuck with figuring out what to do with the Amico</a>.

			<p>The improvements brought by Unreal Engine 5 with Lumen and Nanite may not be enough to justify the massive hit to the performance they cause, as highlighted by new comparison videos shared online this week.</p>
<p>The new comparison videos, put together by Cycu1, showcase the Unreal Engine 4.27 and 4.25 versions of Abandoned Warehouse and Ancient Temple tech demos developed by Scan Factory with their Unreal Engine 5.1 ports. Both videos highlight how the difference in shadows and accurate lighting is not that massive to justify the performance hit in both demos, which is often close to a 100 FPS difference on an RTX 4080 GPU.</p>
<p><iframe title="Abandoned Werehouse Demo Unreal Engine 4.27 vs Unreal Engine 5.1 RTX 4080 Graphics Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ViDILolphuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><iframe title="Ancient Temple Demo Unreal Engine 4.25 vs Unreal Engine 5.1 RTX 4080 Graphics Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRflwKil6MI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have seen the Unreal Engine 5 <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-struggles-native-4k-rtx-4080/">pushing current generation high-end GPUs to their limit</a>, as the RTX 4080 struggles to run some tech demos with decent performance at native 4K resolution. As such, it's clear that the new version of the engine by Epic needs plenty more work to deliver smooth gaming experiences, although it seems like playing at native 4K resolution may be something that only a few players with the best possible rigs will be able to do in the future, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-cant-run-native-4k-engine-design/">upscaling is an important feature of the engine that is expected to be used</a> by developers to achieve playable framerates.</p>
<p>The latest version of the engine by Epic is Unreal Engine 5.4. You can learn more about it by heading over to its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-4-is-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186316/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-notes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="YLXwTH">FromSoftware has released a surprise mini-patch — or “<a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-calibration-update-1122">calibration update</a>,” as it’s calling it — for <em>Elden Ring</em> that should ease the steep difficulty challenge posed by its new expansion, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180113/dlc-walkthroughs-guides"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>.</p>
<p id="ysn0zk">The patch adjusts the way Shadow Realm Blessings, a crucial character advancement system in the DLC, will scale. The blessings increase the attack and defense of player characters and their spirit summons through the collection of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24178006/scadutree-fragment-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Scadutree Fragments</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24178007/revered-spirit-ashes-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Revered Spirit Ashes</a>.</p>
<p id="HlXFmh">FromSoftware says it has increased the value of the blessings for the first half of players’ progress, and then made progression for the second half more gradual. The final level of enhancements has also been upped slightly.</p>
<p id="0UV0TA">In short, this adjusted power curve should mean players feel more powerful in the early parts of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, where the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180254/all-dlc-boss-locations-bosses-in-order">first few bosses</a> have been giving the community serious trouble. The final boss should be a bit easier now, too.</p>
<p id="hndE9i">Note that you need to log in to <em>Elden Ring</em>’s multiplayer server for the changes to apply. The version number displayed on the title menu screen should be 1.12.2.</p>
<p id="hV7myH">That’s it for changes in this small emergency patch. However, FromSoftware also noted that it has confirmed a bug in the PC version of the game that causes raytracing to be enabled when loading save data from previous versions of the game. If you’re suffering from poor performance, the developer recommends checking your graphics settings to ensure raytracing hasn’t been unintentionally turned on.</p>
<p id="U4FQ56">Further balance changes and bug fixes will be coming in a future patch, FromSoftware said.</p>

        <p>Nexon's title earned double that of Tencent's best-selling game Honor of Kings</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Tencent and Nexon's latest release Dungeon &amp; Fighter Mobile exceeded $270 million during its first month of release in China, according to Sensor Tower.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-24/tencent-s-new-game-doubles-honor-of-kings-sales-in-first-month">Bloomberg</a>, the mobile title also ranked in the top spot for downloads and revenues on Apple's App Store following its release on May 21. It also earned twice as much as Tencent's best-selling game Honor of Kings.</p>
<p>The spin-off of Nexon's Dungeon &amp; Fighter series initially launched in South Korea in 2022, with Tencent earning the publishing rights of the game for China shortly after. Its release was delayed due to government restrictions, as noted by <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/dungeon-and-fighter-mobiles-first-month-of-ios-revenue-was-twice-that-of-honor-of-kings/">PocketGamer</a>.</p>
<p>"Since its release, Dungeon &amp; Fighter Mobile has been occupying the top positions for the iOS charts in all categories," said Sensor Tower's senior director of Asia-Pacific marketing Nan Lu.</p>
<p>"This is a very impressive start, and it has been stable as well. The future performance will depend on Tencent's operations and continuous update of the game."</p>

            <p>Playground Games is delisting Forza Horizon 4 from online stores at the end of the year, due to "licensing and agreements" with the game's partners.</p>
<p>On 15th December, Forza Horizon 4 will be removed from digital storefronts on PC and Xbox. This includes Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>The upcoming delisting means the new Series and Festival Playlist that started earlier this week, and which runs until 22nd August, will be the last. After this time, players will no longer be able to access the playlist screen, other than to see the festival playlist history.</p>

<p>"Even though there won't be any more Festival Playlists after Series 77 (August 22), you will still be able to see the Forza Events screen which will include a selection of daily and weekly challenges," Playground Games shared in a <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting">blog</a>. Completing these challenges and Forzathon Live Events will earn players Forzathon Points, which can be exchanged for Backstage Passes.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 4's DLC has already been delisted, meaning from now on this content can only be acquired through purchases of the game's Deluxe or Ultimate Edition versions.</p>
<p>"Players who already own the game and its content will be able to download and play it as normal, including its offline, online, and multiplayer features," Playground said. "Physical copies of the game purchased after [15th December] will also work and will be able to use online features."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Attention Forza Horizon 4 players!  </p><p>We have an important announcement regarding how FH4’s Festival Playlist will work after Series 77 (from July 25 until August 22) and its availability in digital stores after December 15.  </p><p>Please, read the complete update here:… <a href="https://t.co/sFrZU5sjOq">pic.twitter.com/sFrZU5sjOq</a></p></div>— Forza Horizon (@ForzaHorizon) <a href="https://twitter.com/ForzaHorizon/status/1805650519853351346?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Ahead of December's digital delisting, Playground will sell Forza Horizon 4 cheaper - though pricing is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Anyone who played the base game via Xbox's Game Pass subscription service and subsequently purchased DLC will be provided with a "token" for the game they can redeem, Playground also said.</p>
<p>"By having an active, full-paid (not discounted) Xbox Game Pass subscription on 6/25 you will be eligible to receive a game token if you have purchased any extra content for Forza Horizon 4 through your Xbox Message Center," it said, adding these codes will start being distributed in the coming days.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much for enjoying the content updates we have brought to this game," the Forza team closed. "Remember to make the most of the remaining time of the Festival Playlist and that when the game is delisted, you'll still be able to play it as you always have."</p>
<p>Former Eurogamer editor in chief Oli Welsh called the game  "another sumptuous, endlessly entertaining automotive playground" in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-4-review-racing-great-rolls-gingerly-into-new-era">Forza Horizon 4 review from 2018</a>.</p>

            <p>When I finished my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-review">review</a> for Soulslike Lies Of P, the devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/good-news-casual-soulslikers-lies-of-ps-latest-update-makes-it-dramatically-easier">released a patch</a> not long after that nerfed bosses and made things for ol' Pinnochio easier overall. Sod's Law struck that day… and it's returned with a smirk. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> has just been patched, making its Shadow Realm Blessings stronger from the off, and in turn, things a little easier for everybody. Such is the life of a reviewer, eh.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In what FromSoftware are calling "<a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-calibration-update-1122">Calibration Update - Version 1.12.2</a>", they've buffed the power of the Shadow Realm Blessings you'll find scattered exclusively throughout Erdtree's areas. Both Scadutree Fragments and Revered Ash Blessings have had their attack and damage negation increased for the "first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements". Once you've obtained the first half, later blessings will see more of a gradual increase to your stats.</p>
<p>In addition, the attack and damage negation granted by the "final level" of those blessings has been slightly increased. There aren't any concrete stats to analyse here, but the general gist is simple to understand: Blessings are strongerer.</p>
<p>To get the update you'll need to login to the multiplayer servers once you've booted up the game. You'll know if you're on the right build if you see "1.12.2" at the bottom right of the title menu. FromSoft says later "balance adjustments as well as bug fixes" are planned for a future patch.</p>
<p>And if you've been experiencing performance issues, the patch notes say to check in System &gt; Graphics Settings &gt; Raytracing Quality settings and see if it's been toggled to turn on automatically. If it has, it might be worth switching it off and seeing if things improve.</p>
<p>Erdtree <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-mixed-steam-reviews-paint-a-different-picture-to-the-critical-reception">launched to a mixed reception on Steam</a>, despite a positive critical reception. That came down to performance issues, but mainly, the DLC's difficulty when it comes to bosses being particularly overbearing. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-mod-resets-the-difficulty-to-elden-ring-levels-and-gets-rid-of-scadutree-fragments">A mod</a> was even released that balanced Erdtree's enemies to be more in line with the base game.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm fine with FromSoft lowering the difficulty and agree with Nic's sentiment in the "mixed reception" piece that the pushback is valid, but I don't think the game deserves to be bombed because it's particularly challenging. Erdtree's bosses are definitely more nightmarish in their damage output and design, but Erdtree gives you tools to make life easier, moreso than any other entry in the Souls catalogue. Like the Blessings, like the summonable pals or online co-op, like the copious number of builds and elixir combinations.</p>
<p>If you're struggling, I'd advise going off and seeking out those Blessings (with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragment-locations">help of this guide</a> that rounds them all up) as well as rejigging your set up. You can do it! I mean, you beat Elden Ring to get here, right?</p>

			<p>Known Unreal Engine 5 concept artist TeaserPlay is working on a brand-new UE5-powered horror game - Homeless.</p>
<p>Late last year <a href="https://wccftech.com/gravehard-shift-teaserplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we reported</a> that the artist and his two-man studio DarkPhobia Games were working on atmospheric horror title Graveyard Shift. This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2636420/Graveyard_Shift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game is now available via Steam</a> and has been positively received. Fast forward eight months, and TeaserPlay has now announced that he's working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3018910/Homeless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homeless</a> - a horror title set in New York in the 90s. In the game, players play as security guard Albert, patrolling the subway tunnels during which he encountering a rather sinister individual. Gameplay mechanics for Homeless include investigation, puzzle-solving, exploration, and occasional gun-play. "As communication lines go down, you find yourself trapped with a flesh-eating predator, you must navigate the new York streets and subway corridors, uncover The Vulture's dark past, and stop him before becoming his next meal", the description of Homeless reads.</p>

        <p>Atari relaunched Infogrames in April</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Atari's Infogrames label has picked up the Surgeon Simulator series from TinyBuild.</p>
<p>The publishing division was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-relaunches-infogrames-acquires-totally-reliable-delivery-service">relaunched by Atari in April</a> to focus on games outside of Atari's core portfolio of IP. Alongside that launch, the firm announced the acquisition of the Totally Reliable Delivery Service, also from TinyBuild.</p>
<p>Surgeon Simulator is a comedy medical operation simulator developed by Bossa Studios. Titles in the franchise include the 2013 original, the 2016 VR game Surgeon Simulator VR: Meet the Medic, the 2018 Switch title Surgeon Simulator CPR and the 2020 sequel Surgeon Simulator 2: Access All Areas.</p>
<p>Infogrames says it plans to expand the distribution of these games, explore merchandising opportunities and potentially develop new titles.</p>
<p>“More than 10 years after the release of the original, <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> remains a popular and unique franchise,” stated Infogrames manager Geoffroy Châteauvieux. “This was a rare opportunity to acquire a game with a timeless appeal, and we are excited to have <em>Surgeon Simulator </em>within the Infogrames portfolio.”</p>
<p>Infogrames was founded in 1983 in Paris, and grew aggressively through the 1990s and early 2000s via a slew of acquisitions. It licensed the Atari brand in 2003 and rebranded the business under that name. What followed was a series of huge losses, resulting in cuts and closures, a company re-organisation and the full acquisition of Atari Inc. The firm's European distribution business was then sold to Bandai Namco.</p>
<p>After a few failed efforts to refocus the brand around different concepts, the current Atari leadership has <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ataris-re-focus-on-retro">focused on the growing retro games market</a>, and has acquired several remaster and remake specialists, including <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-to-acquire-digital-eclipse-in-20m-deal">Digital Eclipse</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-to-acquire-nightdive-studios-for-10m">Nightdive Studios</a>. It has also acquired numerous IP catalogues, such as titles from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games">Intellivison</a>, M Network Games and Stern Electronics (plus any more).</p>

            <p>
FromSoftware is well known for adding seemingly useless items or places in its games to get fans speculating about lore and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree is no different.
</p>
<p>
But there's one particular location that has fans stumped: the Scadutree Chalice.
</p>
<p>
This is a named location found after beating a specific boss, but it appears to serve no purpose. What could it be? <strong>Spoilers follow</strong>.

</figure>

<p>
The Scadutree Chalice is found in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-get-to-shadow-keeps-back-gate-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">area behind the Shadow Keep</a>. Players will need to beat Commander Gaius first - he's the armoured boar-riding boss who reminds me a little of that orc in Twilight Princess.
</p>
<p>
Afterwards, players can wander into a new area which leads up to an archway and a precipice overlooking the Scadutree that dominates the skyline. Here players will find an enormous unlit stone chalice with five fragments scattered around it.
</p>
<p>
Now, on a basic level, those fragments are incredibly useful as they're used to level the player's Shadow Blessing. But finding five in one place? That's definitely unusual.
</p>

<figcaption>Riding up to the archway and pondering the purpose of this chalice</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
So what is it for? My first thought was this would be the location to use Messmer's Kindling, but soon found a use for this elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
My own, loose theory is that the chalice relates to the Scadutree fragments. That's obvious considering the name and the fact it overlooks the tree. But is this where fragments are formed or their power distilled? Or were fragments used here in some sort of ritual, hence so many being scattered nearby?
</p>
<p>The item description for the fragments reads: "A splinter of the Scadutree that contains golden brilliance...It is said that when the Scadutree crumbles from its core that it will scatter across the entire realm of shadow. The people of the Erdtree collect the splinters and use them in prayer." Is that prayer only at Sites of Grace, or this chalice too?</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Katharine Castle has also been investigating, testing out multiple poses or wearing Gaius' armour, considering the nearby Albinauric drops his greaves. But so far, all to no avail.

<p>
Players on reddit have also been speculating, following a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dlszyr/does_anyone_know_what_the_scadutree_chalice_is_or/">post from XSidsgothemX</a>. They suggest it could relate to the Albinaurics, hence the shack nearby, perhaps hinting at how they're made, or that their blood is required?
</p>
<p>
"There's just no way its useless. I'm hopeful there's a secret quest we haven't discovered that allows interaction with the Scadutree," one reply reads.
</p>
<p>
Others have tried lighting the chalice with different pots, but with no effect. 
</p>
<p>
Another user, Rockerode, suggests the chalice could also relate to the Suppression Tower - this is found in the first area but serves no purpose beyond housing a chest. "I think between Scadutree chalice, suppression tower, and the trailer showing a scene none of us have unlocked there's something going on here," they propose, perhaps linking to some sort of quest to perform a ritual and cleanse the Scadutree. Is there a secret ending somewhere yet to be found?
</p>
<p>
Or maybe, just maybe, the chalice has no purpose beyond those five fragments. And that, certainly, is reward enough.
</p>
<p>
Do you have any theories on what the Scadutree Chalice is for, or represents?
</p>
<p>
Scadutree Fragments are integral to the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC as the primary method of character progression. Earlier today, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-revises-shadow-realm-blessing-balance">new patch for the game was released</a> which re-balances the scaling of their Blessings.

            <p>Celebrity streamer and Midnight Society co-founder Guy Beahm or "Dr Disrespect" has finally responded in full to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deadrop-developer-midnight-society-cuts-ties-with-dr-disrespect-following-new-twitch-ban-allegations">allegations that he was banned from Twitch for sending sext messages to a minor</a>. In a much-edited statement on Xitter yesterday, Beahm confessed that, yes, he messaged an "individual minor" via the Twitch Whispers chat service in 2017, characterising the messages as "casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more".</p><!--more-->
<p>As we wrote in yesterday's report, Twitch cancelled a multiple-year exclusivity contract with Beahm, then one of the platform's biggest stars, in 2020. At the time, Twitch <a href="https://x.com/Shannon_Liao/status/1276617617730568195">would only say</a> that Beahm had acted "in violation of our Community Guidelines". Beahm sued Twitch over the ban in 2021, but the suit was eventually <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/drdisrespect-settles-his-lawsuit-with-twitch/">settled</a> with neither party admitting wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Last week, however, former Twitch strategic partnerships account director Cody Conners <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">accused</a> Beahm of "sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch Whispers product" adding that Beahm "was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon", the company's semi-annual gaming convention. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">The Verge</a>'s Ash Parrish subsequently obtained comment from two unnamed former Twitch employees who corroborated Conners's account.</p>
<p>Beahm pushed back, rejecting the claim that he had been grooming a minor while saying that the terms of his settlement with Twitch forbade him from going into detail. "I didn't do anything wrong, all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid," he <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878">wrote on Xitter</a>.</p>
<p>Beahm's colleagues at Midnight Society weren't convinced by his defence, announcing on Monday 24th June that they would ties with Beahm "in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals" following an internal inquiry.</p>
<p>Which brings us to last night, when Beahm finally addressed the allegations directly in <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805668256088572089">a lengthy Xitter statement</a>. "Everyone has been wanting to know why I was banned from twitch, but for reasons outside of my control, I was not allowed to say anything for the last several years," Beahm writes in the post. "Now that two former twitch employees have publicly disclosed the accusations, I can now tell you my side of the story regarding the ban.</p>
<p>"Were there twitch whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017? The answer is yes. Were there real intentions behind these messages, the answer is absolutely not. These were casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more. Nothing illegal happened, no pictures were shared, no crimes were committed, I never even met the individual. I went through a lengthy arbitration regarding a civil dispute with twitch and that case was resolved by a settlement. Let me be clear, it was not a criminal case against me and no criminal charges have ever been brought against me.</p>
<p>"Now, from a moral standpoint I'll absolutely take responsibility," it continues. "I should have never entertained these conversations to begin with. That's on me. That's on me as an adult, a husband and a father. It should have never happened. I get it. I'm not perfect and I'll fucking own my shit."</p>
<p>The last line would be more convincing if the post hadn't been repeatedly edited since publication to first remove, then restore the word "minor", as you can see by clicking the "last edited" text at the bottom. In general, the post strikes me as a very rambling, loud but elusive way of saying "yes, I did the thing they accused me of".</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the post, Beahm apologises to Midnight Society, presenting his departure from the studio as a collective decision, rather than one imposed on him. He also describes "remarks and labels being thrown around" that he is a "predator or pedophile" as "exaggerations", commenting "that's a different level of disgust that I fucking hate even hearing about". Finally, he insists that he's not going to let being caught sending a minor dodgy messages interfere with his career.</p>
<p>"If you're uncomfortable with this entire statement and think I'm a piece of shit, that's fine," the post concludes. "But I'm not fucking going anywhere. I'm not the same guy that made this mistake all those years ago. I'm taking an extended vacation with my family as mentioned on stream and I'm coming back with a heavy weight off my shoulders. They want me to disappear... yeah fucking right."</p>
<p>Ah yes, the infamous "they", that cabal of nay-sayers hell-bent on bringing down a good man for the merest offence of maybe just possibly being a little bit of a creep. Going by the comments on the X-post, I'm not sure Beahm's fans are clamouring for his return from holiday.</p>

            <p>With a groan, it rises. The first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a> is a piece of horror game history, and it has just come shambling back to PC after a long time putrefying. Ye olde games shoppe, GOG.com is selling the 1996 survival horror classic as a <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil">digital download</a>, so you don't have to go rummaging through eBay auctions to find an original physical copy anymore. It's going for £9/$10. But the smile-raiser is the revelation that its sequels, Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, will also be getting reanimated in their original polygonal glory.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Resident Evil was first ported to Windows back in 1997, after its release on PlayStation. It got a few re-releases soon after that, mostly updated editions. But time scratches all surfaces, and the PC port was left languishing even while the old version of the game reappeared digitally on the classics catalogue of PlayStation. Now, it's playable again on PC. (Well, it's long been playable to anyone who cared enough to emulate it, but that's another story...)</p>
<p>The GOG re-release promises very few changes, aside from support for modern controllers,  "new rendering options" and "improved timing of the cutscenes". It's fun to read the original description that would have been splashed on the back of the game's box. "Completely uncut, with even more blood, graphic violence and gory scenes than the worldwide monster hit version on PlayStation," it says. Please understand, it was the 1990s, people <em>loved</em> seeing exposed intestines. It was an interesting decade.</p>
<p>The sequels are also going to see a re-release. "Capcom's Resident Evil series has defined and revolutionized the survival horror genre," say GOG in a post <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/capcom_and_gog_join_forces_to_release_the_original_resident_evil_trilogy_2ad34">on their forums</a>, where they point out you can now wishlist <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_2?source=news">both</a> <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_3?source=news">sequels</a>. None of these should be confused with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_(2002_video_game)">Resident Evil remake</a> of 2002, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-2-review">Resident Evil 2 remake</a> of 2019, or the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-3-review">Resident Evil 3 remake</a> of 2020. But those are all pretty swell survival horrors too.</p>
<p>My personal memory of Resident Evil is getting it from a friend while hankering badly for its sequel, which I was reading about in every magazine I could find. I played up until the first zombie, whose iconic head-turn freaked me the flip out, whereupon I stopped playing and went to hang out with my dad in another well-lit room. I told this story enough times that my brother now recounts it as a memory of his own. That's okay, it's a good memory, we can share it.</p>

"It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on."</p><h2>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Update 1.12.2 Patch Notes</h2><p>Attack and damage negation curve scaling of the <strong>Shadow Realm Blessings</strong> has been revised.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of <strong>Blessing enhancements</strong>, and the second half will now be more gradual.</li><li>The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased.</li></ul><p>The calibration update can be applied by logging into the multiplayer server.</p><p>If the Calibration Ver. listed at the bottom right of the title menu is not "1.12.2", then select LOGIN and apply the latest regulations before enjoying the game.</p><p><strong>About graphics settings (PC version only)</strong></p><p>We have confirmed a bug where the raytracing settings are automatically enabled if you have previously loaded saved data from previous game versions.</p><p>If your framerate is unstable, please check in the 'SYSTEM' &gt; 'Graphics Settings' &gt; 'Raytracing Quality' settings from the title menu or in-game menu to check if it has been unintentionally set to 'ON'.
