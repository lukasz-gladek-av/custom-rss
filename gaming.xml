		<p>Housemarque has revealed Saros, their next new IP and an evolution of the time looping shooter action that was last seen in their PS5 debut <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/returnal">Returnal</a>. Saros is in development for PS5 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, and it’s coming out in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Saros - Cinematic Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rK4W-hBrSZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This latest tale takes players to the planet carcosa, with an ominous eclipse and the end of the world sending poor Arjun Devraj (portrayed by Rahul Kohli) into a deadly time loop. He’s a Soltari Enforcer, looking for answers on a lost off-world colony.</p>
<p>Saros will feature a permanent progression system where death reshapes the world and gives you new upgrade possibilities to defeat the challenges you face. That’s a wordy way of saying it’s going to be a roguelike.</p>
<p>It’s also confirmed that it will be another third-person action game, again looking to evolve the gameplay from Returnal.</p>

<p>Gameplay will be revealed in due course, but we’re immediately rather excited for this one!</p>
<p>Looking back on Returnal,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-ps5/"> our glowing 9/10 review</a> of the PS5 launch window game said, “It feels immensely satisfying to be sat here in 2021, eons after playing Super Stardust HD on PS3, and see just how far Housemarque has come. Offering a visual bullet hell spectacle, a showcase for the DualSense controller and a rewarding sci-fi narrative woven around the roguelike loop, we can say with unflinching confidence that Returnal is the PS5’s best game to date.”</p>

		<p>Konami and developer ZDT have revealed Darwin’s Paradox, a side-scrolling platformer adventure with an abducted octopus as its star. The game has been confirmed for PS5, coming out in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Darwin's Paradox! - Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TbgsjUFIBOw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game looks like it draw influences from other platformer adventures of the last decade, such as Playdead’s Inside and Limbo, or Tarsier’s Little Nightmares, but gives it a more humorous, lighter tone thanks to much more colourful grahpics, a 1950s sci-fi style and animation in keeping with modern movies.</p>
<p>Writing on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/darwins-paradox-makes-a-splash-onto-ps5/">PS Blog</a>, the team explain:</p>
<p>Our protagonist Darwin has all the evolutionary features of an octopus including the ability to climb almost any surface, camouflage himself, and also the skill to shoot ink to evade his enemies. Haptic feedback on the DualSense controller’s triggers will give you the satisfying feeling of firing off multiple shots of black ink to hit hard-to-reach levers and buttons, or to blind security camera feeds to plan your escape. When swimming in underwater scenarios, the ink shot disperses into the water, creating a perfect back smokescreen to help you get past searchlights without being spotted – just like octopi do in the real world when they feel threatened by a predator in the wild.</p>

<p>Keeping a close eye on your environment is key if you want to survive. As a typical octopus is known to do, Darwin can also morph his skin to match the spot he’s in – essentially creating camouflage to hide and avoid detection.</p>
<p>Darwin’s movements across the world are meticulously tracked with controller vibrations, giving you a sense of connection to our curious cephalopod everywhere he climbs. When you get hit, you feel it.&nbsp; In a world as dangerous as the one Darwin dares to explore, there will be short-circuit shocks, crushing machines of twisted metal, and roaming packs of rabid rats looking to make Darwin a tasty meal.</p>
<p>Certainly one to keep an eye on, if you ask me!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-is-a-stunning-action-adventure-game-set-in-a-fantasy-london-inspired-by-arthurian-myths/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the most impressive games we saw at Gamescom 2024 was Tides of Annihilation. We haven't been able to talk about it until now, but the long embargo is finally over as the project was just revealed during the latest State of Play broadcast.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5 and developed by Chengdu-based studio Eclipse Glow Games, this is a single player narrative-driven action/adventure game originally codenamed Ghosts of Fog. The setting features modern-day London mixed with many fantasy elements, some of which are explicitly borrowed from the Arthurian and Knights of the Round Table myths.</p>

<p>The main character is Gwendolyn, seemingly the only human survivor roaming in a post-apocalyptic London, who embarks on a journey to reclaim her legacy and her homeland. Eventually, she gains the ability to summon two Knights of the Round Table to fight at her side. In the footage, the combat&nbsp;looked fast, frantic, and meaty. The developers promised that the skills would be customizable, too.</p>
<p>Tides of Annihilation clearly takes some cues from games like Monster Hunter and Shadow of the Colossus, as there are some gigantic bosses that are practically like their own level. Gwendolyn can climb on and explore them. Level design as a whole is inspired by the Metroidvania genre, featuring interconnected levels and shortcuts to unlock between them. London itself is also meant to be a character of sorts in the game. The developers likened it to a tree, with each branch being an iconic landmark, albeit transformed.</p>
<p>The team had around 100 developers during Gamescom 2024, although it planned to increase the size to 130 by the end of 2024 as Tides of Annihilation approached its beta phase. The employees have several years of experience at triple-A studios like Sega, Ubisoft, and Gameloft. For example, the game's producer designed combat in Yakuza 0, while the lead programmer worked on technologies used in Assassin's Creed and Prince of Persia games.</p>

<p>The team also clarified that, much like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, Eclipse Glow Games has received an investment from Tencent but is not owned by Tencent. Moreover, they already have plans to expand the IP to other mythologies, such as Egyptian, Chinese, and Japanese, if it is as successful as they hope.</p>
<p>Tides of Annihilation is currently in development for PC and consoles, with no publicly announced release window. You can find more info in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-qa-2026-tentative-launch-30-hours-light-rpg-elements-exclusive-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Q&amp;A with the developers</a>.</p>

			<p>Housemarque Games, the studio behind some of the best shooter games released in the past few years, announced today their next project called Saros.</p>
<p>The new game, which was announced during today's State of Play with a cinematic trailer and will launch sometime next year, is being built on the features of the studio's latest game, Returnal, to offer the ultimate evolution of the Housemarque trademark gameplay where every death will reshape the world while offering new upgrades to the player. Judging from the game's description and what happens in the trailer, there's little doubt that the game will feature some roguelike mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Saros - Cinematic Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rK4W-hBrSZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>SAROS features permanent progression systems, where every death reshapes the world while offering new upgrades to overcome challenges. With a haunting story, deep third-person action, and a grounded performance by Rahul Kohli, SAROS presents the next evolution in Housemarque's gameplay-first experience.</em></p>
<p>Saros is currently in development for PlayStation 5, and will release sometime next year. You can learn more about Returnal, the game upon which Housemarque is building their next title, in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/returnal-in-my-restless-dreams-i-see-that-house/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Save for an ending that crashes nearly as hard as Helios' entry onto Atropos, Returnal checks all of the marks for what a best-in-class roguelike should aim for: a gameplay loop that rewards the player for innovation and mastery, loot that can synergize to create some unstoppable character builds, and most importantly, weapons that simply feel right in the player's hands. Without a doubt, Returnal is one of the finest PlayStation 5 exclusives available in 2021 and those that are eager for the next great challenge can find plenty to look forward to with Selene's first steps onto the alien planet again and again.</em></p>

            <p>Chinese developers Eclipse Glow Games have revealed Tides Of Annihilation, a fantasy hack-and-slash set in a "twisted", modern yet Arthurian version of London. It casts you as Gwendolyn, a baby-faced blood-letter who must defeat <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avalon">Avalon</a>'s demi-gods by *checks notes* throwing the Knights of The Round Table at them.</p><p>I'm interested in the game partly because it's a Chinese interpretation of London, complete with a tipped-over Millennium Wheel and cheery red phone booths, and I'm always eager to see my own plague-ridden cultural inheritance reflected in the eyes of artists from overseas. I already have some pointers for Eclipse Glow. For instance, the River Thames looks <em>far</em> too clean, massive fish demons notwithstanding, and there aren't nearly enough sexshop fliers in those phone booths.</p>
<p>I also like the bits in the announcement trailer where bosses growl about "doomed fates", then do a martial breakdance at you with mild overtones of Cat.exe Has Stopped Working. Love a good flamboyant boss. There are over 30 of them in the game, including a beefy bloke with floaty dreadlocks and a lady who seems to have borrowed Gilgamesh's Gate Of Babylon ability from Fate/Stay Night. Gwendolyn, for her part, comes equipped with combos, juggles, invisi-dodges and the aforesaid ability to project spectral knights to smash things up or light them on fire.</p>

<p>The press release cites <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> Automata as comparisons. They could have chucked Final Fantasy 16 in there, too - the knight-summoning mechanics remind me of the latter game's Eikons. Also, God Of War 3 or Shadow Of The Colossus, given that Tides Of Annihilation's London is full of wandering, armoured titans who serve as "dynamic, interconnected vertical challenges". </p>
<p>The developers - who are funded by Tencent, and include former Sega and Ubisoft people - say it'll take you at least 30 hours to finish. The thing I like least right now is Gwendolyn's acting. It's like somebody left Morphydd Clark's Galadriel in the fridge. I guess we can't all be Cate Blanchett. Anyway, you can read more about Tides Of Annihilation on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3292470/_/">Steam</a> (page not live at the time of writing). There's no release date yet.</p>

<p>Eclipse Glow Studios has revealed ‘Tides of Annihilation’ during the PlayStation State of Play showcase. This developing title promises to plunge players into a post-apocalyptic rendition of London, <strong>transformed </strong>by an ‘otherworldly invasion’. It’s a single-player, story-driven game that has ties to Arthurian myth and the Knights of the Round Table.</p>



<p>During Gamescom 2024, I sat down with the team from Eclipse Glow Studios – which has since undergone a rebrand – to learn about and see exclusive, pre-alpha footage of Tides of Annihilation. Back then, it was called Ghosts of Fog, and it won me over in an instant.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-tide-is-coming-in">The Tide is Coming In</h2>



<p>Per the game’s description, Tides of Annihilation blends ‘intense, breakneck combat, an immersive narrative, and an unforgettable setting.’</p>



<p>Players assume control of Gwendolyn, a powerful protagonist and the sole survivor of the devastated human race, poised to battle incredible enemies in her bid to turn back time. She’ll be able to summon spectral knights and wield the powers of ancient beings in her fight for good.</p>



<p>Here’s a snippet from the game’s description:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Players will encounter hordes of enemies, unforgettable bosses, and vertical levels in the form of gigantic knights roaming the landscape.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And here’s the impressive first trailer for the game:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tides of Annihilation | Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/om7mQozgOdQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Eclipse Glow Studios is a Chinese company headquartered in Chengdu. The team is made up of industry veterans who have contributed to games like Assassin’s Creed, Yakuza, and For Honor.</p>



<p>One of the topics I discussed with Eclipse Glow Studios’ representatives at Gamescom was how they could make the game more appealing to a Western market. This included making Gwendolyn appear as more of a strong, formidable lead than simply making her ‘eye candy’ like other, similar games have done in recent years.</p>



<p>The trailer that debuted today at the State of Play showcase represents that perfectly, and Gwendolyn looks like a phenomenal main character. This is comparable to a cross between Stellar Blade and Elden Ring.</p>



<p>Do you like the look of Tides of Annihilation, which is coming soon to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>At today’s PlayStation State of Play event, Konami confirmed the previously leaked release date of August 28, 2025, for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days ago, a PlayStation Store listing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaked</a> Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater’s release date. The date was leaked alongside a new trailer featuring gameplay and narrative-based sequences. The same trailer was shown at today’s Play event, and excitingly, it also had the ‘Ape Escape Mode’ tease at the end. &nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Details about Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater have already been revealed. The game features two new perspectives, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-remakes-difficulty-will-vary-for-new-style-and-legacy-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘New Style’ and ‘Legacy Style,’</a> and the difficulty levels for each mode. Players have also been told about the latest battle systems, which reflect bullets and battle wounds on the body, with some permanent marks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the story, characters, voice acting and music have all been remade for modern consoles, with new intuitive controls that provide a more immersive stealth survival experience. Alternatively, you can always go back to the classic controls. There is an additional game mode called Snake Vs Money, where players will round up escaped apes as Snake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a recent claim stated that Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater will also be released for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-to-release-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 this year</a>. Konami has also indicated that it would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-1-would-be-hard-to-remake-konami-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hard to remake Part 1</a>.

                <p>In PlayStation's February 2025 State of Play, Supermassive Games announced that The Dark Pictures Anthology: Directive 8020 is releasing on October 2 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Directive 8020 follows a crew on a spaceship called Cassiopeia, which is on a journey to find a new home for humanity. It crash-lands on the planet of Tau Ceti f, which is 12 light-years away from Earth. The crew on the ship is brought out of hypersleep early and each of them must survive an unknown alien threat.</p><p>One of the crew members, Brianna Young, is portrayed by Lashana Lynch, who is best known for playing Maria Rambeau in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as well as roles in Bob Marley: One Love and The Woman King.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a_VXgNSfME" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4a_VXgNSfME" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Like the franchise's previous entry, The Devil in Me, players will be able to use a variety of tools in Directive 8020, including a new scanner. The scanner is used to detect aliens that can mimic the appearances of Cassiopeia's crew. There's also a screwdriver that can be used to distract enemies by activating electronic devices nearby. A new utility strap on the characters' wrists can be used to control a flashlight, but the aliens will be able to spot it, so players will need to be careful.</p><p>Directive 8020 is the latest entry in The Dark Pictures Anthology and takes inspiration from other media such as The Thing, with a mix of both stealth and horror.</p>

                <p>Sony Bend's open-world action-horror game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/days-gone/" data-ref-id="5000-455389">Days Gone</a> is getting the PS5 remaster treatment that the publisher has used with several of its first-party games this generation. Days Gone Remastered was previously rumored to exist in 2024, but now it's official, and players who own the PS4 version can upgrade to the PS5 version for $10.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1ARn0H6HXA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D1ARn0H6HXA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Days Gone's PS5 features include several upgrades, such as improved draw distance, stronger graphical fidelity, better lighting and shadows, 3D audio (so you can hear those hordes of Freakers better, no doubt), and VRR support on compatible screens.</p><p>Naturally, it will also enjoy DualSense support, with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers meant to provide a more immersive sense of the "Broken Road" on your bike, as well as capturing weather effects like rain and thunder. Another staple of PS5 remasters, Days Gone will also include new accessibility features, including "Contrast mode, Game Speed, UI Narration, Collectible Audio Cues, Controller Remapping, Field of View slider, and more."</p><p>New modes are coming to the PS5 version, too. Horde Assault is billed as a "survival arcade mode" that sounds a bit like Call of Duty Zombies, with an emphasis on lasting as long as you can rather than reaching a definitive end point. A new permadeath mode will also give hardcore players a one-life-to-live stipulation for the most authentic apocalyptic experience. There will also be a new speedrun mode that pushes you to beat the story as quickly as you can.</p><p>Photo mode is also being overhauled to throw in more features such as time-of-day settings, new lighting rigs, and new logo options.</p><p>Days Gone Remastered arrives on April 25 for PS5, with the game's new content mentioned above coming to the PC version as the Broken Road DLC bundle. This was one of many announcements during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256">February 2025 State of Play</a> presentation.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hell-is-us/" data-ref-id="5000-562538">Hell is Us</a> is a dark, melee-focused combat game set in a war-torn country, featuring tons of monsters and tough combat, and it's launching on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on September 4. While the focus seems to be on war, the trailer also features tons of sci-fi and horror elements, to create a surreal atmosphere.</p><p>The new trailer shows the main character, Rémi, and his trusty sidekick, a drone, exploring the war-torn countryside and villages, interacting with survivors, and fighting off monsters. While there are plenty of gruesome images showing the devastation of the war, there are also sci-fi monsters, like a white figure with no face, and an evil business man with a ridiculous-looking chin.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s_oHQYBoJA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2s_oHQYBoJA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Detailed in a press release, Rémi will be voiced by Elias Toufexis, an actor who has appeared in multiple TV shows and is best known for voicing Adam Jensen in Deus Ex. Hell is Us is described as an action-adventure game focused on exploration, but without pesky map markers and quest lists. The game will use an approach called Player-Plattering, meant to incentivize players to follow their own instincts in exploration and discover new objectives and areas on their own. Rémi will need to discover the origins of the mysterious monsters in the region, which have started appearing amidst the destruction caused by the war.</p><p>Hell is Us launches on September 4 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Sony has announced a souped up version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a>, the 2019 PS4 not-zombie game where you ride around on a motorbike to escape hordes of enemies.
</p>
<p>
PlayStation 5 and PC (via both Steam and the Epic Games Store) versions will launch simultaneously, on 25th April, Sony announced tonight during its latest State of Play broadcast.
</p>
<p>
If you owned Days Gone on PS4, or already on PC, you'll have the option to upgrade to this new version for $10 (UK price TBA).

<p>
This time around, Days Gone's hordes will be bigger in the new survival arcade mode Horde Assault, and there are fresh Permadeath and Speedrun modes as well. 
</p>
<p>
As you'd expect, this version's visuals have also been given a polish, with increased draw distance, shadows and lighting, and additional accessibility features like game speed and controller remapping. 
</p>
<p>
Tonight's announcement comes just a couple of weeks after it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">Days Gone developer Bend Studio recently had an under-wraps live-service project cancelled by Sony</a>, in the wake of Concord's high-profile flop.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg previously stated that the studio had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-studio-says-it-still-plans-on-creating-cool-sht-after-sony-pulls-plug-on-latest-game">working on a new game that included multiplayer and was set to build on Days Gone's open-world systems</a>. It is unclear what the team is working on next.

            <p>The release date for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> has been confirmed during this evening's State of Play.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-leaks">As leaked last week</a> (spot of poetry for you there), the remake of the 2004 game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a> will arrive on 28th August.</p>
<p>Along with confirmation of the release date, we also got the official release date trailer, which you can see below complete with a bottom spanking Ape Escape monkey. Yes, the special minigame "Snake vs Monkey" where you have to capture the Pipo Monkeys is back. Having written that, though, I have just seen that Snake vs Monkey is in PS5 and Steam versions, but not Xbox. "A different special game will be implemented for the Xbox version! Please wait for further details," reads the blurb on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/METAL%20GEAR%20SOLID%20%CE%94:%20SNAKE%20EATER%20-%20Release%20Date%20Trailer">Konami's Xbox release date trailer</a>. </p>

            <p>
The promised DLC expansion for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> has been revealed as a prequel called Overture.
</p>
<p>
Once again, players will take the role of Geppetto's puppet but will follow the legendary Stalker in the final days of the city of Krat. It's due out this summer.
</p>
<p>
The DLC has a distinct winter theme, with plenty of snow and fluffy hats, as well as some flashy-looking combat moves. Check out the trailer below.

<p>
Mainly, I'm excited about the prospect of new bosses to fight against and fresh weapon combinations - the trailer includes both a bow and a pair of nasty looking claws that will do serious damage.
</p>
<p>"We knew that the end of Lies of P was just the beginning for what our team had in store for fans," said Jiwon Choi, game director at Round8 Studios. "Lies of P: Overture allows us the opportunity to fully explore the past and present of our universe. We are grateful for our community’s patience as our team took the time to tell the story we’ve always wanted to share."</p>
<p>
Lies of P first released back in 2023 from Korean publisher Neowiz. It's a Soulslike in a Belle Epoque setting, with the developer aiming to take on FromSoftware at its own game.
</p>
<p>
It mostly succeeded, with Lies of P considered one of the best Soulslike games not created by FromSoftware. The prospect of more puppet goodness in this DLC is definitely enticing.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/see-the-first-trailer-for-onimusha-way-of-the-sword/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Having announced Onimusha: Way of the Sword back in December with a teaser trailer, Capcom has turned up for the State of Play stream with the first real trailer for the classic franchise revival, showcasing the game’s protagonist: Miyamoto Musashi.</p>
<p><iframe title="Onimusha: Way of the Sword - 1st Trailer: Protagonist | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9Ct29FeMak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword is in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and set for launch sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>The Onimusha series has lent on a blend of Japanese history blended with supernatural elements for its setting, built around third-person hack and slash combat for the gameplay, featuring its “Issen” counterattack mechanics.</p>
<p>Way of the Sword takes us to Kyoto in the Edo period where the relative peace of this period has been broken by &nbsp;the infestation by the demonic Genma, transforming it into na eerie and unsettling place. A long samurai with the Oni Gauntlet will have to step into the darkness and battle the hellish enemies.</p>

<p>Debuting on PS2 in 2001, the series flourished through the generation with a string of sequels, a tactics spin-off on GBA and a fighting game. The most recent main new entry was Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams in 2006, so Way of the Sword will mark two decades since that point. We did have a remaster of the original in 2018, though, and Capcom has also recently confirmed a remaster of Onimusha 2, coming out on 23rd May.</p>
<p><iframe title="Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny - Pre-Order Announcement Trailer&nbsp;| PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jZVwlMhAPg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Games have come a long, long way since then – just see Capcom’s mastery of the remake and remaster in recent years – so it will be fascinating what parts of the original concept they retain, and what they update and overhaul.</p>

<p>As an alien organism that seems to be able to mimic other life invades a colony ship, you’ll have to try to find any way to survive that you can.

<p>The game will feature Hollywood actor Lashana Lynch who you may have caught in Bob Marley: One Love or the superb The Woman King.</p>
<p>Here’s more from Supermassive:</p>

<p>“Earth is dying and humanity is running out of time. 12 light years from home, Tau Ceti f offers a small sliver of hope. When the colony ship Cassiopeia crash lands on the planet, its crew soon realize they are far from being alone.”</p>
<p>“Hunted by an alien organism capable of mimicking its prey, the crew of the Cassiopeia must outwit their pursuers to make it home alive. As they battle to survive, they are confronted with the hardest choice of all: to save themselves, they must risk the lives of everyone on Earth. In space, death takes many forms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Next-Gen Cinematic Survival Horror </strong>– Experience immersive cinematic storytelling and edge-of-your-seat horror on a deep space mission to save humanity.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Alien Threats </strong>– Evade a deadly alien threat that roams the dark corridors of the ship, intent on eradicating human life. Overcome your enemies using improvised weapons, lightning reflexes, and stealth.</li>
<li><strong>Trust No One</strong> – Encounter an alien lifeform that perfectly imitates its prey. Years of training and trust are lost among the crew when their enemy hides in plain sight. Who is human and who is not? Your choices are now more important than ever!”</li>

		<p>The first new game from Sony’s State of Play broadcast was revealed as Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, a title that looks like it owes a lot to the rather good Team Sonic Racing as you will racing across the ground, air and water.&nbsp; On top of that, you also get to zip through space and time as well, maybe Sonic’s blue car is made of a TARDIS.</p>

<p>After rumours that Joe Musashi might appear in Lizardcube’s last big retro revival, Streets of Rage 4, the team has instead been given control of the series return instead.</p>
<p>“Play as Joe Musashi in a new 2D action platformer that marks the return of the iconic SHINOBI franchise,” reads the trailer blurb. “Battle challenging enemies and epic bosses in a uniquely hand-drawn world.”</p>
<p>It’s looking pretty tasty. We’ll share more details when we have them.</p>

			<p>Lost Soul Aside, the action game developed by UltiZero Games, is launching this May on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>
