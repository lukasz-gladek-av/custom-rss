          <p>New episodes of season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em>&nbsp;are premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't)&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-two/">will be talking about them here after they air</a>. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviously&nbsp;<strong>heavy spoilers</strong>&nbsp;contained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: We start this episode from the perspective of a band of highly armed FEDRA agents in 2018 Seattle, shooting the shit in a transport that somehow still has usable gasoline. Maybe it's just the political moment we're in, but I was not quite emotionally prepared for these militarized characters in my post-apocalyptic escape show to start casually using "voters" as an ironic signifier for regular people.</p>
<p>"LOL, like we'd ever let them vote, amirite?"</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: We've spent so little time with FEDRA—the post-collapse remnant of what had once been the US government—since the very opening episodes of the show that you can forget exactly why nearly every other individual and organization in the show's world hates it and wants nothing to do with it. But here's a reminder for us: casual cruelty, performed by ignorant fascists.</p>
<p>Of course as soon as you see and hear Jeffrey Wright, you know he's going to be A Guy (he's an HBO alum from <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> and <em>Westworld</em>, among many, many other film, TV, vocal, and stage performances). He just as casually betrays and blows up the transport full of jumped-up FEDRA jarheads, which is a clear prestige TV storytelling signifier. Here is a Man With A Code, but also a Man To Be Feared.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yeah, Isaac's backstory was only broadly hinted at in the games, so getting to see this big "Who This Character Is" moment in the show was pretty effective.</p>
<p>What I found less effective was Ellie playing a very able A-Ha cover when she discovers the abandoned guitar room. In the game it serves as a welcome change of pace from a lot of frenetic action, and a good excuse for an endearing guitar-playing mini-game. Here it felt like it just kind of dragged on, with a lot of awkward dwelling on close-ups of Dina's creepily enamored face.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: You know what, though, I do appreciate that the show at least made an effort to explain why this 30-year-old guitar was still in pristine condition. I don't <em>instantly</em> buy that the silica gel packets (which Ellie, wisely, does not eat) in the guitar case would have lasted for that long, but at least she didn't pull a mossy guitar straight off the wall and start tuning it up. Those strings are gonna corrode! That neck is gonna warp!</p>
<p>I do also think the show (and the game, I guess, picking up your context clues) got away with picking one of the goofiest songs they possibly could that would still read as "soulful and emotionally resonant" when played solo on acoustic guitar. But I suppose that's always been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c745E7T_Wvg">the power of that particular instrument</a>.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Both the game and the show have leaned heavily on the '80s nostalgia that Joel passed on to Ellie, and as a child of the '80s, I'll be damned if I said it doesn't work on me on that level.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: It's also, for what it's worth, exactly what a beginner-to-intermediate guitar player is going to know how to do. If I find a guitar during an apocalypse, all people are going to be able to get out of me are mid-2000s radio singles with easy chord progressions. It's too bad that society didn't last long enough in this reality to produce "Boulevard of Broken Dreams."</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Not to cut short "Guitar Talk," but the show cuts it off with a creepy scene of Isaac talking about high-end cookware to an initially unseen companion on the floor. The resulting scene of torture is, for my money, way worse than most anything we're exposed to in the games—and these are games that are not exactly squeamish about showing scenes of torture and extreme violence!</p>
<p>Felt to me like they're taking advantage of HBO's reputation for graphic content just because they could, here...</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Definitely gratuitous! But not totally without storytelling utility. I do think, if you're setting Isaac up to be a mid-season miniboss on the road to the Dramatic Confrontation with Abby, that you've got to make it especially clear that he is capable of really nasty things. Sure, killing a truckful of guys is ALSO bad, but they were guys that we as viewers are all supposed to hate. Torturing a defenseless man reinforces the perception of him as someone that Ellie and Dina do <em>not</em> want to meet, especially now that they've popped a couple of his guys.</p>
<p>Because Ellie and Dina have unwittingly wandered into the middle of a Seattle civil war of sorts, between Isaac and his militarized WLF members and the face-cutting cultists we briefly met in the middle of last episode. And while the WLF types do seem to have the cult outgunned, we are told here that WLF members are slowly defecting to the cult (rather than the other way around).</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: I will say I appreciated the surprisingly cogent history of the "chicken and egg games" beef between the two factions, as discussed between torturer and torture victim. Definitely a memorable bit of world-building.</p>
<p>But then we're quickly back to the kind of infected attack scene that now seems practically contractually obligated to happen at least once an episode. At this point, I think these kinds of massive setpiece zombie battles would work better as a light seasoning than a thick sauce that just gets dumped on us almost every week.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: People in and from Seattle seem to have a unique gift for kicking up otherwise dormant swarms of infected! I know we'll get back to it eventually, but I was more intrigued by the first episode's reveal of more strategic infected that seemed to be retaining more of their human traits than I am by these screaming mindless hordes. Here, I think the tension is also ratcheted up artificially by Ellie's weird escape strategy, which is to lead the two of them through a series of dead ends and cul-de-sacs before finally, barely, getting away.</p>
<p>But like you said, gotta have zombies on the zombie show! And it does finally make the "Dina finds out that Ellie is immune" shoe drop, though Dina doesn't seem ready to think through any of the other implications of that reveal just yet. She has her own stuff going on!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yes, I've had to resist my inclination to do the remote equivalent of nudging you in the ribs to see if you had picked up on the potential "morning sickness" explanation of Dina's frequent vomiting (which was hidden decently amid the "vomiting because of seeing horrifying gore" explanation).</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: It does explain a couple of things! It does seem like a bit of a narrative shortcut to make Ellie extremely invested in Dina and whether she lives or dies, and given this show I am worried that this zygote is only going to be used to create more trauma for Ellie, rather than giving us a nuanced look at parenting during an apocalypse. But it is sweet to see how enthusiastically and immediately Ellie gets invested.</p>
<p>A question for you, while spoiling as little as you can: Are we still mostly just adapting the game at this point? You'd mentioned getting more Isaac backstory (sometimes the show expands on backstories well and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/hbos-the-last-of-us-episode-8-ruins-one-of-the-games-best-villains/">sometimes it doesn't</a>), and some things have happened a bit out of order. But my impression is that we haven't gotten a full departure a la the Nick Offerman episode from last season yet.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: At this point it's kind of like a jazz riff on what happens in the game, with some bits copied note for note, some remixed and thrown into entirely different temporal locations, and some fresh new improv thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>I'm definitely not a "the game is canon and you must interpret it literally" type of person, but the loose treatment is giving me a bit of whiplash. The reveal of Dina's pregnancy, for instance, is not greeted with nearly as much immediate joy in the games. That said, the moment of joy Ellie and Dina <em>do</em> share here feels transplanted (in tone if nothing else) from an earlier game scene that the show had mostly skipped thus far. It's like free association, man. Dig it!</p>
<p>The show also spends an inordinate amount of time discussing how pregnancy tests work in the post-apocalypse, which for me pushed past world-building and into overexplaining. It's OK to just let stuff be sometimes, y'know?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: It's jazz, man. It's about the zombies you <em>don't</em> kill.</p>
<p>However it's been rearranged, I can still tell I'm watching a video game adaptation, because there are stealth kills and because important information is conveyed via messages and logos scrawled in blood on the walls. But I am still enjoying myself, and doing <em>slightly</em> less minute-to-minute missing of Joel than I did last episode. Slightly.</p>
<p>The episode ends with Ellie and Dina hearing the name of someone who has the same name as someone who knew Abby over a WLF walkie-talkie they nabbed, which gives them their next objective marker for Abby Quest. But they've got to cross an active war zone to get where they're going (though I couldn't tell from that distance whether we're meant to be able to tell exactly who is fighting who at the moment). Guess I'll have to wait and see!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Personally, I'm hoping we see the moment where the newly out-and-proud bisexual Dina finally realizes "what's the deal with all the rainbows." Show your post-apocalyptic pride, girl!</p>

This episode opens with a flashback to 2018, roughly 15 years after the outbreak begins in the show’s timeline. A FEDRA squad is riding through the Seattle quarantine zone, sharing jolly stories about their time enforcing the will of the fascist military organization. Peck’s unnamed soldier is the focus of the scene until someone asks why FEDRA calls citizens “voters,” then the real star of the scene makes himself known: Isaac (Jeffrey Wright).</p><p>In the corner of the car, Isaac has been mostly quiet through all the hooting and hollering. But then he gives them a history lesson. He explains that the “voter” pejorative comes from FEDRA’s fascist rise, in which the military took away citizens’ right to vote, and started using the term to mock people’s newfound powerlessness under their regime. Peck’s character, clearly unsettled by Isaac’s interruption, says he “didn’t mean anything by it.” To which the sergeant replies that of course he didn’t, because he’s “thoughtless.”</p><p>As the truck moves along the Seattle streets, it comes across a blockade. The FEDRA squad prepares their guns, but Isaac insists that he’ll go out and talk to the approaching civilians alone. As he exits the truck, he tells the FEDRA soldier who inquired about the “voters” to come along with him, saying he might “learn something” from the interaction. And what transpires is certainly instructive, though Isaac’s conversation with the civilians’ leader ends up being pretty short. After verify each other’s identities, Isaac lets out a sigh and casually tosses two grenades into the back of the FEDRA truck. He guns down the driver and then nonchalantly shakes the civilian leader’s hand as she says, “Welcome to the fight.” He looks at the FEDRA rookie and tells him to make his choice.</p><figure id="" data-id="e50b0e9a59d65f99b816c805fda5c36a" data-recommend-id="image://e50b0e9a59d65f99b816c805fda5c36a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Isaac wears a set of FEDRA armor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Isaac wears a set of FEDRA armor." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e50b0e9a59d65f99b816c805fda5c36a" data-recommend-id="image://e50b0e9a59d65f99b816c805fda5c36a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Isaac wears a set of FEDRA armor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Isaac is far and away one of the best parts of <em>The Last of Us</em>’ second season, and not just because they got Wright to reprise the role from <em>Part II</em>. In the game, he got remarkably little screen time for as much impact as he has on the events of Seattle, and the show makes great use of him with new scenes illuminating his role as the Washington Liberation Front’s top dog. From this scene alone, I was immediately drawn in by Wright’s unsettling but charismatic performance and genuinely could not wait to see how the show would make the most of our extra time with him.</p><h2 id="h761334"><a id=""></a><strong>“I’ll be comin’ for your love, okay”</strong></h2><p>Back in the present day, Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Dina (Isabela Merced) are scavenging the remains of Seattle for supplies. The pharmacy they’re looking through doesn’t have much, but it does have one thing that catches Dina’s eye. She grabs a box off one of the shelves and shouts to Ellie that she’s gonna take a quick pee break. Considering her sudden stomach issues last episode, you can probably see where this is going.</p><p>When Dina reunites with Ellie and their horse Shimmer, Ellie senses something is off and asks if she’s alright. Without missing a beat, Dina says everything’s good and reminds her they need to get moving. They’ve got “people to kill.”</p><p>As the two ride around, they note that Seattle is surprisingly well-preserved for a city that was bombed at some point during the outbreak. They also note there are a lot of “rainbows” around this part of the city. Ellie theorizes the Pride flags—for which she has no context—were a sign of optimism within the city before the infection tore it asunder. This moment has an equivalent in<em> Part II</em> in which Ellie and Dina enter a queer bookstore and note the rainbow flags and gay literature, but don’t know what any of it is. I still find this to be one of the most compelling examples of<em> The Last of Us </em>acknowledging that culture is just as much a casualty of the apocalypse as people are, as these two queer girls are standing in a place which, at one time, would have likely held some significance to them, but no one ever taught them what a Pride flag was in a quarantine zone.</p><figure id="" data-id="001decacf5b0fd891d43c4136423f864" data-recommend-id="image://001decacf5b0fd891d43c4136423f864" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dina looks lovingly at Ellie off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dina looks lovingly at Ellie off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="001decacf5b0fd891d43c4136423f864" data-recommend-id="image://001decacf5b0fd891d43c4136423f864" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dina looks lovingly at Ellie off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Any notion that the rainbows were indications that Seattle was a happy place immediately goes away when the pair turns a corner and finds the aftermath of a FEDRA battle. The bodies that are decaying on the street have been here for a long time, and the aftermath tells Ellie that FEDRA might have been dealing with infighting in the city. As she looks inside a molded-over tank, she finds burnt bodies and says it’s like the Apollo 1 disaster, as she gets to flex her astronaut knowledge. “At least they died for something worthwhile,” Dina says. Ellie agrees and says these FEDRA corpses are just “assholes killed by other assholes.”</p><p>Dina then notes W.L.F. graffiti on a TV station a ways out, which Ellie nearly starts booking it toward before Dina points out that barreling on horseback to an uphill station in the middle of the day is an easy way to get themselves killed. The show does a good job of illustrating the contrasts between Ellie’s blind rage and Dina’s more considered approach. Ellie would probably have gotten herself killed on the way here if not for Dina’s thinking. Now, if only she could apply all that consideration to her love life.</p><p>The two take Shimmer and hide out in an abandoned record store. Ellie looks through some of the old selections, from Bob Marley to Tears for Fears. Most of the instruments in the store have been destroyed by the elements, but Ellie finds an acoustic guitar remarkably preserved in its case. It just needs a little tuning. Then she starts singing an acoustic rendition of A-ha’s “Take On Me,” now iconic from its use in the game. Dina hears it from downstairs and heads up, then urges Ellie to keep playing. Just like Ashley Johnson’s rendition in <em>Part II</em>, Ramsey’s performance is understated, and Ellie doesn’t come off as a vocal powerhouse or anything. But it’s incredibly earnest, and you can see Dina falling in love with her as she performs it. She says her skills with the gee-tar are from all the lessons Joel gave her over the past few years.</p><h2 id="h761335"><a id=""></a><strong>Fake wars about real ones</strong></h2><p>Well, now that we’ve had a healthy helping of cute gay shit, it’s time to go back to The Horrors. We see a slightly older Isaac cooking in a kitchen and telling someone off-screen that when he would try to impress women in his younger years, he’d cook for them. He wanted better tools, though, and dreamed of owning fancy Mauviel cookware to make the most of his culinary talents. He finally achieved that dream of having Mauviel at his fingertips here in Seattle, though what he’s using them for in this scene is quite different from what he probably imagined all those years ago. We finally pan over to see who it is Isaac’s been regaling with romance advice, and it’s a chained-up, naked, bloody Seraphite. Or “Scar,” as the W.L.F. call them. In the back and forth, we learn that the Seraphites follow a prophet, but there seems to be some disagreements within the cult about whether she was just a person or a Christ-like figure capable of miraculous feats. Isaac’s not interested in debating this, however. All he wants to know is where the Seraphites will attack next. When the man refuses to answer, Isaac tells him to put out his hand before he presses the hot Mauviel frying pan against his skin.</p><figure id="" data-id="1ef1f73d637cc24f98f2f7ee86b75aa8" data-recommend-id="image://1ef1f73d637cc24f98f2f7ee86b75aa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Isaac looks at something off-screen in a kitchen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Isaac looks at something off-screen in a kitchen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1ef1f73d637cc24f98f2f7ee86b75aa8" data-recommend-id="image://1ef1f73d637cc24f98f2f7ee86b75aa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Isaac looks at something off-screen in a kitchen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Annoyingly enough, the <em>Last of Us</em> show does what it does best and ensures that we know this is bad. Outside of Isaac’s torture chamber, we see one W.L.F. lackey say to another, “This is so fucked!” only to be told to shut up because Isaac knows what he’s doing. You know, in case you didn’t realize that torturing people with scalding hot cookware is not very cash money. Isaac is a bad guy, just so we’re clear. Are we all on the same page now? Do we all understand that, as compelling as Wright is on screen, he’s playing a bad dude? Great. Mission fucking accomplished, <em>Last of Us</em> show.</p><p>These asides, in which <em>The Last of Us </em>clarifies what you’re supposed to feel, are somehow more frustrating when the episode was doing a great job of just letting characters talk to each other like they don’t know a camera is in the room. Isaac’s introduction is a no-nonsense character moment that tells you everything you need to know about him through his actions, and his gleeful, torturous monologue puts Abby’s ridiculously overwrought one from episode two to shame. But then we get to see this nameless dude be like, “Hey, are we the baddies?” instead of letting the audience figure that out themselves. Just cut that shit out. (They won’t. It’s going to get so much worse.)</p><p>After Isaac removes the pan from his prisoner’s skin, the Seraphite prays to the prophet, asking her to “fill [his] soul.” Isaac asks if the prophet was “filling his soul” when he shot a W.L.F. child. The two then go back and forth about where all this violence between the two factions began, and it becomes clear that this has been going on for so long that these two can’t even pinpoint who started the fight in the first place. The Seraphite says that the W.L.F. will lose this war either way. Isaac isn’t convinced, given the cult is using archaic weaponry against their heavily militarized militia. But the cultist doesn’t believe that this war will be won by force; he believes that eventually the wolves will see their prophet’s light. When it becomes clear that his conviction can withstand another round with the scalding hot frying pan, Isaac pulls out a handgun and kills the cultist. We then get another cutaway to the W.L.F. lackeys, in which one dude is uncomfortable with what’s transpired while the other is hardened to the violence because Scars are “animals.”</p><p>In a vacuum, the Seraphite and W.L.F. conflict is meant to serve as a large-scale reflection of the cycle of violence Ellie and Abby are caught in. Isaac and the Seraphite can’t even pin down when this whole war started, and they’re both so devoted to their cause that it doesn’t matter anymore. This is the tit-for-tat these two women are inflicting on one another, on a scale that goes far beyond dead dads and sad daughters. But beyond its use as a thematic mirror reflecting the inevitable self-destruction that comes from the cycle of violence the protagonists are engaged in, the Seraphite/W.L.F. war is also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://time.com/7275781/the-last-of-us-controversy-israel-gaza/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://time.com/7275781/the-last-of-us-controversy-israel-gaza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inspired by the ongoing real-world conflict between Palestine and Israel</a></span>. And there’s no escaping the fact that <em>Part II</em>’s vision of its two warring factions is mostly centrist in a way that points fingers at both sides, suggesting both are equally misguided in continuing their pointless war with each other, rather than presenting a situation in which one faction is struggling for survival and the right of freedom and self-determination against an infinitely more powerful oppressor. And as the general public has become more aware of what’s happening in Palestine in the years since <em>Part II </em>released, it’s become impossible to reconcile the game’s, and now the show’s, fictional war, which we’re meant to believe both sides are equally complicit in perpetuating, with the real-world conflict that inspired it.</p><p>In the case of Ellie and Abby, the “both sides” framing is a kindness that the narrative extends to its two leads. It meets both women where they are, acknowledges how they got to places of such violent retribution, and frames them both as victims and perpetrators worthy of sympathy in this cycle of violence their fathers started. When it comes to entire factions of people being swept up in a war, sanding down all the people within them into the arms of fanatical forces who can’t even tell you when this war began, the “both sides” framing loses nuance. Given the real-world inspiration, it’s naive and irresponsible at best, and could be condemned as straight-up propaganda at worst. It may not be explicitly pro-Israel, but fence-sitting is still making a choice. What are we meant to take away from a story inspired by a real-world event, but so divorced from the reality that it doesn’t actually say anything about it?</p><h2 id="h761336"><a id=""></a><strong>Now, kiss!</strong></h2><p>Back to Dina and Ellie’s big gay murder party. As the pair makes a game plan for infiltrating the TV station, they make a pact that they’ll kill any wolves, even if they weren’t part of Abby’s crew. But as luck would have it, they won’t have to, because the wolves in the station have already been taken out by Seraphites. Their bodies have been strung up and gutted, and one look at the carnage sends Dina’s stomach churning. Ellie verifies that none of these are members of Abby’s crew, and realizes that the group they saw slaughtered in the woods was responsible for this violent display. Dina finds a working walkie-talkie on one of the corpses that they might be able to use to intercept W.L.F. comms, but unfortunately it was also used to call for backup, which arrives fully armed. Dina and Ellie hide, but overhear the wolves giving a kill-on-sight order for whoever’s left in the station, so it’s time to skedaddle.</p><p>Ellie manages to make it to the upper floors, but the windows are locked and there’s seemingly no way out. Just when it seems like she’s been cornered by a pair of wolves, Dina comes in with the save, shooting the window which they promptly jump through, though they’re not out of the woods yet. As they run away from the station, they crawl into the public transit tunnels, but they’ll have more than wolves to deal with in the subway.</p><p>As the wolves throw out flares and fan out to find our little lovebirds, we hear the distant screeching of infected. The W.L.F. squad didn’t expect to see any infected in the Seattle subway, much less an entire horde, and though this situation puts Ellie and Dina in danger as well, they try to use it to their advantage. The two take shelter in one of the subway cars, only to find it littered with bodies they have to crawl over. The infected trample over each other in their mindless fervor, giving the girls a chance to escape through the emergency exit hatch. With the horde on their heels, Dina and Ellie push through a rusted revolving gate. Ellie makes it to the other side, but the gate gets stuck as Dina’s trying to push through. If she were here with anyone else, Dina might have met her end right here as an infected darts towards her with teeth at the ready, but Ellie puts her arm through the grate and lets the infected take a big ol’ bite out of her so Dina can fire one good shot into its stomach. As the two try to collect themselves, Dina can’t help but stare at the bloody bite mark next to Ellie’s tattoo. Even though the two are still running away from wolves and infected, Dina is more focused on the fact that she’ll probably have to kill her best friend before the end of the night.</p><figure id="" data-id="cdb2890f9b07df2fc04077a9e2b961a3" data-recommend-id="image://cdb2890f9b07df2fc04077a9e2b961a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dina aims a gun at Ellie, who has her hands raised on the other side of a theater lobby." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dina aims a gun at Ellie, who has her hands raised on the other side of a theater lobby." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cdb2890f9b07df2fc04077a9e2b961a3" data-recommend-id="image://cdb2890f9b07df2fc04077a9e2b961a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dina aims a gun at Ellie, who has her hands raised on the other side of a theater lobby." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s here that Ellie and Dina find what becomes their base of operations in Seattle: an old theater. Ellie is so fixated on finding shelter and barring the door that she doesn’t even notice Dina keeping her distance until she finally pulls out her gun. She’s distraught that Ellie seemingly sacrificed herself for her and asks her not to make this any harder than it has to be. Ellie says that she would die for her friend, but that isn’t what happened here. She finally has to give up the facade and tell Dina that she’s immune to the cordyceps infection. That sounds like nonsense to Dina, but she’s already hesitating, so she’s open to delaying the inevitable as long as possible. Ellie suggests that she sleep on the other side of the room while Dina keeps her gun trained on her, and if she doesn’t turn, she’ll know she’s telling the truth. This reveal was something the show was always going to have to handle differently than the game because of the changes it made to how the infection spreads. HBO’s version of the cordyceps isn’t spread in the air through spores, and Ellie’s immunity was revealed without any room for doubt in the games because she was able to breathe in the fumes without it affecting her respiratory system. Here, the show has to work within the lines it drew for itself so that it wouldn’t have to cover Pedro Pascal’s face with a gas mask half the time, and I was really pleased with how it took this chance to illustrate how Dina cares for Ellie, even when that care takes the form of hesitating to do what she’s been trained to do for her entire life.</p><p>Morning comes, and of course Ellie doesn’t turn. She’s completely asymptomatic, but Dina hesitates to put her gun down until Ellie shows her that the bite isn’t showing any signs of infection. Dina slowly walks over to Ellie and, rather than say another word about the post-apocalyptic miracle happening before her eyes, she drops another bomb: “I’m pregnant.”</p><p>All of these feelings collide, and Dina, with no intoxication to explain it away, kisses Ellie and then the two have at it on the theater lobby floor. There’s been some understandable concern around the cadence of Dina and Ellie’s relationship in the show, given that Dina has gone back to Jesse (Young Mazino) in the time since Joel’s death, seemingly to make sense of the pregnancy storyline given the show’s elongated stretch of time between the inciting incident and Ellie’s departure from Seattle. It does color Dina and Ellie’s extracurricular activities here differently, as it paints Dina as a far messier bisexual woman figuring her shit out. It works in the show’s favor in some cases, giving us the catharsis of the two finally doing the deed after four episodes of will they/won’t they tension, but I wouldn’t blame anyone who wasn’t thrilled that Dina’s new arc ends up playing into some shitty stereotypes around bisexual people as cheaters, and moves her away from the confident, self-assured queer woman she was in the game. If nothing else, we did get all the important pieces of <em>Part II</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03IN0mtmC7s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03IN0mtmC7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weed scene</a></span> over the course of a few episodes, but once someone pointed out that the “rate our kiss” scene from last week’s episode no longer passes the Bechdel Test, it was hard not to feel like something special had been lost in translation.</p><p>This feeling that we might have lost the plot only grew with the pillow talk scene that came after. As the two wake up and make out a little more, Dina inspects the bite wound, then asks about the first time she was bitten. The original bite mark that started it all is barely visible anymore because Ellie burned it off, ostensibly so she could wear short sleeves again. I had always imagined that Ellie’s self-inflicted burn also came from a place of not wanting the painful reminder of the cure she didn’t get to be, so I’ll chalk her explanation here up to flirty banter. But then shit gets serious, Ellie asks why this is finally happening now. Dina explains that seeing someone get bit in this world puts things in perspective, and if you have a second chance to say or do something, you’d be a fool not to take it. She also apologizes for taking so long and reveals that she knew Ellie had feelings for her, but says she was unsure of herself after her mother flatly said “no, you like boys” when Dina was questioning at a young age. Even after her death, it took until now for Dina to shake off her mother’s dismissive words.</p><p>This is where the<em> Last of Us </em>show’s take on homophobia differs from that of the games. In <em>Part II</em>, Seth’s bigotry is treated as an obvious fringe case by everyone around him. It’s an uncomfortable relic of a time before that no one even considers until they’re face-to-face with it. We’re trying to survive in an apocalypse where mushroom-faced monsters use echolocation to hunt humans down, and you’re worried about who’s swapping spit with someone of the same gender? It is so trivial and petty that everyone around him is like, “What the hell is this guy doing?” and his beliefs aren’t given any credence because they’re so obviously archaic. Why would you put any energy into being this brand of shitty in the post-apocalypse?</p><p>Jackson’s relative normalcy and small-town America feel might have made people like Seth more comfortable in going back to their old ways. It’s a status quo that Maria, as the town’s leader, is clearly willing to uphold for the sake of keeping the peace. But in general, the <em>Last of Us</em> games haven’t held up queerphobia as a prevailing belief in a post-cordyceps world. At least, not the boring, old school “Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve” shit that Seth touts (the Seraphites are a conversation for another day). He felt like the smallest man who ever lived because everyone saw how ridiculous it was that he would harass two young women for kissing in the middle of a dance floor.</p><p>The show’s approach, however, is different, as evidenced by the reveal that, in this continuity, Dina was actively told to suppress all her gay thoughts by her mother, even amid the outbreak. It implies that such thinking isn’t merely some bullshit Seth dragged with him through the decades since the pandemic began, and there will be another example of this to talk about down the line as well.</p><p>In the games, Dina and Ellie not knowing what a Pride flag implied a collective loss of culture for everyone in a post-cordyceps world. Jackson is, as best as we can tell, a settlement with a broad shared culture mostly lacking in the kind of distinct elements and signifiers that members of certain subgroups once would have known and clung to before society fell apart, elements seemingly lost in the collapse or left behind in evacuations and trips from one safe haven to another. That tragic loss of culture and history seemed to apply to everyone equally. But now, as the show weaves prejudice into the post-apocalypse, the loss of queer culture feels like a more targeted one. I had long assumed Ellie knew fuck all about queer history because a FEDRA military school wasn’t about to teach anyone anything that didn’t have to do with survival or killing Fireflies. Hell, she doesn’t even know what Halloween is in <em>Left Behind</em>. But in the show, the continued presence of homophobia has larger ramifications for the worldbuilding that I don’t know if Mazin and company thought through. Yes, it’s well-meaning, and queer kids in the real world are still facing the shit Dina’s mother said to her as a child. But in trying to replicate a real-world queer experience, <em>The Last of Us </em>may have inadvertently undone one of the more compelling and quietly devastating anthropological phenomena of its post-apocalyptic world.</p><figure id="" data-id="6bcb9af48e5a8283334bafcb03b344ab" data-recommend-id="image://6bcb9af48e5a8283334bafcb03b344ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Dina look at something off-screen in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie and Dina look at something off-screen in the distance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6bcb9af48e5a8283334bafcb03b344ab" data-recommend-id="image://6bcb9af48e5a8283334bafcb03b344ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Dina look at something off-screen in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After all the heavy shit, Ellie asks how Dina knows for sure she’s pregnant, and she says that after barfing at the bloody Seraphite aftermath, her period being late, and peeing on four pregnancy tests, she’s pretty sure there’s a bun in the oven. Despite her doubts, Ellie seems pretty on board with a three-person co-parenting situation between the two of them and Jesse, which contrasts greatly with how this revelation nearly caused a rift between Dina and Ellie in the games. She even says, “I’m gonna be a dad,” which I’m sure will just thrill anyone who already viewed this storyline as an example of heteronormative nuclear family dynamics in the game. I don’t count myself among them, to be clear. The joys and stresses of having children shouldn’t be exclusive to breeders who make them, and queer parents have every right to child support checks, too.</p><p>The tender moment is interrupted by radio chatter and explosions. The wolves on the other side of the walkie-talkie mention that Nora (Tati Gabrielle) is at the Lakehill Hospital and will likely know where Abby is. The girls head to the roof to get a better lay of the land and figure out where to go, but Ellie asks Dina to consider staying behind because things are different now that there’s another life on the line. Dina hesitates, but agrees and holds Ellie’s hand as the two reaffirm that they’re in this together. They’ve come this far; time to get a taste of the revenge Ellie’s been craving. But will she bite off more than she can chew?

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Earlier this year, accessory maker Genki showed off a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">3D-printed mockup</a> it said was based on the Nintendo Switch 2’s official dimensions just days before the console’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">first official reveal</a>. The company has since started offering Switch 2 accessories that it says will be compatible with the system at launch. Now, Nintendo is suing the company, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/nintendo-lawsuit-against-genki-switch-2-mockups-ces-2025/">reports <em>The Game Post</em></a>.</p><p>Filed May 2nd, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.1.0.pdf">Nintendo’s complaint</a> alleges that Genki is guilty of five counts of “trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising,” and that its actions violated multiple laws, including the Trademark Act of 1946. It claims that Genki’s use of Nintendo’s trademarks is confusing to buyers, who are “likely to impute any shortcomings, defects, or lack of quality in Genki’s products to Nintendo” itself.</p><p>Nintendo’s lawyers write that although Genki has promoted its products as compatible with the Switch 2 at launch, it has been inconsistent about whether their designs are truly based on unofficial access to the console itself. Nevertheless, they claim customers will probably think the products are Nintendo-authorized, and that Genki is “taking advantage of the trust and loyalty that Nintendo fans have for the Nintendo brand and mark and causing actionable harm.”</p><p>Nintendo asks that the court require Genki to stop selling products marketed with Nintendo’s trademarks, and for compensation for any damages Nintendo sustained from the the alleged offenses, and more.</p><div><p>Genki addresses the lawsuit in a statement <a href="https://x.com/GenkiThings/status/1918852177046737231">posted to X</a>, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-began-working-on-switch-2-shortly-after-the-release-of-switch-1-new-genki-lawsuit-papers-reveal"><em>Eurogamer</em> spotted</a>:</p></div><div><blockquote><p>You may have seen that Nintendo recently filed a lawsuit against us. We’re taking it seriously and working with legal counsel to respond thoughtfully.</p><p>What we can say is this: Genki has always been an independent company focused on building innovative gaming accessories for the community we love. We’re proud of the work we’ve done, and we stand by the quality and originality of our products.</p><p>While we can’t comment in detail, we’re continuing preparations to fulfill orders and showcase our newest products at PAX East this week.</p><p>We’re grateful for the overwhelming support we’ve received so far. We’ll share more when we can, but for now, we’re staying focused on doing what we do best: building gear for gamers. —Team Genki</p></blockquote></div><p>Genki isn’t the only company that unveiled accessories for the Switch 2 before Nintendo officially revealed it. Dbrand announced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">Switch 2 case</a> in December, and before that, smaller accessory makers announced things like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">screen protectors</a>. These sorts of early accessory announcements aren’t unusual in the world of smartphones, where case makers turn to leaked specifications to make risky bets <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23892671/iphone-15-pro-action-button-case-maker-problems">that don’t always pan out</a>. But for Nintendo, Genki at least seems to have crossed a line that it simply isn’t willing to tolerate.</p><p>Nintendo did not immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/first-unreal-engine-6-info-shared-by-epics-tim-sweeney-preview-versions-in-2-3-years-goal-is-to-go-multithreaded/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games president and largest shareholder Tim Sweeney discussed Unreal Engine 6 for the first time (alongside several other topics) in a massive interview featured in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest episode of the Lex Friedman podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Sweeney said that the next big iteration of the Unreal Engine technology will unify the parallel development threads that Epic is currently working on. The goal is to get the first UE6 previews out to developers in two to three years.</p>
<p><em>We have these two different tendrils of progress. There's Unreal Engine 5 for game developers, and there's Unreal Engine 5 targeting the Fortnite community. And there's different bits of development that are only in one area that aren't applied to both. Not all the Unreal Engine 5 features are actually available in Fortnite, because some of them we haven't figured out or haven't gotten to the point where we can deploy them to all seven platforms in a platform-independent way. </em></p>
<p><em>The place where all of these different threads of development come together is Unreal Engine 6.&nbsp; </em><em>And it's a few years away. We don't have an exact timeframe, but we could be seeing preview versions of it perhaps two to three years from now. We're making continuous progress towards it.</em></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Epic president admits that the technology is currently being hindered by the company's decision to stick with single-threaded simulations. That choice was made to simplify things not only for Epic itself but also for all game developers, but it is a limitation that Sweeney plans to overcome with Unreal Engine 6, which should finally fully embrace multithreading.</p>
<p><em>The biggest limitation that's built up over time is the single-threaded nature of game simulation on Unreal Engine. We run a single-threaded simulation. If you have a 16 core CPU, we're using one core for game simulation and running the rest of the complicated game logic because single-thread programming is orders of magnitude easier than multi-thread programming, and we didn't want to</em><br>
<em>burden either ourselves, our partners, or the community with the complications of multi-threading.</em></p>
<p><em>Over time, that becomes an increasing limitation, so we're really thinking about and working on the next generation of technology and that being Unreal Engine 6, that's the generation we're actually going to go and address a number of the core limitations that have been with us over the history of Unreal Engine and get those on a better foundation that the modern world deserves, given everything that's been learned in the field of computing in that timeframe.</em></p>
<p>This is undoubtedly the source of most, if not all, the CPU-related issues we've seen with Unreal Engine 4 and 5 games. It's great to hear Epic is finally going to address it, though it'll be a long while before we see Unreal Engine 6 in any game. As a reminder, the first UE5 preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-now-available-in-preview-updated-to-allow-for-even-bigger-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped in early 2022</a>, while the first games that took advantage of the new technology didn't appear on the market until mid-to-late 2023: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/layers-of-fear-now-truly-finished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Layers of Fear remake</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/remnant-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remnant II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-of-aveum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortals of Aveum</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lords of the Fallen</a>, to name a few. As such, we might have to wait until late 2028/2029 to play the initial batch of Unreal Engine 6 games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/660272/shotgun-cop-man-review-pc-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Shotgun Cop Man</em> is a strange platformer. You play as a square man with a round, bald head who’s chasing Satan to arrest him. At the beginning of each of the game’s nine worlds, Satan gives you the middle finger. And you don’t just use guns for fighting, but for traversal as well.</p><p>You start each world with two guns: a rapid-fire but weak pistol and a more powerful shotgun that only has three blasts. When you’re on the ground, your ammo constantly refills, meaning you essentially have infinite ammo. But when you’re in the air, if you run out of bullets, you won’t get a refill until you touch the ground.</p><p>This all matters because there’s no jump button. That means you get into the air by shooting your guns: the pistol lets you hover, while the shotgun can rocket you upward to reach high platforms. You can aim in any direction, so the shotgun can blast you backward and forward, too — it’s a speedy and fun way to get around. It’s all a little bit like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/15/9538815/downwell-hp-lovecraft-game-iphone-steam">Downwell</a></em>, but sideways.</p><p>You’ll need to get around quickly to dodge Satan’s minions. Most often, you’ll take on little devils that spit bullets and are generally a nuisance. But there are a few more difficult enemies, such as flying sentient saws with one eye. There are bosses at the end of each world, too, like a flying skull with horns that can manifest a body to attack you with.</p><p>If you get hit by an enemy or stung by a spike, your heart will fly a short distance away from your body. If you get the heart back, you’ll survive another hit and the heart will float away again. It’s similar to a <em>Sonic</em> game, where you can take a hit so long as you have at least one ring. If you’re hit while your heart is out, you’ll die — though thanks to the game’s generous checkpoint system, you usually won’t start too far from where you were killed.</p><p>Each world has 17 short levels that are filled with typical platforming dangers including baddies, spikes, moving platforms, lasers, and block pushing puzzles. (Block shooting puzzles?) Individual levels generally take 30 seconds to a couple minutes to beat, so depending on how skillful you are with your guns, you can zip to the goal quickly and feel like a speedrunner.</p><p>You’ll frequently find new guns, too. I was a big fan of one that made bullets bounce off walls, which doubled as a useful puzzle-solving tool. The sniper rifle was a welcome upgrade because it could blast through multiple enemies at once.</p><p>Visually, the game looks like a platformer in dark mode: black is the primary color, and enemies are generally a shade of red. Throughout the game, you’ll hear a persistent, thumping, and unnerving soundtrack that sounds like what you’d hear at some kind of Satan-worshipping club. The whole vibe makes you feel as if you’re actually descending into the pits of some dark hell.</p><p>My favorite part of the game was that you could accomplish a lot in a short amount of time. My full playthrough was about three and a half hours, and I could get through most of the nine worlds in about 20 or 30 minutes. I appreciated the brevity, because even though I very much enjoyed the game, the intentionally uncomfortable atmosphere got under my skin, and I could only play it in short bursts.</p><p>Once you understand how to navigate just with <em>Shotgun Cop Man’s</em> guns, you can really fly around the levels like some kind of cartoony action hero. By the end, you’ll use those guns to give the finger right back to Satan.</p><p><em><sub>Shotgun Cop Man is now available on PC and Nintendo Switch.</sub></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/chips-arent-improving-like-they-used-to-and-its-killing-game-console-price-cuts/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Consider the PlayStation 2. Not all of the PS2 Slim's streamlining came from chip improvements—it also shed a full-sized 3.5-inch hard drive bay and a little-used IEEE 1394 port, and initially required an external power brick. But shrinking and consolidating the console's CPU, GPU, memory, and other components took the console from its original design in 2000, to the Slim in 2004, to an even lighter and lower-power version of the Slim that returned to using an internal power supply without increasing the size of the console at all.</p>
<p>Over that same span, the console's price dropped frequently and significantly, from $299 at launch to just $129 by 2006 (the price was lowered again to $99 in 2009, deep into the PS3 era).</p>
<p>Or look at Microsoft's Xbox 360. Its external design didn't change as much over the years—the mid-generation "slim" refresh was actually only a little smaller than the original. But between late 2005 and early 2010, the CPU, GPU, and the GPU's high-speed eDRAM memory chip went from being built on a 90 nm process, to 80 nm, to 65 nm, and finally to a single 45 nm chip that combined the CPU and GPU into one.</p>
<p>Over that time, the system's power supply fell from 203 W to 133 W, and the base price fell from $300 to $200. The mid-generation 65nm refresh also substantially fixed the early consoles' endemic "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems#General_Hardware_Failure_errors">red ring of death</a>" issue, which was caused in part by the heat that the older, larger chips generated.</p>
<p>As you can see when comparing these various consoles' external and internal design revisions, shrinking the chips had a cascade of other beneficial and cost-lowering effects: smaller power supplies, smaller enclosures that use less metal and plastic, smaller heatsinks and cooling assemblies, and smaller and less complicated motherboard designs.</p>

<p>A slowdown of that progression was already evident when we hit the PlayStation 4/Xbox One/Nintendo Switch generation, but technological improvements and pricing reductions still followed familiar patterns. Both the mid-generation PS4 Slim and Xbox One S used a 16 nm processor instead of the original consoles' 28 nm version, and each also had its price cut by $100 over its lifetime (comparing the Kinect-less Xbox One variant, and excluding the digital-only $249 Xbox One). The Switch's single die shrink, from 20nm to 16nm, didn't come with a price cut, but it did improve battery life and help to enable the cheaper Switch Lite variant.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Original story:</strong> Court papers filed in California, USA, show Nintendo is formally suing accessories manufacturer Genki for infringing its trademark, as well as alleging unfair competition and false advertising.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-lawyers-visited-genki-to-discuss-those-switch-2-leaks-reporter-claims">Nintendo lawyers reportedly visited Genki on the CES trade show floor in January</a> after videos of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">its dummy Switch 2 console went viral</a> before the system was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">formally revealed by Nintendo on 2nd April</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Nintendo has filed its copyright claim against Genki, accusing the company of "capitalising" on demand for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> news and giving "contradictory and inconsistent" statements.</p>

<figcaption>Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uGRs-ispRU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Beginning at least as early as December 2024, [Genki] embarked upon a strategic campaign intended to capitalise on the public interest surrounding Nintendo's next-generation console," court papers <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.1.0.pdf">said</a>,</p>
<p>"In January 2025, [Genki] began advertising that it gained unauthorised access to Nintendo's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console, which had not yet been released or even revealed publicly by Nintendo. Following its initial claims of access to a genuine Nintendo Switch 2 console, Defendant's statements were contradictory and inconsistent, with Defendant later stating that it was never in possession of a console. Nevertheless, Defendant has since maintained its representation to consumers that its accessories will be compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2 upon the console's release."</p>
<p>Nintendo said that "ensuring the compatibility of Defendant's accessories would not be possible unless and until Defendant has access to a Nintendo Switch 2 console" and insists it neither provided nor authorised a Switch 2 to the company. Therefore, Nintendo alleges Genki either misled consumers by pretending to have a "genuine console" when it didn't, or "unlawfully or illicitly obtained an authentic Nintendo Switch 2, or proprietary technical information about the Nintendo Switch 2, prior to the console's release to the public".</p>
<p>"Genki boasted its alleged early access to the unreleased console and allowed guests to hold and measure the mockups," Nintendo's lawyers said, adding the videos, renders, and images Genki displayed at its CES booth and on its website infringed Nintendo's copyright and "garnered significant attention from the media and public resulting in confusion among consumers as to the validity of Genki's statements and association with Nintendo".</p>
<p>"Public discourse and confusion over Genki's announcements were so significant that on January 10, 2025, Nintendo issued a statement to reporters about the incident, clarifying that 'the gaming hardware that Genki presented as Nintendo hardware at CES is unofficial and was not provided to the company by us'," Nintendo added.</p>
<p>Then, on 20th January, Genki posted a picture of its CEO, Edward Tsai, on its official Twitter account with the caption: "Genki ninjas infiltrate Nintendo Kyoto HQ", which Nintendo said was "an apparent attempt to further confuse the public as to whether Genki had access to a Nintendo Switch 2 and/or an affiliation with Nintendo". It then updated its website and advertisements "to boast about its early access to Nintendo Switch 2 information", saying: "Can you keep a secret? We can’t..."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>On 1st April, 2025 - the day before Nintendo's Switch 2 Nintendo Direct - Genki allegedly "mass-emailed its marketing list and posted on social media an announcement of its own 'Direct' presentation to be held on the same day as Nintendo's highly anticipated presentation". Nintendo then took issue with the name of Genki's broadcast - Genki Direct - and its branding materials.</p>
<p>"Genki's claims of compatibility would be impossible to guarantee without unauthorised, illegal early access to the Nintendo Switch 2. Thus, Genki has misled and is misleading the public as to its ability to guarantee the compatibility of its products with the Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
<p>Nintendo is asking for Genki to be stopped from using "Nintendo Switch" in its marketing, destroy any products or marketing that does use Nintendo's copyright, and "recover all damages it has sustained as a result of Defendant's infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising, and that said damages be trebled".</p>
<p>Interestingly, the court papers also revealed that Nintendo wasted no time designing the Switch successor, saying: "Shortly after the release of the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo began planning its successor console, with formal hardware development beginning around 2019."</p>
<p>The Switch 2 will release on 5th June and cost £396. Nintendo is gearing up for the launch of Switch 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-prepares-for-switch-2-with-original-console-update-adding-gameshare-virtual-game-cards-and-more">by releasing a chunky update for the original Switch</a>. Update Version 20.0.0 adds a number of features to the console, including the new Virtual Game Card system, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-cards-thatll-let-you-share-you-digital-switch-and-switch-2-games">allows players to share their digital games with another console</a> or Family Group members in the same way they might swap a physical cartridge.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Half-Life 3 is not just in development, but it's now "playable, end-to-end".</p>
<p>That's according to Valve insider Tyler McVicker, who posits the eagerly-anticipated sequel could be announced as early as this summer (Q3), with a possible release before the end of 2025, probably winter (Q4).</p>
<p>We already had strong evidence - if no specific confirmation - that Valve is once again working on a major new Half-Life project of some kind, codenamed HLX, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">a trustworthy report last summer detailing datamined assets and code snippets</a> backing up a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">leak from an actor</a> likely involved.</p>

<p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/half-life-3-is-reportedly-playable-in-its-entirety-and-could-be-announced-this-year-183030499.html">Engadget</a>, McVicker gave a livestreamed Q&amp;A packed with explosive clues and hints about what's to come, and he has once again stressed: "The game is not VR. Half Life 3 is not a VR title."</p>
<p>"HLX is being playtested so religiously and so widely that there are individuals who will just talk," McVicker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Z9IOIWKHg&amp;t=1300s">said</a>. "I personally have a policy of avoiding any story-related questions or information wherever possible, so I currently have avoided all of them. But I've been offered it by people whom are trustworthy and I know some of my contemporaries have been given it so there is information out there about the plot..."</p>
<p>That said, he did tease that he "actually do[es] think [Portal's] Chell may turn up in Half-Life 3", and stressed: "Erik Wolpaw wants to do Portal 3 so fuckin' bad". McVicker also opined it was possible Portal 3 could be the next single-player project developed at Valve, but that may depend upon who is "gonna retire" after Half-Life 3.</p>
<p>"This is the furthest (HLX) has ever been. Period," he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Z9IOIWKHg&amp;t=8230s">added</a>. "The game is playable - end to end. Period. [Other HL3/Ep3 projects have] never been that far. And they're optimising, polishing, and they're probably content-locked and if they're not then they're mechanic locked."</p>
<p>He also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Z9IOIWKHg&amp;t=2310s">addressed</a> the procedural generation system, saying it has been "misunderstood" by the general public.</p>
<p>"The way Valve is going about that is akin to taking the [AI] Director from Left4Dead 2 and making it significantly more powerful. It's not changing geometry. It's instead changing entity placement, right [... like] doors, physics props, enemies, items. NPCs of any kind." He also disputes claims the story will be procedurally generated.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-cancelled-a-lot-of-games-over-the-last-10-years-including-half-life-3-and-left-4-dead-3">What we <em>do</em> know for sure is Half-Life 3 was in development 2013/2014</a>, and was set to be a procedurally-generated, replayable game that fused <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>-inspired gameplay with scripted story moments. It was cancelled because it was built on the unfinished Source 2 engine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's no mystery that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been a great success, given that developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive have <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it's already a million seller (despite being available on Game Pass, too). How does it compare to other JRPGs, though?</p>
<p>According to our analyst friend Rhys Elliott, who was often <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-hit-all-the-right-notes-according-to-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously featured in exclusive interviews on Wccftech</a>, it's selling much faster, at least on Steam. Elliott, who recently left MIDiA Research to become Head of Market Analysis at Alinea Analytics, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-more-than-twice-as-fast-as-other-jrpgs-on-pc-analyst-says-heres-why" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke to GamesIndustry.biz</a> about the game's surprising early sales compared to triple-A games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>:</p>
<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a certified hit, officially selling more than one million copies. The announcement didn't say players reached – it said copies sold. That was a choice, and I applaud the transparency. It's worth noting that two of these are ports, but the data still speaks volumes for how much gamers are drawn to Expedition 33. The low price point likely also factored in, as our Steam data shows that many players bite the bullet when an AAA game goes on sale and drops below $50.</em></p>

<p>The same doesn't quite apply to PlayStation sales, where Final Fantasy VII Rebirth sold four times faster at launch. However, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is still ahead of the rest of the pack. Besides, losing to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on PlayStation isn't surprising, given the enormous hype surrounding that game ahead of its launch last year.</p>

<p>In the interview mentioned above, Elliott also pointed to the fact that several JRPG fans were waiting for such a realistic JRPG, even with its turn-based combat, in contrast to Square Enix's public statements on the matter:</p>
<p><em>There was also an opening for a modern, realistic-looking JRPG. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has given RPG fans something they always wanted. If you asked Final Fantasy fans from the late '90s/early '00s what the ideal version of a JRPG should look like, it'd be something like this.</em></p>
<p>The reference is quite obvious. Back in June 2022, Final Fantasy XVI Producer Naoki Yoshida openly <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that it is getting harder to mix turn-based combat and realistic graphics because they create a feeling of idiosyncrasy among some players. Indeed, that game focused strictly on action-based combat, shunning the series' traditional turn-based system.</p>
<p>While I personally don't fully disagree with Yoshida's assessment, there is definitely still space for turn-based combat, especially if it is revamped with key innovations such as in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which features real-time dodges and parries.</p>
<p>Besides, this particular game is just too good at almost everything it does, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's 9.5/10 review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive’s first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself.</em></p>

Do you ever think to yourself, "gee, I wish that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/l-a-noire">LA Noire</a> actually looked like a noir film and also everyone is a furry"? Then boy howdy do I have the game for you: The Shadow Syndicate. It just got announced yesterday at the Gamescom Latam showcase, and I should say it's not exactly like LA Noire in that you don't have to try and read the faces of motion capture actors overperforming their hearts out. What it does have is some detective work, gunplay, and even some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/max-payne">Max Payneish</a> bullet-time. How can you not be into that mixture?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The game is set in an early 1930s Brooklyn, and you play as private detective Sam Marlowe. According to a press release, Sam's mentor has gone missing, and alongside that there's a weird secret group getting up to no good.

I would like to point out there is also essentially zero mention of the fact that everyone is an anthropomorphic animal anywhere in said press release, the only mention it gets is "evocative character designs", which they certainly are. I'm into it though, this is a hard-boildish Noir we're talking about, everyone being a dog or a chicken is just the way of the world, don't think about it too hard.
</p>
<p>
There's two parts to the gameplay, one being the aforementioned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> gunplay, which does seem to borrow from Max Payne's iconic mechanic. The other is talking to citizens to collect clues, as well as interacting with the city at large, all of which gets jotted down in Sam's journal to help open up new dialogue options and story paths.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, The Shadow Syndicate doesn't have an exact release date just yet. It's due out some time in 2026 at the very least, and in the meantime, you can always <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3668300/The_Shadow_Syndicate/">wishlist it on Steam</a>.

I'm not sure how they have time for it, but as part of a livestream held earlier today, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/hoyoverse">HoYoVerse</a> revealed yet another new game. This one isn't a completely new world, it's actually another Honkai game, though right now it doesn't have a name. A very short teaser was shared for it which literally just called it a "brand new Honkai game", but there were a couple of signs that it was one anyway. Namely, the presence of a couple of characters, Kiana and Blade.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Kiana isn't from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Star Rail</a>, she's from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-impact">Impact 3rd</a>, one of the main characters in fact, and Blade is a playable character in Star Rail, so it seems like there's a bit of a crossover going on here. The teaser doesn't have a lick of gameplay, it's just a pre-rendered cutscene, but I think it's a safe bet on being some kind of Pokemon clone. 
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="547"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/1kdsy74/new_honkai_game_announced/">New Honkai Game announced</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vegetable-Feedback11/">u/Vegetable-Feedback11</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/">HonkaiStarRail</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
When Kiana rocks up she's accompanied by the most gelatinous looking dog creature you've ever seen in your life. Blade also has a dog thing with him, though his one's a bit cooler, and the two dogs are shown charging towards each other for a fight. You can see a couple of other characters that also have their own critters with them, so, this really does come across as HoYoVerse starting to stake their claim on Pokemon's cash cow.
</p>
<p>
There's as strong possibility of the game being named Honkai: Nexus Anima as the fan-run account <a href="https://x.com/StarRailVerse1/status/1915725508639179139">Star Rail Universe</a> found that a bunch of Twitter accounts have been registered with that name. I guess we'll have to wait and see on that one.
</p>
<p>
Pokemon doesn't seem like the only game that HoYoVerse is going after, as there's been leaks and other social media accounts spotted to do with a <a href="https://www.vg247.com/hoyoverse-stardew-valley-style-game-astaweave-haven-wechat-account-potential-announcement-soon">game that might be in the vein of Stardew Valley</a>. This is what I mean about them being so busy! Guess they really just want to have a game for every genre.

Well, this is all a bit awkward. Yesterday, you might have seen claims that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> writer Yuji Horii accidentally confirmed that a remake of the beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-japanese-games-to-play-on-pc">JRPG</a> is in the works. It all read a bit suspicious right off the bat, because it initially just came from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chronotrigger/comments/1kd1gij/yuji_horii_confirms_chrono_trigger_remake_at/?sort=new">Reddit post</a> from someone who attended a panel Horii was speaking at during Napoli Comicon without any video evidence. Then some other posts started cropping up, alongside commenters saying they were also there and that this was true. Except, it isn't true, because it was all a translation miscommunication.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Later on in the day, a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2448211166?t=18941s">Twitch VOD</a> was shared of the event, where <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3lo7v4b6jdc23">Gematsu</a> was able to confirm that Horii didn't actually mention anything about a remake of Chrono Trigger at all. It seems that somehow the interpreter interpreted something Horii said as confirmation of a remake. I can't tell you how that happened though, as I neither speak Japanese nor Italian. Go figure!
</p>
<p>
It's not exactly a surprise that such a story got people so excited so quickly. After all, on the game's 30th anniversary back in March, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> noted that they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">plan to share word of various projects</a> that "go beyond the world of the game" later this year. I can't exactly blame someone for thinking that that's code for "a remake is coming", and for all I know one still is happening. It just hasn't been accidentally revealed by one of its lead writers, that's all.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I don't even think it needs a remake. I'd imagine it would be an HD-2D one in the style of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> 3 and Live A Live, which while pretty, just feels pretty unnecessary. Of course, none of you can hold this against me if one does get announced and I think it looks cool, actually, ok? Cheers.

We're not too far off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> now, with the spinoff game due out right at the end of the month. Some of you might have even played some of it already, unlike James, who struggled to play any of it at all when the test was held <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ten-pc-games-i-could-have-played-in-full-during-the-time-i-spent-failing-to-connect-to-elden-ring-nightreign-on-ps5">back in February</a>. Considering how few of us have actually spent any time on it overall though, quite conveniently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco</a> shared a little overview trailer yesterday that dove into what you'll be doing in the Fortniteish Souls game.
</p>
<p>
When you first drop into Limveld, you'll be doing so pretty weak as a level one character. From there, you can fight just regular old enemies, loot some treasure chests, the typical kind of thing you'd do in the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. One thing that differs is that you can also sneak into different bases to try to get some info from some maps about the land. And, of course, there's also some big blighters that'll knock you down pretty easily if you're not careful you can try to take a whack at if you're feeling brave enough for some bigger rewards.
</p>

<p>
Another big difference is random events that can take place. As you might already know, from session to session the maps change shape, sometimes much more dramatically than others. Sometimes there'll be a volcanic area that erupts, or you'll have to trek through some woods full of rot. That guy that calls you a foul tarnished might rock up too! There honestly looks to be quite a lot of variation.
</p>
<p>
The Fortnite constantly dwindling circle storm aspect of the game isn't just a case of it slowly killing you while you're outside it. By the time nightfall comes, you'll be forced into a very tiny circle, having to fend off some much tougher enemies.
</p>
<p>
You'll also find that this game's version of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-how-to-get-to-roundtable-hold">Roundtable Hold</a> looks a bit different. It's here where you'll equip relics that have different effects. Just your usual stat buffs and improved skills kind of things from the looks of it, but it wasn't a particularly comprehensive look. 
</p>
<p>
There's an in-game currency called murk that lets you buy different outfits for the preset characters, so there'll be some amount of customisation at the very least. And yes, there is a Solaire of Astora costume, amongst references to other characters too. My favourite's the hunter outfit from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, which won't be a surprise to anyone that knows me.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, despite not being able to make your own character, you can find something called fragments which unlock bits of the respective Nightfarers' backstory. And, of course, there's proper boss fights if you make it to the third day in a session. Wouldn't be a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> without boss fights!
</p>
<p>
I'm still not entirely convinced by Nightreign as a concept, it's a smart way to reuse assets that's for sure. I just prefer my FromSoft games to be a little bit more handcrafted. Still, I'll keep my mouth shut until May 30th, when the game launches.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> was a strong remaster, not just because it was a great Unreal Engine 5 upgrade for a decade-old game, but because it included a whole new expansion called In the Beginning.</p>
<p>In the Beginning includes 18 new puzzles for fans to solve, with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fhow-to%2Fthe-talos-principle-reawakened-in-the-beginning-subway-escape-puzzle-guide%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F2806640%2Fview%2F519709875052217858%3Fl%3Denglish&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=49867ab213c4ee089d653e284f7a2968&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D">16 of those puzzles</a> being made by fans who collaborated with Croteam on the expansion.

<p>When you enter the Castle puzzle area, you'll notice that the tetromino is on an elevated platform that you can only reach by a fan directly underneath it, and that you'll need to get both a red and blue laser to the nodes on either side of this elevated platform to reach the tetromino.</p>
<p>To do that, you first need all the pieces you'll need. Basically, this puzzle is one part gather the pieces, the other part execution.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Start by grabbing the fan off the vent below where you fly up to the tetromino, and place the fan on the pressure switch directly in front of you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;With the fan on the pressure switch, you'll be able to reach the first connector (C1). Connect it to the red node and red laser generator that you can see through the window, and the red node on the wall behind you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the fan from the pressure switch, and use the fan that's activated to fly yourself (with the first fan in hand) over the gate and into the walled-off area with a deactivated fan vent and a second connector (C2).</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the fan on the vent to activate it, grab the connector and use it to get back across to the other room, without having to pass through the purple forcefield between them.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Bring C2 into the main puzzle area, and grab the fan you used to fly yourself over the gate the first time, and place it on the first pressure switch you activated. Now you're free to grab C1 and carry it to the center puzzle area, so that you have two connectors and a fan at your disposal.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the fan, and place it on the pressure switch on the left side of the center puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator that's on the left side of the puzzle area, and place it down on the pressure switch on the right side of the puzzle area. Connect it to the red node in the room on the right side of the puzzle area to clear the path to a box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the box and bring it to the center puzzle area.&nbsp;Place the box on the pressure switch on the left side of the puzzle area (removing the fan first) and using C1, connect it to the blue laser generator on the right side of the puzzle area and the blue node on the left side of the puzzle area. Place C1 on top of the box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the red laser generator, and the red node that's hidden behind the shield you're deactivating with the blue lasers to release the third connector (C3). Bring the third connector into the center puzzle area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you nearly have all the components you need. All that's left is the box stuck behind a shield on the right side of the center puzzle area, with a red and blue node on either side to deactivate it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Take the box off the pressure switch, and replace it with C1. Connect C1 to the red laser generator.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the blue laser generator, and the blue node in the center puzzle area on the right side.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C3 and connect it to C1 and the red node on the other side of the shield. Place C3 on top of the box, making sure the box is somewhere that you can angle C3 to hit C1 and the red node.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>If you've done it correctly, your laser layout will look something like this.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the second box and bring it to the center puzzle area. You should now have two boxes, three connectors, and a fan at your disposal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Two - Make the lasers fly</h3>
<p>Now you have all the components, you're ready to make the lasers fly.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab one box, head up the stairs on the right side of the center puzzle area and place it in front of the fan underneath the blue node. Do the same with the other box on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1, and connect it to the blue laser generator, the blue node above the box, and the blue node that deactivates the shield blocking the way to the tetromino. Place it on top of the box under the blue node when you're done.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the fan, and place it on the pressure switch on the right side of the room. Grab C3 and connect it to C1 and the blue laser generator. Make sure the angles are set, and when you place C3 down, you should see the box and C1 on top of it flying back and forth.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the red laser generator, the red node above the box, and the red node that deactivates the shield blocking the way to the tetromino. Place it on the box when you're done.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick the fan back up, and place it on the pressure switch on the left side of the puzzle area. Grab C3 and connect it to C2 and the red laser generator. Again, ensuring the angels are right, when you place C3 down, the box and C2 should be flying back and forth.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Now you can pick up the fan, and place it down on the vent just below the elevated platform where the tetromino is.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Fly up to where the tetromino is, and the shield will be deactivated, letting you grab the tetromino to solve the puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's how you solve the Castle puzzle in The Talos Principle: Reawakened's new In the Beginning expansion. A few of the steps can be done differently, but it all leads to the same final shape. At least, I think it does. Let me know if you figured out a different solution.</p>
