            <p>
I don't play online games particularly often, mostly the only ones that I do enjoy are the kind of games I can play with just my friends. People are mean, you see, and I have a sensitive soul, and also I often find them deeply boring conceptually and in practice. Take of that what you will in relation to this story about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>! Moving on swiftly to a topic that I promise connects to this intro, Gabe Newell! He is a co-founder of Valve, and a noted Dota 2 lover. He also, apparently, is someone who is often subjected to ridicule while playing the very same game his company makes.
</p>
<p>
The man himself made a pre-recorded experience at this year's Dota 2 International, opening exactly how you'd expect him to: "Hi, I'm Gabe Newell." After clearing that up, he waxes not quite poetically about how he fell in love with the MOBA quite deeply thanks to the first International. But, he says says, "It's not just the game I love, but the community.
</p>

<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="[EN] Day 1 - The International 2025" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g_uN-k7BjGw?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
"Sure, people talk s**t at me in chat, and about once a week people say, hey noob, uninstall the game and [censor blip]. But that's really about their enthusiasm, and the energy that they bring, and that's why, after all these years, I still play Dota every day."
</p><p>
Now, I do feel I have to say that this is a pretty subtly horrendous way to endorse quite toxic behaviours that many people are often subjected to in online games. I don't care if you're enthusiastic! We're all here to have fun, right? Try a friendly word of advice before you make your way to the arcade's basketball machine for some easy dunks.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I find it quite an amusing, if brief, anecdote about the ways in which we don't know who we're playing with online. I fully believe that Newell regularly gets lambasted by strangers online, and it tickles me to imagine how they might change their behaviour if they had the relevant context.
</p>
<p>
Not to say that it's good many of them would likely be kinder with said context, I just think there's a lesson to be had here in how we encourage certain kinds of communication in game spaces. One that Valve, even now, still should probably learn how to do better.

<p>But the Switch experience is reportedly "worse"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Everybody's Golf: Hot Shots" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0927536caea58/everybodys-golf-hot-shots.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a> can be a fun experience on Switch, but there are admittedly certain areas of its game that could be improved (like performance). Fortunately, developer Hyde and Bandai Namco seem to already be addressing some problems.</p>
<p>As highlighted by the <a href="https://youtu.be/z93sHPDsli0">YouTube channel Good Vibes Gaming</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JonComms">former Nintendo Life video presenter Jon Cartwright</a>, this title has received a new patch since its release last week, bumping it up to Version 1.1.1. It apparently uncaps the frame rate on both the Switch and Switch 2 (it was previously fixed at 30fps across both systems).</p>
<p>According to the results so far, it's said to have enhanced the performance of the game on Switch 2, enabling the title to now hit 60fps "most of the time" but some weather effects might impact this.</p>
<p>The downside of this? The game experience on the original Switch hardware is now supposedly "worse". As the frame rate is unlocked (and there are no frame rate toggle options), it's now running at "around 35fps" on this platform, but this results in "a very inconsistent timing frame" when taking a swing, compared to when the game was capped at 30fps.</p>

<p>This patch for Everybody's Golf also happens to follow a recent 60fps performance update for the Clap Hanz title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/easy_come_easy_golf">Easy Come Easy Golf</a>. If the official patch notes for this latest Hot Shots update are shared online, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/first-borderlands-4-mods-remove-outlines-bloom-fog-tweak-rewards/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-borderlands-4-mods-remove-outlines-bloom-fog-tweak-rewards-difficulty-and-weapon-stats.1297242/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Borderlands 4 launched two days ago, it immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set a new franchise record for concurrent players on Steam</a>. That record has since been broken as recently as thirteen hours ago, when SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1285190/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered</a> 252K concurrent players playing the latest entry in the looter shooter series. That number is likely to go up even further between today and tomorrow, as it often does in a popular game's initial weekend, even if most user reviews on Steam are currently Mixed due to performance issues. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the newly created Borderlands 4 page on Nexus Mods already hosts 20 mods for the game. Some of them are the usual Unreal Engine tweaks that, more often than not, turn out to be snake oil, promising decreased hitching or stuttering without actually delivering. A couple aim to remove the start screen and introductory videos, but there are better ways than using mods for this purpose. Just go to the OakGame\Content\Splash and OakGame\Content\Movies folders (within the main Borderlands 4 folder) and delete or rename the Splash.bmp, 2KLOGO.bk2, and GBXLOGO.bk2 files. </p>



<p>Since those files will be restored with any new update, though, it is even better to add the following command line argument to the game's launch options within your PC launcher, be it Steam or Epic Games:</p>



<p>-nostartupmovies -nosplash</p>



<p>But there are quite a few useful mods well worth downloading from the Nexus. For example, Akelaphobia <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/11?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made</a> a ReShade add-on that allows players to toggle various effects on and off based on predefined keybindings:</p>



<ul>
<li>Toggle HUD (Caps Lock) </li>



<li>Toggle Damage Numbers (F1) </li>



<li>Toggle Speed Lines (F2) </li>



<li>Toggle Almost All Outlines (F3) </li>



<li>Toggle Loot Outlines (F4) </li>



<li>Toggle Loot Beams (F5) </li>



<li>Toggle Loot Glow (F6) </li>



<li>Toggle Hurt/Bloody Vignette (F7) </li>



<li>Toggle Healing Vignette (F8) </li>



<li>Toggle Healing Orbs (F9) </li>



<li>Toggle Tracers (F10) </li>



<li>Toggle Bloom (OEM [) (Left Bracket) </li>



<li>Toggle Fog (OEM ]) (Right Bracket)</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>The mod is extremely easy to install. Users just need to extract the contents to the game root's folder, then boot up the game and use the keybindings to toggle off the effects as desired. To change keybinds, press the Home key to bring up the ReShade UI, go to the Add-ons tab, select Edit under ShaderToggler to pick a new hotkey, and save all Toggle Groups.</p>



<p>User Caites also created several Borderlands 4 mods that aim to tweak the game's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulty</a> (experience, damage dealt and received, loot, and cash can be tweaked separately), increase <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapon stats</a> (improving fire rate and decreasing recoil), <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mission rewards</a> (2x or 4x), <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve repkits</a> (a new gear type that heals and buffs characters), and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removes the fog of war from the in-game map</a>.</p>



<p>Many more Borderlands 4 mods will undoubtedly be released in the coming days and weeks, and we'll report on anything significant, such as the much-needed removal of the dreadful 30 frames per second cap on in-game cutscenes.</p>

Whenever there is word of a video game's release date being changed, it's hardly ever surprising because nine times out of ten, it's because it has been delayed. That's just the way things are these days, no one can have the luxury of Team Cherry, who took so long making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> just because they were having fun. However, in this case, the release date shifting news is actually a positive one, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> will be launching just that little bit earlier.
</p>
<p>
By little bit, I truly do mean only a tiny amount. The game was originally slated for release on September 19th, and now it's coming out… September 18th! I do genuinely wonder how such a miniscule change will make any difference to Techland's bottom line, but I'm no accountant, or, I don't know, money line go up predictor, whatever that particular job might be called.
</p>
<p>
In a press release, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light">Dying Light</a> franchise director Tymon Smektała said that because they know the game is ready, they wanted to "do something special for our players," so they pushed themselves to "make the impossible possible," which translates to one day less that everyone has to wait for it. Feels like a slightly hyperbolic way to present such a tiny release date bump, but I suppose it is always nice to see this as opposed to yet another delay.
</p>
<p>
Also, as another form of thanks to those who have or will pre-order the game, some kind of "exclusive new reward" will be in store for them. Can't tell you what that is, not because it's a secret, but because proper details will be coming during launch week, i.e. next week.
</p>
<p>
Our own Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-the-beast-wants-to-make-you-afraid-of-the-dark-again">got to have a little jaunt</a> through the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> earlier this year which he described as "on the whole, quite jolly."

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/high-on-life-2-preview-squanch-games-faux-skater</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/high-on-life-2-preview-%E2%80%93-squanch-games-faux-skater.1297191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/high-on-life-review" rel="nofollow"><em>High on Life</em></a> seemingly had one guiding question that fueled every design decision: What's the funniest thing we can do here? It's the kind of over-the-top, wildly left-field humor that's in line with <em>Rick &amp; Morty</em>, as you'd expect, and <em>High on Life 2</em> takes those ideas to new heights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I played it a few weeks ago at a Microsoft event during PAX West weekend, where we also chatted with Squanch Games COO Matty Studivan about this sequel that takes things to more radical places (in more ways than one).&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <em>High on Life 2</em>, you must use your intergalactic hitman abilities to take down a sci-fi-comedy metaphor for big pharma. The talking weapons from the first game return, though some new ones have joined the fray. Most interestingly, however, is that you can't sprint in this game. Instead, you skate.</p>



<h2>High on Laughs</h2>

<p>If you played the first game or have watched <em>Rick &amp; Morty</em>, you'll know exactly what to expect with <em>High on Life 2 </em>in terms of its narrative and character moments. A prime example from the demo I played is when I was infiltrating an area to assassinate my target.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, the front door was guarded, so I had to sneak in through some other means. In most other games, you'd find that vent or elevator shaft and simply use it. Congratulations, you reached the next checkpoint.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <em>High on Life 2</em>, I just went slightly to the right and found an elevator being worked on by maintenance. I approached the worker, heard a little of his spiel, and then walked past him to get in the elevator, which immediately broke.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From there, he asked if I could help him fix the elevator by hitting some buttons inside. At some point, he asks me to hold one button for 20 seconds, then while holding it, hit another button. Astute gamers might realize that there's only, in fact, one interact button.</p>

<p>So even if you follow the charade of counting to 20, you can't do it. And the worker says something that points out that you don't really have the capacity to hit two interact buttons.</p>



<p>In other words, it's meta comedy all the way down. That meta humor comes into play during a boss fight in the demo. I won't spoil it too much, but let's just say that it surpassed my expectations in terms of just how much Squanch Games is dedicated to obliterating the fourth wall. If this wouldn't risk legal trouble, I'm sure they would joke about deleting system32 to solve a puzzle.</p>

<p>Even the premise of <em>High on Life 2</em> lives on the line between absurd and ridiculous. My mission was to hunt down a fictional senator named Muppy Doo, who was giving a speech at a convention. So I had to go to the Convention Planet and go through Parking Con and Con Con (again, meta) to get to his convention. Of course, it was impossible to find parking at Parking Con.</p>



<h2>Love It or Skate It</h2>

<p>This kind of humor can be pretty polarizing; often it's either incredibly your thing or absolutely not your thing. Regardless, what's hard to deny is that the core gameplay itself is fun, amid all the jokes and jabs.</p>

<p>This first-person shooter feels more energetic and frantic than its prequel, and what really contributes to the frenetic pace is the new sprint mechanic. Instead of running, your character whips out a skateboard, immediately changing the trajectory of how you move.</p>

<p>It takes a bit to get used to just because it really does feel like riding a skateboard instead of sprinting in something like <em>Call of Duty</em>. Once you get the hang of it though, you can also leap onto walls and ride them for a bit. Rails can be grinded on, adding another option for cruising around an arena.</p>

<p>The talking weapons make a return here, as expected. They're arguably the heart and core of <em>High on Life</em>, providing both comedic relief and narrative advancement. Each has an alternate fire mode as well, which can doubly be used to solve certain puzzles in the environment.</p>

<p>The new weapon I found in the demo was a three-shot burst rifle named Sheath, and he's voiced by the buttery-brutal tones of Ralph Ineson. His alternate fire shoots out a giant spike, and you can chain it to multiple enemies to make them all collide into each other. It adds a nice amount of crowd control that comes in handy, especially when you get a little overwhelmed.</p>



<h2><em>High on Life 2</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, I think a lot of people interested in <em>High on Life 2 </em>already know exactly what they're signing up for. This is a comedy game first and foremost, which is both its greatest strength and greatest weakness. If you like quirky meta humor, you'll like this, but the equal and opposite is also true. At the very least, the tone seems consistent in the demo, and it will always stand out from the pack regarding all the first-person shooters out there.</p>

<p>Over the long term, I'm curious how well the narrative will land. Joking the entire time can potentially get old, and I personally ran out of steam partway through the first game. But with more exciting gameplay, maybe <em>High on Life 2</em> will have enough juice to keep things radical all the way to the end.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield 6’s</em> open beta</a> on PC and consoles quickly became one of the most-played games of 2025. But like any modern game hitting Xbox in 2025, <em>BF6</em> is launching on both the Series X and the weaker Series S. And according to the devs behind the game, getting <em>BF6</em> to run on the less powerful console was a “challenge.”</p> <p>Earlier this week, <em>Kotaku</em> sat down with two <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-ttk-shotgun-jumping-sliding-nerf-changes-open-beta-ea-patch-notes-2000619184"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> devs to discuss the game’s console ports, and I asked if the team struggled while trying to get such a big and complicated game to run well on Xbox Series S. <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-x-s-release-delay-1851731006">We’ve heard stories</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-devs-xbox-series-s-x-performance-60fps-mode-1851674405">that the Series S</a> <a href="https://gamerant.com/rocksteady-fleur-marty-comments-xbox-series-s-holding-back-generation/">can cause devs headaches</a>. And despite Frostbite, <em>BF6</em>‘s engine, being very “scalable,” the Series S was still proven a tricky beast to conquer.</p> <p><span>“I will say that the biggest thing we did that was a challenge for us was [dealing with the console’s limited] memory,” explained Christian Buhl, technical director on <em>Battlefield 6.</em> “Xbox Series S does have less memory than even our mid-spec PC. And so there was a point…Oh, I want to say, like, 6 to 12 months ago where we kind of realized that a lot of our levels were crashing on Xbox Series S.”</span></p>

 <p>As a result, the team focused on “optimizing” memory usage in<em> Battlefield 6</em>. And these improvements weren’t just felt on Series S. According to Buhl, this process made the “whole game better and more stable.” However, the devs also worked on “specific optimizations” for Xbox Series S, too.</p> <p><span>“We were doing so much testing…we were collecting all this data,” explained Buhl. “Once we kind of started running all our levels through it, and were able to see where the problems were, after a month or two, we had kind of resolved all of our memory issues on Series S.” </span></p>

 <p><span>Buhl says <em>Battlefield 6</em> is now “super solid” and “performant” on Xbox Series S and will run at a “smooth 60 frames per second.” And <a href="https://youtu.be/m3nUC1dUFy8">footage of the game’s open beta running on Series S</a> seems to back that up.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>EA Won’t Talk About <em>Battlefield 6</em> On Switch 2</h2> <p>Of course, with Frostbite being so scalable and the studio working hard to make <em>BF6</em> super optimized, I wanted to ask if, theoretically, the game could run on a Switch 2. The studio is even i<a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-controversial-quick-turn-flick-console-why-cheating-2000625445">mplementing gyro controls on PS5 and PS5 Pro</a> to let players flick around quickly or reload with the simple waggle of the gamepad.</p>

 <p>However, when I asked if it would be possible for <em>Battlefield 6</em> and Frostbite to run on a Switch 2 based on the specs, an EA rep stepped in and cut off Buhl right as he began to say something.</p> <p><span>“Sorry, I have to step in here,” said the EA rep. “We can’t talk anything beyond, sort of, like, the consoles that <em>Battlefield’s</em> coming to, which is Xbox Series X/S and PS5, and PS5 Pro.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p>Later on, when the team was talking about gyro controls, I brought up how the Switch 2 has excellent gyro sensors in its Joy-Con.</p>

 <p><span>“Exactly, yeah,” was the response. So, at least I can confirm the devs working on <em>Battlefield 6</em> think the Switch 2 has great <a href="https://kotaku.com/gaming-controllers-gyro-trackpad-scuf-mouse-keyboard-2000624503">gyro controls. </a>Beyond that, nothing.</span></p> <p>I’m very excited to play <em>Battlefield 6</em> once it launches on October 10 on my PS5 Pro and high-end gaming PC. But not everyone has access to those devices, and some players are gaming on the aging and weaker Xbox Series S. So I’m happy to hear that the devs behind the game worked so hard on optimizing it and making sure all platforms get a great version of <em>Battlefield 6.</em> And hey, maybe Switch 2 owners will get their own solid version of <em>BF6</em> in the future?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valor Mortis Preview – Bloodborne But Make It French]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/valor-mortis-preview-bloodborne-but-make-it-french</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Polish studio One More Level made a good name for itself with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ghostrunner-2-review-run-ghost-run" rel="nofollow">the <em>Ghostrunner </em>franchise</a>, and now it's taking a stab at the ever-popular soulslike formula with its own twist. Enter <em>Valor Mortis</em>, which was revealed just weeks ago at Gamescom.</p>

<p>This upcoming game keeps the first-person perspective that One More Level is known for, but it swaps out the cyberpunk-ninja aesthetic for something a little more 19th century. You play as an English soldier in the French military (for story reasons), but there's some supernatural, bloodcurdling spooky stuff going on.</p>

<p>The combat feels intense and enjoyable, and the world presents this intriguing mystery that I want to learn more about when <em>Valor Mortis</em> releases in 2026.</p>



<h2>Shoot, Slice, Spark</h2>

<p>A majority of soulslikes, as you probably know, are in a third-person perspective, to account for the rapid movements of certain enemies and the endless dodge rolls you'll be doing. They can be frantic at times, so I was a little worried about how it'd feel in first person.</p>

<p><em>Valor Mortis</em>, however, threads the needle perfectly. Motions are clear, and I found a lot of clarity in the hitboxes between me and the enemies. Swinging the sword feels great, and the visual and audio feedback when you land a hit or parry is satisfying.</p>

<p>This game goes for the dual-wielding approach to combat, where your right hand is your sword while your left hand deals ranged attacks. I got a flintlock pistol early in the demo, but later, I found a power up that let me shoot magical fire. In some screenshots, I saw a full-on rifle too that requires two hands to wield.</p>



<p>If you keep up the pressure, you can break an enemy's stance, though parries do more damage to their stance meter. Once they're broken, you can do a critical hit that does massive damage, similar to other soulslikes.</p>

<p>I found that the dodge feels great, as well. It reminded me of the quick dash in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-eternal" rel="nofollow"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a>, and it was easy to position myself to wherever I needed around the enemies.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you've got all the usual soulslikes trappings here, too. There are totally-not-flasks to heal you, and they get replenished at totally-not-bonfires that also respawn all the enemies.</p>



<p>At the lamps, which are <em>Valor Mortis</em>'s bonfires, I could also upgrade my stats using a currency that enemies dropped. Most of them seemed a little boring at first, with basic upgrades like +6% endurance. I imagine in the long run, it'll add up nicely, but for a short 20-minute demo, there wasn't much to play with there.</p>

<p>The most exciting thing about the skill tree was that after you unlock a certain tier of it, you can equip something called an Amber into your tree. These can be found around the world, and they provide more powerful passive upgrades. I get the sense that in the full game, these will play a core part in crafting a build.</p>



<h2>Alt-History Europe That Isn't World War 2</h2>

<p>Aesthetically, <em>Valor Mortis</em> combines the grotesque body horror of <em>Bloodborne </em>with 19th-century French military garb. In fact, this game takes a stab an alternate history, but instead of tackling the trodden paths of World War 2, it looks at the Napoleonic Wars.</p>

<p>In this universe, Napoleon clinched the victory at Waterloo, continuing his conquest across Europe. Of course, there's more going on here—your character seems to have some sort of telepathic link to Napoleon, implying all sorts of supernatural spooky vibes. It's an intriguing story setup that makes me curious about the ramifications of a magical super Napoleon.</p>



<p>Where it really came together for me was when I ran into the first boss in the demo. It was a giant, fleshy mass of a formerly human soldier—or really, more like a group of soldiers mushed together.</p>

<p>It had three arms on its one shoulder, like a twisted pauldron. Each hand had a flintlock pistol, giving it a ranged attack, while its main arms twirled and thrusted a giant spear. In the second phase, it swapped the spear for a giant claw. In terms of design, it felt like the perfect mix of a From Software boss with the world that One More Level has crafted.</p>



<h2><em>Valor Mortis</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Valor Mortis</em> brings a unique premise to the well-worn soulslike formula, both in terms of gameplay and narrative. The moment-to-moment combat feels good, with just enough challenge to keep you on your toes.</p>

<p>The addition of magical powers and supernatural vibes adds a level of intrigue here, as well. It's not a straightforward alt-history romp. Instead, there's something more insidious at play here, and we'll learn more when <em>Valor Mortis</em> releases some time next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game celebrated its 15-year anniversary on August 10, 2025. Below, we speak with the developers of the original game about how it came to be and its enduring legacy.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Trust an elder millennial on this one: The longer you live, the more you start to see the media of your youth reflected in a weird, recursive funhouse mirror. The old Grandpa Simpson "It'll happen to you!" meme is not just a perfect reaction to have here, but a perfect example. It's a famous meme, born from a show that is now mostly known by younger generations as an infinite meme factory, from a scene that was directed at Gen-Xers with nostalgia for the 1970s, by a character lamenting how he was cool in the '50s, and nostalgia for the '40s being the actual intended joke.</p><p dir="ltr">Scott Pilgrim now occupies a similarly strange place in pop culture. Back in the mid-2000s, the original graphic novels were to old-school video games, anime, and Canadian indie bands what Kevin Smith's worship of Star Wars and Marvel comics were to Gen X. Plenty of readers could latch onto the story of a nerdy slacker--the titular Scott--dating Ramona Flowers, a much cooler person with a checkered past, and Scott having to reckon with said checkered past by fighting her seven evil exes. The emotional honesty injected into the story by its creator, Bryan Lee O'Malley made it appeal to the folks who may never have picked up a controller, the folks who simply saw an extremely well-drawn, well-written fantastical slice-of-life indie book. Scott still had to deal with getting a job, paying his rent, and generally having to become an adult. He just happened to do so while speaking to nerds in a whole other secret language of nostalgic metaphors.</p><p dir="ltr">This is ultimately the thing that made Edgar Wright probably the only reasonable pick to handle a film adaptation. Wright had been speaking the same language through his work since the early 2000s with Spaced, Shaun of the Dead, and Hot Fuzz. This is a man who staged a climactic argument between roommates on Spaced as a round of Tekken 3, had Queen's Don't Stop Me Now as the backdrop for a zombie getting beaten with pool cues, and used the classic tropes of both zombie films and big Hollywood action movies to examine the whole idea of how men evolve within the world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566948-ss_2b90d8671643152538256ed146317c9cc51417eb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566948" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566948-ss_2b90d8671643152538256ed146317c9cc51417eb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566948"></a><figcaption>Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566948-ss_2b90d8671643152538256ed146317c9cc51417eb.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's an art to using pop culture as shorthand. In Ready Player One author Ernest Cline's hands, it's cheap and meaningless, because it's the validation of obsession, rather than saying anything about the people obsessed. In Wright's hands, it's charming and effective, because it's using pop culture to accentuate the emotions that are already there.</p><p dir="ltr">And thus we got Scott Pilgrim vs. the World in theaters in 2010, a still-incredible piece of work, not just as a faithful adaptation of the novels, but a still-staggering achievement in audiovisual storytelling altogether. Its closest visual analogue is the Wachowski Sisters' Speed Racer. You can probably count everything else in that particular echelon on one hand, and two of those slots are Spider-Verse movies. Unfortunately, that's for good reason. Despite the incredible filmmaking, the zeitgeisty non-stop comedy, a fantastic indie rock soundtrack, the heartfelt story, a rock-solid critical reception, and a cast that would go on to become some of the most acclaimed and recognized actors of a generation, the film was actually a major flop. It opened to a $10 million opening weekend and ended at $30 million, only barely making back half its $60 million budget. It was dead on arrival. Turns out, the film has more in common with the Wachowskis' Speed Racer than the visual language. It was hard sell to an unsavvy casual audience unaccustomed to hyperkinetic maximalist storytelling. Universal's marketing department clearly felt the same; the film was sold as a musical with fights instead of songs. It's not a wrong representation of the film, but it's still difficult to sell.</p><p dir="ltr">At the same time Scott Pilgrim: The Movie was floundering in theaters, in real-life Canada, Scott Pilgrim was fighting a different fight in a different medium.</p><p dir="ltr">Jean-Francois Major is one of the co-founders of Tribute Games, the folks behind a slew of old-school pixel art throwback titles such as Mercenary Kings, Panzer Paladin, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, and the upcoming Marvel Cosmic Invasion. But back in 2010, he was part of a development team at Ubisoft that decided to make the company take a big risk.</p><p dir="ltr">"We mostly focused on Game Boy Advance titles: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Open Season, Star Wars, mostly licensed games," Major said, in a brief interview with Gamespot over Zoom. "At some point we found out there was gonna be a movie made on Scott Pilgrim. And we thought, why doesn't Ubisoft make a game based on the [intellectual property]. So we decided to make a pitch and get it cleared through Universal. That was actually the last pixel art game Ubisoft tackled. We kept it retro-looking, kind of a follow up to our Game Boy Advance games."</p><p dir="ltr">For reference, the bigger games that Ubisoft would release around that time included Splinter Cell: Conviction, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands, and Ubisoft's first go-around with a game based on James Cameron's Avatar. The closest thing to a retro game in Ubisoft's portfolio at that time is an entirely forgettable TMNT: Turtles In Time remake. So how did Major and his team manage to slip a pixel art 2D game into the company's slate at the time?</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't know how to answer this politely," Major said with a laugh. "I think it wasn't really a project that was fully understood at Ubisoft. Luckily, they kind of let us do what we wanted, and didn't ask too many questions. They were more focused on their bigger titles. Ubisoft was shifting away from [pixel art games], and that was kind of our last go. Our whole team was sent to work on more AAA games, and that wasn't really our passion. It was why we ended up founding Tribute." Bryan Lee O'Malley had similar mixed feelings, saying in our brief interview that "they didn't really give us the budget to do everything we wanted to do," and noted that the finishing touches for the game were ultimately farmed out to Ubisoft's Chinese studio.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, as the film was in production, Majors and his team got to work on what would become Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game, which was, indeed, a rare sight in 2010: a side-scrolling 2D beat-'em-up that felt more like River City Ransom on NES or the original Turtles In Time than the character-action titles of that moment in time. The art style--which had Bryan Lee O'Malley dividing his time between working on the film and providing original artwork embellished by famed pixel artist Paul Robertson--would take most of its cues from the original graphic novels, while still recreating specific beats from the film, including a very cute pixel art version of Edgar Wright directing Lucas Lee's movie at Casa Loma. In return, pixel art Scott would get a cameo on the big-screen. The game character appeared as the icon for Scott's 1-Up after defeating the Katayanagi Twins, as well as in a post-credit bit with Pixel Scott getting to throw a few brick-busting punches, a shout-out that was a complete surprise to Majors and his team.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566949-ss_ef5c046131bc14cc2933609e8b103d31ebbdcaff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566949" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566949-ss_ef5c046131bc14cc2933609e8b103d31ebbdcaff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566949"></a><figcaption>Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566949-ss_ef5c046131bc14cc2933609e8b103d31ebbdcaff.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game also had an extra ace in the hole with its amazing, eclectic soundtrack from chiptune band Anamanaguchi.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our style was a natural fit for the general vibe," said lead songwriter Peter Berkman in an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/01/13/anamanaguchi-talks-scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-the-game-10-years-later/" rel="nofollow ">interview with PlayStation Blog</a> back in 2021, "but it was a lot of fun to flex and adapt for certain moments that a 'band playing shows' doesn't normally get to do. Like a bossa nova shop theme, or boss songs."</p><p dir="ltr">His co-writer, Ary Warnaar, agreed. "There were a handful of prompts that took us out of our comfort zones," Warnaar said. "Some of those styles were definitely just for the game, but others started to shape sounds that became a bit more normal to us. Dance-tempo four to the floor tracks were a pretty new thing to us back then!"</p><p dir="ltr">The game was at least more of a success story than the film, selling nearly 150,000 copies within its first year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/02/09/psn-sales-figures-announced/" rel="nofollow ">according to research firm FADE</a>. The problem there was that the success would be, unfortunately, short-lived. Licensing problems aren't new for video games--even as much as the industry loves its remakes and remasters, there are licensed games across the expanse of the medium that may never see the light of day ever again because of either the cost or logistics of nailing down the IP. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World was no different, and in 2014, the game was delisted from the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade because of a complete mess of licensing problems between Ubisoft, Universal Pictures, and ABKCO Music, who owned the rights to Anamanaguchi's soundtrack.</p><p dir="ltr">"We didn't have Limited Run back then, or smaller physical publishers to make sure we have a physical copy that can be resold and kept alive," said Majors. "There was also no release on Steam, that was also an issue."</p><p dir="ltr">That could have been game over in terms of Scott Pilgrim's full-court press into culture at large. But there was a continue attached to that failure.</p><p dir="ltr">There's <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/edgar-wright-scott-pilgrim-box-office-bomb-lesson-1234771212/" rel="nofollow ">a famous story</a> Edgar Wright tells about finding out the film flopped on opening weekend: "Monday morning, [Universal's chief of marketing] Michael Moses sent an email with three words. It was one of the sweetest emails I've ever gotten from anybody in the industry. It said, 'Years, not days.'"</p><p dir="ltr">That email should be nailed to the door, Martin Luther-style, of anyone daring to make art in the 21st Century. Yes, smash hit, immediate success is good, especially as far as the people who bankroll art these days are concerned. But immediate success is a flower. Lasting impact, legacy, and culture are trees.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the film's initial failure in theaters, it soon became a cult classic in the making through word of mouth, with numerous high profile creators singing its praises. The film quickly became a midnight-movie mainstay at Quentin Tarantino's New Beverly theater in Los Angeles. The home release in 2011 was also a minor hit, managing to be the first film to knock Christopher Nolan's Inception off the top of the <a href="http://www.theofficialcharts.com/video-archive-chart/_/26/2011-01-08/" rel="nofollow ">sales charts</a>. More than that, the film’s visual language–incorporating elements from video games, comics, and manga– starts becoming commonplace in media not long after. That particularly shows in Edgar Wright's own work moving forward, with the effects-heavy production playing a big influence in how he'd handle effects in The World's End and editing around music in Baby Driver. Ultimately, the film cracked open a door that Marvel in particular would kick down entirely in the years that followed, leaning heavier on embracing the wilder and weirder aspects of comic book storytelling, compromising less towards Hollywood conventions of four-quadrant blockbusters. The kinetic wall-of-visual-stimulation style of storytelling that nerds had been immersed in for years is now very much mainstream.</p><p dir="ltr">For the game's part, Scott Pilgrim was already riding a wave of nostalgia for 8- and 16-bit style aesthetics, and the game's eventual disappearance from storefronts only drove its popularity further. But also, while there had been occasional blips on the radar as far as old-school beat-'em-ups, Scott Pilgrim showed there was still plenty of life in the genre. Not long after, titles like Double Dragon Neon, Dragon's Crown, and Charlie Murder joined the side-scrolling beat-'em-up roster, paving the way for the true renaissance of the genre when the likes of River City Girls and Streets of Rage 4 hit the scene.</p><p dir="ltr">The story is, indeed, "years, not days." In 2020, the film's popularity warranted an outright media blitz celebrating its modern classic status. The original cast reunited during the COVID pandemic to do a read-through of the entire script, only emphasizing the now-accumulated star power of its cast. The popularity of the stream--currently sitting at over 3 million views <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKqKLnsmoK4&amp;t=3876s&amp;pp=ygUac2NvdHQgcGlsZ3JpbSByZWFkIHRocm91Z2g%3D">on Youtube</a>. The film got a high-profile theatrical re-release in 2021 just before a 4K Blu-Ray dropped. That same year, a miracle happened: Whatever licensing problems had been keeping the game off shelves had been resolved, and it was re-released that January, with a physical release from Limited Run selling 25,000 copies in the first three hours after its announcement.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566950-ss_6be04ad2a96d34589200f166b8a1255460634a91.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566950" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566950-ss_6be04ad2a96d34589200f166b8a1255460634a91.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566950"></a><figcaption>Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566950-ss_6be04ad2a96d34589200f166b8a1255460634a91.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It'd be easy to chalk all that up to nostalgia becoming a cottage industry on a scale even previous generations could never imagine. But something very different was happening with Scott Pilgrim in those early days of the pandemic.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'd moved on to other things, but Scott Pilgrim keeps calling me back," said O'Malley. "The fanbase just keeps growing. They're getting younger. I feel like I owe them more and more each year."</p><p dir="ltr">That sense of responsibility led to what eventually became Netflix's Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. Except the nostalgia is a little different here. In 2010, Universal promoted the Scott Pilgrim film with<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqmimK80duA"> a 4-minute short on Adult Swim</a>, with Michael Cera, Mae Whitman, and Jason Schwartzman voicing a fully animated scene from the graphic novel. It was a perfect fit on the same network that quietly introduced a generation to Naruto and Cowboy Bebop. It would also only air once, the night before the film was released.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2023, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off became a 10-episode anime splashed across the front page of the world's biggest streaming platform, sharing promo space with the absurdly popular Delicious In Dungeon, and an anime adaptation of Castlevania. In 2025, it's one of the first things Netflix recommends after K-Pop Demon Hunters rolls credits. Scott Pilgrim is no longer a nostalgia trip; it's part of the zeitgeist.</p><p dir="ltr">"You'd expect the audience for Scott Pilgrim would be all 45-year-olds at this point," O'Malley said, "but I have an influx of 15-year-olds coming to conventions these days, and they don't see the references the same way... They're more interested in the characters themselves, and they're the flashpoint, the thing they connect to most."</p><p dir="ltr">It's with that angle in mind that Scott Pilgrim Takes Off forges its own path. The first episode is the animated adaptation of the graphic novel everyone expected, right up until the fight with Ramona Flowers' first Evil Ex, Matthew Patel. Scott fights him...and loses.</p><p dir="ltr">The rest of the series then becomes Ramona Flowers' story. Her guilt about "dabbling in being a bitch" costing a new partner his life guides the series into a very different direction from the original, a direction that can only come from 15 years of hindsight and maturity. As opposed to most plays for nostalgia, Scott Pilgrim hasn't just grown up with its audience, but adapted to a changing world, while ensuring that even the people who have no attachment to the graphic novels or film have an entry point.</p><p dir="ltr">That entry point turns out to be one far more interested in Ramona being fascinatingly messy, Scott being frozen in time, and how pathetic that stagnation can be if left unchecked. Scott Pilgrim is no longer a reflection of the past, but a living examination of it. As the show ends up proving, nostalgia can be good, but a version of a person that's still open to change and growth is absolutely the most healthy version of that person.</p><p dir="ltr">That same need for growth and change wound up leading Jean Majors and the folks at Tribute Games to the next step in Scott and Ramona's journey: Tribute Games' Scott Pilgrim EX.</p><p dir="ltr">"[Bryan and I] have been friends ever since the original game, and when we started Tribute we always kept in contact," Majors said. "Over the years, after Mercenary Kings, we would reach out and ask if we could have a second stab. Things didn't pan out, but over the years, we kept harassing him. When the anime was announced, we gave it another go...and that's when the discussions became more serious."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="981714729" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

"We [initially] targeted older [audiences], because retro games have an easier reach for people who lived through it, but that's no longer true. We noticed with [TMNT: Shredder's Revenge] that it reached this massive audience that was younger, because the people who grew up playing Turtles In Time wound up playing it with their kids. We were missing out on the younger audience who grew up with the series and movie getting its second wind, and we saw it with the direction the animated series went. "</p><p dir="ltr">With that in mind, Majors said, much like Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, EX will grow up a little more. That especially pertains to where the challenge for the new game will be coming from this time around.</p><p dir="ltr">"The production [on the original Scott Pilgrim game] was so short we didn't second-guess [the difficulty]," he said. "We did some minor playtesting, but we probably should've done a better job making sure it wasn't too hardcore. One thing we're improving is listening to the feedback from the original game, because one of the things they thought dragged the game down was the grinding."</p><p dir="ltr">"[Another thing] that will surprise people is it's not a sequel, or even a simple beat-'em-up either," Majors continued. "We're kind of starting from scratch, thinking about how to structure the game the way we wanted the original to be. It's not as linear, it's more open-ended, Link to the Past-style. You have to [explore the world] a bit more to complete quests. We've adopted more of a River City Ransom structure."</p><p dir="ltr">For his part, Bryan Lee O'Malley is still heavily involved with EX.</p><p dir="ltr">"I just wanna make a video game," he said, laughing. "Just, something new that reminds me of all the games I played growing up."</p><p dir="ltr">Not that there's anything wrong with that at all. But O'Malley is more than aware of the ride Scott Pilgrim has gone on, from a little black-and-white indie comic born of nostalgia and a love of the games, movies, and bands of his youth, to a longtime favorite for multiple generations of nerds and weirdos who have grown up and out over time--a fond memory born of fond memories.</p><p dir="ltr">"If they're 20 now, they were born around the time all this was starting, when I was obsessed with the late '70s, early '80s," he said. "I feel like every generation has that '20 years behind you' nostalgia, 'What was the world like before the one I was born into?' To them, Scott Pilgrim's become this sort of rosetta stone. It's a map to an older version of pop culture."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford says it’s impossible to break the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> servers this weekend through sheer weight of player numbers alone — and he’s so confident he’s publicly promised that Borderlands 4 won’t join the long list of big AAA games whose online systems fail at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 launched earlier this week and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-the-biggest-borderlands-ever-on-steam-just-an-hour-after-launch">immediately saw a concurrent player count on Steam bigger than all the other prior Borderlands games</a>. At the time of this article’s publication, Borderlands 4 had seen an impressive peak of 252,530 players on Valve’s platform, with the peak weekend playing time to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, Borderlands 2 set a Steam peak concurrent player count of 124,678 13 years ago, with Borderlands 3 hitting a peak of 93,820 five-and-a-half years ago, and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel reaching 68,238 10 years ago. Borderlands Game of the Year Edition has a peak of 23,655.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966621625115107531" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitchford took to X / Twitter</a> to address concern about Borderlands 4’s ability to hold up over this weekend, making a promise gamers aren’t used to hearing from developers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So here's the thing with this... We are VERY confident in our backend on-line infrastructure and systems. And we're off to an insane start — record breaking,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But we know from past experience that peak numbers will start really hitting over this weekend. You're going to be hammering our on-line infrastructure and some people are nervous if our on-line systems can handle the numbers you will be throwing at us.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But here's the thing: our on-line team rules.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford is taking the opportunity to encourage as many people as possible to play Borderlands 4 this weekend, and so Gearbox is offering the Break Free Pack to all who play the game from September 12-14. This includes 1 Vault Hunter Skin usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe, and 1 Legendary Ripper Shield, which scales to your Vault Hunter level when redeemed (with a minimum of Lvl 25).</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/13/bkl-1757758196285.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford said he “wanted to see if we could motivate everyone to log in this weekend to see how far we can stress the system,” which is why the free pack was created.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued in typically confident fashion:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Listen — I'm telling you that it's going to be VERY unlikely you guys can be enough people to break the backend and take our game down. I know there have been some high profile backend on-line systems failing around big AAA game launches, but not this one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I am THAT confident.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That said, IF concurrency *does* break our systems, I'll find a way somehow to reward everyone and to make it up to everyone for showing me that it can break. And, you'll have helped expose something that we will need to make stronger, so... win-win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So here it is... I'm throwing down the gauntlet: you cannot break our on-line infrastructure through too many players. You can't. Hacking doesn't count, btw. Just concurrent players in the game is what we're looking for. Play cooperatively; jump into random people's games; log in and out a bunch of times at peak hours... Whatever you can fairly and reasonably do within the game to add pressure to the system, do it!”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/13/gettyimages-2165616595-1757758321299.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Gearbox chief Randy Pitchford sounds very confident in Borderlands 4's servers.

The release was marred by complaints about PC performance that have resulted in a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Valve’s platform. The complaints revolve around poor performance even on high powered PCs, with some affected by crashing that makes the game difficult to even start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Gearbox posted a Borderlands 4 Nvidia Optimization guide on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802577921" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>, advising players how to optimize their graphics settings for “better performance and framerates” on PC with the Nvidia app.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox then issued a piece of advice to PC gamers that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-asks-pc-gamers-to-keep-playing-for-at-least-15-minutes-after-they-tweak-settings-to-see-how-performance-has-changed-as-negative-steam-reviews-pile-up">to me reads like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game's performance as soon as they’ve changed their settings</a>: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile. Please keep playing for at least 15 minutes to see how your PC's performance has changed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4 don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes">SHiFT codes list</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/opinion-im-celebrating-super-mario-bros-40th-anniversary-by-finally-finishing-it.1297143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/99e7e20537869/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Please, angry mob, wait! It's true, I had never finished <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> before this week, but that's not to say that I hadn't played it before. If you'll put your pitchforks and burning torches down for a moment, I promise, I can explain.</p>
<p>It was 2004 when I first came into contact with Super Mario Bros. I remember that because I had just received a Game Boy Advance for my birthday, and in a vague attempt to put me onto a "proper" game and dissuade me from my copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/spongebob_squarepants_movie">The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</a> tie-in platformer, my dad bought me the SMB GBA re-release.</p>
<p>Now yes, the handheld's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/classic_nes_series_super_mario_bros">Classic NES Series</a> version might not have been the <em>ideal</em> way to experience it for the first time — the squashed image, poorly lit screen, dinky little speakers, etc. — but six-year-old Jim knew no better, so I showed willing and cracked on with it.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a4f94d0ac5ee8/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>That first play <em>has</em> stayed in my head. My friend had the zoomed-in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/super_mario_bros_deluxe">Deluxe</a> version on her Game Boy Color, and I distinctly remember comparing notes about how far we had made it through each level. My first time sneaking under Bowser in World 1-4 and sending him into the lava below was a particular point of conversation at the school lunch table, and while I never made it all that far before hitting a 'Game Over', I still managed to get a good few Worlds under my belt. I must have been better at games back then than I am today.</p>
<p>But then, for whatever reason, I stopped. Perhaps it was my inability to make it through the later stages. Perhaps the 32-bit GBA's larger colour palette and sexy sprite potential made me turn my nose up at anything that felt distinctly 'old'. Perhaps my eye was swayed by another attractive tie-in banger, because who would choose a little-known, blocky curio when the solid-gold <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/crazy_frog_racer">Crazy Frog Racer</a> is right there (this is a joke, please don't hurt me).</p>
<p>Whatever the cause, I moved on and never went back. It's not like Nintendo hasn't given me <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/whats-the-best-way-to-play-super-mario-bros-in-2024">ample opportunity to play it</a> on every single console released since, but, at the time, I was far more interested in what was <em>new</em> instead of what I had missed.</p>
<p>So, I never picked it up on a Virtual Console, I didn't have the money for one of those sexy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-a-gorgeous-object-that-leaves-you-wanting-more">Game &amp; Watches</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/11/hardware_nes_classic_mini_review">NES Classic Minis</a>, and you know I wasn't heading up to Argos to buy any of the 'remixed' versions on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/nes_remix_pack">Wii U</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/ultimate_nes_remix">3DS</a>. As for Nintendo Switch Online... <em>yeahh</em>, I don't really have an excuse for that one.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/284b7e2426461/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>All this is to say that the best part of 22 years have passed since I first played SMB on my Game Boy Advance, and I still hadn't seen the fabled 8-4. Until this week.</p>
<p>Knowing that the 40th anniversary was right around the corner, I decided to buck up my ideas and finally fill in my biggest blind spot in gaming. I fired up NSO, started from the very beginning, and in just a couple of hours — made all the shorter by the blessing of Rewind — I finally made it to the very end.</p>
<p>I don't know where exactly I stopped playing all those years ago, but if I had to guess, I'd say that everything from World 6 onwards felt new. This meant that I had never seen the monochrome 6-3, I had never dodged the flying Cheep Cheep bridge in 7-3 (although that feels like 2-3+, to be fair), and I had to actually work out the maze solutions in the final two castles.</p>
<p>It's got to be said — news flash! — it's a good game. There's a lot here that feels a bit outdated by today's standards (from a 40-year-old game? Never!), but on the whole, I was impressed by how <em>not</em>-outdated it felt.</p>
<p>Mario's jump always has been, and always will be, super satisfying. Lakitu is <em>still</em> an arsehole if you don't bop him on the head at early doors. And I wasn't anticipating quite so much of a difficulty spike at the end. I'm not going to say it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a>, but I'm once again grateful to the NSO gods for blessing us with the Rewind feature.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7707fe258163c/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After more retries than I care to admit, I ducked under Bowser's legs one last time and finally, <em>finally</em>, found Princess <del>Peach</del> Toadstool in the right castle. It was a good feeling, made all the sweeter by the sound of my previously revoked membership card to the Nintendo Fan Club dropping through my postbox.</p>
<p>And to think, it only took four decades of the game being on the market for me to finish it. Come back in 2036 to see me finally play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> (this is another joke, I promise).</p>

		<p>It’s heckin’ windy and rainy out and about, so it’s a good weekend to have a cosy time inside playing nice and lovely video games. Definitely nothing spooky and horror-filled – it’s not October yet. Personally, I’ll be continuing with Everybody’s Golf, maybe the Donkey Kong DLC and I need to get back to Indiana Jones’ DLC as well.</p>

<p>Nintendo is really mixing it up nowadays with merchandise, and the next surprise product on the way is a talking flower. It's not just any talking flower though, it's the same one based on the character from the 2023 Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>.</p>
<p>If you were a fan, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/09/you-can-apparently-mute-the-talking-flowers-in-super-mario-bros-wonder">and admittedly not everyone was</a>, as of next spring (alongside the release of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Switch 2 Edition</a>, you'll apparently be able to own your very own physical version of this flower. Here's some insight from Nintendo's Yoshiaki Koizumi about this new product:</p><div><figure data-videoid="MjdXHwRDqMw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MjdXHwRDqMw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MjdXHwRDqMw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MjdXHwRDqMw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3948b1jqsivp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjdXHwRDqMw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Squadron 42, Star Citizen's single-player campaign, <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-feature-complete-polishing-phase-no-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been in polishing mode since late 2023</a>, and Cloud Imperium Games has repeatedly stated that <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-gets-2026-release-window-and-new-gameplay-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it will finally launch next year</a>. However, a fresh comment made by Content Director Jared Huckaby has worried fans that there might be another delay after all. During the <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/09/12/squadron-42-wont-be-at-this-years-citizencon-presentation-so-cig-can-focus-on-the-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest Star Citizen Live videocast</a>, he said:</p>



<p><em>There will be no Squadron 42 presence at CitizenCon Direct this year. That team is heads down. We drew a line in the sand when we said 2026. I don’t know that we’re gonna make it; I just know that we’re going to do every single thing possible to make it, and part of that is not taking time for the distraction of CitizenCon. It's why we're not doing a larger event this year. It's why we're doing a smaller, more focused thing. Even when we did digital CitizenCon, those were still these big 6, 8, 10-hour things. This is not CitizenCon, it's CitizenCon Direct. It's a much smaller, more focused thing, specifically on the work of the Star Citizen team and what they plan for the next year of development.</em></p>



<p>As mentioned above, the statement quickly started a bit of a panic among the fanbase, whom Huckaby tried to reassure <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/3/thread/sq42-i-dont-know-if-we-are-gonna-make-it-jared-202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a forum post</a> explaining that he was talking in general terms about the unpredictability of game development, which can always lead to a relatively last-minute delay, and not of specific issues for Squadron 42, which currently remains on track.</p>



<p>Cloud Imperium Games founder and director Chris Roberts recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-launch-2027-2028-squadron-42-top-gun-star-awrs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke</a> of Squadron 42 as a mix of Star Wars and Top Gun. He also shared the team's hope that its launch might be a GTA VI-like event in terms of hype, touting it as the biggest AAA release scheduled for 2026 after Rockstar's behemoth. When it comes to game budgets, he may very well be right; we don't know exactly how much Squadron 42 is going to cost, but we do know that Star Citizen has received $865 million in crowdfunding, and the campaign's star-studded cast (Gary Oldman, Henry Cavill, Mark Hamill, Gillian Anderson, Ben Mendelsohn, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Mark Strong, and Liam Cunningham, just to name a few) certainly cost the developer a pretty penny.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-review-let-fire-duardin-of-war</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Helsmiths of Hashut, the Chaos Duardin, have brooded for centuries on the wrongs done to them, but with the Hour of Ruin, they have emerged to claim back what's rightfully theirs, and they consider everything rightfully theirs.&nbsp; In this article, we check out the first <em>Age of Sigmar</em> release for the spiritual cousins of <em>Warhammer's</em> Chaos Dwarfs, the Helsmiths of Hashut Army Set.</p>

<p>We've been covering <i>Age of Sigmar </i>for a while on the site, and you can check out our review of the <em>Age of Sigmar</em> 4th Edition launch box <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-review-perfect-starter-set" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and as the Helsmiths of Hashut Army Set also functions as their Spearhead force, you can check out our getting started with the Spearhead style of gaming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/how-to-get-started-with-age-of-sigmar-4th-edition-with-spearhead" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>




<h2>What's In the Box</h2>

<p>The Helsmiths of Hashut Army Set acts as the perfect introductory set for the new faction, and contains all the rules for the full planned release of miniatures, along with containing a complete Spearhead force that can be used straight away while you flesh out your full&nbsp;<em>Age of Sigmar</em> army.</p>

<p>The full box contents are:</p>

<ul><li>Helsmiths of Hashut Battletome</li>
	<li>32 Helsmiths of Hashut Warscroll Cards</li>
	<li>Helsmiths of Hashut Transfer Sheet</li>
	<li>14 miniatures (War Despot, Dominator Engine, Tormentor Bombard, and 11 Infernal Cohort)</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-2.jpg?itok=W2KgM3gL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-2.jpg?itok=1tnXRb-A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Helsmiths of Hashut Army Set includes a full Battletome, Warscrolls and Spearhead Force.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Tip Of The Glaive</h2>

<p>The Helsmiths of Hashut Spearhead force is a complete force for the Spearhead <em>Age of Sigmar</em> game type. This force can be used against any other <em>AoS</em> Spearhead box using the unique warscrolls for it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Helsmiths' Spearhead force is led by a War Despot who boosts nearby units' ability to capture objectives. They're armed with a Daemonflame Glaive, with 5 attacks that hit and wound on a 3+. They're backed up by 2x 5 warrior units of sturdy Infernal Cohorts, one of which also has a Gong Carrier who can be removed to return D3 slain units to the battlefield, further adding to their resilience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-3.jpg?itok=rtbcYkSE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-3.jpg?itok=PHCbP7dp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The<em> Age of Sigmar</em> Helsmiths of Hashut Army Set is led by a War Despot, backup by 2, 5 warrior Infernal Cohort units.</figcaption></figure><p>The real power of the force is the towering Dominator Engine and the Tormentor Bombard artillery piece. The Dominator is the fastest unit in this force, and its movement and attacks can also be boosted with demonic power points, which your force gains a growing number of each turn. It's immolation cannons start off with 5 attacks, each dealing D3 wounds. The Bombard has a range of 30 inches, but its attacks are also boosted for larger enemy units more than 12 inches away. It can also be used to reduce the control score of enemy units by allocating demonic power points to the Bombard, to stop them from scoring objectives.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-4.jpg?itok=4CV0G8VA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-4.jpg?itok=ZLhk7kte 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Age of Sigmar</em> Helsmiths of Hashut Army Set Tormentor Bombard and Dominator engine give your force a huge punch.</figcaption></figure><h2>Thick Beards, Horns And Tusks</h2>

<p>On top of those in the Spearhead force, their Battletime details a number of durable and devastating units with which to grind their enemies down. Our favorites are the Infernal Razers, armed with Flamehurlers or Blunderbusses. The flamehurlers have a shorter range, but more attacks, and the blunderbusses have a slightly longer range, but are easier to wound and deal 2 damage each.</p>

<p>The Helsmiths also have Bull Centaurs, who, along with looking awesome, really capture the Helsmiths' cavalry aesthetic. They add 1 to their charge rolls for each demonic power point they have, and can also inflict extra mortal wounds by rolling a 6+ for each model in the charged unit, with the roll also boosted by the number of their demonic power points.</p>

<p>There's also an option for a different flavor of Dominator Engine, armed with Bane Maces for an entirely close combat experience of smashing your enemies into the ground, and for those who prefer range, the Deathshrikeker Rocket Battery adds another artillery option with 3 attacks dealing D3+2 wounds, with their Watch Them Burn reaction able to deal maximum damage to monsters or war machines.</p>

<p>The Helsmiths of Hashut Army Set is a great start for the Chaos Duardin, and the Spearhead force it contains offers a great insight into their larger game. The Infernal Cohorts stand firm on objectives while the War Despot supports them, and then the Dominator Engine wreaks havoc, as the Tormentor Bombard rains down fire on units that look like they might score other objectives.&nbsp;The miniatures across the range really capture the feel of the Chaos Dwarves of old. Thick black beards and tusks standing proud, and the demonic weapons they carry add an eerie feel to them.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tying in with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-is-set-to-release-in-april-2026/">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, Nintendo is remastering Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, launching on 2nd October. It will cost you a pretty penny to get their collection of Nintendo Wii titles, though, with the two game bundle costing $70 / £59, or being available individually for $40 / £34 apiece.</p>
<p><iframe title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 blasts off October 2nd! (Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/21HVvGkVV_8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The remasters promise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded visuals for both games.</li>
<li>Assist Mode to help with your adventure, which can be turned on and off whenever you like. It lets you play with more health, heal just by standing still and return to solid ground if you fall into space.</li>
<li>An additional chapter of Rosalina’s picture book in Super Mario Galaxy, and an entirely new picture book in Super Mario Galaxy 2.</li>
<li>Listen to the soundtrack of each game from the main menu with 154 tracks in total.</li>
</ul>
<p>Switch 2 support is being included for free, letting both games be played at 4K output in TV mode and 1080p on the built-in screen.</p>
<p>While it’s great to have these two games on Switch – they’re still regarded as two of the best platformers of all time – and the upgrades are nice, the price tag stings. Super Mario Galaxy and its sequel launched in 2007 and 2010 respectively, with the first getting much more love and attention with re-releases since then. In 2015 both games were released on the Wii U eShop in unenhanced form and with a discount $20 price point. A few years later, the first game was then included in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/16/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-switch/">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> collection for Mario’s 35th anniversary alongside Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. This time-limited collection wrapped the three games up in emulation layers to enhance visuals and UI, before being pulled from sale just six months later.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/01/21/super-mario-galaxy-2-a-modern-masterpiece/">Further Reading: Super Mario Galaxy 2 – A Modern Masterpiece</a></h2>
<p>This duology remaster does go further than 3D All-Stars with Switch 2 support and some gameplay additions, and it does allow you to avoid double-dipping by just buying Galaxy 2, but it’s still an immediate point of controversy to have this sticker price.</p>

<p>It's that time of the week once again, and now that the Super Mario 40th anniversary plans have been fully unveiled via the latest Direct...well...we're maybe not gonna be diving into quite as much Mario as we had sorta hoped this weekend, as the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Mario Galaxy 1 and 2's</a> re-release and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> are a little ways off yet. But hey, we got more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a> deets (and that's all this guy cares about right now)!</p>
<p>Yes, there was a big ol' Nintendo Direct yesterday and we got a ton of new info — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> has a release date! The new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a> has a release date! We're getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon life sim</a>!</p>
<p>Besides the Direct, somebody out there is playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection</a> (look, we've all got our crosses to bear), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> is the newest member of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-is-hollow-knight-silksong-too-difficult">the Difficulty Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-every-exciting-new-game-from-the-acclaim-showcase">Acclaim held its own showcase</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever it is you happen to be picking up to play this weekend, or if you're taking some time off from games to do there things (like dream about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/its-official-the-mario-movie-sequel-is-based-on-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy movie</a>) make sure to let us know in the comments; for now, let's pass you over now to some of the Nintendo Life team as we detail what we're up to this weekend.</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I was all geared up and hoping for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Galaxy 1 and 2</a> announcement that we got, although I now have to wait (and they're really quite expensive), so cold water has been applied to those plans.</p>
<p>Now, instead, I'll defo be diving into the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza DLC</a>, I'm excited for that, and I'll also take a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/storm_lancers">Storm Lancers</a>, which I've been keen on since it first got announced a while back. I'm really hoping the talent at ProbablyMonsters delivers something special here! Oh, and my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> playthrough must low-key continue!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I recently got to Deepnest in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>. Lovely place. Looking forward to exploring more there, definitely. Beyond that, I still haven't fired up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars: Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> continues to surprise/delight/astound.</p>
<p>And beyond <em>that</em>, Episode 9 of Robert Ashley's <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://alifewellwasted.com/" href="https://alifewellwasted.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Life Well Wasted</a> is sitting downloaded on my phone. It's been nearly three years since the last and, while I feel it deserves my undivided attention, listening in the kitchen while prepping something tasty sounds like a pretty perfect evening. Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Y'know what, I might just play that newly-announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Bananza</a> DLC! It looks <em>awesome</em>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm on a bit of a <strong>Contra</strong> binge at the moment, so I'm playing a lot of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/contra_anniversary_collection">Anniversary Collection</a> on Switch. Those early entries really are peerless.</p>

<p>It's packed with tiny, beautiful, entirely unnecessary details, like snow falling off trees when you run into them, lanterns and window shutters swaying in the wind, and animals that lie down to rest. I am so happy that this game exists, with this level of love and care put into it, and I hope that it's a sign of equally good Story of Seasons games to come!But also I will be on a plane next week, so I might need to pick a good Plane Game (again — I promise I don't usually travel this much. It's a family reunion! Blame them, not me.)</p>
<p>My personal game development projects right now are centering around MICROGAMES — fishing minigames, specifically, but more generally speaking, any tiny games-within-games that have compelling and moreish mechanics. I know that sounds like I should just play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/warioware_move_it">WarioWare</a>, but that's not exactly what I'm looking for. I'm thinking <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley's</a> fishing minigame, or (if anyone remembers it) the carpentry minigame in <strong>Puzzle Pirates</strong>. Recommendations absolutely encouraged! It's Research™!</p>

<p>Yes, I'm still playing Silksong. That's it. That's the tea.</p>
<p>My review is coming next week, but it's safe to say I <em>love</em> it. Have a good weekend, everyone!</p>
