            <p>Despite a PlayStation blog earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">suggested Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater would drop in 2024</a>, Konami still hasn't put a definite release date against the highly-anticipated remake.</p>
<p>According to Konami's half-yearly financial results, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is still listed as "TBD", alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, Silent Hill Townfall, and a couple of games only releasing in Japan.</p>

<p>It's not that publisher Konami is simply refraining from detailing the release dates of games coming in 2025, either - other titles on the list such as Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection have generic "2025" or "Feb 2025" dates appended. It's just Snake Eater and the Silent Hill games that have no hint of a street date at all.</p><p>If you were hoping for a little more information about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>'s financial performance, that too is sadly missing from the <a href="https://img.konami.com/ir/en/ir-data/meeting/2024/en1031_4xpuc2.pdf">presentation</a>. For now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-tops-one-million-copies-sold-in-less-than-a-week">all we know is that it sold over a million copies in just three days</a>.</p>
<p>Konami says the remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>: Snake Eater maintains what players loved from the original, such as its story, characters, voice acting, gameplay, and music, but now it is "presented in an even more immersive experience".</p>
<p>It's been a year since we had got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-remake-in-engine-footage-receives-mixed-reaction">look at some in-engine footage of Konami's remake</a>. While Snake actor David Hayter gave the trailer his stamp of approval, others said they missed the older style of the original game.</p>
<p>"Whisper it quietly, but Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater looks like the most exciting Konami project in years," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metal-gear-solid-delta-what-tech-does-the-new-remake-bring">Digital Foundry's Tom Morgan wrote after some time with the game earlier this year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>This last week has whizzed by, and perhaps some of that was down to the joy I found in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/23/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-confirms-open-beta-for-next-week/">Monster Hunter Wilds beta</a>. It’s a true sequel to Monster Hunter Worlds, and while I’m very sad to see the Palamutes and Wirebugs of Monster Hunter Rise head off into the sunset, I’m more than happy with what Capcom are serving up! Other than that, there’s been more Metaphor ReFantazio, a heap of Empire of the Ants and a sniff of F1 24.</p>
<p>Checking in with the team, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Diablo IV’s latest expansion, Phasmophobia, Baldur’s Gate 3, and D&amp;D. Meanwhile, <strong>Ade</strong> is very late to the party but he picked up Helldivers 2 the other day and sayd, “OH MY GOOD GRIEF WHAT A GAME! The most fun I’ve had with an online multiplayer in years. Helldivers 2 has shot it’s way straight into GOTY position for me!” So, I think he liked it.</p>

<p>It’s been a bad week for <strong>Aran</strong> as he’s been suffering with illness this week – hope you get better soon mate! <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has continued with his standard dose of Destiny 2 and a little Beat Saber.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/the-smurfs-dreams-review/">The Smurfs – Dreams</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review/">Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</a> for review, both of which “were enjoyable in very different ways”. He continues, “I have got another highly anticipated horror game on the go for review next week so that’ll be my main focus. Other than that I have been polishing off the last few remaining Steam Next Fest demos and have put together a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/8-games-that-show-the-future-of-horror-is-terribly-exciting/">recommendation list</a>.”</p>


<p>Then we’re onto <strong>Jim</strong>, who’s week has almost exclusively been dedicated to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>. He absolutely loved it, saying, “It’s my favourite COD since Black Ops 2 and manages to deliver on all fronts though the acrobatic omnidirectional movement takes some getting used to.”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tef</strong> snuck in a few matches of Black Ops 6 as well, but hasn’t started the campaign yet. Instead, this week he quickly checked out the spooky <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/lego-islands-mystery-of-the-monolith-wraps-up-with-lego-dark-space/">Lego Dark Space level in Fortnite</a>, got to share some thoughts about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/hands-on-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preview/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and put together a compare ’em up piece for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-review/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Russ Crandall knows how to reinvent himself. At 24, he relearned how to walk and write after a stroke impacted his brain. When open-heart surgery wasn’t enough to address a rare autoimmune disease, he adopted a paleo diet — and became <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paleo-Takeout-Restaurant-Favorites-Without/dp/162860087X?tag=theverge02-20">a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling cookbook author</a> and food blogger following his seemingly miraculous recovery. Last year, he retired from a 22-year career as a US Navy translator to become a full-time YouTuber instead.</p><p>Now, he’s wondering if Nintendo will force him to change yet again.</p><p>Crandall runs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RetroGameCorps">Retro Game Corps</a>, a YouTube channel with half a million subscribers that shows hundreds of ways to play classic games using modern hardware and emulation.<strong> </strong>If there’s a handheld gaming device released in the past four years, odds are Crandall has made a 20-minute video about it. He started the channel as a hobby in 2020 during the covid-19 pandemic but soon realized it could become his day job. </p><p>So, last year, he <a href="https://thedomesticman.com/2023/04/06/i-think-were-done-here/">shut down his food blog</a> — “I was kind of done telling people what to eat,” he says — and left the military with the rank of master chief petty officer.</p><div><figcaption><em>Yes, Retro Game Corps was a master chief, just like in </em>Halo<em>. (I saw his DD-214.)</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Selfie by Russ Crandall</cite></p></div><p>But four years into his YouTube career, on September 28th, Crandall saw how easily his new life as a content creator could disintegrate. Walking back from his studio after pulling an all-nighter, he checked his phone to see if a just-edited video was uploading properly. It was — but another one of his videos vanished before his eyes. Days earlier, he’d published a 14-minute video about how well Nintendo Wii U games can run on Android handhelds, and now it had been wiped from YouTube.</p><p>“This can’t be happening,” he recalls saying out loud. A few minutes later, a YouTube email confirmed it wasn’t a glitch: Nintendo had issued a DMCA takedown notice, YouTube had removed his video, and his entire 500,000-subscriber channel was now at risk of permanent deletion.&nbsp;</p><div><p>“We’ll have to terminate your channel” after one more strike, YouTube warned</p></div><p>It was his second YouTube copyright strike from Nintendo, and Crandall says that’s when it truly sank in. YouTube maintains a strict “three strikes, you’re out” rule, and he realized his family’s livelihood depended on preventing strike number three. “It all sort of came crashing down in that moment,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>In a panic, he rushed back to the studio, canceled his upload, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/1frjcaa/hey_everyone_this_is_russ_from_retro_game_corps_i/">publicly declared</a> that Nintendo was targeting him. He would begin self-censoring all his videos to hopefully escape the Japanese company’s wrath. “I will no longer show any Nintendo games on-screen,” he told his fans and related communities on Reddit, YouTube, and social networks.</p><p>Nintendo was well within its rights to ask for a takedown, of course: Crandall had shown the company’s copyrighted content onscreen. And yet that doesn’t explain the copyright strike at all since countless Twitch streamers, YouTubers, TikTokers, and Instagrammers show Nintendo content every single day. Clearly, Nintendo was using copyright as a pretext to get these videos taken down.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Crandall says he received this YouTube notice on September 28th.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Most institutions have historically taken Nintendo’s legal threats seriously. Countless fan projects, including unofficial remakes and sequels, have been voluntarily terminated by their creators after receiving cease and desist orders from Nintendo. While the technology behind video game emulators is generally considered legal, even the lead developers of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">Nintendo Switch emulators Yuzu</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259791/nintendo-ryujinx-switch-emulator-gdkchan-removed-downloads-github">Ryujinx folded</a> when Nintendo came knocking on their doors. </p><p>But unlike many of those developers, Crandall isn’t some pseudonymous person who could slink back into the internet’s shadows. Nor is he someone Nintendo can readily accuse of “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">facilitating piracy at a colossal scale</a>,” like Yuzu, for distributing software tools.&nbsp;</p><p>Even among content creators, Crandall doesn’t seem like the kind of person Nintendo usually threatens — he’s known for <em>advocating</em> that people should buy Nintendo products before they use emulators and often shows off physical cartridges in his videos to drive that message home.&nbsp;</p><p>“If I’m playing a Switch game on my Steam Deck, the cartridge will be there or the box will be there to indicate that I have purchased the game,” he says. While he admits he hasn’t done that 100 percent of the time, he’s been careful with Nintendo Switch games in particular. In one of the videos that YouTube removed, he flips through a wallet full of 80 genuine cartridges. He also produces guides on how to create personal backups of your own genuine classic games.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Here’s his wallet of 80 genuine Switch cartridges, from one of the videos that Nintendo asked YouTube to remove.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>That’s why the community was so surprised when Nintendo targeted him, of all YouTubers — and it’s why Crandall might possibly take the unusual step of<em> </em>challenging Nintendo’s takedowns.&nbsp;</p><p>Crandall says he’s been a Nintendo fan for nearly 40 years, ever since his family bought an NES for Christmas in 1985. The copyright strikes hit hard. “This is the first actual interaction I’ve had with Nintendo, and it’s crazy. I feature most of their games not because I’m trying to, like, stick it to them, but just sharing the love of those games,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>But he does have a guess as to why Nintendo targeted him. The first copyright strike landed on his video about <a href="https://migflash.com/">the MIG Dumper and the MIG Flash</a>, a pair of devices that let you turn genuine Nintendo Switch cartridges into digital files and then carry around an entire library of those ROMs in a special microSD-equipped flash cartridge for your console. I’ve watched the video, and while Crandall does explicitly take an anti-piracy stance, it’s easy to imagine these gadgets being used by bad actors, too.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think the first strike was simply due to the fact that they wanted to minimize attention around the MIG Flash cartridge and dumper, and they had an opportunity,” Crandall says. That opportunity was a relatively tiny mistake: unlike, say, fellow YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4A5LR_ipQ4">Taki Udon’s video on the MIG products</a>, Retro Game Corps showed off four seconds of the title screen of <em>Mario</em> to prove the MIG hardware could legitimately dump and run games, potentially infringing Nintendo’s exclusive right to distribute and / or perform its audiovisual intellectual property.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>In one of the videos YouTube removed, Crandall never shows more than the title screen of this Nintendo game.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Isn’t that fair use? Crandall thinks so. It seems like his uses could be brief, limited, and educational enough to satisfy <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107#:~:text=the%20factors%20to%20be%20considered%20shall%20include">the four-factor fair use test</a>, and arguing that could genuinely get him out of YouTube purgatory. I could easily find dozens of similar examples in our journalism here at <em>The Verge</em>. But in order to submit what’s called a “<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807684?hl=en">copyright counter notification</a>” with YouTube, which argues that he’s been inaccurately targeted and isn’t infringing on someone’s copyright,<strong> </strong>Crandall would have to open himself up to a potential Nintendo lawsuit.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s a dangerous game,” says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HoegLaw">Richard Hoeg</a>, a business attorney who hosts the <em>Virtual Legality</em> podcast. “You really don’t want to get into federal court over something that even if you win, will be an expensive and time-consuming burden.”</p><p>But Crandall knows this — he seems quite read up on both the DMCA and YouTube processes — and yet he’s considered at least trying his luck. Crandall says he’s conflicted; he doesn’t want to “poke the bear.” He has his family to think about. But it’s possible Nintendo could continue to come after him, he admits, even if he lies low.</p><p>While he’s already eliminated Nintendo games from his testing suite for all future videos, he says he simply doesn’t have time to go back through the hundreds of videos he’s created that already contain <em>Mario</em> footage and blur or delete every last scrap. And yet, the way things stand, Nintendo could pick any of those videos to immediately designate his channel for deletion.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies can freely pick and choose who they target with copyright infringement complaints and lawsuits, several legal experts tell me. Unlike with trademarks, they don’t need to actively&nbsp;or consistently defend their works in order to maintain their rights.</p><p>Crandall says that even YouTube initially thought that perhaps Nintendo made a mistake when targeting him. He’s part of the YouTube Partner Program, and his designated partner manager told him to sit tight while YouTube asked Nintendo if it might retract its own takedown requests. But Nintendo wouldn’t, and YouTube has now told him he’s on his own.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>On November 23rd, one of the copyright strikes should simply expire — unless Nintendo makes a move before then.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image via Russ Crandall</cite></p></div><p>As of late October, he’s waffling. He could simply wait two more months until YouTube’s 90-day copyright strikes expire because, as soon as they do, his channel will no longer be in danger of immediate termination. Nintendo’s takedown requests already succeeded in removing those videos, and he can<strong> </strong>hope Nintendo feels it’s made enough of an example out of him to do anything more.&nbsp;</p><p>Or he can submit a document that shows he’s not willing to be that example, not willing to be pushed around by Nintendo — and hope it doesn’t land him in a world of legal hurt.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s painful for Crandall, who has been a lifelong fan of Nintendo’s work. Even after a long day of making videos about games, he likes to relax by playing through a couple of classic <em>Mario</em> or <em>Donkey Kong</em> levels, purely to admire the artistry and design. “Since the second strike I haven’t been doing that much at all, because even just seeing the box art leaves a bit of a sour taste in my mouth,” he says.</p><p>Nintendo didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Our Ed has been hands on with the game already, and came away impressed. "For the most part, Monster Hunter Wilds strikes a balance between approachability and depth of combat. It offers a familiar thrill of the hunt, of player customisation (the new armours look awesome), and of extravagant combat, but with a fresh world ripe for a bit of co-op action - even with NPCs," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds preview</a>.</p><p>"Coupled with some of those smart tweaks to streamline the experience and put as much focus as possible on the action, rather than fiddly menus, and there's a good chance this one'll successfully lure in a new audience of hunters."</p>

		<p>This week saw the global launch of Pokemon TCG Pocket for Android and iOS devices, having been available in New Zealand for the last month. Pokemon TCG Pocket brings the trading card game of Pokemon to mobile, allowing players to collect cards through opening packs, build their own decks and collections, and take part in battles against AI or other players around the world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon TCG Pocket | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16duP6ga_Q8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Today, following the global launch on October 30th, sees the first event that players can take part in outside of the standard missions. This event is Wonder Pick Event Part 1, with Chansey and Meowth being the focus. From today, and for the next two weeks, special promo card versions of Chansey and Meowth will appear in Wonder Picks. There is no other way to obtain either of these promo cards, so a lot of this will be on your luck at selecting the correct option when using a Wonder Pick. For those unfamiliar with Wonder Picks, this is an option where you can pick one of five overturned cards to add to your collection. You are limited to how many times you can do this in a day.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> is something of a talisman for gaming on Linux, its popularity and penguin-powered SteamOS having almost singlehandedly dragged it past MacOS as the second-most-used operating system among Steam users. Sadly, this also means the Valve handheld is the primary casualty when developers decide to stop bothering with Linux support, as Respawn Entertainment have decided to do for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-best-guns-tier-list-weapon-stats">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to a <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740">post</a> on EA’s tech support hub, Respawn’s immediate culling of ApeLeg’s Linux support – which, to be clear, effectively renders it unplayable on SteamOS – is a well-meaning sacrifice to the anti-cheat pantheon. The post explains that Linux is particularly vulnerable to exploitation by hacker types, due to it not allowing anti-cheat measures access to the deep, dark levels of OS kernel space that they typically need to block non-kosher modifications.</p>
<p>"We had to weigh the decision on the number of players who were legitimately playing on Linux/the Steam Deck versus the greater health of the population of players for Apex," it reads. "While the population of Linux users is small, their impact infected a fair amount of players’ games. This ultimately brought us to our decision today."</p>
<p>Yeah. I dunno. While it is technically true that Linux is more protective of its kernel space than Windows (ironically, this is in part to ensure all its drivers remain open source), I’ve been playing Apex Legends since it released nearly six years ago, and I’ve been rolled over by a passing aimbotter... twice? Maybe thrice? I’ve never felt the impression that its legit playerbase is being held at the mercy of a horde of rampaging Linux abusers. As such, it’s hard to agree that effectively banning an entire operating system, taking out the world’s most widely played handheld PC in the process, is a proportionate response.</p><p>For bonus bafflement, Respawn have previously been unusually supportive of the Deck, working with Valve back in 2021 to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-conundrum-partially-solved-with-easy-anti-cheat-support">improve SteamOS compatibility with Easy Anti-Cheat</a> and earn Apex a coveted Steam Deck Verified badge. Today, that cheerful green tick is replaced by the grumpy grey of Unsupported status. And that’s saying nothing of the small (but, if they’re still playing a shooter from 2019, loyal) contingent of desktop Linux/SteamOS players who’ve now been locked out as well.</p>
<p>Windows-based handhelds, like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/asus-rog-ally">Asus ROG Ally</a> series and the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zotac-zone-review">Zotac Zone</a>, are unaffected.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s a beautifully presented thing, faux-encased in a red, four button handheld. “Oh no!” reads the mock-up instruction manual. “The Adventure Club’s official mascot turtle has carelessly wandered into Moida Mansion. Your friends went after her and got trapped! They broke the golden T.A.C rule: “Stay out of Moida Mansion!” Now it’s up to you. Sneak in and rescue them before it’s too late!”</p>
<p>The idea here is that you’ll explore the Moida Mansion in first person, listening for noises to locate your missing mates. It’s basically a very elaborate game of hide and seek. There’s also puzzles, helpful and harmful inhabitants to meet, and a ‘monsta’ chasing you around. No word on whether the New Yoik-ification of these terms has any bearing on the actual game, but maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UPXUG8q4jKU?feature=share">pizza rat</a> will show up at some point.</p><p>It’s fair to say Pope has a penchant for retro presentation. The excellent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/return-of-the-obra-dinn">Return Of The Obra Dinn </a>utilised early Macintosh monochrome, and the Playdate itself has its own, stripped back style. If you’re yet to play Obra Dinn itself, it’s safe to say it’s somewhat of an RPS favourite: one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-games-of-the-decade-on-pc">favourite PC games</a> of the 2010’s, actually. “Obra Dinn asks you to tease out social lives from a freeze frame of murder,” was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/return-of-the-obra-dinn-review">wot Matthew</a> (RPS in peace) reckoned. “It doesn’t take the little grey cells to realise this is remarkable stuff.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-breaks-steam-records-for-a-bioware-and-ea-single-player-game.1024980/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-breaks-steam-records-for-a-bioware-and-ea-single-player-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard launched only a few hours ago,&nbsp;<span>but in this short timeframe, the game has already managed to break some Steam records. Firstly, it has&nbsp;<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1845910/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> a concurrent player peak record for a BioWare game with 70.</span>K players. The previous best was Mass Effect Legendary Edition, which launched in May 2021 and included the full remastered trilogy of the sci-fi franchise; its Steam peak was 59.8K concurrent players.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that for several years, EA did not release its games on Steam to favor its own store and app (first Origin, then EA app). For example, Anthem was never launched on Steam, as EA only <a href="https://wccftech.com/electronic-arts-is-back-on-steam-with-ea-games-and-ea-access-subscription/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reverted</a> this policy several months after the third-person cooperative shooter launched. By that time, the game had already failed.</p>
<p>While Anthem quickly faded, it did attract considerable interest at first due to the hype. For example, it topped PS4's digital chart for that month. It is reasonable to assume it could have achieved bigger numbers on Steam had it been released right away on Valve's platform.</p>
<p>Still, even with those caveats, Dragon Age: The Veilguard also became the single player game with the highest concurrent player peak published by Electronic Arts, beating Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which stopped at 67.8K players. There's another little caveat here: The Sims 4 is also a single player title, and it peaked at 96.3K players on Steam, but it is a free-to-play game.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard could still surpass The Sims 4 wholesale during the weekend, when concurrent player records are usually established. Anyway, user reception also appears to be largely favorable, with 79% of the 3,610 user reviews already submitted rating it positively.</p>
<p>Granted, we'll have to wait a bit longer to see a larger picture of the game's sales. Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-breakout-potential-says-ea-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed</a> confidence in the game's breakout potential.</p>
<p>In my review of the game, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPG with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>

Leading the pack is <strong>Amnesia: The Bunker</strong>, one of the scariest games to come out in a while. It locks you in a World War I bunker with a horrific, mutated creature, tasking you with finding your way out while continually powering a generator to keep the lights on and stay alive. You've also got <strong>Death Stranding</strong>, Kojima Productions' post-apocalyptic vision of an America infested by killer ghosts, and <strong>Hard West II</strong>, an XCOM-like turn-based strategy game set in a paranormal Old West.</p><p>The Prestige bundle features 16 games, and the more you buy, the cheaper the individual price on each one. Bundle two games together and you'll pay $15, or $7.50 for each; push it up to three games and the price drops to $7.33 each; and with five or more games, you'll pay only $7 each. That means you can grab five games for $35, or the entire bundle for $112, which would normally cost $408 if you paid retail for all of them.

You can also get some more lighthearted experiences if you want some counterprogramming to the usual Halloween haunts. <strong>Payday 3</strong> lets you pull off heists with your friends (and mostly get into ridiculous shootouts with the cops), <strong>Another Crab's Treasure</strong> is a funny and satirical Souls-like set under the sea, and <strong>Squirrel with a Gun</strong> is about a woodland creature's hilarious rampage.</p><p>But spooky options are on the table as well, specifically with <strong>Ghostwire: Tokyo</strong>. It mixes first-person shooter mechanics with a Japanese setting filled with incredibly creepy creatures and spirits--excellent for those who like a Halloween feel without big scares.</p><p>The Supreme Collection bundle has newer titles than the Prestige collection, resulting in prices that are a little higher--but you can bring them down by bundling more games together. You can grab two games for $24, or $12.50 apiece; for three games, you'll pay $36, or $12 each; and five games will run you $55, or $11 each. As with other Fanatical bundles, you can grab as many games as you want and keep the $11 apiece price for all of them. With 23 games available in the bundle, you'll pay $187 for the lot, down from the retail price of $593 for all of them.

            <p>
Were you one of those people who thought <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a> went on a bit too long? Would you have preferred it if the much-loved sci-fi horror wrapped things up after 46 seconds? If so, you're in luck: one enterprising modder has now released an "impossible" mod that slings a chronological spanner in the works so the game technically ends before it begins.
</p>
<p>
"In an attempt to please IGN," modder Matt Filer wrote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlicicqW9mY">on YouTube</a> (and if you don't know what that's about, all should become clear <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review">over here</a>), "this mod substantially shortens Alien: Isolation's playable length by introducing Xenomorphs to LV-426."
</p>
<p>
And here comes the science bit. What you're seeing in Filer's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlicicqW9mY">46-second video</a> below is an ordinarily Xenomorph-free flashback sequence that usually takes place a good few hours into Alien: Isolation. It's a scene that sets the main story - in which Amanda Ripley searches for her mother - into motion, and one that would create a hell of a paradox if, say, someone shoved in a murderous Xenomorph, causing the flashback crew to perish. "As a result of the inevitable fatalities," Filer continues, "Marlow's team never discovers Ellen Ripley's flight recorder, and subsequently never arrive on Sevastopol to cause the Xenomorph outbreak."
</p>

<p>
 However, the mod does a bit more than add a Xenomorph; it also shifts the flashback sequence to the very start of the game. That both prevents the paradoxical weirdness of having it pop up several hours after Amanda is already (now impossibly) doing her thing, and means that - depending how ruthlessly efficient the Xenomorph is feeling - the entire story "usually ends in under a minute". Or in the case of Filer's illustrative video, 46 seconds.
</p><p>
The mod, which can be <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/MattFiler/mods?gameId=1310">downloaded on Nexus Mods</a>, isn't <em>just</em> an amusing novelty; it also serves as an advert for Filer's <a href="https://opencage.co.uk/docs/">OpenCAGE</a>, an open source set of mod tools for Alien: Isolation capable of "asset import/export, level script modification/creation, core configuration edits, NPC and behaviour tweaks, weapon mods, and more!". And if you're curious what else it can achieve, Filer has helpfully released a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/alienisolation/mods/48">Thomas the Tank Engine mod</a>, as is now obligatory.
</p>
<p>
Sega recently confirmed an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alien-isolation-2-teased-by-creative-assembly-with-original-director-returning">Alien: Isolation sequel is in early development</a>, with the original game's director onboard. Unfortunately for everyone, Filer's mod now makes that a temporal impossibility, so expect reality to start collapsing in on itself anytime soon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-removes-steam-deck-support-due-to-cheating/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA and Respawn Entertainment have <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced on the official EA website</a> that they are shifting away from Linux support for Apex Legends. This means that those using a Steam Deck will no longer be able to play <a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-lootboxes-get-official-drop-rate-disclosure-from-ea/">the game</a>, as the Steam Deck runs Linux OS. This move likely comes as a shock to many, as games such as these are quite popular to play on handheld consoles. However, EA mentions that they are dropping support for Linux OS in an attempt to maintain "competitive integrity" and to fight off cheaters. This isn't the only game to drop Steam Deck support, as Grand Theft Auto V also went from being the most played game on the Steam Deck to unsupported due to Rockstar Games adding an <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-pc-finally-gets-anti-cheat-might-be-about-to-get-ray-tracing-too/">anti-cheat</a> that is unsupported on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This announcement made by EA and Respawn Entertainment says: "In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we've identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we've decided to block Linux OS access to the game. While this will impact a small number of Apex players, we believe the decision will meaningfully reduce instances of cheating in our game."</p>
<p>It's a well-known fact that there are ways to modify the Steam Deck, and adding ways to cheat in a game seems to be no different. People have managed to get Blizzard games running on their Steam Deck, as well as emulated Nintendo games. The handheld seems to have no bounds, as long as the person knows what they're doing.</p>
<p>EA has mentioned that Linux is an "attractive" OS for those who want to cheat in the game. This comes after they looked into the number of legitimate players using Linux against those who are cheating and utilizing Linux. It's not known how many are using Linux to cheat, but EA and Respawn Entertainment are willing to take the risk in doing so.</p>
<p>By default, it means that the Steam Deck will be unsupported, as there is "currently no reliable way for us to differentiate a legitimate Steam Deck from a malicious cheat claiming to be a Steam Deck (via Linux.)" However, people have managed to install Windows on their Steam Deck. In doing so, this means that those using it will be able to continue playing Apex Legends on their handheld. Whether they will change this decision in the future will depend on how successful they are in stamping out cheaters by limiting Linux users.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/papers-please-creator-lucas-pope-has-made-a-free-game-watch-style-haunted-house-caper-for-halloween</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/papers-please-creator-lucas-pope-has-made-a-free-game-watch-style-haunted-house-caper-for-halloween.1024827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/papers-please-creator-lucas-pope-has-made-a-free-game-watch-style-haunted-house-caper-for-halloween<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
'Tis the night for ghosties and ghoulies and hiding with the lights off because you suddenly remembered you forgot to buy sweets for trick-or-treaters this Halloween (oops!). And what better way to celebrate the occasion than with a free Game &amp; Watch-style haunted house caper from Papers, Please and Obra Dinn creator Lucas Pope?
</p>
<p>
The wonderfully titled Moida Mansion is <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/moida-mansion">available to play right now on itch.io</a>, challenging players to slip into the titular spookhouse and find their fellow Adventure Club members - who've all been trapped after following their mascot turtle inside. "Now it's up to you," reads the gloriously retro-styled manual. "Sneak in and rescue them before it's too late!"
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, Moida Mansion is a relatively simple thing, tasking players with moving from room to room and cycling through the objects within to search each one. Searching might locate one of your Adventure Club pals, or it might reveal a secret passageway, or even a handy key. Or all that rummaging might attract the attention of the mansion's "monsta", in which case you'll either need to sneak or - if you cause a ruckus while it's nearby - run away.
</p>

</p>
<figcaption>Pope also released Mars After Midnight on Playdate earlier this year.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTKhC5Chp2w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
For all its simplicity, though, Moida Mansion is oddly compelling, and I've just merrily spend the last 20 minutes dodging monsta and scouring the house to uncover its secrets. It's also surprisingly atmospheric (and just a little bit tense) for a game with rudimentary LCD-style visuals, virtually zero animation, and minimal sound. What's more, Pope builds an impressive amount of variety from a relatively limited number of visual elements - and better yet, the mansion changes each game. I would buy this thing immediately if it was real!
</p><p>
This isn't Pope's first Game &amp; Watch style effort, of course; the acclaimed designer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/papers-please-gets-game-watch-style-demake-to-celebrate-10th-anniversary">created a free demake</a> of Papers, Please last year, in celebration of the dystopian document thriller's 10th anniversary. More recently, he released his Playdate-exclusive puzzler Mars After Midnight - a "lovely, silly game about community", as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lucas-popes-new-playdate-puzzler-is-a-lovely-silly-game-about-community">Christian Donlan put it</a> back in March.

		<p>Red Barrels has announced that it is partnering with Lionsgate to create a movie based on Outlast, with the game series writer, JT Petty, handling the writing of the screenplay. The Outlast movie is going to be produced by Roy Lee, who has previously been a producer on the likes of The Strangers: Chaper 1, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, and IT. No actors have yet been confirmed for any of the roles for the Outlast movie.</p>
<p><em>“As die-hard fans of horror ourselves, we hold immense respect for Roy Lee and Lionsgate,”</em> said David Chateauneuf, Co-Founder and Creative Director at Red Barrels. <em>“Horror films, both classic and modern, have profoundly influenced our franchise, and collaborating on an Outlast&nbsp;film with true horror legends is a dream— or should we say, a nightmare—come true.”</em></p>


<p>Roy Lee also had this to say about the Outlast movie. <em>“When Outlast launched in 2013, it changed the landscape of horror gaming,” Roy explains. “Its deep, emergent lore provides the perfect foundation for a film that explores the psychological and physical horrors at the core of the franchise. I’m excited to bring this unique world to life for both new viewers and dedicated fans.”</em></p>
<p>The Outlast series kicked off in 2013 with the original game, which was a first person horror game in which players took on the role of investigative journalist Miles Upshur as he explored the Mount Massive Asylum, which contained a lot of secrets and horrors to avoid and escape from. This was followed by the prequel Outlast: Whistleblower, in which players are Waylon Park, a software engineer at the asylum who gets the word out to Miles which leads to the events of the first game. Outlast 2 followed in 2017, introducing a new protagonist called Blake Langermann, another investigative journalist, who finds himself a poor rural area where a doomsday cult lives. The Outlast Trials is the most recent game, adding a multiplayer spin to the series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-accounted-for-19-of-comcast-internet-traffic-this-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>You might think that since <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> (which was released last Friday) is the 21st game in the franchise, it wouldn't be that highly anticipated. You'd be wrong. Last week's entry set multiple records when it launched.</p>
<p>Specifically, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the game set new records for Game Pass subscribers, particularly for a first-day game launch. That's, of course, to be expected—Call of Duty was a major reason why Microsoft acquired Activision, the longtime publisher of the series.</p>
<p>It gets a little zanier, though. The Internet service provider Comcast says <em>Black Ops 6</em> was directly responsible for 19 percent of its overall traffic the week of the launch, according to a report in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283801/comcast-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-large-downloads">The Verge</a>.</p>
<p>That's partly due to the game's popularity, but it can also be attributed to its huge file size. A full install of <em>Black Ops 6</em> can take up to just over 100GB, depending on your platform—and possibly as much as 300GB if you also install game modes tied to the previous entries in the series, like the immensely popular battle royale <em>Warzone</em>. That will wreak havoc on users' data caps; Comcast imposes a 1.2TB monthly cap in many states.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-marvel-snap-rewards-card-1851686837<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>  <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> arrived this week on iPhone and Android, and it’s a surprisingly crisp and streamlined version of the card game after years of really bad alternatives. <em>Pokémon</em> is pretty much a license to print money, but <em>TCG Pocket</em> does a great job of spotlighting what people love about about the game—the cards themselves—and getting most of the other stuff out of the way. Still, as a big fan of Marvel Snap, there are a few things I wish the mobile game would steal from Second Dinner’s 2022 comic book phenomenon. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192873" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="133" data-playlist="192873,196165,196578" data-current="192873"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18337.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’ve been spending most of my idle smartphone moments the past two days playing <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> instead of doom scrolling Twitter or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/zuckerberg-the-ai-slop-will-continue-until-morale-improves/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/zuckerberg-the-ai-slop-will-continue-until-morale-improves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ingesting AI-slop on Instagram</a></span>, which is exactly what I want from a good, daily grind  mobile game. All of the currencies and sub-economies aimed at getting you to spend money on the otherwise free-to-play game are a bit convoluted and hard to parse, but the battles are fun and opening virtual booster packs by slicing wrappers with a finger swipe is a surprisingly effective simulacrum of the pure joys of doing so in real life. </p><p>I’m not yet as obsessed with <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> as I was with Marvel Snap, however, and I think there are three reasons for that. The first is match length. Marvel Snap battles breeze by, making it feel relatively low-stakes to start up another no matter what’s going on around you. <em>TCG Pocket</em> is a bit more involved. Players have a cumulative timer of 20 minutes, with countdowns starting at over 60 seconds for individual turns. The clock rarely gets milked, but matches can still feel a little drawn out as players stack their benches and build up their Pokémon’s power. More than once I’ve finished a match and thought, “That was neat but do I really have time for another.” </p><p>The second thing holding <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>back a little for me are the match rewards. In addition to bite-sized matches, <em>Marvel Snap</em> has an ingenious progression built around acquiring extra cards  to level them up and earn points that can be spent on acquiring new ones. It’s a clever twist on the traditional booster pack RNG formula. <em>TCG Pocket</em>, as an adaptation of an existing card game, doesn’t have that same luxury. Unfortunately, as things stand, the only rewards for winning matches are miniscule amounts of XP that contribute to an overall level. Raising it nets additional rewards but none of them feel very distinct. The result is that finishing matches feels a bit anti-climactic, rather than giving out that dopamine hit that makes you immediately want to play another match.</p><p>Finally, there’s the cards themselves. Outside of building your collection, Marvel Snap has the secondary goal of acquiring, sometimes by outright purchasing, cool alternate card art for your favorite decks. It provides something else to strive for as well as a way to express your particular flavor of popular deck type. Again, <em>TCG Pocket</em> runs into trouble here because its working off of existing card art, and while there are multiple versions of certain cards to unlock, there aren’t many, and there’s no real way to chase them directly. If you open a pack and get a full art variant, great! If not, well, wait for the next random pull. </p><p>It’s still early and <em>TCG Pocket</em> is otherwise doing a lot right, certainly more than probably every other digital version of the <em>Pokémon </em>card game I’ve played in the past. There’s only one set of cards to collect at the moment and not much eye candy to salivate over in the paid in-game store. I’m sure that will all change soon enough but for now the game hasn’t quite conjured the full magic of my early days with <em>Marvel Snap</em>. Maybe that’s for the best. I eventually had to delete that game from my phone because it was consuming way too much of my free time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It is no secret that Valorant has one of the biggest esports out there. The popular first-person shooter is a hit with gamers and will continue to grow throughout the years. But what about the game’s ranked mode? Here is a list of all the Valorant Ranks.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-valorant-ranks">All Valorant Ranks</h2>



<p>Sure, Valorant has the simple few ranks, including Bronze and Silver, but it also has some of its own unique ranks.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-valorant-ranks-worst-to-best">All Valorant Ranks (Worst to Best):</h4>



<ul>
<li>Iron I</li>



<li>Iron II</li>



<li>Iron III</li>



<li>Bronze I</li>



<li>Bronze II</li>



<li>Bronze III</li>



<li>Silver I</li>



<li>Silver II</li>



<li>Silver III</li>



<li>Gold I</li>



<li>Gold II</li>



<li>Gold III</li>



<li>Platinum I</li>



<li>Platinum II</li>



<li>Platinum III</li>



<li>Diamond I</li>



<li>Diamond II</li>



<li>Diamond III</li>



<li>Ascendant I</li>



<li>Ascendant II</li>



<li>Ascendant III</li>



<li>Immortal I</li>



<li>Immortal II</li>



<li>Immortal III</li>



<li>Radiant</li>
</ul>



<p>Valorant’s final few ranks, Ascendant, Immortal and Radiant, are unique to the shooter game. However, reaching them is incredibly difficult, especially with the skill gap in competitive. </p>



<p>How does one reach Radiant in Valorant?</p>



<h6 id="h-related-valorant-challengers-reveal-2025-changes-and-more">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-challengers-reveal-2025-changes-and-more/">Valorant Challengers Reveal 2025 Changes and More</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-radiant-in-valorant">How to Get Radiant in Valorant</h2>



<p>Like other competitive video games, climbing up the ranks in Valorant is simple (in terms, that is). All you have to do is continue to win matches. </p>



<p>Losing will only set you back and push you below in rank. The difficult part about attempting to rank up in Valorant and achieve the Radiant rank is the fact that you have to also rely on teammates. </p>



<p>One of the best suggestions for ranking up is developing a team of five beforehand, and playing ranked together. That way you build up chemistry and can practice as a team, making it easier to climb the ranks together. Doing it solo with random players all the time will only make your journey to Radiant more difficult.</p>



<p>Will you be attempting to get Radiant in Valorant?</p>

            <p>
Fireproof Games, the studio behind the acclaimed puzzle-adventure series The Room, has announced its first new title since 2021's The Room 4: Old Sins. It's a spooky, single-player VR puzzle-adventure called Ghost Town, and it's heading to PC, PSVR2, and Quest 2/3 next year.
</p>
<p>
Ghost Town unfolds in the London of 1983, charting the adventures of with turned ghost hunter Edith Penrose. "Life has been going well for Edith," Fireproof explains in its announcement. "The paranormal detective agency she runs with her flatmate has never been busier, she's almost up-to-date with her rent and the ghosts in her bathroom mirror have been less demanding than usual. But Edith's world is turned upside down when her brother goes missing and a mysterious new lead promises to reveal clues of his whereabouts."
</p>
<p>
Edith's journey first takes her to a remote Scottish island in search of a gifted clairvoyant, but Fireproof isn't saying much more about its story just yet. It does, however, share a few details on how Ghost Town will unfold in VR as players explore its world of "large navigable environments" and deal with fully motion-captured characters, both living and dead.

"Explore a variety of atmospheric locations with a controller in each hand and a torch to light your way," it explains. "Use the dexterity of your hands to overcome tactile puzzles, cast spells and even summon troubled spirits to move them on to the next world."
</p><p>
And that's about everything Fireproof is willing to say right now. Ghost Town will initially launch for <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/ghost-town/9531494193591052/">Meta Quest 2/3</a> in "spring" next year, with a <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010082">PSVR2</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2496180/Ghost_Town/">Steam VR</a> release set to follow in the summer. Fireproof's wonderfully macabre The Room series has been a consistent delight over its numerous instalments (including 2020's excellent VR outing The Dark Matter) since launching over a decade ago, so Ghost Town's going straight on my wishlist.

The studio will be helping six unique, best-selling TTRPGs in the Italian market from two different publishing companies reach wider audiences worldwide.</p>

<h2>The Ares Games Italian RPG Distribution Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official <a href="https://www.aresgames.eu/36303">Ares Games blog post</a>, the company will be distributing six "Made in Italy" TTRPGs and volumes in the English language. Three of these RPGs were produced by Italian publisher MS Edizioni, the others were made by indie studio Nigredo Press.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/five-days-promo-image.jpg?itok=5E8eBrwr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/five-days-promo-image.jpg?itok=H5uGv1Vi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The three MS Edizioni releases are described as light, self-contained, and highly innovative RPGs set in original settings. The first is Italian best-seller <em>Green Oaks</em>. It is a fast-paced narrative-driven RPG where players take on the rule of quirky elders staying at a haunted, rumor-filled retirement home.</p>

<p>The second RPG, <em>Five Days</em>, is a more somber one. Players play as a family member, either by blood or by experience, whose familial bond has been greatly damaged by past trauma. The game is an intense role-playing experience about navigating the raw pain of loss and fractured relationships but ultimately about coming to terms with tragedy.</p>

<p>The last MS Edizioni release being distributed by Ares Games is <em>Last Resort</em>. It is a cooperative RPG set on a tropical island during a zombie apocalypse. Players must work together if they want to stay alive at this resort.</p>

<p>The three RPGs produced by Nigredo Press are system-agnostic experiences aimed at enthusiasts with an emphasis on visual impact and novel gameplay ideas.</p>

It is an investigative RPG packed with Lovecraftian horror and pulp-storytelling. It even allows players to create their own unique endings by piecing together Clues. In an industry packed with other Lovecraft RPGs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/call-of-cthulhu-arkham-review-supplemental-strangeness" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Call of Cthulhu</em></a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Arkham Horror RPG</em></a>, that novelty is notable..</p>

<p>The second book, <em>Flail Kult</em>, is an artbook featuring the work of Arcane Throne. It is a collection of black-and-white illustrations of brutal mythology with spiked weapons.and the endless cycle of time.</p>

<p>Last but not least is <em>Forsaken Scriptures</em>. It is a collection of minimalist word-maps designed for Mork Borg and other fantasy RPGs. It condenses the text visuals of whole dungeons into single images for easy no-prep adventures.</p>

<p>At time of writing, there is no concrete release date for these books.</p>
