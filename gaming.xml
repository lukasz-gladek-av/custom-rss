I'd never even heard of G-Mode's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/kuukiyomi_consider_it">Kuukiyomi</a> series before - not once have I ever had it mentioned to me. <em>[Tsk tsk, PJ - you need to catch up on the lovely <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/community-22-switch-games-we-missed-as-recommended-by-you">reader recommendations on nintendolife.com</a>! - Ed.]</em></p>
<p>And I'm puzzled, because judging by the official description of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kuukiyomi-4-consider-it-nintendo-switch-2-edition">KUUKIYOMI 4: Consider It</a> — now that my attention has finally been drawn to it by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nintendaan.com/post/3lznclu5nk222">Daan Koopman</a> and the positive social media reaction you can see below! — it seems like something I was destined to play. It's right up my silly little street, this stuff.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zrkgqw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>The premise here is that you assume the role of an innocent young child, reverting back to a state of mental purity, before being placed into situations where you need to make a call. The game puts it better, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Consider It with innocence while looking back on various events that everyone must have experienced in their childhood.<br>
The basic rule of deciding what to do in situations by moving the red object on the screen is the same. Please consider the situation and read the atmosphere according to the various scenes that will be asked.<br>
A total of 100 situations will be asked. After playing all the questions, your "ability to read the atmosphere” will be diagnosed."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've always felt like I needed a diagnosis for that.</p>
<p>Kuukiyomi 4: Consider It then puts you in the sorts of uncomfortable situations that have me howling with laughter, whilst also having a great time making digs at Switch 2 for being hard to find in stores. As you can see in the video above, it specifically references the lottery system Nintendo is running in Japan: <em>"Can you put that console away? It's too blinding to someone like me, who didn't win one."</em></p>
<p>It also utilises the console's features (whilst talking about them in-game), so you get some new mouse and motion-controlled fun and some stuff that wasn't in the Switch 1 version, including five minigames that involve <em>two</em> Joy-Con in Mouse Mode.</p>
<p>Now, the science bit. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Kuukiyomi 4 currently has a 30% discount on the eShop, putting it at £8.04 (or whatever that equates to where you are). And if you bought the Switch 1 version, there's an upgrade pack available for that, also discounted to £3.59 at the time of writing.</p>

<p>So yeah, I'm 100% diving in this weekend to see just how funny it is!</p>

            <p>Amid a consumer boycott of their Xbox business, Microsoft are apparently ending the Israeli military's access to certain Azure cloud and generative AI technologies used to surveil Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. As reported by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/microsoft-blocks-israels-use-of-its-technology-in-mass-surveillance-of-palestinians">Guardian</a>, one of the publications who originally exposed the surveillance project, the company told Israeli officials last week that spy agency Unit 8200 had violated Microsoft's terms of service by storing records of civilian phone calls and other data on Azure servers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Microsoft's vice-chair and president Brad Smith allegedly informed staff of the termination of the Unit 8200 partnership in an email sent on Thursday 18th September, shared with the Guardian. In that email, he said that Microsoft had "ceased and disabled a set of services to a unit within the Israel ministry of defense", including cloud storage and AI services. "We do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians," the email continues. "We have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades."</p>
<p>The Guardian also cite another email from a senior Microsoft executive to Israel's ministry of defence, sent late last week, in which the executive noted that "[w]hile our review is ongoing, we have at this juncture identified evidence that supports elements of the Guardian's reporting."</p>
<p>Microsoft confirmed that they had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">supplied technology and services to the Israeli military</a> during the latter's current Gaza offensive this May, following an investigation of the alleged use of Microsoft genAI models to facilitate airstrikes, among other operations. </p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In August this year, a joint investigation by the Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call found that Microsoft had worked with Unit 8200 specifically to create an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-equipped-israels-indiscriminate-palestinian-surveillance-operation-with-azure-cloud-tech-claims-report">"indiscriminate new system"</a> for gathering data on Palestinians, including a sizeable pool of non-combatants. For context, according to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/aug/21/revealed-israeli-militarys-own-data-indicates-civilian-death-rate-of-83-in-gaza-war">alleged leaked Israeli military intelligence</a>, around 83% of the tens of thousands of Palestinians reported killed in the current conflict's first 19 months were civilians. </p>
<p>The reporting inspired the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions organisation to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">launch a campaign against Microsoft's gaming business</a>. Microsoft workers have been openly protesting against their employer's involvement with the assault on Gaza since early 2024.</p>
<p>Back in May, Microsoft insisted that they had found "no evidence" that their technology was being used to target or harm Palestinians, following a review carried out by an unnamed third party. In August, a spokesperson announced that they would carry out another review, while insisting that "[a]t no time during this engagement has Microsoft been aware of the surveillance of civilians or collection of their cellphone conversations using Microsoft's services, including through the external review it commissioned."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The Guardian claim that as much as 8000 terabytes of intercepted calls were being held in Azure datacentres in the Netherlands as part of the Microsoft/Unit 8200 partnership. The paper adds that Unit 8200 appear to have swiftly moved the data elsewhere in the wake of their reporting. Israel now allegedly plan to transfer it all to Amazon's Web Services cloud platform - neither Amazon nor the Israel Defense Forces have responded to the Guardian's request for comment.</p><p>The reported partial divestment from Israel doesn't reveal which "elements" of the Guardian's reporting Microsoft have corroborated as part of their review. Microsoft continue to have a wider commercial relationship with the Israeli armed forces. They are also far from the only big overseas technology company to have significant dealings with Israel's military, before and during the current invasion and destruction of Gaza - <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2025/as-israel-uses-u-s-made-ai-models-in-war-concerns-arise-about-techs-role-in-who-lives-and-who-dies/">an Associated Press investigation in February</a> also mentions Google, Amazon, Palantir, Cisco, and Oracle. A UN special rapporteur has accused western tech firms at large as being complicit in an "economy of genocide".</p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">interviewed a number of developers</a>, including former Microsoft worker Abdo Mohamed, about their participation in No Azure for Apartheid and the BDS action against Microsoft.</p>

			<p>Resident Evil Requiem looks better than most expected on Nintendo Switch 2, judging from new footage captured during this year's Tokyo Game Show.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53319">a new TGS hands-on report from Famitsu</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the next entry in the series is available for testing in handheld mode alongside the PlayStation 5 version. While it is the same demo that CAPCOM brought to Gamescom, which, in my opinion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">managed to be impressively haunting even in a far from optimal testing environment</a>, it being available on Nintendo Switch 2 has allowed the Famitsu reporter to quickly compare the two and highlight how playing the game on the Nintendo system in handheld mode doesn't dimish the experience in any significant way.</p>



<p>Besides Famitsu, others such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@shacknews">Shacknews</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@coelhonojapao">Coelho no Japão</a> tried Resident Evil Requiem on Nintendo Switch 2 during this year's Tokyo Game Show, sharing off-screen footage on YouTube. While a precise comparison with footage captured on other versions of the game is not possible at the moment, the Nintendo Switch 2 version already seems to be in an excellent spot, as some details, such as the hair rendering, seem to be better than what was shown in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-with-new-trailer/">Switch 2 version announcement trailer.</a> </p>



<p>In addition, the footage suggests the game is running at higher than 30 FPS in different scenarios, although drops are evident in some instances. As such, there's a good chance the game could be running at an unlocked framerate, which would not be the first time for <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-ps5-vs-xbox-series/">a game powered by the RE Engine that cannot run at a steady 60 FPS</a>. Considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-ray-tracing/">Resident Evil Requiem supports ray tracing in some capacity on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, even just having the game run at 30 FPS with ray tracing on the system is still rather impressive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It took them long enough, but Microsoft has finally confirmed the pricing for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rog-xbox-ally-x">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> and ROG Xbox Ally, just a few weeks ahead of the handheld’s launch on 16th October.</p>
<p>The two models are priced as follows:</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>ROG Xbox Ally X</strong>: Available for $999.99, €899.99, and £799.99</li>
<li><strong>ROG Xbox Ally</strong>: Available for $599.99, €599.99 and £499.99</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s some slightly muddled pricing, no doubt thanks to the very muddled situation with imports and tariffs in the US right now. What’s quite baffling is that while the base model equates $1 to €1, the higher-powered Ally X makes $1 equal to €0.90. Pricing hardware between regions is difficult at the best of times, but this definitely makes the base Ally a bit less appealing in Europe.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X have been developed in partnership between Xbox and Asus, a successor to Asus’ first effort, the 2023 ROG Ally, but with a newer chipset, Xbox branding, and with Microsoft building bespoke gaming features into Windows 11 for this and other PC gaming handhelds.</p>
<p>Sharing the same form factor with proper handgrips and a 7″ 1080p screen, there’s internal difference, but they’ve got some pretty impressive specs under the hood. Both have AMD processors, with the Xbox Ally toting an AMD Ryzen Z2 A Processor, which combines Zen 2 CPU cores and RDNA 2 GPU architecture with 16GB of RAM and a 512GD SSD. The Xbox Ally X meanwhile has a Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor which leaps ahead to newer architectures with three Zen 5 cores and five more lower-powered Zen 5c cores, paired with RDNA 3.5 GPU architecture, a massive 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally has architectural basis similar to the Xbox Series X|S consoles, but with different CPU and GPU core counts roughly half of what is found in the Series S. The Ryzen Z2 A is actually using older architecture than the outgoing Ryzen Z1 (which was used in the original ROG Ally), though with a different balance in core counts such that the GPU should be better. The Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme of the ROG Xbox Ally X is also rebalanced in core configuration versus the Ryzen Z1 Extreme, but crucially has both a neural engine that could be used for FSR upscaling, and more GPU compute units for improved baseline graphics performance.</p>
<p>All of which is to say, we eagerly await benchmarks and comparisons to see how these two consoles compare, both to each other, to other handhelds, and to Series S.</p>

            <p>Microsoft has finally revealed the price of its ROG Xbox Ally handheld, and it's more expensive than an Xbox Series X.</p>
<p>Launching globally on 16th October, the handheld (much like its home console siblings) comes in two flavours:</p>
<ul>
<li>ROG Xbox Ally X (£799) - comes with 24GB RAM and 1TB storage</li>
<li>ROG Xbox Ally (£499) - comes with 16GB RAM and 512GB storage</li>
</ul>

<p>For comparison, an Xbox Series X currently costs £499.99 for its disc drive edition with 1TB of storage. The all-digital Series S costs £299.99 for its 512GB edition.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally is in direct competition with Valve's Steam Deck, offering a handheld device that merges Xbox and PC capabilities.</p>
<p>While its user interface is inspired by the Xbox console, it has controller-like grips, and there's a dedicated Xbox button offering a Game Bar overlay, the device also offers an aggregated gaming library across Xbox and other leading PC stores like Steam.</p>
<p>It also offers both Cloud Play to stream your games, and Remote Play to play games from your console.</p>
<p>Microsoft even offers a Handheld Compatibility Programme to indicate which games play well on handheld, just like Valve's Steam Deck Verified system.</p>
<p>Full details can be found on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/pre-order-rog-xbox-ally-x-and-rog-ally-starting-today/">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>
<p>For further comparison, Valve's Steam Deck costs £479.99 for its 512GB OLED model and £569.00 for its 1TB OLED model. The Ally isn't OLED, but then neither is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> and that has a gorgeous screen.</p>
<p>The handheld's release is all part of Xbox's Play Anywhere campaign, allowing players access to its games wherever they are and across a range of devices.</p>
<p>There's no denying, though, that this comes at a hefty cost.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Mario’s final victory is at hand, as Bowser has announced his retirement. Oh wait, it’s not Bowser, the Daimaō of the Koopa Clan? It’s the human Bowser instead?</p>
<p>That’s right, Doug Bowser, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/21/nintendos-reggie-fils-aime-announces-retirement-bowser-becomes-president/">who took over as Nintendo of America President in 2019</a>, has announced his retirement and will step down from the role on 31st December 2025. He led NOA through a surprisingly tricky console launch earlier this year, as Nintendo had to navigate the sudden imposition of tariffs in the US for the Switch 2’s release, but ultimately went on to have a hugely successful launch.</p>


<p>Bowser sadly won’t be succeeded by another Mario namesake, but instead by Devon Pritchard. She’s been with Nintendo since 2006 and is a long-standing member of the NOA leadership team, currently holding the position of Executive Vice President of Revenue, Marketing and Consumer Experience.</p>
<p>“One of my earliest video game experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong,” said Bowser. “Since that time, all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family. Leading Nintendo of America has been the honor of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we’ve created for consumers.”</p>
<p>“Now, it’s time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself,” Bowser continued. “She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company’s growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights.”</p>

<p>Pritchard said, “I am humbled and excited to take on this new role. Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish. With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo’s legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family.”</p>
<p>So, pour one out for the recurring jokes about Bowser running Nintendo, but we wish Doug Bowser a happy retirement.</p>

            <p>Another day, another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> update aiming to smooth out more of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-the-new-recommended-settings-for-borderlands-4-and-oh-no-they-dont-actually-fix-its-stuttering">performance problems</a> which have plagued the looter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> since launch, especially on PC. Unfortuntely, this latest patch looks to have led to an uptick in stuttering for some players, with Gearbox recommending some shader messing around as a potential fix.
</p>
<p>In fairness to the studio, you can't say they haven't been working hard to get Borderlands 4 running a bit more smoothly since problems in that department became apparent, with this being the third <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-gets-a-new-pc-patch-to-fix-crashes-progression-blockers-and-gpu-related-problems">post-launch patch targeting performance</a> in the past couple of weeks. One of them was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-update-aims-to-improve-stability-for-a-wide-range-of-pcs-but-comes-without-proper-patch-notes">confusingly noteless</a>, but hey.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, this one <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">has notes</a>, and delving into them you'll find a few tweaks to weekly activities being granted top billing before things descend into fix territory. The weekly big encore boss has been swapped to a tougher version of another existing boss and will offer more loot. The weekly wildcard mission's changed and Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine has been moved.
</p>
<p>In terms of fixes, Gearbox cited the rectifying of "various instances of hitching, low FPS, and crashes" as well as "infinite loading screens during crossplay". Characters should also load up faster in menus, and their animations have been updated to match the fixes. Sadly, it seems that the update's actually led some players to experience more performance problems, with Gearbox acknowledging this in a follow-up tweet.</p><p>"Stuttering issues should resolve over time as the shaders continue to compile in the background while playing," they wrote. "If you're still experiencing issues after 15 minutes of continuous play, you can also clear your shader cache via your video card manufacturer's approved method." If problems persist, you'll have to <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/categories/39763360813843">file a support ticket</a>.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>That aside, studio have also made some changes to rewards and progression with this update, plus some minor tweaks to individual vault hunters. On top of that, there's a bit of gear balancing, with the tweaks as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hellwalker: now always spawns with Fire element</li>
<li>Tediore weapons: +10% Damage and +10% magazine size</li>
<li>Order Pistol Lucky Clover (Rocket Reload): increased fire rate</li>
<li>Order Sniper Rifle Fisheye: increased Damage</li>
</ul>
<p>Borderlands 4 creative director Graeme Timmins has <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1971250703239901643">revealed in a tweet</a> that the game's next patch'll be much heavier on the balancing tweaks. "As a note, we had too many Vault Hunter buffs to safely fit into today's big update," he wrote. "Instead, we broke up them into their own balance update that we're targeting to release early next week instead."</p><p>Here's hoping that Gearbox can get their shooty thing running nicely soon, especially since yapping CEO Randy Pitchford thankfully looks to have stopped giving impromptu setup advice on the socials. As for the game itself, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-review">Jasmine Mannan gave it a go for us</a> and generally liked what these four bordered lands had to offer.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Formula Legends Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/formula-legends-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/formula-legends-review.1309539/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">From the makers of Paw Patrol Grand Prix and Gigantosaurus: Dino Kart, comes… Formula Legends, an off-brand, Formula One-inspired arcade racer. Yes, it’s certainly true that developer 3DClouds’ primary output appears to be racing games aimed at an extremely young audience so, on paper, Formula Legends might sound easy to cruise on past for those of you who are no longer eating spaghetti with your hands. However, if you’re a fan of the long and storied history of Formula 1 racing – as well as games like Art of Rally, Circuit Superstars, and Micro Machines – Formula Legends might prove to be a dark horse in the race. This colourful, toy-like arcade racer consistently impresses thanks to its charming and evolving approach to showcasing the many, many eras it represents, although the fun is punctured somewhat by a slightly laggy handling model, some annoyingly uneven AI, and its lack of multiplayer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In case it’s not obvious by its chunky car caricatures and cartoon-adjacent art style, Formula Legends is <em>not</em> here to compete against the likes of Codemasters’ modern F1 series. Those games are mostly for hardcore fans who crave a realistic approach, but also tweakable enough to remain approachable for newcomers and younger players – indeed, that’s one of their real strengths. But where F1 2025 is seeking to be a credible simulation of a current elite sport, like its peers on the football pitch or basketball court, Formula Legends is still very serious about faithfully paying homage to the sport of F1 in a delightfully comprehensive way that older fans can appreciate.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Through Goes Hammerton</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking a greatest hits-style approach to the history of the world’s premier, open-wheel motorsport, Formula Legends boasts a career mode that covers <em>seven decades</em> – stretching all the way back to the ’60s. On top of this, most of these decades are broken up into multiple mini-eras covering the early, mid, and late phases of these periods. The car models, drivers, and the teams they race for are constantly shaken up across each championship. Many of these championships are locked until you complete the one prior to it, but there are entry points in each decade. This feels like a good balance between giving us plenty to unlock, but also the flexibility to hop around the different eras as we choose. You won’t have to chronologically move all the way from the late ’60s to today – through 70-odd years of racing – just to unlock Formula Legends' most modern car and driver combinations. You can do a vintage championship, head into the 2020s, and then jump back to the ’90s if you want to. All the while you’ll be unlocking new content. It’s all very well considered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We ought to note that Formula Legends is completely unaffiliated with real-life F1, so there are no licensed cars or driver names. This kind of thing comes with its own sort of charm, however: Not only does it remind me of the equally unlicensed sports games full of cheeky soundalikes I played in my youth, but part of the fun for me has been discovering the silly aliases 3DClouds has cooked up for its huge timeline of teams and drivers. This means being introduced to the likes of Osvald Pastry, Charlie Lacreme, and Luis Hammerton, and also past drivers like Dave Coulthsoft, Marvin Brubble, and Mike and Malf Shoemaker. Some of them stretch the bounds of a good pun to the point of being a bit too obtuse or confusing – and it could’ve done with one more edit pass from the development team to catch quirks like Alan Jones… I mean, Al John inexplicably migrating from Australia to New Zealand in the 1980s – but it’s cute stuff overall.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[No licensed cars or driver names] means being introduced to the likes of Osvald Pastry, Charlie Lacreme, and Luis Hammerton, and also past drivers like Dave Coulthsoft, Marvin Brubble, and Mike and Malf Shoemaker.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The cars look great, and I like how their squat frames and exaggerated features make them look like the sort of Micro Machines I would’ve climbed over every kid in my class for back in the late ’80s. They sound great too, thanks to the fact that Formula Legends’ engine sounds profoundly change for each era. Well, they don’t <em>all </em>sound great, because the real modern F1 is limp and wheezy compared to the primal screaming present in the age of V10s – but that’s not 3DClouds’ fault. Actually, there’s currently a sound bug that causes the engine noise for the modern cars to sometimes drop out for extended periods. It's a fault I’m sure 3DClouds will seek to fix as soon as feasible, but it’s probably an indictment on today’s V6 turbo-hybrids that I didn’t really miss hearing them that much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spanning so many eras of racing has also compelled 3DClouds to get clever with how it handles the vast differences between old-school racing tracks and their dramatically refurbished incarnations. For this, many tracks have up to three different versions: vintage, classic, and modern. As with the drivers and cars, the tracks are unlicensed – but they each contain enough recognisable nods to famous corners and track segments that there’s no question which ones they’re homages to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I really enjoy how tailored the tracks are to each era. Vintage tracks make liberal use of hay bales as their one and only concession to driver safety, and they’re largely surrounded by quaint countryside, while their modern versions are lined with curbs and wrap around areas that have since become huge, built-up racing precincts. Better yet, while some tracks evolve upon a single recognisable layout – like the circuits for Belgium or Italy (which riff on Spa and Monza, respectively) – others find themselves totally reinvented. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/formula-legends-splitscreen-1758871381343.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Formula Legends' own-brand <strong>Eau Rouge</strong> through the ages. Or maybe that should be 'Faux Rouge'? </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The vintage German circuit is an extensively long track that winds through a forest, mimicking the full Nürburgring Nordschleife that F1 cars used to race on, but the classic and modern German track is a shorter and more conventional GP circuit. Similarly, the classic Australian track has a clearly different layout and aesthetic to the modern track, mirroring the real-world differences between the Adelaide street circuit of the late ’80s/early ’90s and the current circuit in Melbourne’s Albert Park. It’s this kind of attention to detail that tells me that this is not being phoned in. There are even optional visual filters that give vintage races a warmer, old-school film tone and classic races a bright, CRT TV effect to better situate them in the ’80s and ’90s. It’s a really well-curated and crafted career mode, and you can tell the team are firm F1 fans from the commitment to these small details that’s on display.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">10 Terrific F1 Games Throughout the Ages</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Turn Around</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The disappointing part of Formula Legends is that it doesn’t <em>always </em>hold up out on track. There are some circuits where I’m able to get into a pretty good groove – particularly after several laps of the layout to learn the corners. However, there are a few too many other occasions where it’s difficult to find the right rhythm without yawing side to side trying to correct my line coming out of corners. I think the reason behind this is that there’s some odd lag in the steering – like it’s not responsive enough. It makes rapid changes of direction, like chicanes, quite frustrating at times. The change of angle coming a fraction late does take some getting used to. A bit more sharpness to those controls would have been preferable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I like playing Formula Legends from its most distant camera setting (a cockpit camera is included, but it wasn’t my preferred view) because that’s where it reminds me most of Art of Rally (and where I feel it’s at its best; a more top-down view takes the edge off the numbness in the handling model). The difference is, Art of Rally doesn’t have a gaggle of other AI cars to contend with – and it’s Formula Legends’ AI cars that are one of its key weaknesses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s quite annoying how impactful even minor contact with your AI opponents can be. Essentially, any scrape with a car on the outside of you during a corner will completely overrule your steering, causing you to understeer directly into a wall or off track, and even a light touch from behind will cause other cars to immediately slow down dramatically and trap you behind them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The inconsistent AI, which comes in just three settings (easy, normal, and hard) is a significant bugbear, especially since there’s no multiplayer mode in which to race against friends. The main problem is how much their proficiency varies between circuits. On a lot of tracks I found it entirely straightforward to keep the normal AI behind me throughout a race, sometimes pulling out to quite large leads. However, on some tracks (especially Formula Legends’ version of Monaco) they’re supernaturally quicker for no apparent reason. That should be no problem because you can just turn down the difficulty for those tracks, right? Unfortunately not: the difficulty level can’t be adjusted between races during a championship – once it’s set, it’s set for all subsequent races.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Formula Legends would be much improved with an AI system we’re able to adjust with a bit more granularity.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Formula Legends would be much improved with an AI system we’re able to adjust with a bit more granularity. Something like that could help keep the pack closer together, particularly since tyre wear, dynamic weather, and pit stops are all factors in Formula Legends’ racing. Having to think about your pit stop strategy throughout a race is a nice touch, but making those snap decisions to pit (or stay out for one more lap) would be a lot more tense if we could find a way to bring the racing closer on a more regular basis. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Formula Legends is an earnest and consistently charming unlicensed homage to seven decades of F1 racing that’s one part Art of Rally and one part Micro Machines. With tracks, engine notes, and even visual filters that evolve dramatically over the decades, Formula Legends has me thoroughly addicted to exploring and unlocking its many eras of racing, and I was willing to put up with its laggy handling and its frustratingly inconsistent AI racers in order to take it all in.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/formula-legends-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> patch has been released packing a number of important improvements, including a much-requested FOV slider on the console version, various bug fixes and stability improvements. However, it has also bizarrely reduced game stability for some PC players too.</p>
<p>To these newfound performance problems, <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1971285941194195311">the official Borderlands X account</a> has suggested stuttering issues should resolve over time as shaders compile in the background. However, if problems persist after 15-minutes of play, it then recommends clearing your shader cache.</p>
<p>There's a lot of fixes here, some of which are wild. According to the <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">patch notes</a>, continued improvements to stability will be made over time, plus fixes have been made to infinite loading screens, certain achievements unlocking before they should, unowned DLC items appearing in chests or menus, and more.</p>

<p>It's not all fixes though. This update comes with weekly activity changes too. The Weekly Big Encore Boss has switched, as has the Weekly Wildcard missions and Maurice's Black Market Vending Machine location. So if you're still locked into Borderlands 4 there should be some new surprises for you starting today.</p><p>The update comes following a saga of performance related drama surrounding Borderlands 4. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gearbox-releases-borderlands-4-pc-optimisation-guide-following-reports-of-poor-performance">The game launched with significant performance problems</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-pc-hardware-requirements-ask-for-an-rtx-2070-as-a-minimum-but-a-3080-is-recommended">had quite lofty minimum recommended PC specs</a>. Gearbox CEO stood by the game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-is-pretty-damn-optimal-randy-pitchford-responds-to-borderlands-4-pc-performance-complaints">stated it was "pretty damn optimal"</a>, later advising unhappy players to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/randy-pitchford-advises-borderlands-4-players-to-get-a-refund-if-theyre-not-happy-with-it-as-social-media-tirade-defending-pc-performance-continues">refund Borderlands 4if they were unhappy with the game</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-switch-2-version-has-been-delayed-with-no-new-release-date-in-sight">the Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 was indefinitely delayed</a> too, so it's been a rough start for the sci-fi shooter. Still, the game is proving popular among its playerbase and has a lot to offer those able to push past technical hurdles. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-review">The Eurogamer review notes</a>: "There was rarely a moment playing Borderlands 4 where I didn't enjoy some part of it. But there was rarely a moment where elements of it didn't frustrate me, either."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> president Doug Bowser is set to retire at the end of the year, and will be succeeded by the company's first female president.</p>
<p>Bowser followed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/reggie-fils-aime">Reggie Fils-Aimé</a> as president in 2019, and has spent over a decade in multiple leadership positions. His time as president has covered the majority of the Switch's life, and the recent launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and will end on 31st December 2025.</p>
<p>Devon Pritchard will take over as president, following 19 years in the industry. She is already a long-standing member of the NOA leadership team, currently serving as executive vice president of revenue.</p>

<p>In addition to this change, Satoru Shibata will join NOA as chief executive officer. Shibata was previously president of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-europe">Nintendo of Europe</a> from 2000 - 2018, and was most recently general manager of the marketing division at NOA. He's also outside director of The Pokémon Company.</p><p>"One of my earliest video game experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong," said Bowser. "Since that time, all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family. Leading Nintendo of America has been the honour of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we've created for consumers.</p>
<p>"Now, it's time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself," he continued. "She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company's growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights."</p>
<p>Pritchard said she is "humbled and excited to take on this new role". "Doug has been a fantastic mentor," she continued, "and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish. With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo's legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family."</p>
<p>Nintendo's Japanese president Shuntaro Furukawa added: "During his tenure, Doug made numerous contributions to bring smiles to the faces of people connected to Nintendo. I would like to express my gratitude for his strong efforts. Devon, who will become the next president, has also made many contributions to Nintendo over the years. I am confident that, like Doug, Devon will continue to support Nintendo’s important mission of creating smiles."</p>

                <p>In 2015, developers Pilgrim Adventures and GrabTheGames Studios released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-deed/" data-ref-id="5000-450997">The Deed</a>, an adventure-RPG that upended the traditional structure of mystery stories. This week, The Deed is available on Steam for free for a limited time, but only if you grab it quickly.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2P0BdvGoUo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O2P0BdvGoUo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>From now until Saturday, September 27 at 10 am, The Deed is free to all users on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/420740/The_Deed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The best way to describe the premise is to invoke the board game Clue. Except this time, you're not out to find the killer because your character is the murderer, and the goal of the game is to get away with the crime. </p><p>Players assume control of Arran Bruce, a man who believes that he's the rightful heir to his family's ancestral home, Dunshiel House. Arran's father disagrees, and has cut him out of the will in favor of Arran's younger sister. For Arran, the solution is simple: His sister needs to die. How she dies is up to you as the player. </p><p>There are ten possible murder weapons, including a rope, a candlestick, and rat poison. Your weapon of choice also informs your decision about who to frame for the crime. Household servants and other members of Arran's family could be the prime suspects, if you play cards right and convincingly leave enough evidence. </p><p>Once Arran's sister is dead and a fall guy or girl is selected, there's one last task. The police send an inspector to investigate the crime and interrogate Arran. If players can't keep their stories together, they might be Columbo-ed and wind up in prison. There are multiple endings and not all of them positive for Arran. </p><p>While The Deed is only available for free this week, GameSpot has assembled our picks for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-free-steam-games/2900-5335/" data-ref-id="2900-5335">the best free Steam games</a>, which you can grab right now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Remedy's first online cooperative multiplayer game, FBC: Firebreak, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-admits-disappointing-sales-fbc-firebreak-control-sold-5-million/">did not perform as well as the Finnish studio had hoped</a>. However, Remedy has not given up. The studio has a plan to improve the game in key areas, starting with the first major free update, Breakpoint, scheduled to go live on Monday, September 29.</p>



<p>Breakpoint adds a new playable Crisis mission, Outbreak, set in the Research Sector, where a Mold infestation creates unique challenges and enemies, as well as a dangerous new condition. The developer also overhauled the old Job Board with a Crisis Board, offering curated crises to play that are refreshed every half hour. Four to six Crises will be active at any given time, ranging from full runs to shorter Jobs or Corrupted Jobs.</p>



<p>Each Crisis has randomized rewards, objectives, and length. Crises in the first two zones have been tweaked with streamlined requirements and can occasionally feature unique Alternative Objectives for added variety. Additionally, the Quick Reinforce feature lets you jump into active runs to assist other groups.</p>



<p>Following this update, every weapon and piece of equipment in FBC: Firebreak is fully powered the moment you unlock it. New gear is unlocked simply by playing and leveling up, while a smaller set of streamlined currencies now focuses on unlocking cosmetics and Perk upgrades. On the other hand, Remedy introduced a new progression layer with gun mods, of which there will be 27. </p>



<p>Breakpoint also introduces three brand new heavy weapons (Semi-automatic rifle, Scattergun, and Rotary cannon) and three new grenades (Freeze, Healing, and Black Rock). Remedy even increased the enemy variety with five new types: two Mold foes (Mold Walker and Mold Turret) and three new Hiss threats with variants: the Corrupted Ranger, the Corrupted Ranger (Airborne), and the Demolition Expert. The new Hiss threats can be encountered throughout the whole game, while the Mold foes are exclusive to the new Outbreak Crisis.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There's also going to be a new tutorial level, orientation videos, and a redesigned early-game flow to make it more accessible to newcomers. Lastly, there's a series of quality-of-life improvements, such as already unlocked Altered Augments and Improvised Devices from level 1. Augments and Devices have been tuned to be usable more often than before and will also have a more substantial impact while playing. Additionally, moving while downed and sliding have been added.</p>



<p>Breakpoint is just the beginning. The next major update, which will include a new game mode and cross-platform voice chat, will be released in late November. A third patch will go live in March 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hotel Barcelona Review - Room for Improvement]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hotel-barcelona-review-room-for-improvement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hotel-barcelona-review-room-for-improvement.1309506/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>is a collaboration between legendary auteur developers Suda51 and SWERY, and when I heard about it, I had to double-check that the two had never worked together before.</p>

<p>After all, their styles feel entirely complementary; Suda51's stylish, totally unselfconscious weirdness seems like the ideal partner for SWERY's maverick disregard for established development norms. That's probably what led to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suda51-and-swery65-team-up-for-indie-horror-game" rel="nofollow">the 2019 announcement</a> that they'd be working together.</p>

<p>On first glance,&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>seems like it's going to tick both of those boxes pretty nicely. It's an action roguelite in which you play a lady who's possessed by a dead serial killer, and together, you must hack your way through a series of themed levels taking heavy inspiration from classic horror movies.</p>

<p>What follows is probably pretty much exactly what you should expect from a Suda51 and SWERY collaboration, and while that can sometimes play to&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>'s advantage, many of the flaws of the two developers are in full effect here as well.</p>

<h2><em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>Sure Is Weird, but That's Not Quite Enough</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hotel-barcelona-review-eve.jpg?itok=UfuvP0OB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hotel-barcelona-review-eve.jpg?itok=P0Oh1nDh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As if it wasn't already obvious, this is a Suda51 game.</figcaption></figure><p>The division of labor in&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>runs thus: Suda51 contributes the overall world and concept, and SWERY serves as the gameplay designer, so this is really SWERY's baby wearing one of Suda51's characteristically zany hats.</p>

<p>Narratively speaking, however,&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>has plenty to satisfy fans of both Suda and SWERY. As you make your way through&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>'s levels, you'll learn more about the hotel's history, its inhabitants, and even protagonist Justine's relationship with the serial killer Dr. Carnival.</p>

<p>Despite the oddness on display, the story here is grounded enough to follow, and I enjoyed the exchanges between Justine and Dr. Carnival, as well as the bizarre normality of some of the hotel's most prominent employees and guests.</p>

<p>It's a shame, then, that the narrative doesn't have much to offer beyond its initial thrills. We're a long way from the insane head trip of <i>Killer7&nbsp;</i>or the&nbsp;<em>Twin Peaks</em>-inspired rollercoaster of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/deadly-premonition" rel="nofollow"><em>Deadly Premonition</em></a>, let alone the sheep-riding rural thrills of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/good-life" rel="nofollow"><em>The Good Life</em></a>.</p>

<p>All of the crazy twists you might expect if you've played past efforts by the two star names here just feel absent from&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>, and what few surprises there are feel underdeveloped. By the time the story ends, it feels like&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>is as bored with its premise as I was by then.</p>

<p>There are a couple of late-stage moments that recall back the offbeat, effervescent promise of the premise, but by and large,&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>&nbsp;feels far too rote for its strange, off-kilter ideas to support.</p>

<h2>Combat in&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>Feels Janky and Stiff</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hotel-barcelona-review-slashing.jpg?itok=bd2qEcm- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hotel-barcelona-review-slashing.jpg?itok=JLhYYQb0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hotel Barcelona</em>'s combat isn't its selling point.</figcaption></figure><p>This being an action roguelite with a heavy hack-and-slash emphasis, perhaps the story's flaws can be forgiven if the gameplay is fun. I'll admit to a strange "one more run"-style compulsion every time I failed or completed a run in&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>, but I don't think that's because the gameplay is good, per se.</p>

<p>Each of&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>'s levels consists of a semi-linear sequence of platforming and combat challenges, with a variety of doors waiting at the end to offer different bonuses depending on which one you enter.</p>

<p>Right off the bat, there's a lack of weight and catharsis to the combat here that proves pretty much fatal.&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>is plenty gory; limbs and heads fly off with gleeful abandon, and a single mighty swing of an axe can easily take out four or five foes at once.</p>

<p>The problem is that the swings don't actually feel mighty. Hitting enemies feels weedy and unsatisfying, and while there's a heft to the parry that threatens to add some oomph, subsequent combos and advantage attacks just feel like depleting a health bar.</p>

<p>That issue extends to the boss battles, too. Each of&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>'s stages has a boss for you to fight at its conclusion, and while none of them are overly difficult, actually fighting them on a moment-to-moment level doesn't feel like much fun.</p>

<p>Platforming here is mercifully rare and brief, but when it does occur, it's...fine, I suppose, with the exception of the shark-infested bonus stage. That's an absolute exercise in rage-inducing frustration that I would strongly recommend against bothering with.</p>

<h2><em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>Is Undeniably Creative</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hotel-barcelona-review-jacob.jpg?itok=R2HQbn4N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hotel-barcelona-review-jacob.jpg?itok=DJH1CdkF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Boss battles are a highlight in&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>, but the references aren't exactly subtle.</figcaption></figure><p>It's a shame, because the stages and bosses on display in&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>are a lot of fun conceptually. Since they're based on classic horror properties, it's a hoot spotting the (admittedly rather obvious) references, and the bosses have that classic Suda51 mixture of comedy and splatter-style gore as well.</p>

<p>The employees and residents of the hotel are also a fun bunch to interact with, as are some of the other NPCs you'll meet outside of the liminal rooms and corridors of the hotel proper. Their non sequitur-style conversations are a joy to sit through.</p>

<p>Each boss battle also feels markedly different from the previous one, and they all call on different skills. There are a bevy of fun secrets to discover, and stages manage to pepper interesting new enemy types throughout, keeping things interesting.</p>

<p>It's heartbreaking that&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>'s core combat and game feel are so mediocre, because with some extra polish and jank removal, this could be something truly special.&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>'s gameplay feels like it does a disservice to its world.</p>

<p>In many ways,&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>shares a lot in common with Suda51's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-review-seventh-gen-all-stars" rel="nofollow"><em>Shadows of the Damned</em></a>; its world is full of life and flavor, but its gameplay is stiff and awkward, letting down the whole package.</p>

<h2><em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hotel-barcelona-review-laboratory.jpg?itok=D9WYZFN6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hotel-barcelona-review-laboratory.jpg?itok=ibaKkTcP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>has plenty of weirdness, but it's just plain not a ton of fun, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>Think very carefully before making a reservation at&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>. It's got plenty of both Suda51 and SWERY's signature style on offer, and if you unconditionally love what one or the other brings to the table, you'll probably find something here to like.</p>

<p>If, however, you're looking for an action roguelite to sate your hack-and-slash bloodlust and you don't have much tolerance for jank, it's entirely safe to look for alternative accommodation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>When talking about video games, there’s no place in the world more powerful, more creative, more magical than Japan. The glistening waters of the Tokyo Bay nestle up against looming grey skyscrapers, while vibrant green trees nestle in between. Tokyo is a microcosm of the country itself, the old and the new brushing up next to each other, while nature cradles them both. Lots of the countries I visit feel hard – places born from industry and commerce often are – but the softer edges of Japan’s scenery and history make it all the more inviting, even as I’m shunning the wonders outside for the latest digital wonders inside the Tokyo Game Show 2025</p>
<p>Not immediately though. The entrance to the Makuhari Messe sees us snaking out and around the building, in one of the most orderly and good-natured games expo queues you’ve ever seen. Admittedly, this is the opening of the first business day, so it’s only press, devs and corporate types, but compared to the scrum at Gamescom, it’s thoroughly genteel.</p>

		
		

<p>That’s soon forgotten as the barrage of noise and neon lighting inside is only amplified by the corridor of tote bags, posters, fans and other paraphernalia as you walk into the Messe. It is actually in Chiba and isn’t quite in Tokyo, if we’re being honest, but let’s forget that for now. Lots of shows like to lather you up with the odd bit of tat, but the free stuff is out in force here, with many of the multitude of booths offering you a collectable prize for taking part or completing a section of their game. Am I going to play Professor Layton in Japanese in order to get a keyring? Yes. Yes, I am.</p>
<p>It says something that the first game I’ve played today had me hooked up to an electric shock machine. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/let-it-die-inferno-is-a-brand-new-full-price-entry-in-the-roguelike-series/">Let It Die: Inferno</a> might not have actually killed me, but the extensive health form I had to fill out before taking part did make me question how smart I was for playing a game that’s hooked up to the electrical grid. I don’t have a pacemaker though, and if we’re being honest, I’m not that smart, so let’s carry on with the game-based torture. Getting hit here didn’t just cost HP, it cost the seat of my pants, and if you took damage… well, you took actual damage. I don’t think a game has ever taught me to be careful and block quite so quickly, though, so perhaps this is the future?</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Let it Die: Inferno - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMwZTM3dJMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s fair to say that even if I was here for a month, I wouldn’t be able to play everything at this show. The number of booths, the number of games, has eclipsed anything I’ve seen before at Gamescom, GDC or EGX, and I can’t quite reason out the fact that today is a business-to-business day, so should in theory be quieter. The 30-degree heat outside slowly creeps in through the doors, and into the afternoon, the Makuhari Messe turns into a sweatbox, fuelled by the bodies of thousands of people and thousands of PCs pumping out heat. It’s still a lot of fun.</p>

<p>There’s a great deal of queueing though, and I can only guess that the visiting as part of the general public would only let you see one or two major games. The most popular ones here today – those on Sony’s booth or one or two of the biggest publishers – are shut closed by midday, filling their quota without a thought, and giving the lucky few a chance to lord it over their friends with tales of Resident Evil Requiem and Ghost of Yotei before release.</p>
<p>It’s always an odd thing to play games at a show. Just enough to titillate and build your excitement and just enough to make the remaining time until it launches utterly excruciating. For the first time in a while, a number of the titles on the TGS show floor aren’t out until 2026, and that level of separation from your initial trial until they appear almost seems unfair. It’s clear that the public at large don’t seem to feel that – interest for the show is at its height – but this is a show where I simply want to play everything I’ve seen, now. I guess I’ll have to wait like everybody else, and stop acting like a petulant child. That’s harder than you might think.</p>

<p>My highlights on day one have been the bevy of Monster Hunter titles over at the Capcom booth. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-takes-the-series-mythology-in-a-new-and-exciting-direction/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/monster-hunter-outlanders-preview-what-if-this-is-the-best-monster-hunter-of-2025/">Monster Hunter Outlanders</a> are right up my Monster Hunter street, and with Wilds currently losing out to World in our household, it’s clear that we need more Monster Hunter as soon as possible. Besides that, Morbid Metal is fantastic, with its fast-paced Roguelike combat looking and feeling amazing, while Project Motor Racing has me really hoping for a return to form for the spiritual successor to Project Cars.</p>
<p>What’s always nice about game shows is getting to meet up with friends, devs and PR folk – this was the first time I was able to meet our US-based writer Miguel in person! I also enjoyed being fooled by Google maps into thinking everything was ten minutes away from my hotel, but only if I was a car, and I have walked very slowly around most of Chiba today. I can thoroughly recommend the Makuhari Brewery if you’re into craft ale, and I’ve also learned that anime is thoroughly true to life, with the sound of Cicadas ringing out so loudly that I’m glad my hotel isn’t near any trees. On the seafront, I also saw a group of three Japanese students – two boys and a girl – and can only assume that they’re currently fighting demons or travelling through time, as that’s the start of every anime I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>The sun set on the first day of the Tokyo Game Show a while ago – who knew that the other side of the world has a different season going on? – but it’s clear that the Japanese development scene, and the wider development community, still place TGS at the centre of their plans. As day two is close – closer perhaps than it should be – my biggest problem is working out what on earth I’m going to play. If today is anything to go on, we are truly living in a golden age of game development, and there’s a huge number of games that deserve to find an audience. I’ll do my best to find them tomorrow.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starbreeze-admits-mistake-with-new-payday-2-subscription-and-price-increase-of-infamous-collection-dlc-bundle.1309500/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Starbreeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently introduced an optional Payday 2 subscription</a> that automatically includes access to all the many (over 65) DLCs available for the cooperative heist-based first-person shooter game. Subscription options include a monthly and auto-renewing $4.99 fee or a biannual $19.99 fee (discounted by 31% compared to the monthly one).</p>



<p>If players subscribe and subsequently cancel at a later date, they get to retain any progress made (level, money, and inventory). However, any DLC content in their inventory, such as weapons, characters, heists, or masks, will become unavailable. Access can be regained by renewing your subscription or by purchasing the relevant DLC.</p>



<p>However, alongside the introduction of this new subscription model, Starbreeze also reduced the discount on the popular Infamous Collection bundle, which includes all the Payday 2 DLCs released so far, from 52% to 33%. This led to a community outrage that brought recent user reviews on Steam down to 54% (overall reviews are at a healthy 87%), as fans likened it to a scummy move to get people on board with the new subscription option. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PAYDAY 2: Subscription Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1BeTuIJOi8U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a statement <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-dropped-the-ball-starbreeze-admits-it-botched-payday-2-subscription-rollout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to the website Game Developer</a>, Gustav Nisser (Head of Commercial at Starbreeze) admitted the mistake, adding that the Payday 2 Infamous Collection bundle has had its discount restored to 52%.</p>



<p><em>We dropped the ball on coordinating internally and communicating with our community properly. The negative reaction makes complete sense, and the community has made it clear how the price change and its timing looks from the outside. We agree with the community, we messed up on this one, and we have reverted the price on the bundle effective immediately. In hindsight, we should have realized how it would seem. Since the bundle only charges for the items you don't own, and the bundle discount is cumulative with any other discounts (i.e., discounts on the included items), the actual full price of the bundle can vary significantly.</em></p>



<p>Given <span>Payday 3's commercial failure (<a href="https://wccftech.com/remnant-2-sales-2-million/" target="_blank">certified by Embracer</a>, the parent company of game publisher Deep Silver), Starbreeze should exercise</span> a little more care when it comes to its most prized game IP. </p>



<p>The Swedish studio's next project is, however, based on a popular licensed franchise: Dungeons and Dragons. The so-called Project Baxter, an online co-op game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-is-still-in-pre-production-yet-starbreeze-says-its-on-track-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is supposed to launch in 2026</a>.</p>

            <p>After much <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-lock-in-a-release-date-for-their-rog-xbox-ally-handhelds-but-no-price-yet-because-macroeconomics">hemming and hawing</a>, Asus and Microsoft are finally ready to talk pricing on their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-handheld-pcs">handheld PC</a> team-ups, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xboxs-handheld-is-coming-this-year-is-also-really-a-new-asus-rog-ally">ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X</a>. It’s nothing too egregious in the King’s sterling, with the Xbox ROG Ally confirmed at £499.99 and the Xbox ROG Ally X at £799.99 – while hardly chump change, these are pretty standard prices for entry-level and premium portables respectively.</p>
<p>Those in the US, however, will be paying $599.99 for the ROG Xbox Ally and $999.99 for the ROG Xbox Ally X, the latter representing a big increase on Asus’ current <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-x-review">ROG Ally X</a> model.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That, at least, won’t quite make it the most expensive Windows handheld around, as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-review">MSI Claw 8 AI+</a> has also hit (give or take a penny) the one-grand mark in recent months. But still, this looks an awful lot like the effects of US tariff policies, with the added cost of importing Taiwan- and China-made hardware being passed down to aspiring owners. It’s a process Microsoft’s console business will be familiar with, its current generation of lounge-dwelling Xboxes having hiked their prices twice in the past year, with big green fingers pointing at macroeconomic conditions on both occasions.</p>
<p>By contrast, the ROG Xbox Ally X’s UK price merely matches that Asus’ 2024 predecessor, while upgrading its innards with a newer, faster AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme APU. The ROG Xbox Ally, mind, still seems like something of a wildcard. It’s only £21 more than the equivalent 512GB <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a>, and £50 less than the already budget-minded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-review">Lenovo Legion Go S SteamOS</a>. Yet mystery surrounds its own APU, the Ryzen Z2 A, a chip whose four cores and ageing RDNA 2 graphics processor gives it specs largely in line with the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>. If performance is a match as well, then it’ll struggle with the GPU-threshers that are modern 3D games.</p><p>That said, Microsoft and Asus aren’t just banking on framerates. The ROG Xbox Ally duo will be the first Windows 11-powered handhelds to include the operating system’s new, bespoke, Xbox-branding gaming mode, where many of Win11’s extraneous guff remains switched off at launch to preserve speed and batter life. It’ll have a more handheld-friendly UI than standard Windows as well, potentially wiping out a major advantage that SteamOS has always held over its desktop-tuned rival.</p>
<p>I’ll be seeing whether this mode will be worth the money, especially for stateside punters, with a review prior to the handhelds’ October 16th launch date. That’s assuming they’re not partaking in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">ongoing boycott calls</a> against Microsoft for their alleged dealings with the Israeli military, including providing access to Azure cloud storage and AI tools for the purpose of running a mass surveillance programme against Palestinians. Microsoft have, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/microsoft-blocks-israels-use-of-its-technology-in-mass-surveillance-of-palestinians">reportedly</a>, since revoked this access.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlaytonicGames/status/1971200015541457309">post on social media</a>, the developer mentioned how the team had "limited time" with Switch 2 dev kits ahead of the game's October launch, and this decision was made to ensure the "best possible looking and seamless version of the game" is available at launch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<em>To provide players the best possible looking and seamless version of the game, Yooka-Replaylee will be running at a consistent 30fps on Nintendo Switch 2 both in handheld and docked mode.</em> Due to limited time with the development kits, we're investigating the possibility of implementing a performance mode to follow some time post launch."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for a Switch 2 demo, there's nothing planned ahead of the launch, but there is apparently something in the works for post-launch.</p>
<p>Playtonic's limited time with Switch 2 development kits isn't an isolated issue, with many third-party and indie teams citing how these kits have been in short supply.</p>
<p>Yooka-Replaylee is releasing for Switch 2 on 9th October 2025 and will be available as a digital and physical purchase.</p>

<p>It's been previously noted how this title was lacking modes and certain features, and it seems this latest update has improved the overall experience. For starters, it's now possible to play local wireless games (supporting up to 8 players), and apart from this, there are some handy updates to the game's 'Online' mode and fixes to go with it.</p>
<p>As usual, here's the full rundown courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p><div><figure data-videoid="epMKq3hLRsg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f18d0rnqhgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<h2>Drag X Drive - Version 1.1.0 (25th September, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>General Updates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s now possible to play local wireless games.
<ul>
<li>Select Local wireless park from the Mode tab of the X Menu to play.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The game will now display play history.
<ul>

</li>
<li>The game will now display player levels, which increase by gaining XP.
<ul>

<li>It is not used in matchmaking for public parks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is now possible to select either Set as Blue or Blue/Red for Your Team Color.
<ul>
<li>Select Settings on the Help tab of the X Menu, then select Display Options to make this choice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adjusted certain depictions, including the game-start animations, lighting within parks, and the time the lights are lit up when at top speed.</li>
<li>The game will now display version information.
<ul>
<li>Select the Help tab of the X Menu to view it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Online</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to join the wait list when the public park or friend park your friend is in is full.
<ul>
<li>You can join the wait list from the list found under Friend park on the Mode tab of the X Menu.</li>
<li>If you select your friend when the park that friend is in is full, you will automatically attempt to connect next time a spot opens up in that park.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you are in a public park, selecting public park again will now prioritize selection of another public park.</li>
<li>Made adjustments to increase the chances of 3-on-3 games in public parks.</li>
<li>Changed the game start position for 2-on-2 games in public parks.</li>
<li>The game will now display the score when using the spectator camera.</li>
<li>Like offline bots, online bots will now pass to players when they raise their hands or use the “Hey” reaction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes no record is made under Search for Users You’ve Played With.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the game would sometimes crash when starting up the game or heading to a park.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the shot success rate for shots made immediately before landing was based on the position where the shot was made.</li>
</ul>
<p>The success rate for shots is affected by the distance to the hoop (how close the player is to the hoop) and the player’s orientation towards the hoop (how directly the player is facing the hoop).</p>
<p>In order to make it so that bunny-hop shots while approaching did not become excessively advantageous, the intended design was to calculate shot success rate for distance to the hoop based on the last point of contact with the ground (the jumping off point).</p>
<p>However, just for when the player took a shot immediately before landing, the shot success rate was being calculated based on the position where the shot was made, which was not intended, so we have fixed this.</p>
<p>However, there are no changes to the success rate for orientation towards the hoop.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can find out more about this game in our review here on Nintendo Life. If not, here's a quick sample where we said it was a well-made sports game, even with the lack of options and control hurdles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Drag x Drive may lack options with regards to online modes, and its controls take a bit of getting used to. However, if you can give up some time to engaging with this one, if you can get past the barriers in terms of controls and the early frustrations as you find your rhythm, you'll be rewarded with a unique and very well-made sports game that deserves to find an audience of dedicated fans."</p>

<p>According to the game's director Naoki Hamaguchi, Square Enix is planning to release a demo for Nintendo's new system by the end of this year. Speaking to Inverse recently, he mentioned how it should help players who are still "unsure" if this enhanced release is right for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wanted to mention that at the end of the year, a demo is coming out for Switch 2 and Xbox. Players who might still be on the fence or unsure about playing, it’d be great for them to experience."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>He adds how it will also give players the chance to "feel the full specs" of the game on the Switch 2. This demo is once again planned for "the end of the year", so if we hear any formal announcements or updates from Square Enix between now and then, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Last month, Square Enix confirmed this game would run at a "stable 30 frames per second" on the Switch 2, while "offering smooth performance and crisp visuals".</p>

<p>The next entry arrives on Switch 2 in 2026</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo's amiibo series has got a boost in recent times, thanks to games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy</a> package.</p>
<p>Third-party developers such as Capcom have also continued to build the amiibo line. And now, following its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> series, the same company is teasing at least three new amiibo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>.</p>
<p>This game is due out next year on 13th March 2026, so we'll likely see them show up on this date, or at least nearby. This information comes from this year's Tokyo Game Show, with the company displaying these unannounced amiibo at its booth this week (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1npv7fv/tokyo_game_show_mh/">Amiibo News via MonsterHunter subreddit</a>):</p>

<p>Capcom previously released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monster_hunter_stories">Monster Hunter Stories</a> amiibo for the second entry in the series. These were released during the Switch generation and included Ena, Razewing Ratha and Tsukino, and all of them were released alongside the game. There was also a series for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/07/monster_hunter_stories_gets_three_shiny_new_amiibo_figures">original 3DS release</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from this latest amiibo update, Capcom has shared an "extended cut" of the Monster Hunter Stories 3 release date trailer. The launch date was originally shared earlier this month during the Nintendo Direct broadcast. Here's a bit about this new version of the trailer, and you can see it in action at the top of this page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Watch an extended version of the Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Release Date Trailer, featuring a deeper look into the game's story, characters, and world! Plus, get a first look as an electrifying foe emerges from the Forbidden Ground."</p>
