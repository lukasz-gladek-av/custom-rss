			<p>Starship Troopers: Extermination has officially launched on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, a new title that has been developed by Offworld Industries, who are known for producing the 2020 game Squad. The Starship Troopers game is part of the franchise and takes place within the Starship Troopers movie universe. This title was created in collaboration with Sony Pictures Consumer Products and Knights Peak. Now, players will get to dive into a familiar world full of horrifying creatures to fight off in exciting and explosive battles. Starship Troopers: Extermination is a 16-player FPS that has finally escaped from Early Access to be launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and the Epic Games Store, after only previously being available on Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Starship Troopers: Extermination - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9kp46jD26oQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/starship-troopers-extermination-1-0-launches-on-october-11-adding-single-player-mode-and-more/">latest version</a> of the sci-fi title comes with brand-new features, including a solo-play tutorial mode with Casper Van Dien reprising the role of General Rico to accompany you on your journey. This is just chapter one of the solo play tutorial mode, and chapter two of the solo play mode will come in post-launch updates, which help to introduce players to new mechanics in the game.</p>
<p>The Tanker Bug that appears in the game is a direct inspiration from the 1997 movie. This is a new addition, specifically in the 1.0 update, and these Bugs are an armored assault unit in the Arachnid army and are incredibly strong, with the potential to kill you and others on the team in mere seconds. To be able to dispatch it at all, the entire team will need to focus their attention on blasting the Tanker Bug, which is full of holes.</p>
<p>The full-release update of the game also comes with a new ice planet called Boreas, where players will get to explore and kill as many bugs as possible until their hearts are content on an icy cold planet that was hit with a Bug Meteor, which allowed the Arachnid army to set up camp and begin to evolve to survive the extreme winter.</p>
<p>There are other new features in the fully released version of the game, including new Companies, which allow players to build a company of dedicated Troopers, much like General Rico and his Roughnecks. Each Company will enable players to work together on the Galactic Front and complete special Company Operations, which will provide you and the other players in the Company with rewards as well as the power of friendship.</p>
<p>Starship Troopers: Extermination is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268750/Starship_Troopers_Extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S for $49.99.</p>
<p>Will you be diving into the game?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/axis-unseen-heavy-metal-elevates-hunting-experience</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-axis-unseen-review-heavy-metal-elevates-hunting-experience.1007382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/axis-unseen-heavy-metal-elevates-hunting-experience<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Axis Unseen</em>&nbsp;is the first indie project by Nate Purkeypile and his studio Just Purkey Games. A veteran game designer who worked on&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="167cdfe5-ff47-41b1-9613-8e5afb7de3c4" href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-76"><em>Fallout 76</em></a>,&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="50194234-bf65-48d6-8b69-3165aebab8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim"><em>Skyrim</em></a>, and <em>BloodRayne 2</em><em>,&nbsp;</em>he wanted to bring his creative vision to life with a new indie venture. The result was&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>, which blends heavy metal, horror, and hunting. After experiencing the unknown world, I can thoroughly say that <i>The Axis Unseen</i>&nbsp;is a knockout indie entry in gaming.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Experience a New Kind of Hunt in&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em></h2>
<p>The main premise of&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>&nbsp;is you're a hunter following in the footsteps of those who came before you. Hunt down creatures and collect journal entries to learn about hunters and the world around you as you journey toward the Mountain. A world between worlds, this unknown place is not where you originally came from, and the Mountain is the way back to the real world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took me around 25 hours to complete my first playthrough where I gathered all the powers, magic, and arrow types. I played on average difficulty, but you can choose harder ones, even permadeath. Once you make it through the Portal at the top of the Mountain, you can embark on new game+, start a new playthrough, or keep playing the game to earn different achievements.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/axis-unseen-elusive-greenman.jpg?itok=-YUVTab0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/axis-unseen-elusive-greenman.jpg?itok=XaNzRcqz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The creatures you hunt aren't your ordinary deer, quail, or bear, however. They're what legends are often told of. Cryptids and beasts from folklore that somehow slipped into our world from this place. This is where a chunk of the horror present in the game comes into play.</p>
<p>Not only are these creatures startling in appearance, with giant bone growths or lacking skin, but they also make incredibly creepy sounds. There are creatures so large they shake the earth when they walk, while others scream if you get too close to them. Even during the day, these can ambush you with fatal consequences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While your prey may be scary to look at or hear, the world of&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>&nbsp;is filled with giant human skeletons, horned creature skeletons, and an abyss filled with fleshy tissue. Everywhere you look there are bones, altars, and abandoned structures. It sets the scene for all the tension that builds as you hunt, and are hunted, across the regions.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/axis-unseen-giant-skeletons.jpg?itok=RQfJO0bV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/axis-unseen-giant-skeletons.jpg?itok=Cd-udmwd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Heavy Metal Instrumentals&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Throughout the game, the music enhances all encounters. The Forest is melancholic, the Darkness puts you on edge. Like other titles, the music changes as you encounter stronger enemies. What makes it the perfect fit for&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen&nbsp;</em>is the genre of music, metal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it was classical or electronic, the music wouldn't fit as well. It wouldn't enhance all interactions in the game like metal does. Entering a new region brings new music. Combined with creature sounds, new visuals, and potential attacks, it heightens the tension substantially. At one point, the music had amped me up so much that I almost jumped off my chair when I got attacked by a new creature.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/axis-unseen-goatman-huay-chivo.jpg?itok=o1NZPjpd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/axis-unseen-goatman-huay-chivo.jpg?itok=F6Nhl0Te 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The genius behind the heavy metal is&nbsp;Clifford Meyer, a former member of&nbsp;Red Sparowes. His band experience and musical talent allowed him to craft instrumental music that elicits a variety of emotions from triumph to sadness to fury. Without this aspect of&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>, it wouldn't be as fun to play as it currently is.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It's Not All Hunting Trophies</h2>
<p>There are a lot of good things about&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>, but there are a couple of issues with the game as well. While there's an intricate story laced throughout the game, it involves finding the scattered journal pages. This isn't necessarily hard since most are found near Portals, magic altars, or energy hotspots. The real downside is the pages and pages of reading you have to do to learn about the story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I don't mind reading a bit of lore to understand a story. However, it's about 150 pages of reading that you need to go through to get the big picture. On top of having to read a lot of words, you can be attacked while getting through the journal entries. Unless you're sure there are no creatures around, learning lore can be a bottom-of-the-list task.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/axis-unseen-journal-entry-darkness.jpg?itok=sP4_CnxX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/axis-unseen-journal-entry-darkness.jpg?itok=xBTwWXDJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition to large-scale reading, there are some areas you can fall through the map. Don't jump off any ledges, as you may get stuck at the bottom of a cliff and have to end your hunt, sacrificing any unlocked energy you've collected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, an arrow type you're looking for gets skipped over when changing arrows. This can disrupt your timing for explosions, getting in a kill, or being able to see in the dark. This is a minor inconvenience and doesn't happen all the time, but often enough that it should be mentioned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all,&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>&nbsp;is a solid solo game produced by&nbsp;Nate Purkeypile. It combines horror, hunting and shooting, with heavy metal music to carve out a place among competing titles. For players looking for something new, want to experience their favorite music genre in a different way, or just want to check out a great indie title,&nbsp;<em>The Axis Unseen</em>&nbsp;should be on the list.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-disco-elysium-devs-reveal-two-new-studios-and-spiritual-successors.1007379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developers have announced two brand new studios and two spiritual successors to the influential RPG within just a day or so of each other. Feel free to make your own "weird that it happened twice" joke here.</p>
<p>The first new studio to make its announcement (in our running order, not necessarily chronologically) is Dark Math Games, which describes itself as a "breakaway group from the original development team of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>".</p>
<p>The team is based in the UK and boasts a staff of 20, "about half of whom contributed to bringing the critically acclaimed hit&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>...to life", according to a press release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disco-elysium-new-studios-spiritual-successor-xxx-nightshift.jpg?itok=rAR4RCPA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disco-elysium-new-studios-spiritual-successor-xxx-nightshift.jpg?itok=VOxJ99yn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>XXX Nightshift&nbsp;</em>is one of the two&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>spiritual successors revealed today.</figcaption></figure><p>Dark Math's debut game is&nbsp;<em>XXX Nightshift</em>, a slightly questionably-named narrative RPG in which you are "stranded at a luxury ski resort in Antarctica".&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you play, you'll experience "deep single-player role-playing", complete with an "innovative and powerful role-playing system" that "respects your time and trusts your intelligence with seismic choices". Sounds pretty&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>-esque, alright.</p>
<p>Somewhat cheekily, Dark Math also promises&nbsp;<em>XXX Nightshift&nbsp;</em>will bring "a few less words" and "a few more bullets" to the RPG table, resulting in a "lot more fun".&nbsp;It's probably fair to say there was a lot of reading involved in enjoying&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>
<p><em>XXX Nightshift&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date or window yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3261450/XXX_NIGHTSHIFT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam here</a> if you want to follow along with its progress.</p>

<p>Next up on the&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor conveyor belt is Longdue, a new studio that boasts a dozen staff members "including team members that worked on <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disco-elysium">the original</a>&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>and its unreleased sequel".</p>
<p>Longdue is also pulling in talent from the likes of Bungie and Rockstar for its debut title, which it describes as a "psychological RPG" which "explores the delicate interplay between the conscious and subconscious".</p>
<p>Unlike Dark Math's game, Longdue's debut project doesn't have a name yet, but you can keep an eye on its progress by heading over to the studio's <a href="https://www.longduegames.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new official website</a>.</p>
<p>In total, this makes four companies arguably vying for the legacy of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>. As well as the two studios above, there's also Red Info, a studio supposedly founded by ex-<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>leads Robert Kurvitz and Aleksander Rostov, although we haven't heard much about that studio for a while.</p>
<p>Of course, original&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developer ZA/UM is also technically still a going concern, although it did <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs">cancel a project and lay off some of its staff</a> earlier this year. Which of these studios will emerge victorious in the battle for&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s soul? We shall have to wait and see.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/us-video-game-hardware-sales-fell-drastically-in-august-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It looks like people have the game hardware they want or need right now. According to the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l6ahdhuslg2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, US video game hardware sales saw a drastic year-over-year decline in August 2024.</p>



<p>Per the sales data, hardware spending fell from roughly $325 million to $208 million. That’s a 36% drop year-over-year. It was also added that each current-generation console had at least a 34% fall in sales compared to August 2023. The Nintendo Switch had the furthest fall at 41%.</p>







<p>While steep, the drop in sales shouldn’t be surprising. The current-generation Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 consoles are almost four years old, and most players who would buy them already have them. The Nintendo Switch is over seven years old and is set to be replaced, so the near 50% year-over-year fall is somewhat expected.</p>



<p>The PS5 Pro launch should see a jump in sales later this year, but it won’t move the needle all too much with its $700 price point. The holiday shopping season will also see an uptick in sales in some way.</p>



<p>Sticking with cost, money likely plays a large factor in hardware sales. With basic goods and services more expensive now than ever before, spending money on things like video game consoles and other hardware can take a backseat on the priority list. </p>



<p>Also falling in August, but not nearly as much, were accessory sales as they fell 3% to $173 million.</p>



<p>“Growth in the Remote Play Device segment (PlayStation Portal), was offset by a 10% year-on-year decline in Gamepad spending,” Mat Piscatella of Circana said.</p>

She was 90.</p><p>The new was announced by Oyama's agency and circulated on X/Twitter. Oyama had been living in a retirement home since 2016 and reportedly suffered from dementia. She died on September 29.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Nobuyo Ōyama and Noriko Ohara.</p><p>Born 1 year, 11 months, 2 weeks, and 16 days apart, died less than a year, 2 months, 11 weeks, and 2 days apart.</p><p>Close friends until they physically couldn't during their lives anymore.</p><p>Doraemon and Nobita for 25 years straight.</p><p>Rest in peace. <a href="https://t.co/hQ2IYAT4Aq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/hQ2IYAT4Aq</a></p></div>— Daily Pictures of Doramula (R.I.P Nobuyo Ōyama) (@DailyDoramiPics) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyDoramiPics/status/1844660677144654057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Prior to her retirement, Oyama had been best-known for her role as Doraemon, the robotic cat from the future who is often seen as being right up there with Astro Boy as one of the foundational characters of modern anime. Oyama voiced Doraemon for an incredible 2,338 episodes over the course of more than 25 years before finally handing the role to Wasabi Mizuta for a new show that began in 2005. She also had a starring role in the iconic 1970s mecha anime Zambot 3, where she played the hero Jin Kappei.</p><p>After Doraemon, Oyama took on a new role: Monokuma, the villainous mascot of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/danganronpa-trigger-happy-havoc">Danganronpa</a>, a "walking, talking, psychopathic bear." The series developed a devoted cult fanbase in the U.S. and Japan, and Oyama continued in the role for several games before her retirement in 2015.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nobuyo Õyama, the Japanese voice actress for Doraemon in the "Doraemon" (1979) series, has been confirmed to have passed away at 90 years old.<br>She passed away back on September 29th.<br>Rest in peace.

Her personal Arkanoid cabinet has reportedly found a home at Mikado, one of Tokyo's most famous arcades, and Arkanoid has been trending on Japanese social media.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="in" dir="ltr">RIP Nobuo Oyama, pengisi suara Doraemon 🥀 <a href="https://t.co/23APkM64am" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/23APkM64am</a></p>— Ry 🍉 (@ventableu) <a href="https://twitter.com/ventableu/status/1844620691611832690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In the meantime, fans on social media have paid tribute to Oyama with old pictures and videos highlighting her work while thanking her for her contributions to anime over the years.</p><p>"Oyama Nobuyo-san, thank you for lending your voice to one of the most iconic anime characters and making my childhood enjoyable," one fan wrote.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/xbox-plans-to-set-up-shop-in-androids-play-store-if-court-order-holds/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>After a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/judge-orders-google-to-distribute-third-party-app-stores-on-google-play/">US court ruled earlier this week</a> that Google must open its Play Store to allow for third-party app stores and alternative payment options, Microsoft is moving quickly to slide into this slightly ajar door.</p>
<p>Sarah Bond, president of Xbox, <a href="https://x.com/BondSarah_Bond/status/1844506029599707255?t=SrOvyzBRyQLwuWk9wn58hw&amp;s=19">posted on X (formerly Twitter)</a> Thursday evening that the ruling "will allow more choice and flexibility." "Our mission is to allow more players to play on more devices so we are thrilled to share that starting in November, players will be able to play and purchase Xbox games directly from the Xbox App on Android," Bond wrote.</p>
<p>Because the court order requires Google to stop forcing apps to use its own billing system and allow for third-party app stores inside Google Play itself, Microsoft now intends to offer Xbox games directly through its app. Most games will likely not run directly on Android, but a revamped Xbox Android app could also directly stream purchased or subscribed games to Android devices.</p>
<p>Until now, buying Xbox games (or most any game) on a mobile device has typically involved either navigating to a web-based store in a browser—while avoiding attempts by the phone to open a store's official app—or simply using a different device entirely to buy the game, then playing or streaming it on the phone.</p>

The first two were originally released for the PlayStation 1 and Dreamcast, while the third one came out on PlayStation 2. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/04/tomb-raider-the-last-revelation-3">All three</a> are considered <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/04/tomb-raider-the-last-revelation-3">lesser entries</a> by many fans, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/07/10/tomb-raider-angel-of-darkness-review">Angel of Darkness in particular</a> being known for being buggy and unfinished.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here are the official descriptions of all three games.</p><p><strong>Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation (1999)</strong></p><p>Lara Croft uncovers the lost tomb of the Egyptian God Set, unwittingly unleashing him and fulfilling an ancient prophecy—one that plunges mankind into darkness. Pursued at every turn by her arch-rival, the unscrupulous archaeologist Werner Von Croy, Lara embarks on a journeyof discovery across Egypt, where she must overcome the most ingenious puzzles and infernal traps ever devised while facing terrifying evil from beyond the grave.</p><p><strong>Tomb Raider: Chronicles (2000)</strong></p><p>Following the events of The Last Revelation, Lara Croft is buried in an Egyptian tomb and presumed dead.

They follow in the footsteps of the Tomb Raider I - III Remastered Collection released earlier this year, which were developed in part by a fan who had previously been working on remakes of the original games.</p><p>We wrote in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered-vs-rtx-remix-performance-review">our tech review</a>, "The very small and largely independent team that built Tomb Raider I-III Remastered have clear passion and skills for the legacy of Lara Croft. The enhancements offered are great and much better than, for example, the recent <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1">Konami Metal Gear Solid Collection</a>. High frame rates, dual new and old modes, all of the expansion packs, improved graphics and controls alongside fast swapping across all 3 titles and DLC from the main menu are welcome."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/tr-100-million-1728595236292.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Tomb Raider has officially reached 100 million games sold.</figcaption></figure></output><p>In the midst of announcing the remaster, Crystal Dynamics also revealed that Tomb Raider has hit a notable milestone, having officially sold 100 million units over its lifetime. An official statement celebrating the accomplishment said, "We’re so honored to share a huge milestone for Tomb Raider – we have officially reached over 100 million games sold across the franchise! This is a momentous accomplishment that few video game franchises ever achieve." </p><p>We owe our thanks to you, the fans, as well as to all the passionate developers and artists whose talent and imagination have given us so many stories and experiences to share together for nearly three decades. We’re extremely grateful for the Tomb Raider community’s collective spirit of adventure, and we look forward to all the journeys still to come as Lara Croft and Tomb Raider continue to reach new heights."</p><p>Tomb Raider I - III Remastered was released on February 14, 2024, and Tomb Raider IV - VI Remastered will follow exactly one year later on February 14, 2025 for PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-asks-switch-online-playtesters-not-to-disclose-any-information-but-how-long-will-that-last<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Nintendo is requesting participants in its secretive <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-gb">Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program</a> do not disclose details of the test.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo announced it would soon be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-playtesting-mystery-new-switch-online-feature-this-month-with-up-to-10k-people">playtesting a new Switch Online feature</a>, but only up to 10,000 people would be accepted.</p>
<p>This, of course, drew plenty of attention and excitement - so much so that the playtest application reached capacity within a minute of going live yesterday.</p>

<p>Twitter/X user (and Nintendo dataminer) OatmealDome was one of the lucky people to be accepted and has since shared a screenshot of Terms and Conditions from Nintendo that must be accepted.</p>
<p>"We request that you do not discuss or disclose content from either the Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program test software or website with others," it reads.</p>
<p>The download code also cannot be shared with others, or re-issued.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>[NSO - Playtest]</p><p>Note: players will not be allowed to talk about the contents of the playtest. You must accept an NDA before the software can be downloaded.</p><p>(Pretty sure there will be people who post to social media about it within the first 5 minutes regardless...) <a href="https://t.co/uhvmwFs4Q9">pic.twitter.com/uhvmwFs4Q9</a></p></div>— OatmealDome (@OatmealDome) <a href="https://twitter.com/OatmealDome/status/1844467949190451647?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>While this isn't strictly an NDA, it's clear Nintendo wants lucky applicants to keep quiet about what they experience.</p>
<p>But really, how likely is that?</p>
<p>The playtest itself is set to take place from 24th October until 6th November and involves a 2.2 GB software download.</p>
<p>So what do you think the playtest will be for? A new Virtual Console? Game streaming? Something related to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In 2020, two actors out of work during covid tried to put on Shakespeare’s <em>Hamlet</em> in it, and made a documentary about their efforts.</p><p><a href="https://www.undiscoveredcountryfilm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Grand Theft Hamlet</em></a>, by Pinny Grylls and Sam Crane, is about the pair attempting to organize and mount a production of <em>Hamlet</em> in <em>GTA Online</em>, and is shot entirely within it. They write that “By using the in-game phone camera we were able to get intimate close ups and cinematic pans across landscapes – enabling a more cinematic visual language and moments of pathos, emotion and lyricism to exist within the chaos and violence of this undiscovered country.”&nbsp;</p><p>I’ll admit I take umbrage with the idea that <em>GTA </em>is an “undiscovered country,” even though I <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56965/speech-to-be-or-not-to-be-that-is-the-question" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get the reference</a>. A <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/grand-theft-hamlet-review-1235936982/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> review notes that the creators “aren’t experienced players of the game,” and when I first started poking around the documentary’s website, I was expecting the kind of “<em>in a video game?!</em>” vibes we often see from people who aren’t familiar with the cool, creative stuff players have been doing in games for decades.&nbsp;</p><p>The full documentary could very well be that, but check out this clip. As Luke said when I showed it to him, “OK no, this is fucking great.” </p><div><figure><p><iframe title="GRAND THEFT HAMLET clip | BFI London Film Festival 2024" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fCUvXc5ESFo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Things go so perfectly wrong at all the right times, with the <em>Hamlet</em> actors initially seeming out of their depth when faced with regular <em>GTA </em>players, but then they get into the swing of <em>GTA</em>'s chaos while <em>still</em> desperately trying to say their lines. The seemingly spur-of-the-moment situation brings a whole new dimension to <em>Hamlet</em>’s opening scene, and I love that they can laugh about it. If the full documentary keeps up this vibe, I’m here for it.</p><p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/mubi-acquires-grand-theft-hamlet-us-global-streaming-1236029112/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a> writes that Mubi has acquired the theater and streaming rights, and Mubi <a href="https://x.com/mubi/status/1844347147883335955" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a> that <em>Grand Theft Hamlet</em> is “coming soon to US theaters and streaming globally.” The Hollywood Reporter writes that it will show in London next week, with further releases in 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite <em>Hamlet</em> is always going to be the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUN3_yAOUNo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenneth Branagh</a> version, even though friends have made persuasive arguments for why it’s not the best one.

		<p>Following on from the well received original trilogy remaster, Aspyr Media has announced Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC. You love to see it, and that’s probably why they’re releasing it on 14th February 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ow6cM-fgiB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>While the first three games were all numbered, the games that came fourth and onwards were all named. 1999’s The Last Revelation sees Lara uncover the lost tomb of the Egyptian God Set, unwittingly setting him free. She’s then presumed dead after saving the world from that danger, with Tomb Raider: Chronicles rounding out the series’ PS1 era with family and friends reminiscing on earlier Lara Croft adventures (which you obviously get to play through).</p>
<p>Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness saw the series make the leap to PlayStation 2, coming with a brand new engine and overhauled gameplay – Lara has a stamina meter for climbing, can perform melee attacks, stealth, and more. Unfortunately, this was a real problem project for Core Design, taking three years to produce with multiple delays and content being cut or scaled back to meet deadlines. While it sold a 2.5 million copies, it was not a critical success, and Eidos decided to hand the series over to Crystal Dynamics going forward.</p>
<p>As with the first remastered trilogy, Aspyr is making a number of modernising changes. You’ll have both overhauled and classic graphics that &nbsp;you can switch between on the fly, and there’s a more modern control scheme inspired by later games to give camera controls, or you can still play with the old tank controls. Further quality of life tweaks include boss health bars, and there’s trophies and achievements integrated as well.</p>

<p>The Darkness trilogy will come in at the same $29.99 / £24.99 / €29.99 price point as the first trio.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/21/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-review-ps5-xbox-switch-pc/">Tomb Raider I-III Remastered review</a>, we said, “Lara’s original trilogy has been lovingly restored with the launch of these remasters, offering a definitive collection that bundles the core games and their expansions. However, dusting off these old relics in the name of nostalgia may come with a nasty surprise. Don’t worry, there are no mummy curses, snake pits, or swinging pendulum axes, though the clunky controls will definitely take some getting used to (again).”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-franchise-sells-over-100-million-units-comes-with-remaster-announcement/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.tombraider.com/news/video-games/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-reveal-100-million-games-sold-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crystal Dynamics posted</a> that the Tomb Raider franchise has officially reached over 100 million games sold across the entire franchise, a franchise that started in 1996 and is still going strong even today in 2024. Not only did Crystal Dynamics express their gratitude and excitement over the success of the franchise, but they also announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-the-last-revelation-remaster/">that Tomb Raider IV-VI are getting their very own remaster collection</a>, which is monumental news for those who have been waiting to see whether Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness would ever receive any special treatment. Angel of Darkness has always been the most controversial game in the series, and it's already taken plenty of Tomb Raider fans by surprise that they've chosen to remaster this game, too. It's possible that by remastering it, all of the bugs that the game ever had will be fixed, and its reputation may finally swing to a positive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered Starring Lara Croft" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bdQDT7LSPWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Remastering all of the original games in the collection means that they are more accessible than ever, which will definitely help to contribute to the number of sales made in the Tomb Raider franchise. While the numbers for the Tomb Raider I-III Remastered collection weren't revealed, the <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Embracer-Group-publishes-Interim-Report-Q4-January-March-2024-Adjusted-EBIT-increased-by-56-to-SEK-1426-million-240523.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Embracer Group financial report</a> stated that the collection was positively received and performed above management expectations. The first remastered collection saw a lot of Limited Edition merchandise released for the title, which helped boost and promote the game. Additionally, those working on the game continued to release bug fixes and updates, making the game as flawless as possible.</p>
<p>While Tomb Raider IV-VI are not considered many people's favorites in the franchise, it will bring the entire collection full circle, and will make the entire collection more accessible to those who want to play it on alternative consoles, as well as giving those who create content an easier way to do it, as the game allows you to choose between the original graphics and the remastered graphics.</p>
<p>This will likely help to bolster the sales of the Tomb Raider franchise, especially as the last new game in the franchise was released in 2018, and the next game in the Survivor franchise hasn't received any new information.</p>
<p>Whether this remastered collection will receive the same amount of fanfare and promotion as the first three will remain to be seen, but it will be released on all platforms similar to the first remastered collection. Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered is set to release on February 14, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-26-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.6 release date, with a new five-star character and more coming to the game later this month.</p>
<p>Launching on October 23rd,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.6 follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-25-release-date">last month's Version 2.5</a>, which saw you uncovering secrets within the Shackling Prison, bringing a "trailblazing silkpunk saga" to its climax.</p>
<p>This time around, the stakes aren't quite so high. In Version 2.6, you'll be returning to Penacony and visiting the Paperfold University, an academic institution currently preparing for its new semester, as well as its anniversary celebrations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.6-release-date-rappa.jpg?itok=uCPkhcgb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.6-release-date-rappa.jpg?itok=o1zGWXnq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.6 introduces the ninja graffiti artist Rappa, among many other things.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll be given the chance to take part in the University's festivities and experience a glimpse of campus life, alongside the likes of March 7th and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-honkai-star-rail-trailer-is-all-about-dan-hengs-super-cool-imbibitor-lunae-form">Dan Heng</a>.</p>
<p>A new five-star character is also joining the roster in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.6. Rappa is a character who "calls herself a ninja" and uses the art of ninjutsu, as well as "rap, graffiti, and comics", in combat.</p>
<p>She can deal area-of-effect damage, debuff enemies, and more, making her an ideal addition to your team if you're looking for some more group-based destruction.</p>
<p>As well as Rappa, you'll also get another chance to obtain the aforementioned Dan Heng, along with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-acheron-raiden-shogun">Acheron</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-reveals-new-character-acheron-as-20-reveal-is-coming-this-week">Aventurine</a>, during the course of this update cycle.</p>

<p>Version 2.6 also brings part three of the Simulated Universe DLC, which introduces the Unknowable Domain. You'll collect Scepters, enhance them with Components, and unlock "powerful synergies" in your race to take on a "formidable final foe".</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, it's a turn-based gacha RPG from HoYoverse, the creator of smash hits&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zenless-zone-zero"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>. It has similar gacha mechanics to those games, but you'll be taking on your opponents in more thoughtful turn-based engagements.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 2.6 arrives across all platforms on October 23rd.</p>

		<p><em>Recently, the entire Remap staff was at the movie theater. We're somewhat of cinema aficionados ourselves, but actually going to a theater is a bit of a special event. You'll hear all about our time taking in Megalopolis on My Turn next week, but the experience left an impression.</em></p><p><em>Cado is fortunate enough to live in a part of New York City where there's a lot of options. Good projection, clean theaters. It's a place where people value movies as movies. That's less true for Patrick, who's subject to whatever the suburbs can offer, and for Rob, finding the best often means hopping in the car for a long time.</em></p><p><em>Movies used to be a pillar of society's media diet, but these days, the so-called Attention Economy has something to say about that, combined with the rise of decent home theater setups and easy access to streaming movies. What is the future of the movie theater, and what would get us to come back more often?</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob:</strong> So I was watching <em>Megalopolis </em>and after a few minutes I noticed, as I often do, a bunch of scratches on the screen that created bright slashes when the light from the projection hit them. This particular theater has a bunch of issues like this, but honestly I cannot remember the last time I saw a projection that was flawless. Maybe the Arclight (RIP) in Hollywood, the one at the Cinerama Dome?</p><p>On the other hand, I was one of three people in the audience at 4 PM on a Friday. Matinees are always slow, of course, and <em>Megalopolis </em>has been a huge bomb, but this is almost always what I find when I catch an afternoon movie. A lobby full of bored employees who look surprised to see someone else there as they prepared for the evening crowds, and then an almost entirely empty theater with two or three obvious maintenance issues that make you question the value proposition of a movie ticket versus watching it at home on streaming in a few weeks.</p><p>It got me wondering: is this just the state of movie theaters since the COVID shutdowns and the shift toward shorter delays for stream releases, or was this something that was always going to end up happening with the multiplex model?</p><p>You and I came of age in a world where the huge suburban multiplex was relatively new and served as an easy default for moviegoing and it was hard to argue with the convenience. Everything was showing there, and for more popular movies you could have your pick of showtimes. Now admittedly, only one or two of those screens was anything approaching the kind of movie theaters my parents had taken me to when I was little but, again, the convenience was hard to argue with. If it felt like movies weren’t hitting the same as <em>Independence Day </em>or <em>Toy Story </em>did when I was little, well, surely that was just because I wasn’t a little kid anymore, right?</p><p>Even if there was a significant difference in experience between the smaller shoebox theaters at the edges of the multiplex versus the larger auditoriums that were the default in the 80s and 90s, it still blew the doors off what you could get at home. HD flat screens were a rarity, and no matter how good an audio system you had, you just weren’t going to have anything approaching a cinematic experience. One of my uncles, after a series of boom years for his construction business, splurged on a huge projection system for a dedicated home theater room and I remember him showing us his DVD of <em>Air Force One </em>on that system and thinking that it was, indeed, awesome… and also still incredibly short of what a movie theater could do. The image always looked a little washed-out, the focus never quite right.</p><p>But it never occurred to me what the multiplex would turn into when it was no longer brand-new, when the equipment and furnishings were aging. Those small, narrow theaters were “good enough” when they were in good shape and a good home theater was beyond the means of most people and consumer technology at the time. But man, when that same theater has a projector that looks like it might have burned its bulb, the screen looks like a used napkin, and half the seats feel like their padding has collapsed, it’s hard to imagine a <em>worse </em>way to see a movie. Vulture <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/03/movie-theater-projector-amc-regal.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>ran a great article</u></a> where they surveyed the stated of moviegoing with a professional projectionist and he detailed point-by-point the ways theaters’ lack of maintenance and poor staffing and cleaning practices have caused these endemic issues but one of the big things that stands out to me is that almost none of the big theater chains can afford to fix what’s gone wrong with their theaters.</p><p>Obviously the pandemic plus the proliferation of streaming were going to pose a challenge to the film industry. But every time I attend one of these eerie “ghost ship” multiplexes, I wonder if they weren’t uniquely vulnerable to the competition that streaming provided. If your whole pitch is convenience, you don’t really have a plan B when something significantly more convenient comes along. And to offer that convenience, a lot of these places had already made some compromises on quality, meaning that they did not have far to fall before they invited unfavorable comparisons to watching movies at home.</p><p>Did your relationship with movie theaters follow a similar arc? I know that living in LA and having access to really good theaters probably woke me up to how lousy theaters were in a lot of other places, but I also wonder how much of my irritation with going to the movies now just reflects being in a different place in my life and relationships.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@jeremyyappy?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Jeremy Yap</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>A huge part of what we’re talking about depends on what you’re getting out of attending a movie theater. For the longest time, it was a combination of earliest possible access to a new work, plus an audio and visual experience that could never, ever be matched at home. Movies have adopted a similar arc to arcades, you know? The advent of powerful gaming consoles capable of accepting arcade ports is pretty similar to the one-two punch of perfectly adequate home video equipment and convenient streaming.</p><p>I still attend the movies on a regular basis. When my wife and I have a date night, it’s almost always to attend a movie. In the past, it was superhero spectacles. These days, it’s more likely a horror movie. Just last weekend, I was there with a group of friends for dinner, drink, and the new Joker. We all basically knew the movie was going to blow, but it didn’t matter? We were showing up to an adequate but hardly special AMC in the suburbs, but no one cared? It was an opportunity to get out of the house—and in this case, everyone had children—and spend a few hours together. The theater was a chance for community.</p><p>Community, I suspect, is what’s going to be part of the second act for movie theaters. If we keep the arcade analogy, the rapid expansion of arcades in every mall eventually died out. (So did malls, mostly!) But now, you don’t have to go <em>that</em> far to find an arcade. The difference now is the “arcade” is often dropped into the middle of a fancy adults-oriented experience. There are family-friendly options like Dave and Busters, sure, but increasingly you’re seeing video games as part of a reason to lure adults out.&nbsp;</p><p>In these places, you find brand-new arcade games you can’t find at home. Too many of them are adaptations of mobile games, but between some of the original work still being done, the well-maintained arcade experiences from the 90s and 2000s still kick some serious ass. Sega made so many bangers.</p><p>But ultimately, it’s trying to make a compelling argument for why you shouldn’t just hang out at home.</p><p>Which is all to say that, in my opinion, the future of the movie theater requires a similar reinvention. It needs to become a destination for reasons beyond early access <em>or</em> technological marvels. 4DX, where the chair shakes and water’s spit in your face, is goofily extreme—but it gestures in the right direction of trying to rethink <em>why</em> we sit in a dark theater with other people. I’m sorry, but equipping a movie theater with terrific projection and incredible sound is not going to move the needle anymore. People don’t give a shit.&nbsp;</p><p>You can easily imagine, though, a theater that explicitly caters to people who <em>do</em> give a shit<em>. </em>You could charge them whatever you want. How much would you pay for it, Rob? But for everyone else, for the masses,I think it starts with “why do people want to get together?” and works backwards from there.&nbsp;</p><p>It is, perhaps, a small thing, but what’s been some of the most talked about parts of movies over the past year and change? It’s the fuckin’ popcorn buckets. They’re exclusive. They’re ridiculous. They create a reason to attend the movie. On some level, those popcorn buckets suggest a path forward for theaters.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@felixmooneeram?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Felix Mooneeram</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>I could be wrong, but my instincts say that the popcorn buckets are more aimed at getting people who were already coming out to the movies to pay a bit more. Same way a collector’s edition of a video game is aimed at upselling a guaranteed $60 sale into a $100 sale. Looking at the popcorn buckets that get released and seem to move the needle, they seem like they’re either for long-running franchises or the kinds of big movies that once upon a time would have had all sorts of collectible tie-in deals with fast food businesses in the 90s. Which feels like it is the direction a lot of business is going: faced with the awareness that lots of people cannot will not pay more for the same service, you look at ways to sweeten the pot for the ones who <em>are </em>able and willing without massively increasing costs.</p>

There are a lot of systems to keep track of, levels to grind, and time to manage as you travel through the world of Euchronia. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the things to do when actual in-game days pass when you so much as talk to someone.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193831" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="226" data-playlist="193831,196394,196599" data-current="193831"><div><p>The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19283.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>A lot of this will be familiar to <em>Persona </em>fans, but if <em>Metaphor</em>’s fantasy setting has drawn you in or you’re a veteran looking for some tips on what’s different, we have a big round-up of helpful tips to keep in mind as you jump into Atlus’ 70+ hour epic. Here are X things to know before you start <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>.</p><h2 id="h72985"><a id=""></a><strong>Stealth is pretty forgiving</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest changes in <em>Metaphor </em>from <em>Persona </em>is that you can attack enemies on the overworld like in an action game and kill them without switching to a turn-based battle. If you’re powerful enough to take an enemy out it will save you a lot of time grinding levels and exploring dungeons. However, sometimes you’ll encounter foes who you’ll still have to take out the old-fashioned way. But you can ambush them to start the battle with an advantage, and that means sneaking around them and striking from behind. The “stealth” in <em>Metaphor</em> is extremely forgiving. If you’re seen by an enemy, just sprint far enough away and they will forget you were there, then just stab them in the back when they turn around. You can even escape from a battle, run away, then you’ll get a second chance at stealth. - Kenneth Shepard</p><h2 id="h72986"><a id=""></a><strong>Listen to the narrated lore dumps on the map</strong></h2><p><em>Metaphor</em>’s world is pretty elaborate, with centuries of culture and politics to learn about. One way the game weaves in its world-building is with its narrator, who tells you about towns and cities as you head to them on your runner ship. So while the transitional screens can be skipped, you should listen to or read the subtitles for the lore dumps as you head from one place to another. — KS</p><h2 id="h72987"><a id=""></a><strong>You get control of your teammates…eventually</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest shocks when I first started <em>Metaphor</em> was that I couldn’t control my teammates. This was a much-maligned part of Atlus’ previous games like <em>Persona 3</em> that was changed in re-releases and remakes. But don’t panic, this is just a temporary thing-. You’ll fight alongside a few characters before you control them in battle, but you <em>will</em> at some point be able to issue commands and strategize. They just gate that behind the story for a few hours. — KS</p><h2 id="h72988"><a id=""></a><strong>Read the Mythical Scrolls in Akademia</strong></h2><p>Akademia is a safe space where you’re able to change up your Archetype classes, talk with the enigmatic bookkeeper More, and pet his cat Plateau. However, there’s also a scroll next to his desk that hints at some of the game’s biggest mysteries. The dialogue that follows will change throughout the game, so check in on it every now and then. — KS</p><h2 id="h72989"><a id=""></a><strong>If your protagonist falls in battle, it’s not game over…except in the overworld</strong></h2><p>One of the best quality-of-life changes in <em>Metaphor </em>is that if your protagonist falls in battle you don’t get an immediate game over, unlike previous Atlus games. This means you don’t have to spend most of your resources trying to make sure he survives things that might randomly knock him out with one hit. However, this does not apply if you aren’t in a turn-based battle yet. When you’re smacking around enemies in the overworld before a battle has been initiated, they will smack right back. If they’re not powerful enough to initiate a battle with those attacks, you’ll still take damage, and if your HP hits zero while in the overworld, that’s a game over. — KS</p><h2 id="h72990"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t forget you can reset battles if you get a bad start</strong></h2><p><em>Metaphor </em>encourages you to experiment. One of the ways it lets you do that is that you can reset a battle at any point as long as it’s your turn and you’ve got at least one character alive. Just press down the left analog stick and it will take you back to the very first turn of the fight. Keep in mind that if your opponent managed to start the battle with an advantage, they will still have it when you start the battle over. If you’re looking to get a full reset in which you can try and ambush an enemy, you’ll have to escape the battle and attack them in the overworld again. — KS</p><figure id="" data-id="2e378e5206510659d5479a1780a23b29" data-recommend-id="image://2e378e5206510659d5479a1780a23b29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bardon shakes the protagonist's hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bardon shakes the protagonist's hand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2e378e5206510659d5479a1780a23b29" data-recommend-id="image://2e378e5206510659d5479a1780a23b29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bardon shakes the protagonist's hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h72991"><a id=""></a><strong>A lot of quality-of-life features are locked behind bonds</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of reasons to get to know the many characters you’ll meet in <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>. There are, of course, the great stories and relationships you’ll uncover while hanging out with your new friends, but each also has some unlocks as you progress the relationship, such as new Archetypes to play as. Some, however, have quality-of-life features that really feel like they should be in the game by default. One example is More, who unlocks the ability to change your Archetypes in your pause menu, rather than having to go to Akademia. So just be aware that there are some perks to meeting up with your friends, even if they should probably just be available to you by default. — KS</p><h2 id="h72992"><a id=""></a><strong>Skating on your sword is the best way to get around</strong></h2><p>You spend a lot of time walking in <em>Metaphor</em>, but if you’re not in a dungeon or indoors, you can also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-sword-skate-fast-travel-map-1851668165&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-sword-skate-fast-travel-map-1851668165">skate on your magical sword</a></span>. It’s a speed boost, looks fun as shit, and is generally the best way to get around as you travel through Euchronia. You’ll save yourself a lot of time if you get off your feet and onto your sword. — KS</p><h2 id="h72993"><a id=""></a><strong>Check your local stores for MP items</strong></h2><p><em>Metaphor </em>is an Atlus game, and that means that MP is a scarce resource. Before you go into any dungeon or big story moment, check your local stores for items that will replenish this so you can use spells and abilities in fights. Some of these are only sold in limited quantities, so look for accessories that can give you even the smallest bit of MP. Otherwise, you’ll probably end up having to leave a dungeon early and come back to it later. So mitigate this as much as you can. — KS</p><h2 id="h72994"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t rely on the same Archetypes the whole game</strong></h2><p>When you’ve found classes that work for your team, it’s easy to get comfortable using the same Archetypes through much of <em>Metaphor</em>. However, you will need to level up other trees to progress even the base Archetype for each character. So give some love to the other ancillary classes along the way. It will give you a new appreciation for the intricacies of <em>Metaphor</em>’s battle system, give you abilities you can “inherit” for the classes you do use, and let you further master the Archetypes you’re already using. — KS</p><h2 id="h72995"><a id=""></a><strong>If you can beat an enemy without getting hit, you’ll get bonuses</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of ways to maximize your grind in <em>Metaphor</em>e. If you manage to take out a group of enemies without getting hit in a turn-based fight, you’ll get an “Unscathed Triumph” bonus to your experience, money, and magla when you’re done. So beat enemies quickly both because you should aim to overpower your foes, but because you’ll also fill your pockets and get stronger because of it. — KS</p><h2 id="h72996"><a id=""></a><strong>Pull up the Memorandum at pretty much any time</strong></h2><p>Taking a page from <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> lets you open up its codex called the Memorandum during most cutscenes. Someone said a proper noun you don’t recognize? Push down the right thumbstick at any time and you can scroll through the codex and brush up on your knowledge. — KS</p><h2 id="h72997"><a id=""></a><strong>Some follower conversations are only available on the runner</strong></h2><p>Throughout <em>Metaphor</em>, you’ll get pinged when your followers want to talk to you. However, even if someone <em>wants</em> to talk to you, that doesn’t mean they will at the moment. Some of these conversations can only take place on your ship, which only moves when you’re en route to a new location. So if you have someone who wants to chat but is being particular about where and when, head to the runner and map out a place to go. Sometimes you’ll even find someone who wants to talk but hasn’t made you aware of it until you start heading somewhere. I missed a new follower bond for several in-game days before realizing that I had to initiate it on the ship. So check in with folks while you’re in transit, as well. — KS</p><figure id="" data-id="1775631c56c0e2f3af86a2211a5fbce5" data-recommend-id="image://1775631c56c0e2f3af86a2211a5fbce5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Neuras drives the runner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Neuras drives the runner." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1775631c56c0e2f3af86a2211a5fbce5" data-recommend-id="image://1775631c56c0e2f3af86a2211a5fbce5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Neuras drives the runner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h72998"><a id=""></a><strong>Check the pantry and use the washroom every day on the runner</strong></h2><p>Another thing to do whenever you’re on the runner is check the pantry and use the washroom. Both of these actions have some benefits, and they won’t take up your travel day. Every time you check the pantry you’ll find some new ingredients to cook with, and the washroom will give you an extra 100 experience each time you use it, which isn’t a lot, but it’s free. You can only do these once a day, but they do refresh multiple times over the course of a days-long trip. So check them both every morning when you wake up on the runner. — KS</p><h2 id="h72999"><a id=""></a><strong>Talk to informants before going into dungeons</strong></h2><p>In almost every town you’ll be able to buy intel from informants. These can give you an edge on big bosses as they’ll let you know things like elemental weaknesses and other strategies. They do cost money, but they’re rarely enough to break the bank. So if someone mentions that an informant might have some helpful intel for you, don’t pass it up. — KS</p><h2 id="h73000"><a id=""></a><strong>Bad weather can offer a greater challenge but extra rewards</strong></h2><p>One thingto keep in mind before you go into a dungeon is that the weather will have a tangible effect on how difficult fights are. Bad weather can fundamentally change your battle strategy, as it will prevent you from getting additional turns when you exploit an enemy weakness, which is typically a key part of your tactics in combat. The trade-off is that you’ll get more rewards for finishing battles. So be mindful of this as you head out on missions. You can talk to a fortune teller in town to tell you what the weather will be like, but you will also meet a character later in the game who can outright change the weather for you. - KS</p><h2 id="h73001"><a id=""></a><strong>Agility is secretly the most important stat in the game</strong></h2><p>You’ll upgrade a lot of stats over the course of <em>Metaphor</em>, but agility/evasion is secretly the most important one. Sure, making your characters a bit more nimble when they need to dodge is standard practice, but dodging attacks is essential in <em>Metaphor </em>because of how it factors into the game’s turn system. <em>Metaphor </em>fights play out in rounds with the player’s team and the enemy team executing a number of actions before it swaps to the opposing side. Managing how many turns you have left is a major part of battles, but finding ways to deny your opponent their own turns is one of the best ways to get the upper hand. If you miss an attack, you’ll lose two turns as opposed to just one, so having characters who can dodge attacks more frequently is one of the easiest ways to end an opponent’s turn and mitigate additional damage, healing, or buffs on their part. — KS</p><h2 id="h73002"><a id=""></a><strong>In the late game, keep your characters on mastered Archetypes to help with the grind</strong></h2><p>As you level up Archetypes, you’ll eventually reach Rank 20, which is considered “mastered,” and can no longer level up. However, you will still receive experience points for your Archetype, you’ll just get an item that can be used to level up other Archetypes each time you hit the end of Rank. One of the most effective ways I was able to level up Archetypes I hadn’t been using all game was not to use those classes I was trying to level up, but to instead farm these items by leveling up the Archetypes I’d already mastered. By the end game, leveling up the classes I needed to in order to unlock some of the later Archetypes became trivial because I just fed them these items. That way I didn’t have to compromise the strategies I’d already mastered just to level up something I wasn’t going to keep using in the long run. — KS</p><figure id="" data-id="088f13db6672e3bd69d2cebb9bf86cea" data-recommend-id="image://088f13db6672e3bd69d2cebb9bf86cea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist swings his sword at a goblin enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist swings his sword at a goblin enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="088f13db6672e3bd69d2cebb9bf86cea" data-recommend-id="image://088f13db6672e3bd69d2cebb9bf86cea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist swings his sword at a goblin enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h73003"><a id=""></a>Lock on to enemies to execute a dash attack in the overworld combat</h2><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> mixes real-time combat and turn-based battles, but the action side of that equation is admittedly basic. You have an attack button to chain strikes together, a dodge roll, and…that’s about it. That said, it’s easy to forget that your protagonist <em>can</em> execute a pretty fancy dash attack by locking onto a faraway enemy and pressing the attack button. This will almost immediately close the distance between you and your foe, which should help you score a hit or two before the enemy can retaliate.</p><p>This maneuver works with any short-range weapon your protagonist has equipped, so even Mages can charge into a crowd of foes and (hopefully) take care of them all with a few spells. —Timothy Monbleau</p><h2 id="h73004"><a id=""></a>Your main character’s Archetype grants a unique passive skill</h2><p>The classes in <em>Metaphor</em>—called Archetypes in-game—generally feature all the same stat bonuses and spells no matter which party member has them equipped. However, the main character’s Archetype will completely change the way he plays in overworld combat. Each weapon will alter the speed and range of your attacks, and some Archetypes even allow you to snipe enemies from afar.</p><p>Additionally, each Archetype will grant the main character an extra perk that will help out during the real-time combat sections. For example, while the Warrior’s huge greatsword has an exceptionally slow swing, the <strong>Barge Past</strong> passive will prevent enemies from beginning turn-based battles with an advantage. Other Archetypes can benefit your entire party too, such as the Gunner who can heal your party after stunning or defeating enemies in the overworld. — TM</p><h2 id="h73005"><a id=""></a>Use the Mage Archetype in dungeons to refill your party’s MP in dungeons</h2><p>We need to highlight the amazing passive skill the Mage Archetype grants the main character. In short, whenever your main character stuns or defeats enemies in overworld combat as a Mage, your party will heal a small amount of MP. It’s not a lot (usually a couple MP per enemy), but MP recovery in <em>Metaphor</em> is very rare. You’ll find a handful of MP recovery items in the early game, but that stack will deplete quickly unless you’re really optimizing your magic consumption</p><p>Basic enemies can and will respawn in any dungeons that feature multiple “zones” to explore. In other words, it’s usually easy to slap the Mage Archetype on your protagonist and slay a bunch of small fry until your party’s magic reserves are fully topped off. If you don’t want to consume multiple in-game days just to get through a single dungeon, this trick will come in clutch. — TM</p><h2 id="h73006"><a id=""></a>Save your purchases for Idlesday or the 29th of the month</h2><p><em>Metaphor</em> carries over several gameplay mechanics that are synonymous with the <em>Persona</em> series, which even extends to the smaller details of Atlus’ flagship social simulator. Just as you could purchase discounted weapons in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927"><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></a></span> on Saturdays, “Idlesday” is when almost every shop will discount their goods by 20 percent. All shops throwing sales on Idlesday will appear as red icons on your map.</p><p>Similarly, the 29th of every month in <em>Metaphor</em> will unlock 30 percent discounts at weapon and armor stores. These are harder to plan around than the Idlesday sales, especially if you’re staring down a quest that needs to be completed within a handful of days. That said, several shops feature extra powerful weapons and armor that cost a huge chunk of change to buy, so waiting for a discount can easily save you north of 10,000 money on those bigger purchases.</p><p>If you forget which days are your big sale days, the “Calendar” option on your main menu will specifically list these sales. — TM</p><h2 id="h73007"><a id=""></a>Build your party around Synthesis skills</h2><p>I touched on this when I explained <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/preview/the-best-archetype-class-in-metaphor-refantazio-is-all-1851670424?rev=1728649080460&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/preview/the-best-archetype-class-in-metaphor-refantazio-is-all-1851670424?rev=1728649080460">which Archetypes are best in <em>Metaphor</em></a></span>, but this is a point that bears repeating. Synthesis skills in <em>Metaphor</em> are your <em>Chrono Trigger</em>-style Double Techs and Triple Techs, in which an Archetype can team up with certain combinations of party members to execute special attacks at the cost of multiple turn icons. These can be hard to take advantage of, since going all-in on a Synergy skill can be less optimal than letting two characters attack individually.</p><p>However, when utilized correctly, Synergy skills can turn the tide of battle overwhelmingly in your favor. In the early game, magic users can only use party-wide attack magic via Synergy skills, which you’ll really want for normal encounters and boss fights alike. Later on, you’ll unlock Synergy skills that can grant huge party buffs or exploit weaknesses that your Archetypes can’t normally take advantage of. Realistically, you probably won’t construct a party in which every character can use every Synergy skill they can. But if you see a Synergy skill that catches your eye, it’s definitely worth the effort to build a team that can specifically use it. — TM</p><figure id="" data-id="6d08d206abfb24d45bd31db03d4cc7bf" data-recommend-id="image://6d08d206abfb24d45bd31db03d4cc7bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maria and the protagonist talk in her bedroom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maria and the protagonist talk in her bedroom." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6d08d206abfb24d45bd31db03d4cc7bf" data-recommend-id="image://6d08d206abfb24d45bd31db03d4cc7bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maria and the protagonist talk in her bedroom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h73008"><a id=""></a>Use your time to advance follower relationships and complete quests</h2><p>As anyone who has completed an optimized run of a <em>Persona</em> game knows, time is your most valuable resource. <em>Metaphor</em> similarly advances its plot based on the passage of in-game time, and many side quests have rigid deadlines that can pass you by. You’re not <em>obligated</em> to see every corner of <em>Metaphor</em> before you reach the end credits, but if you want to get the most out of your new $70 video game, you probably don’t want to miss anything just because you were careless.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned quests, it’s best to use your afternoons and evenings on pursuits that absolutely require in-game time. Advancing your relationships with your Followers should be a major priority, since every increased rank of their relationships will strengthen your Archetypes and potentially unlock wildly useful perks. Similarly, you can use spare time to increase Royal Virtues that you need to access new quests or gameplay features (such as the option to purify equipment at the cathedral). Meanwhile, using time on activities that increase battle stats like MP is relatively wasteful since you can always level grind for “free” to increase these attributes. — TM</p><h2 id="h73009"><a id=""></a>Don’t bother cooking until you unlock the Speed Cooking ability</h2><p>Cooking in fantasy worlds is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-game-food-real-meat-cooking-cutscene-1851317963&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-game-food-real-meat-cooking-cutscene-1851317963">all the rage these days</a></span>, and <em>Metaphor</em> is no exception. You’ll eventually unlock the ability to freely cook up recipes with your party members, but whatever you do, <strong>do not waste your time cooking right away</strong>. On the subject of helpful Follower perks, Maria is one of the first Followers you unlock. By increasing her Follower rank, you’ll unlock the ability “Speed Cooking,” which allows you to cook without consuming any time. This is a <em>huge</em> upgrade!</p><p>Granted, Speed Cooking does have its own limitations. You’re still stuck with preparing one dish before you need to find some other activity to pass the time. Still, if you’re looking to cook every dish in the game, this is the way to do it. — TM</p><h2 id="h73010"><a id=""></a>The autosave in dungeons is generous</h2><p>Look, I’m not going to say that you should save scum your way through <em>Metaphor</em>. That said, even though you can’t save anywhere in dungeons, your game will update your autosave file frequently. For instance, finding treasure chests seems to consistently trigger an autosave.</p><p>I mention this because, occasionally, <em>Metaphor</em> just does not go your way. If an enemy ambushes you, you could find yourself needing to dig deep into your reserve of items and magic just to make it out alive. If you’re <em>really</em> on the back foot, loading your autosave file that’s five minutes old might be more advantageous than forfeiting a ton of resources. — TM</p><figure id="" data-id="7ef35986e24587660cfcbbb9464a7638" data-recommend-id="image://7ef35986e24587660cfcbbb9464a7638" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist squeezes through a hidden passage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist squeezes through a hidden passage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ef35986e24587660cfcbbb9464a7638" data-recommend-id="image://7ef35986e24587660cfcbbb9464a7638" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist squeezes through a hidden passage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h73011"><a id=""></a>Look out for hidden passages in dungeons</h2><p><em>Metaphor</em> isn’t afraid to lean on some classic RPG tropes, and that’s especially true when it comes to its dungeon design. Throughout your adventures—though most specifically in side quest dungeons—you’ll come across rooms hiding hidden treasures with seemingly no entrance. Doors to these rooms won’t have any prompt to use a key, and any stairways you find just don’t lead into these spaces. In situations like these, you most likely need to look for a hole in the wall that you can crawl through. These can be easy to miss since they can look pretty small, but your protagonist is apparently comfortable walking through tight spaces.</p><p>As you might expect, these passageways will <em>not</em> show up on your map until you’ve crawled through them yourself. So if you see a room that you just can’t find a way inside of, check around the perimeter of it and see if there are any spots on your map that look like possible secret entrances. — TM</p><h2 id="h73012"><a id=""></a>Don’t worry, you can fast travel between cities for free</h2><p>With all there is to see and do in <em>Metaphor</em>, you might feel stressed trying to cram in all your objectives in a city before the story whisks you away somewhere else. After all, there are expensive things to buy and Followers to get to know better. You can drive yourself crazy trying to fit all that into a dozen in-game days!</p><p>Fortunately, soon after you progress to the game’s second major hub area, you’ll unlock the ability to freely travel between cities. That’s right, there’s no time cost associated with fast traveling like this, and you can freely engage in any time-consuming activities during the afternoon or evening while you’re away. To be clear, this does not totally alleviate the stress of trying to do everything you can within the constraints of the in-game calendar. But at the very least, it helps. — TM</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The latest video game sales data has been released for the United States (US), and EA Sports College Football 25 is still the best-selling game of 2024. After taking over the top spot from Helldivers 2 in July, College Football 25 has continued to hold that spot, according to the latest sales data from Circana.</p>



<p>The only game that made its debut on the list is Madden 25, which comes in at number 12. What doesn’t appear, however, is Black Myth: Wukong. The game has sold over 20 million copies since its August release, but failed to crack the top 20. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-tops-july-2024-and-year-to-date-best-selling-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one game to drop from the list</a> is Sea of Thieves which sat at 19 last month. Other games on the list did move around like Dragon’s Dogma 2 falling slightly from four to six, and Grand Theft Auto V falling from 15 to 17. In what may surprise some people, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League remains on the list as the 15th-best-selling game in the US in 2024.</p>

<p>The United States (US) video game sales data for August 2024 has been released, and an unsurprising name has found itself at the top of the list. According to the latest data from Circana, Madden 25 was the best-selling game in the US for August 2024.</p>



<p>Making their debut on August’s sales data are Madden 25, Star Wars Outlaws, Visions of Mana, and Gundam Breaker 4. On top of that, three games jumped from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-tops-july-2024-and-year-to-date-best-selling-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outside the top 20 in July</a> to crack the rankings this month. Those games were The Elder Scrolls: Online, Forza Horizon 5, and Gran Turismo 7.</p>



<p>Other things to note is that, despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-sales-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">struggling to sell 1 million copies</a> overall, Star Wars Outlaws was the third-best seller in terms of dollar sales for August. Also, three of the top four spots are held by EA Sports Football games with Madden 25 at number one, College Football 25 at number two, and the EA Sports MVP Bundle sitting at number four.</p>



<p>Rounding out the top five is Elden Ring.</p>



<p>One game to note that was missing in the United States is Black Myth: Wukong. The game, even with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-20-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling over 20 million copies</a>, failed to crack the top 20 in the US.</p>
