            <p>
The word "kiss" occurs 10 times in the latest blog post for the seventh major <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> patch, while the word "bug" occurs 14 times. I think this ratio captures how BG3 updates at large walk the line between dealing with stuff like progression blockers, and sating the inexhaustible horniness of the fanbase. There's more to patch 7 than glitch-hunting and snogs, however. Due in September, it introduces dynamic splitscreen functionality, expansions for Honour mode, modding tools, new endings for evil playthroughs, and a brace of tweaks for Origin characters.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Let's start with the splitscreen stuff. Baldur's Gate 3 patch 7 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4240783699885624491">will introduce</a> dynamic split-screen merging when co-op players are close to each other, "because the power of friendship transcends all obstacles, including screen partitions". You can toggle this directly from the HUD or within the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s settings, in or out of combat. Adding to the intimacy, the patch allows for banter between characters assigned to different people in multiplayer, rather than it being limited to characters controlled by a single player.
</p>
<p>
As for Honour Mode, Patch 7 doles out Legendary Actions - that is, mode-exclusive special unique actions that become available in the right circumstances - to more creatures, "including the bulette, everyone's favourite neighbourhood surgeon, Malus Thorm, and githyanki Ch'r'ai Tska'an, Ch'r'ai Har'rak, and Ptaris". Ever the champion of the people, Larian have also given local hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin an Arachnid Compulsion ability that lets him sic a bunch of pit spiders on you.
</p>
<p>
As for the modding toolkit, this lets you fiddle with: items including weapons and armour; cosmetic stuff such as hair and textures; races, classes and subclasses, including variations on existing classes and their capacities;  the user interface and, most appetising of all, the dice you'll roll during those nail-biting skillchecks. You can read more in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbaldursgate3.game%2Fnews%2Fcommunity-update-27-official-modding-support_118">this official FAQ</a>. Larian are collaborating with specific mod authors to roadtest the tools ahead of the patch's September launch. The Steam blog has details of what they've done so far, together with a small landslide of notes about very specific fixes for Origin characters. Did you know, or mind overmuch, that Karlach used to brush the shaved part of her head during her idle animation at camp? Did that used to really wind you up? Well, it won't after September.
</p>
<p>
The new campaign endings, finally, apply to both Origin characters, such as the Dark Urge, and custom creations. "Each new cinematic is yours to discover through nefarious means," gloats the blog. The evil endings accompany various improvements and bug fixes for Dark Urge players in particular. For example, they've quashed the one where the rest of your party would look on blithely when you randomly murder a companion. Oh, "and Minthara will now respond accordingly if you've been stripped of Bhaal's influence." 
</p>
<p>
It's not all gravy: Dark Urgers may be displeased to know that you still can't kiss Gortash. It's been long enough since BG3 went 1.0 that I can't remember who Gortash is without checking a wiki, but I am unsurprised to hear that some players want to kiss him. Go on, show me a Baldur's Gate 3 character somebody doesn't want to kiss. I'll be back tomorrow and you'd best believe I will be Googling your answers, unless they horrify me, in which case let's forget this ever happened.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/talisman-5e-review-fast-paced-high-fantasy-adventures<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Talisman </em>is one of those board games that has stood the test of time. Since it's release in the 1980s it has continued to make a name for itself and is just as relevant to the board game market with the release of <em>Talisman 5th Edition</em> this year. While being aware of <em>Talisman </em>this was my first time playing the game and as a fan of magic and quests I was delighted with what I got to experience.</p>
<p>If traditional high-fantasy adventures aren't for you but you're interested in <em>Talisman </em>you can check out our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/talisman-kingdom-hearts-review"><em>Talisman: Kingdom Hearts</em></a>.</p>
<p>In <em>Talisman </em>4-6 players get to take on the role of one of the twelve high-fantasy archetypes, travel the board facing monsters and becoming more powerful, and race to defeat the Elder Dragon and collect the Crown of Command. The premise sounds simple, and honestly it really is.</p>
<p>Opening the box for the first time you'll find the Gameboard, miniatures and characters cards for each of the 12 characters, three six-sided dice, a collection of different cards, tokens, gold coins, and counters representative of your characters strength, craft, and life values. After punching out all of the tokens each has a specific place to live inside the box and as always that's an incredibly satisfying feeling.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-review-open-box.jpg?itok=Tc6OnGMF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-review-open-box.jpg?itok=GWdASOwZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Talisman box has a space for every component to neatly fit</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Talisman 5th Edition</em> Gameplay</h2>
<p>Setting up the gameboard is as easy as making sure every card is shuffled into their own decks and that each player is set up with their characters starting items. All characters have starting values for their Strength, Craft, Life, Fate, and Gold. On top of that the character cards also clearly outline any special abilities your character has, as well as their default alignment.</p>
<p>In my first game I played as a Monk, this would allow me to add my starting Craft value to my Strength if engaging a physically attacking enemy. While believing this was a strategic play to start more powerful than the other players it was quickly clear how much the dice and cards can turn against you.</p>
<p>On your turn you roll the dice and move that number of spaces clockwise or counter clockwise around the board. Wherever you land you simply need to read the text on the space and follow the instructions to roll dice or draw a card from the adventure deck.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-review-starting-setup.jpg?itok=tFgfwdMw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-review-starting-setup.jpg?itok=8nQvEpwo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players begin in their starting locations and the race to the Crown begins</figcaption></figure><p>The adventure deck is what will propel the encounters as well as how the board will change. At its most simple you might draw a creature, fight and kill it, and move on to the next turn. You can also draw cards that are equipment and followers that might bestow different positive (or negative effects) on you, or have a Stranger take up permanent residence on the board.</p>
<h2>Simple and Fast Paced</h2>
<p>After two or three rounds around the table the previously clean board was now filled with a ghost in the graveyard, a healer and a spell shop set up at neighboring fields, and one of the players had been cursed to only be able to move one space a turn.</p>
<p>It was incredibly impressive to me how quickly so many unique elements to our specific came immediately came into play, that's before you add the chaos of the players like our Ghoul realizing his best course of action was to try to attack other players as quickly as possible.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-review-character-card.jpg?itok=4IbGP5ij 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-review-character-card.jpg?itok=iw_dGHEI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A character can obtain equipment and followers to alter how they play</figcaption></figure><p>I was also impressed that with so much going on across the board the base gameplay loop was also so simple and easy to understand. We were getting through all six players turns in only a minute or two. This speed of play didn't just enhance the experience of keeping a momentum of game events, but it was also making sure that all players were engaged.</p>
<p>While many players were exploring the Outer and Inner rings on the game board one of our players had luck on his side, pulling items and followers that propelled his Craft stat to one where he was confident in his ability to fight the Chaos Dragon. This led to a strange point in the gameplay of <em>Talisman</em>.</p>
<h2><em>Talisman </em>Is A Race Until It Isn't</h2>
<p>As the player passed through the Mines, a skill check space verifying the height of your Craft skill, it felt very much like there was only one player truly in the race for the Crown of Command. There wasn't anything that anyone else at the table could do but play out their own turns while we waiting for him to make his way through the Inner Region.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-review-end-of-game-board_0.jpg?itok=8JNC_RNp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-review-end-of-game-board_0.jpg?itok=vyjzh0vP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Late game play sees Strangers at different map locations, cards discarded, and Fate Tokens spent</figcaption></figure><p>The player definitely deserved the victory, but it still felt a bit strange going about our turns waiting for the slight chance that one of the subsequent skill check spaces would hinder him.</p>
<p>Other times I played the game there were differences in the distance between those still circling the board and those heading to the Crown of Command, it just seems like it would be harder to orchestrate games that remain truly competitive throughout the whole experience.</p>
<p>While the core gameplay loop was simple and fast paced there were a number of slowdowns when needing to look up some complicated rules. There's a lot that the rulebook does very well, but there's also some important information that gets buried in text and difficult to find.</p>
<h2>Rules Need Some Work</h2>
<p>The first thing that the rulebook does that's helpful, <a href="https://www.talismanisland.com/resources/rules-downloads/">before you even open the booklet</a>, is to provide players with a QR code that leads to <a href="https://shop.hasbro.com/en-us/product/talisman-the-magical-quest-board-game-5-th-edition-fantasy-tabletop-adventure-games-12-plus/AA84B1F0-B14A-4209-94B5-21EF4C8B6A45#EnhancedPDPVideo">the store page and a ~9 minute video</a> that teaches you how to play the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-instructional-video.jpg?itok=v-QjFuE- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-instructional-video.jpg?itok=QzPXyXtx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This 9 minute video could save hours of prep time for new players</figcaption></figure><p>This video isn't extensive, opting to refer players to the booklet for certain processes or the minutia of individual spaces in the Inner Region, but as a 9 minute video you can send players ahead of time so everyone at least has a base knowledge of the game it's excellent.</p>
<p>As with any new board game I fight to get through teaching it succinctly, but with the video sent to my players we all sat down, could pick characters and go over some basic ground rules, and then get to player. It was a very pleasant experience to have a player ask a question that another could answer instead of having to be the keeper of all knowledge.</p>
<p>Those 'minutia' rules and experiences are mostly laid out clearly, but each section is layed out for you to be reading them in their entirety. If you're hunting for specific info though it can sometimes get lost in the text.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-review-monk-example.jpg?itok=BqxDas65 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-review-monk-example.jpg?itok=7uNCrSeN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As a Monk you can't use weapons but you do get a buff to your Strength in combat</figcaption></figure><p>The first time I had a player cast a spell and we needed to verify if it stayed with the character or went into a discard it took time to locate the answer because on the two page spread of "Gaining and Casting Spells" it's the final bullet point on the second page.</p>
<p>Another rule that was lost, and that I even had difficulty locating again while was writing this review, is what you can do with Trophies. Obtaining Trophies is detailed within the section about defeating a monster, but if you want to know what they're used for you need to re-read the section about Enemy Adventure Cards. A simple bolded "Trophy" header somewhere in the mix would have been appreciated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Talisman 5e </em>New Features<br>
If you've played <em>Talisman </em>before a lot will be the same but new things are denoted in the rulebook with a wheel icon. Some of these differences include changes to what happens when you die, how you can use Fate tokens to alter your movement, rewards for defeating a creature or player in battle, and how becoming a Toad functions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While there was a fair bit of frustration about the rules these are obviously only pains that will be experienced on fresh plays. As I played the game a few more times, needing to reference the rules less and less, I just got to enjoy the speed and experience of playing <em>Talisman</em>.</p>
<h2><em>Talisman 5e </em>| Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Playing new games for the first time can sometimes be a bit of a rough experience, with each subsequent experience becoming smoother both as the person who teaches the game as well as a player. I was elated when sitting down to <em>Talisman </em>and it being a fun game from the very first diceroll.</p>
<p>The core engine of the game, rolling dice and moving around the board before heading towards the Elder Dragon, is incredibly simple to learn and repeat but features so many permutations every game gets a brand new energy.</p>
<p>Permutations begin as soon as players pick each of the twelve playable characters and possibilities continue to explode outward as Adventure Cards are revealed and the board comes to life.</p>
<p>Having never played <em>Talisman</em> before the look of it seemed intimidating, now that I've experienced it I can see it becoming a game that I frequently pull out for my experienced tabletop friends, as well as for family and new tabletop players.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Talisman 5e is a fast paced and easy to learn fantasy game that lets you live the life of an adventurer. With so many permutations of play and fast paced turns it's easy for each adventure to be totally different and constantly engaging.

You can also get this deal with the base 4K Fire Stick for $60. If you already have a console, the deal might seem unappealing to you, but for someone who’s only just now looking to get into the Xbox ecosystem, it sounds a little too good to be true. While there are definitely some caveats, it’s a pretty killer offer though.</p><p>Fire Sticks, as well as similar devices like Roku, are quickly becoming the norm in households, especially as smart TVs seem to be depreciating more and more quickly these days. My own set is a shell of its former self after some years, and it’s probably only a matter of time before it stops being supported altogether. A Fire Stick is a great and cost-effective way to keep on top of things without having to worry about dwindling support for your device or built-in redundancies. At that point, Game Pass and the controller are just an added bonus.<br></p><p>My only real issue with the deal is the fact that the Game Pass catalog is only accessible via the cloud on the Fire Stick. Though I’ve had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cloud-gaming-remote-play-impressions-xbox-ps5-1851571183?rev=1719947148108&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cloud-gaming-remote-play-impressions-xbox-ps5-1851571183?rev=1719947148108">pleasant experiences with cloud streaming</a></span> Xbox games recently, I’m not <em>entirely </em>convinced of its viability. The 4K Max model features Wi-Fi 6E support, which should theoretically make it smoother to stream despite having multiple connections on the same signal, which <em>could </em>alleviate my concerns. Otherwise, folks should expect a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/neon-white-xbox-game-pass-horny-fps-shooter-1851590023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/neon-white-xbox-game-pass-horny-fps-shooter-1851590023">wide range of titles on Game Pass</a></span>, though they won’t have access to everything on offer, and due to the nature of streaming—as opposed to playing something natively installed—the visual quality will be impacted.<br></p><p>Honestly, the controller alone, which retails for about $50 alone, makes me think that I should pick it up. It’d be neat to be able to play my Xbox games in the living room—where the Fire Stick would be closer to my router—without moving my console from its current spot in the house. A new dedicated media device and a controller for less than $100 makes that almost too good an offer to pass up.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Many players are looking forward to Omnimovement, a new feature in the upcoming Call of Duty title Black Ops 6. However, many have been confused about how this feature works for a few weeks, whether it can be turned off, and more. Activision has now come forward to clear the air about this feature through the official Call of Duty podcast, which you can see below.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-black-ops-6-omnimovement">What is Black Ops 6 Omnimovement?</h2>



<p>The official Call of Duty podcast was launched yesterday, and the first episode concentrated on providing details on the new Omnimovement feature. Stephanie, the Senior Director of Studio Communications, first addressed the feature, talking about how players can sprint, slide, dive, and supine in any direction they want.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stephanie then talks about how players shouldn’t just be excited about being able to move in any direction but also chain specific movements through the Omnimovement feature and create their manoeuvres.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s the full video:</p>

<p>We then had Treyarch’s associate director of design, Matt Ronson, explain Black Ops 6’s Omnimovement and provide much-needed clarity on the feature. Ronson first discussed the feature’s development process before discussing how it can be used in gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Omnimovement will be great for those cinematic shots that players always look forward to, but this time, they will create these themselves. They can run head-first into action, dive in through a window, and then rotate to shoot the enemies while falling, creating a sense of action movies in your gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will also see this movement in action during Corner Slicing when a player goes around a corner or doorway. In these situations, the player’s view and weapon will rotate dynamically according to the speed and entry angle.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-omnimovement-cannot-be-turned-off">Omnimovement ‘Cannot Be Turned Off’</h2>



<p>Ronson then answered the burning question of whether there is a toggle for Omnimovement in Black Ops 6. The short answer is no, as it is a “core foundational mechanic” of the game and cannot be turned off. However, the ‘Intelligent Movement’ feature can be turned on or off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Intelligent Movement is “a suite of player settings” focused on reducing button presses. It is similar to an auto-sprint or an auto-mantle but explicitly designed to work with Black Ops 6’s Omnimovement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These changes seem exciting, and players can form their own opinions once the Black Ops 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-beta-dates-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Beta kicks off in September</a>. Also, Matthew ‘FormaL’ Piper recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/formal-return-to-cod-black-ops-cod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased his return to Call of Duty</a> with Black Ops 6. </p>

                <p>The next big Baldur's Gate 3 patch is arriving in September. With it comes a big quality-of-life change for split-screen play, extended evil endings, the game's modding toolkit, and a number of bug fixes. You can even register on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> to try out the patch ahead of time.</p><p>The patch will add an option for split-screen co-op where the split-screen will merge if both characters are in the same area. This will perhaps save you some visual headaches and confusion in battle sequences or elsewhere. You can toggle the option directly in the main HUD or within the game settings.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why Baldur's Gate 3 Is GameSpot's Game Of The Year 2023</p>
      </div>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-adds-even-more-evil-endings/1100-6522767/" data-ref-id="1100-6522767">previously teased</a>, the patch will add some extensive evil-ending cinematics, including new ones for Origin Characters and The Dark Urge. The new teaser GIFs show the player-character lounging lazily, surrounded by corpses and levitating above an army which stomps their spears in unison. The Honour Mode difficulty will also see some improvements. More creatures will get legendary actions, making a number of the game's bosses and encounters even more fiendish.</p><p>The same patch will also see the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-an-official-modding-toolkit-in-upcoming-patch-7/1100-6523885/" data-ref-id="1100-6523885">the game's modding toolkit</a>. Larian claims the toolkit will help modders do everything they want to make new content for the game including new items, cosmetics, class/subclasses, races, and quality-of-life and UI improvements.</p><p>Finally, the patch will introduce a number of fixes to Dark Urge and Origin character playthroughs, some of which are cosmetic, alongside repairs to unactivated triggers and even kissing-related fixes.</p><p>You can read more details about the upcoming patch in Larian's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4240783699885624491" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. The post also teases additions that may be coming to future patches, including cross-play and a photo mode.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-escalation-mode-disabled</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valorant-escalation-mode-disabled-indefinitely-as-patch-9-01-lands.928581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-escalation-mode-disabled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced that it has indefinitely disabled the&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>Escalation gameplay mode while it investigates "an issue".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1812940198076162373" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), Riot says Escalation won't be available across any of the platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>is playable while the studio investigates this "issue". It doesn't provide any further information regarding what the issue might be.</p>
<p>Riot also says that Escalation will be back in Patch 9.03, but we're not sure when that will be landing either. Judging by the timing of previous&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>updates, you can expect to wait around a month for it, so it looks like Escalation won't be back until at least mid-August.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant-escalation-disabled-lotus-console.jpg?itok=eTN65j5m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant-escalation-disabled-lotus-console.jpg?itok=eKD8VrdE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>players on console are getting the Lotus map with the game's latest update.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that Riot hasn't provided any further details, it looks like we'll just have to wait and see what the issue was that caused Escalation to be disabled.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can pore over the <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-901/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes for Patch 9.01</a>, which was released earlier today. This being a relatively incremental patch, there aren't many earth-shattering changes, but there are plenty of bug fixes and balance adjustments.</p>
<p>Console players, for instance, can now play on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant">the Lotus map</a> across the game's Unrated, Competitive, Swift Play, and Deathmatch modes (although Deathmatch has also been temporarily disabled on consoles, owing once again to "an issue").</p>
<p>Other minor changes include an updated Outlaw animation that makes it "more apparent when the weapon is ready to be fired", as well as tons of bug fixes and small Agent changes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant-escalation-disabled-neon.jpg?itok=duoRjXfX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant-escalation-disabled-neon.jpg?itok=KaaGr7Bi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Neon is just one of the Agents to get some changes in&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>Patch 9.01.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>, it's a free-to-play hero shooter that blends the character-based abilities of&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>with the objective-focused gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike</em>.</p>
<p>The game features a number of Agents, each of which has different abilities to help them triumph over their opponents. Gameplay takes place across a number of labyrinthine maps with lots of winding corridors and opportunities to ambush your enemies.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a>. If you're hesitant to take the plunge on console, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/valorant-console-preview-one-tap-b-plant-no-cap">check out our preview</a> to see how well the game makes the jump from PC.</p>

Flock is the latest from Hohokum creator Richard Hogg. "It's a game about wildlife and it's a game about collecting stuff," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flock-review-the-art-of-noticing">Flock review</a>. "But it's also, serving as bedrock for all of that other stuff, a game about noticing. Its world is there to reveal itself to you, but only when you're ready. Only when you're in sync, only when you're properly attuned."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-of-hinterberg-is-about-a-holiday-which-is-why-everything-feels-so-important">Dungeons of Hinterberg</a> is a hotly-anticipated indie about dungeon crawling in the Austrian alps, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-gets-release-date">Kunitsu-Gami</a> is an action tower defence game steeped in Japanese folklore. Both look absolutely worthy of your time.
</p>
<p>
The following games will also be leaving Game Pass on 31st July:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A Short Hike (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Train Sim World 4 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Venba (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Xbox Game Pass is soon to undergo a big change, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">ditch day one releases for its basic tier</a> and instead save them for Game Pass Ultimate.

Then, Criston Cole arrives back in King’s Landing parading the corpse of Meleys. This display disgusts the smallfolk who see the dead dragon as a dark omen. They realize the Gods of the sky are “just meat,” a thing they are grossly lacking due to the blockade.<br></p><p>King Aegon’s injured body is tended by the maesters, and the worst two minutes of medieval medicine ASMR ever ensues. Aemond looks on from the foot of Aegon’s bed, satisfied with himself. The Kinslayer may be upgraded to Kingslayer, to Alicent’s absolute horror.<br></p><p>The Team Black Council is up to their usual bickering. Yet, this episode focuses on how Ser Alfred dismisses Rhaenyra’s ideas and viewpoints due to her being a member of “the gentler sex.” The Team Black Council may bend the knee to the Queen, but they will not let go of the patriarchy.</p><p>Daemond’s drug-fueled gap year in Harrenhal continues. He mediates between the Blackwoods and the Brackens through sinister plots. The Brackens won’t bend the knee alongside the Blackwoods so Daemon suggests that Ser Ben Blackwood take other “persuasive” measures to get them to heel.</p><p>Rhaena arrives in the Eyrie and becomes Lady Jeyn Arryn’s ward. However, Lady Jeyn does not feel protected by the mere dragon eggs sent. While Rhaenyra lacks allies in her male council, Mysaria reminds Rhaenyra of the biggest asset in the war: the smallfolk. Since Otto Hightower lost his position on Team Green, there has not been any challenger to stoke the propaganda war. “To the discontented, rumors are feed,” Mysaria advises. Rhaenyra’s maid, Elinda, is sent to King’s Landing to start the gossip.</p><p>Alys Rivers has been augmenting Daemon’s reality in Harrenhal. She also has been reading Freud because, in this episode’s most WTF scene, Daemon dreams of bedding a silver-haired woman revealed to be his dead mother. Later on, he hears distant cries and screams of the innocent. Despite Daemon’s insecurities and anxieties being exploited by Rivers, he becomes more reckless and publicly vies for the throne.</p><p>The Green Council reports that Aegon is alive but cannot rule in a coma. Alicent offers to return to her role as regent to the King, but the men in the room reject it. Alicent’s only allies, Larys and Cole, agree that a woman should not rule and Aemond fits better. The camera zooms in slowly on Alicent as she sits, fuming at being dismissed and fearing her violent son at the head of the table. This shot is begging for a <em>Kill Bill</em> fan edit.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="fa32e2222f44cb34c4ffe3efb4e25c00" data-recommend-id="image://fa32e2222f44cb34c4ffe3efb4e25c00" data-format="jpg" data-width="1583" data-height="886" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A crowd jostles in a scene from House of the Dragon S2 Episode 5" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A crowd jostles in a scene from House of the Dragon S2 Episode 5" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ollie Upton / HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa32e2222f44cb34c4ffe3efb4e25c00" data-recommend-id="image://fa32e2222f44cb34c4ffe3efb4e25c00" data-format="jpg" data-width="1583" data-height="886" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A crowd jostles in a scene from House of the Dragon S2 Episode 5" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We get a continuation of the blacksmith family storyline from Episode 2. The daughter is sick and the wife wants to flee King’s Landing. There is no food and the blacksmith is still waiting for King Aegon to fulfill his union demands. However, when they try to escape, King’s Landing is barricaded. The restless crowd cries and chants “meat.”<br></p><p>Cole’s strategy may have lost him the smallfolk but his strategies have all changed since seeing dragons battle. There is no choice but to succumb to the mighty beasts, and Aemond will keep the battles coming.<br></p><p>Jace meets with the Freys and strikes a deal; The Freys will inherit Harrenhal if they bend the knee for Rhaenyra. This is the worst real estate deal ever because Harrenhal barely functions.</p><p>Rhaena tells Lord Corlys that Rhaenyra wants him to be the Queen’s Hand and gives a beautiful speech about supporting Rhaenyra’s ascent to the throne. Rhaena knows her role enough to reject being the Driftmark heir. She is of blood and fire.</p><p>Rhaenyra gets the annoying Ser Alfred off her back and sends him to bring her husband back from his nightmare vacation. Daemon’s crimes against humanity strategy fails as the Brackens and Blackwoods get him out of bed to bicker with each other in his presence. Finally, the Brackens and the Blackwoods agree on one thing: they will not fight one another under the same Team Black banner. </p><p>Aemond contently sits on the Iron Throne for the first time. Our prophetic Queen Halaena chillingly asks him if the seat was “worth the price.” We’ll have to see what her comment will yield in Aemond’s future.<br></p><p>The episode ends with Jace and Rhaenyra devising a strategy to strengthen their army. Team Black is blessed with dragons but short on Dragonriders. Jace suggests going down the Targaryen bloodline in other houses to find riders.</p><p>This week Alicent has lost power while Rhaenrya took her power. But how will that play when Daemon comes back? It begs the question: Has Daemon’s time in Harrenhal been a boring waste (as some fans feel) or is it subduing Team Black’s biggest liability thanks to the witch? Or are we just building to the Daemon v Aemond fight that those characters want so badly?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to a variety of reports, renowned animation and VFX team Axis Studios is officially going into administration, affecting 162 employees.</p>



<p>Axis Studios contributed animation and VFX work for a range of media such as gaming, film, television, and more. The large team offered many jobs in Scotland. </p>



<p>Gaming fans will recognize Axis Studios for its iconic work on various trailers and cinematics. Some of the IP that Axis Studios worked on included Dead Island, Destiny, Halo, League of Legends, and more. Recent work includes the outstanding footage for Destiny 2 Lightfall.</p>



<p>Axis Studios’ cinematic trailer for Dead Island 2 impressed many fans and built a lot of hype in 2019.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dead Island 2" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WKsSnEawsNo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In a new report <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gvqlezn1o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the BBC</a>, administrators Interpath Advisory “confirmed 162 members of staff have lost their jobs immediately, with four people being retained to help wind up the business.” </p>



<p>Alistair McAlinden of Interpath Advisory reportedly explained that “Axis has more recently been impacted by a decline in customer projects.” They also cited “increases in labour costs which have resulted in severe cash flow problems.”</p>



<p>Joint administrator Geoff Jacobs also mentioned plans to “give employees support.” They also invited parties interested in the studio’s live projects to reach out.</p>



<p>At this time, the Axis Studios website is no longer operating as it goes into administration. The studio was founded over two decades ago, in 2000.</p>

<p>Last year, with the launch of the iPhone 15, Apple announced that a slew of AAA games would be heading to the top-tier models of the next-generation phone – and the top model of the latest iPad. To that end, games like Assassin’s Creed Mirage, Death Stranding, and Resident Evil Village were all lined up to be delivered to Apple fans worldwide, but almost every game to be released on the platform has fallen flat on its face.</p>



<p>The latest estimates suggest that Resident Evil 7, the latest release on iOS, has secured fewer than 2,000 sales, netting Capcom a measly $28,140.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-small-fry">Small Fry</h2>



<p>It’s to be expected, right?</p>



<p>While mobile gaming is the most lucrative market in the wider industry, AAA games coming to the iPhone 15 Pro (and similar models) will attract few sales based on how niche that audience is. Even so, Resident Evil 7 securing just 2,000 sales (which is a generous estimate <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/under-2000-people-have-paid-to-play-resident-evil-7-on-ios-estimates-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to MobileGamer.biz</a>) is pretty miserable. </p>



<p>It was further estimated that around 83,000 downloads of Resident Evil 7 have taken place on iOS, but the vast majority of those downloads – which give access to a demo of the game – aren’t converting into full sales.</p>



<p>Last month, figures emerged suggesting that every other game released on the super-powered iOS-backed devices has floundered. Assassin’s Creed Mirage had racked up fewer than 3,000 sales after several weeks on the market, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ios-games-sales-bombing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">despite being downloaded around 123,000 times</a>. It was a worse story with Resident Evil 4 – that zombie-slaying title was downloaded 350,000 times but fewer than 7,000 full sales were estimated.</p>



<p>Ultimately, they’re ports, they’re not perfect, and they still boast premium price tags. You’ll be hard-pressed to find people willing to pay $49.99 to play a seven-year-old Resident Evil game on a phone.</p>

True football fans will likely be able to identify all of the trophies featured in the cover, but for us Americans, it certainly looks like an impressive spread indeed.</p><p>This cover is our first official look at FC 25, but details are thin on the ground for the game as a whole. Publisher EA indicated in the above social media post that there will be a full reveal on July 17. A leak from <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dealabs.com%2Fmagazine%2Fon-vous-devoile-la-date-de-sortie-de-ea-sports-fc-25-54912&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffc-25-tries-something-different-with-its-ultimate-edition-cover%2F1100-6525005%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">earlier this month</a> suggested that the release date for EA Sports FC 25 will be September 27, 2024, which is in line with the best-selling franchise's typical drop dates. However, as usual, it remains unconfirmed. Ahead of FC 25's release, EA will launch both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-25/" data-ref-id="5000-618409">College Football 25</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-25/" data-ref-id="5000-629476">Madden NFL 25</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-games-should-have-a-kick-button.928548/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/anger-foot-dark-messiah-kick-button<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These days, there are as many video games as there are grains of sand on a beach. The sheer breadth of experiences on offer boggles the mind. Depending on the game, I can run, jump, and shoot, or I can eschew violence entirely to chat up random passersby. I can play music. I can build worlds. I can lose myself in abstract imagery. I can solve problems as I please or be taken by the hand and guided through an experience. All of these approaches to game design are valid, but also, every video game should have a kick button.</p><p>I’ve been playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978590/Anger_Foot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Anger Foot</em></a>, a new first-person action game in which your main means of interacting with the world is a swift boot to the face, and it has reinforced one of my longest-held beliefs: a dedicated kick button elevates any game that it’s in. In <em>Anger Foot</em>, perhaps the apex of this trend, kicks send dudes, garbage, and everything in between flying. The game’s pace is reminiscent of <em>Hotline Miami</em>, albeit in first-person; you blaze through dingy apartments and across trash-strewn rooftops clapping enemies before they clap you, with split-second miscalculations meaning certain death.&nbsp;</p><p>Each level is made up of numerous mini encounters – various combinations of bat-swinging alligators, gun-toting goons, shield-obscured SWAT cops, and multiple enemy types that are liable to explode – but almost every single one begins with a kick. Levels are chock full of doors. If you kick one down, odds are, shit’s about to get wacky. Hordes of enemies throw themselves at you, and the soundtrack morphs from a pulsing beat into a full-on cacophony. Then, several additional kicks (and maybe a few gunshots) later, everything calms down, and you can exhale.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Anger Foot Launch Trailer | Out Now on PC" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kJo0miz08g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This simple rhythm makes for an experience that’s compulsively propulsive. Behind each door, a new thunderclap of violence awaits. Even the simple action of kicking doors feels good. They splinter – practically shatter – when brought into contact with your wriggly green toes. Enemies, tables, toilets, trash cans, shopping carts, and pretty much anything else you can imagine similarly ricochets away as though it’s been hit by an eighteen-wheeler, each with its own crunchy, punchy sound effects. Sometimes things you’ve kicked hit walls. Other times they go sailing down stairs or off buildings. This is a game that wants you to survey its world, take in all the clever little details, and think “What would happen if I kicked that?”&nbsp;</p><p><em>Anger Foot</em> has caused me to hark back to one of my happiest early gaming memories: playing <em>Dark Messiah of Might and Magic</em> on the PC at my mom’s house as a teenager. That game wasn’t quite so narrowly focused on kicking, but it nonetheless allowed you to do so whenever you pleased. This, combined with sophisticated physics (for the time), meant I would regularly toy with my orc foes by letting them chase me up flights of stairs and then, just as they were about to catch me, kicking them back down. They’d proceed to dust themselves off and drag their measurably more mangled bodies in my direction again, only to receive another kick for their troubles. I’d repeat this as many times as necessary, cackling the entire time, because teenagers are evil.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m going to take this a step further: As far as I’m concerned, the shove from <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> is a kick. This is because the best kicks are a means to the end of creating one or more additional funny collisions. In <em>Anger Foot</em>, kicks send doors crashing into enemies, who in turn wilt against whichever wall they’ve been pinned to. In <em>Dark Messiah</em>, kicks caused big, burly dudes to take laughably ungraceful tumbles down stairs or into spike traps. In<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, shoves, which are kicks, send enemies – even bosses, in some cases – off ledges onto the cold, hard ground or into endless abysses, never to be seen again. Every time you do it, you come away feeling devious, like you’ve gotten away with an affront to God and game designers alike. And yet, the game was designed with this exact thing in mind! It is ingenious.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe that’s why video game kicks rule so hard: They feel unfair – like a dirty trick that only the player can take full advantage of. Parrying a blade is elegant, an act of beautiful precision. Kicking somebody who just parried a blade in the stomach is classless. But I don’t want to be classy; I want to win. And laugh at somebody falling down the stairs.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/free-codes-for-zenless-zone-zero-polychromes-dennies-and-more/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/free-codes-for-zenless-zone-zero-%E2%80%93-polychromes-dennies-and-more.928530/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/free-codes-for-zenless-zone-zero-polychromes-dennies-and-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you've been stuck in <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/five-things-to-know-before-playing-zenless-zone-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenless Zone Zero</a> but lack resources, do not panic. Luckily, miHoYo has been kind enough to put out free codes that you can redeem in-game, which can help you get various rewards.</p>
<p>These rewards can help you get hands-on resources such as Polychrome, Dennies, and Investigator Logs, which are helpful if you want to progress in your game. Be warned, though. They have a limited amount of time for you to use them before they expire and will no longer give you rewards if you try to redeem them in Zenless Zone Zero.</p>
<h2>All Free Codes for Zenless Zone Zero</h2>
<ul>
<li>KANURBT5MQ8D - 40 Polychromes</li>
<li>USNC9SB4499R - 6 W-Engine Power Supply</li>
<li>NB6D9SB4MPSZ - 6 Crystallized Plating Agents</li>
<li>4BPDRBT459RH - 6000 Dennies</li>
<li>NS6U9TTLM6AV - 2 Bangboo Algorithm Module</li>
<li>XTNDQAS44985 - 4 Official Investigator Logs</li>
<li>CATCHABOO - 30 Polychromes</li>
<li>ZENLESSGIFT - 50 Polychromes, 2 Official Investigator Logs, 3 W-Engine Power Supply, 1 Bangboo Algorithm Module</li>
<li>ZENLESSLAUNCH - 60 Polychromes and 6666 Dennies</li>
</ul>
<p>These codes can only be redeemed once per account, so you won't be able to get these rewards more than once if you try to redeem them multiple times.</p>
<h2>How to Redeem Codes in Zenless Zone Zero</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Due to the layout of the menus in the game, it may seem a little bit daunting trying to figure out how you are meant to redeem codes in Zenless Zone Zero. Don't panic; these steps will walk you through how to get your hands on those free resources.</p>
<p>First and most importantly, you need to reach Inter-Knot level 5. This is quickly done and can be done within the first couple of hours of the game or less.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the in-game menu in the left-hand corner by pressing ESC on PC, options on PlayStation 5, or tapping the button on mobile.</li>
<li>Select 'More.'</li>
<li>Select 'Redemption Code.'</li>
<li>Copy and paste the code into the available text box.</li>
<li>Select 'Redeem'.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to other<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-link-psn-to-hoyoverse-id/"> HoYoverse games</a>, you won't need to unlock the mailbox function, as it will already be available as soon as you start playing Zenless Zone Zero. This is where your rewards will go once you have redeemed them.</p>
<p>You can also redeem the codes via the <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/redemption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenless Zone Zero website</a>. To do this, you must log in to your HoYoverse account.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to the Zenless Zone Zero redemption website.</li>
<li>Select your server and character nickname.</li>
<li>Enter the redemption code into the text box.</li>
<li>Press 'Redeem.'</li>
<li>Check your in-game mailbox to get your freebies.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with most games that have access to redemption codes, they are due to expire. Some codes that were available for Zenless Zone Zero have already expired. They will be listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>NIJIZZZ</li>
<li>ZZZFREE100</li>
<li>ZZZTVCM</li>
<li>ZZZ2024</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide will be updated as soon as new codes are released or as current codes expire so that you don't waste your time trying to get resources from an invalid code.</p>

When I checked the Tiltify page this morning the high bids had all been wiped, but then came back a few minutes later. At the time of writing, the top bids were dominated by user “@haryvibes on X” and user “pls sex me poki.” </p><p>At least it’s all for a good cause. The auction ends on July 19. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When Gears of War: E-Day was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-official-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced back in June</a>, many fans wondered if it would be a console exclusive to Xbox or if a PlayStation release would also happen. Fast-forward a month later and a job posting is hinting at a possible release on Sony’s platform.</p>



<p>The Coalition is looking <a href="https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/job/1729899/Senior-Online-Client-Engineer---Gears-of-War-%E2%80%93-The-Coalition">for a senior online client engineer</a> to work on Gears of War: E-Day. This position, according to the post, will “help build the multiplayer and online experience” of the game, including “in-game economies and commerce, session management, player statistics, user generated content, and matchmaking”. </p>



<p>As part of the preferred qualifications for the job, the listing mentions prior experience working with online platforms such as Xbox Live, Steam, and, yes, the PlayStation Network (PSN). </p>



<p>While having experience with PSN doesn’t necessarily confirm that a PlayStation launch of the game is guaranteed, it’s interesting enough that it was specifically mentioned. We know the game is certain for Xbox and Steam, which is why it makes sense to see it in the listing.</p>

                <p>If you're in the market for a new wireless gaming headset, there's good news: The console variants of Razer's flagship BlackShark V2 Pro headset are seeing a pretty hefty discount this week at Best Buy. Both the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1838999239400000010%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Frazer-blackshark-v2-pro-headset-gets-big-discount-for-first-time-on-prime-day%2F1100-6524981%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X|S BlackShark</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1847980274346195567%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Frazer-blackshark-v2-pro-headset-gets-big-discount-for-first-time-on-prime-day%2F1100-6524981%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5 BlackShark</a> headsets are newer to the market and haven't seen any discounts previously, but both have had their prices slashed by $50 as part of Best Buy's sale to compete with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a>.</p><p>The BlackShark V2 Pro headset has been around for a bit, but the console variants are fairly new and include a few additional features. Both support 2.4GHz wireless connections using a USB-C dongle that's included with the headsets, or with Bluetooth 5.2, and Razer says both can provide up to 70 hours of battery life. They also offer a detachable unidirectional microphone and use 50mm audio drivers. You can get them in either white or black.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4334827-razer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4334827" data-ratio="0.82802547770701" data-width="1099" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4334827-razer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4334827"></a><figcaption>Razer BlackShark V2 Pro for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4334827-razer.jpg"></figure><p>There are some key differences between the headsets, though. The Xbox version works with Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, PC, Mac, and mobile--but only supports Windows spatial audio on the Xbox systems, PC, Mac, and mobile, not the PlayStation consoles. Meanwhile, the PlayStation version works with PS5, PS4, PC, Mac, and mobile, but not the Xbox consoles. That headset also is compatible with the Sony's 3D spatial audio.</p><p>Whichever headset you're going for, though, the discount here is pretty significant. Best Buy is knocking $50 off the usual $200 price tag, bringing the cost of each headset down to $150.

                <p>For virtual reality fans, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a> is one of the best days of the year when it comes to upgrading your VR experience. You can't go wrong with the Meta Quest 3, and a solid set of earbuds helps to make that technology more immersive. Normally $80, the surprisingly versatile <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B87MQG2N?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="nofollow ">Soundcore VR P10 earbuds</a> are now on sale for <strong>$50</strong>.</p><p>These are officially licensed to work with Meta Quest 2 and Quest 3 headsets, but they're also compatible with PC, PlayStation, Switch, and other consoles capable of receiving a Bluetooth signal. This sadly rules out Xbox due to its proprietary tech for wireless headsets, but it still makes for a flexible set of earbuds overall.</p><p>For the tech specs, these wireless gaming earbuds use a 2.4GHz high-speed wireless connection, custom chipset, LC3 codec for fast audio transfer, and 11mm drivers to deliver some deep bass to your ears. It's worth mentioning that the 128GB Meta Quest 3 is currently $430 (normally $500) for Prime Day, and a few other accessories have been discounted as well. The default headstrap on the Quest 3 is not <em>great</em>, but the optional <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-3-Elite-Strap/dp/B0CD15C641?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elite Strap is much better</a> and has been slightly discounted to $60.</p><h2>Prime Day VR Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3 (128GB)</a> -- $430 ($<strike>500</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-3-Elite-Strap/dp/B0CD15C641?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3 Elite Strap</a> -- $60 ($<strike>70</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y2GDXMC?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3 Blood Orange strap</a> -- $24 ($<strike>50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092LBLT7P?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HTC Vive Pro 2 VR headset</a> -- $550 ($<strike>800</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FPCT3H8?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HTC Vive Pro 2 VR system</a> -- $1,000 ($<strike>1,400</strike>)</li></ul><p>This is far more comfortable, much easier to adjust to your head size, and it comes with an extra battery for when you're looking to enjoy a longer VR session. If you just want a different strap and in a more vibrant color, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y2GDXMC?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon is offering one</a> with the metal color scheme of "blood orange" for the discounted price of $24 (normally $50). There's also an alternative VR headset on sale for Prime Day, and if you're looking to experience virtual reality in <em>5</em>K, you'll want to check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092LBLT7P?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HTC Vive Pro 2</a>. It very rarely gets a discount, but right now, you can save $250 when you purchase this advanced piece of hardware.</p><p>For more, have a look at our picks for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-amazon-prime-day-deals/2900-5592/" data-ref-id="2900-5592">best Prime Day deals</a> available so far.</p><hr>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/manor-lords-publisher-announces-literal-cat-and-mouse-city-builder-whiskerwood.928485/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-publisher-whiskerwood-city-builder<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>publisher Hooded Horse has announced brand new city builder&nbsp;<em>Whiskerwood</em>, which apparently didn't get the memo that "a game of cat and mouse" is supposed to be metaphorical.</p>
<p>Developed by Minakata Dynamics, whose work you'll know if you've played train strategy sim&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1355090/RAILGRADE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Railgrade</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Whiskerwood</em>&nbsp;sees you constructing a home for a colony of industrious mice who are laboring under the "oppressive paw of their cat overlords".</p>
<p>Minakata Dynamics promises the ability to eventually decide whether you want to keep working under the cats' yoke or to "raise whiskers in defiance", so it sounds like you'll be able to lead some sort of rebellion against your feline masters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/whiskerwood-hooded-horse-city.jpg?itok=ZFMhpdpP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/whiskerwood-hooded-horse-city.jpg?itok=bu345fhE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Whiskerwood&nbsp;</em>is an actual cat-and-mouse city builder.</figcaption></figure><p>In gameplay terms, if you've played games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/timberborn"><em>Timberborn</em></a>, then you'll know roughly what to expect from&nbsp;<em>Whiskerwood</em>.</p>
<p>The devs promise "complex simulations" and "supply chain management dealing with over 40 commodities", so if building the perfect logistical operation is something that presses your gaming buttons, this one's definitely for you.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, you'll also be able to build both upwards and downwards in order to "maximize space", leading to cities that ask you to build "up into the sky" and to burrow "deep underground". I suppose the latter, at least, is sort of in keeping with the rodent theme.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/whiskerwood-hooded-horse-gameplay.jpg?itok=6GA0M_j6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/whiskerwood-hooded-horse-gameplay.jpg?itok=QN9294NU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love logistics-based city builders, this one's for you.</figcaption></figure><p>As you play, you'll also come across other factions of mice, and it's up to you whether you want to try and befriend them or move straight to hostility to defend your settlement.</p>
<p>Of course, there'll be a tech tree to work your way through, as well as a "strategic layer to expand influence beyond the colony". In short, this sounds like another Hooded Horse hit, especially if you're into&nbsp;<em>Ghost of a Tale&nbsp;</em>or the&nbsp;<em>Redwall&nbsp;</em>novels.</p>
<p><em>Whiskerwood&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> "soon", although no release date has been announced yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>
