		<p>KUNOS Simulazioni has released a new video for Assetto Corsa Evo, which explains what players should expect when the game launches into Steam Early Access on January 16th. The video is hosted by Marco Massarutto, the studio’s Co-Founder and Executive Manager, who touches on subjects like the dynamic weather, the tracks, the cars, and the game modes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assetto Corsa EVO - Everything You Need To Know" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jH5hZqNirVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>When Assetto Corsa Evo releases into early access there will be 20 cars to choose from. From previous trailers some of the cars that have been shown include the Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA, Alpine A110, Alpine A290_β, Hyundai N Vision 74, Hyundai i20 N, Hyundai i30 N, Lamborghini Huracán STO, Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.5-16 Evolution II – specifically the 452nd of 500 road legal cars produced, Porsche 911 (930), and Porsche 911 GT3 Cup (992). The brands that have been confirmed for Assetto Corsa Evol are Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Alpine, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Ferrari, Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Lamborghini, Lancia, Lotus, Maserati, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mini, Morgan, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.</p>
<p>Five tracks will be part of the first phase of Assetto Corsa Evo’s early access, on which you can drive the above cars on. Those tracks are Laguna Seca,&nbsp; Brands Hatch, Imola, Mount Panorama, and Suzuka Circuit. The open world side of the game, which is based in the Eifel region in Germany and includes the Nürburgring, is not due until the summer of 2025. This release will be done in stages instead of the whole map coming out in one go, allowing the team to expand and release content while addressing any issues that come up. The open world will include places where cars can be rented, and retailers that will sell upgrades.</p>
<p>The single player modes will include practice sessions, and the new Driving Academy mode. Driving Academy will let you learn each track using various cars, as well as having challenges to complete. There is also a time attack mode. As challenges are beat, licenses are unlocked while allows access to more cars. Assetto Corsa Evo has a new DirectX 12 graphics engine developed by Kunos specifically for racing games. This engine powers the dynamic weather system, which has everything from clear weather to storms. The lighting will also simulate real life with reflections and shadows being accurately generated to provide a real life look to race proceedings. The track conditions will be affected by wet weather and rubber build up, which in turn will impact how the cars perform. Players will notice better driving simulation too due to improved suspension, more realistic tyre behaviours, and how different parts of cars interact with each other in changing conditions.</p>

<p>Assetto Corsa EVO’s full release is scheduled for Autumn 2025, include 100 cars, 15 officially licensed race tracks, and the open world. More tracks will be added post full launch, and all of these will be free updates.</p>

		<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is a getting a free trial weekend on PS5, with players able to sample all of the game from December 27th to December 31st. There are plans for an Xbox Series X|S and PC free trial, but that will not be this weekend and a date is yet to be confirmed. To take part on PS5, all you will have to do is download <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown trial version</a> off the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p><iframe title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown - Season 2 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L58fbjTNOT0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown’s free trial weekend includes access to the season 2 features, adding Ibiza as another location to drive around in, as well as Hong Kong. Though to get to Ibiza, players will need to reach level 12, as well as side with either the Sharps or the Streets clans. Ibiza also adds new cars, alongside the roster of cars available in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown released in September, and met with middling reviews due to a number of issues. Since then, KT Racing has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-first-patch-notes/">sought to fix the issues</a> that players had concerns about, including the suspension on cars, AI behaviours, and more support for various racing wheels. In our review of the game, Stefan said, <em>“After years and years of waiting, Test Drive Unlimited is back. Kind of. Solar Crown is an open world racer for gamers who don’t need constant gratification, but can be patient and work toward a key unlock and crowning car. It’s just a shame that the game at launch will require patience while KT Racing fix, improve and hopefully expand it to meet more of its potential.”</em></p>

Yet, in recent years, we’ve seen a trend of animated movies and franchises being remade in live-action (or, sometimes, CGI that’s meant to mimic live action with its realism), like Disney’s <em>The Lion King</em> or Universal’s upcoming<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-to-train-your-dragon-live-action-trailer-2025-httyd-1851703309&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-train-your-dragon-live-action-trailer-2025-httyd-1851703309"><em>How To Train Your Dragon</em></a></span>. So you might wonder if Wallace and his silent dog Gromit will ever get a live-action remake. According to the duo’s creator, Nick Park, that ain’t ever happening. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/movies/501986/wallace-gromit-netflix-live-action-disney-remake&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/501986/wallace-gromit-netflix-live-action-disney-remake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon </em>talked to Park about the upcoming <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em> movie</a></span>, <em>Vengeance Most Fowl, </em>and asked him about the possibility of the duo getting a fancy live-action remake. According to the outlet, his response was quick: </p><p> “Well, it’s quite an easy answer,” said Park. “NOOOOOOOO.” </p><p>Park isn’t against bringing the characters to more platforms and mediums. For example, there have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/wallace-and-gromits-grand-adventures&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/wallace-and-gromits-grand-adventures"><em>Wallace &amp; Gromit </em>video games</a></span>. But when it comes to the big movies and shorts, Park thinks the characters will “always be clay.” </p><p> “I think [the clay] is part of the character, it’s part of their soul to be that medium. It’s what they were born out of and [losing the clay] might take something away. It’s quite hard to define. ‘Thumby and funny’ is the phrase we’ve often used.”</p><p>While <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em> won’t be making the leap to live action anytime soon, Disney is continuing to push ahead with its attempts at turning its popular animated features into live-action hits.

The Chat submenu allows you to enable or disable the following message types:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Friend Whisper Messages</li><li>Team Messages</li><li>Event Messages</li><li>Faction Messages</li><li>Spectator Messages</li></ul><p>Curiously, there doesn’t seem to be a way to automatically disable chat from the enemy’s team.

<p>With the absolute smash month that is February 2025, in which we see the release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Civilization VII, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, and Avowed, March may appear like a lightweight initially. The month does feature a few big releases, like Two Point Museum and Atomfall, but they’re more niche. No matter, the biggest video game releases in March 2025 still look enticing!</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a slew of AAA releases in the month of March, then you’re going to be sorely disappointed. But if you want a few indie and AA titles to round out your library and provide a little break from the big studio releases before summer, then March definitely has you covered!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Two Point Museum</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 4, 2025</li>

<h2 id="h-looking-forward-to-april-2025">Looking Forward to April 2025</h2>

(Spoilers, its not good!) In 2021, the PS3 servers for 2014's<em> LittleBigPlanet 3 </em>were shut down due to DDoS attacks. Then in January 2024, due to technical issues, the <em>LBP3 </em>PS4 servers were taken down “temporarily.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/littlebigplanet-3-ps4-servers-sony-playstation-1851423658&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/littlebigplanet-3-ps4-servers-sony-playstation-1851423658">However, in April, Sony announced</a></span> that the servers were going to stay offline permanently.

It was a sad ending for a once-popular franchise. But a small indie team’s new game might provide a happy ending after all. </p><p>Announced way back in 2020, <em>Restitched </em>is an upcoming PC game that looks a lot like<em> LittleBigPlanet</em>. It features a stuffed teddy bear as its main character and will let players create new levels and maps to share online via the Steam Workshop. </p><p>Here’s the new trailer for <em>Restitched:</em></p><p>It’s impossible to not notice how similar this game is to Sony’s <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>. According to Trixel Creative, the small team behind the project, they were fans of <em>LBP </em>and many played it years ago. But Trixel Creative claims <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.trixelcreative.com/restitched/press&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.trixelcreative.com/restitched/press" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Restitched</em></a></span> isn’t just about remaking <em>LBP </em>on PC. </p><p>“Some may think we’re creating <em>Restitched </em>just to bring the same experience to the PC, but that couldn’t be further from the truth,” explained the studio in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.trixelcreative.com/restitched/faq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.trixelcreative.com/restitched/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ on the game’s website</a></span>. “This genre of gaming is largely unexplored, and we love the concept so much that we think there is room for multiple titles to explore it!”</p><p>“Games like <em>LittleBigPlanet </em>have nurtured many creative minds and offered a way for all ages to realize their imagination,” the FAQ continues. “We aim to make a game that can do the same for PC players, albeit with our own unique innovations. We will always have massive admiration and respect for the genre-pioneer that is <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>, along with its many talented developers.”</p><p>The devs also claim this new game isn’t connected to a fan remake of <em>LittleBigPlanet </em>which was also called “Restitched” that was canceled by Sony lawyers in 2020. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-littlebigplanet-pc-fan-game-sony-shut-down-with-a-cease-and-desist&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-littlebigplanet-pc-fan-game-sony-shut-down-with-a-cease-and-desist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trixel Creative was the team behind that project</a></span>, too, and exactly how they are separated isn’t made clear on the team’s website. </p><p>When Trixel Creative starting working on <em>Restitched </em>in 2020, the <em>LBP </em>franchise was on life support. Now, four years later, Sony has pulled the plug on <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>, and <em>Restitched </em>could be the closest thing fans get to a full-on sequel. </p><p>There’s still no release date for <em>Restitched </em>and it sounds like the game won’t be arriving on consoles anytime soon. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361090/Restitched/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361090/Restitched/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can, however, wishlist it on Steam now</a></span>.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/walmart-restart-independent-video-games-journalism<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A season centered around a miraculous birth is in full swing, so it’s only fitting that a couple weeks ago, something verging on impossible happened: A company announced a new video game website. No, that’s not a typo; no, the company did not <em>shutter </em>the website, <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-closed-layoffs-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as tends to be the case</a> with alarming frequency these days. But there’s a catch: <a href="https://www.restart.run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Restart</a>, a publication that billed itself as “independent,” is sponsored by Walmart.</p><p>When a critical mass of video game journalists and industry figures took notice of Restart last week, they <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ohmymithrandir.bsky.social/post/3ldhe243b6c2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediately</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/renegadecut.bsky.social/post/3ldhbxultks2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voiced</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gamingonlinux.com/post/3ldhe4wqizc2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opposition</a> to that label. Walmart, after all, is about as far from independent as one can get. This seeming contradiction suffused the site’s identity. Initially, a banner at the top of the site read “Independent gaming news powered by Walmart,” but it was later changed to “Triple-I gaming news powered by Walmart.” (This, editor-in-chief Brandy Berthelson told Aftermath, was both an acknowledgement of the criticism and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/is-dave-the-diver-an-indie-game-i-would-say-no-says-game-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a nod to <em>Dave The Diver</em></a>, which similarly took flack for embracing an indie aesthetic while owing its existence to a corporate benefactor.)&nbsp;</p><p>Despite that bit of front-and-center branding, Restart staff attempted to distance themselves from Walmart’s influence out the gate.</p><p>“Restart is powered by Walmart, but Restart operates as an independent site,” editor-in-chief Brandy Berthelson wrote in <a href="https://www.restart.run/articles/welcome-to-restart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post introducing the site</a>. “When we mention a game, we'll provide purchase links that will take you to Walmart using a partner tracking code. This link provides us with 0% of the sale if you decide to buy the product, but it does help Walmart see exactly how customers arrived at the product. Walmart doesn't influence our editorial direction. We hope you can see this gives us zero incentive to provide biased review scores or other information about a game.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>I'd just rather them position themselves as that explicitly – an entertainment venture that might get some access because they're a marketing arm – rather than something 'independent.'</p></blockquote></figure><p>This disclaimer only led to more questions: Why stress that you’re not getting affiliate dollars from Walmart when the company is still ultimately footing the bills? How do you avoid a conflict of interest when, as stated, Restart is at its most beneficial to Walmart when people are clicking affiliate links and generating data? What, with that in mind, would incentivize you to ever publish negative reviews? And above all else, why suggest to prospective readers that you are “the video game industry’s latest (and in our humble opinion, greatest) independent source for gaming analysis and entertainment” when your corporate connection is clear as day?&nbsp;</p><p>John Warren, who headed up Tencent-owned gaming publication Fanbyte until the mega-corporation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/15/tencent-lays-off-nearly-all-of-staff-at-its-gaming-site-fanbyte/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off nearly all its staff in 2022</a>, can’t help but feel skeptical.</p><p>"While [Restart's] arrangement is different than Fanbyte's, in which Tencent directly owned and ultimately controlled the fate of the site, I still see parallels that tell me the positioning of Restart as ‘independent’ is extremely odd,” Warren told Aftermath. “Independent how? I'm not going to go to Restart for hard-hitting investigations or opinions because they've essentially stated we shouldn't expect it. ... That's actually totally fine! I'd just rather them position themselves as that explicitly – an entertainment venture that might get some access because they're a marketing arm – rather than something 'independent.'"</p><p>Waters were further muddied by the discovery that Restart is the product of Moonrock, a strategy and content marketing agency – something which, at first blush, would not seem to share the same goals as a more traditional news publisher. But those who run Restart – Berthelson and two other full-time writers, as well as editorial director John Benyamine and managing editor John Gaudiosi – have deep roots in games journalism, and they want to build a publication that serves readers, not just Walmart.</p><p>“When I left Gamer Network (which I loved), I went into content marketing with another company and, eventually, my partner and I started Moonrock. We wanted to use our now-50+ years of collective experience to help connect brands to gamers, and we decided we wanted to do that for brands that already understood the importance of gaming," Benyamine, who got his start at Nintendojo and went on to work at places like GameDaily, AOL Games, Joystiq, and the Gamer Network, told Aftermath. "There was also serendipity, as the same layoffs that prompted Moonrock’s creation also meant some amazing writers lost their jobs. We worked our asses off to make this natural connection happen. Talented, passionate writers who can create great content for an audience who will hopefully buy and preorder their games from the retailer funding the effort.”</p><p>As for why Benyamine chose not to go the <em>wholly </em>independent route, he’s seen – and worked at – too many sites that have crashed and burned while charting their own course.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“While launching Restart without a sponsor may be looked at as preferable, there’s the danger of getting into the trap of chasing traffic, making a poor user experience through more and more ads, and giving more work to fewer staff to make ends meet,” he said. “We weren’t interested in following the same path that has proven very difficult and sometimes fatal to some amazing publications."</p><p>But big money backers – even those who “get it,” as Benyamine insists Walmart does – don’t always make for lasting foundations. Restart’s closest well-known analog, Game Informer, <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-closed-layoffs-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently folded</a> despite a decades-long lifeline from GameStop, and major publications like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2023/03/31/launcher-mission-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington Post</a> (disclosure: I worked there) and <a href="https://aftermath.site/rolling-stone-glixel-savvy-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a> have abandoned gaming verticals at various points.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>We weren’t interested in following the same path that has proven very difficult and sometimes fatal to some amazing publications.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Restart’s staff isn’t harboring any delusions that Walmart will provide unconditional support.</p><p>“We would be naïve to think Restart can last forever if it underperforms, but thus far, through the building of the site and our few months in soft-launch, Walmart has been nothing but a supportive partner,” Berthelson told Aftermath. “‘Why would Walmart continue to fund Restart if the site underperforms?’ is a bridge we would cross if and when we had to cross it, but it helps that we – the Restart team at Moonrock – have our own standards and metrics for success we hold ourselves to, rather than being beholden to a list of [key performance indicators] from Walmart. The editorial team isn’t even aware of how poor the numbers would have to be before Walmart would consider pulling its funding.”</p><p>When it comes to affiliate links, Walmart’s main horse in this race, the matter is a little more complicated. In short, readers don’t have to click them, but it would be good if they did, and that would almost certainly please Walmart. Still, Berthelson believes that if she and her team create something worthwhile, the rest will come.</p><p>“If we can build a community of passionate gamers by sharing our opinions and recommendations, then of course we hope those readers will look to support our work by clicking the affiliate links we offer, and they will always have a choice regarding whether or not to do so,” Bertheleson said. “We can’t and would never force people to click our affiliate links or make a purchase after clicking them, but we will have those links there if they’re interested. Restart doesn’t receive any money when someone uses an affiliate link and buys a product on Walmart’s website. The links will simply tell Walmart where the shopper came from and will help Walmart see whether or not the site is achieving its goal of community building and outreach."</p><p>Berthelson added that Restart won’t shy away from negative reviews. Though the site’s review system only includes three badges – Required, Recommended, and Respectable – games that miss the mark won’t be awarded with any badge. She offered <a href="https://www.restart.run/articles/funko-fusion-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a (gently) critical review of <em>Funko Fusion</em></a> as an example.</p><p>“The three review badges are an alternative to having a 5- or 10-point scale, or a star-based scale, and is similar to how other sites may use word-based quality descriptors,” she said. “We took some inspiration from Eurogamer’s previous scoring system for that. If a game receives a negative review, it simply doesn’t receive a badge."</p><figure><blockquote><p>We would be naïve to think Restart can last forever if it underperforms, but thus far ... Walmart has been nothing but a supportive partner.</p></blockquote></figure><p>If you’ve made it this far and have come to the conclusion that Restart isn’t especially well equipped to challenge an industry prone to exploiting workers and audiences alike, you are correct. But as with spiritual forebears like Game Informer – or <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kyleor.land/post/3ldhddje7ea2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walmart’s own in-store magazine</a>, GameCenter, which ran until 2023 – that’s not really the goal.</p><p>“We know sites like Aftermath are better equipped for hard-hitting journalism,” said Benyamine. “Our focus is a bit simpler in covering and celebrating this passion of ours from a consumer perspective.”</p><p>Freelancers like Jason Fanelli also understand the assignment.</p><p>“From my experience, they have news pieces handled in-house for the most part, so whenever I pitch them, it would be for a review or preview opportunity. The occasional feature might play there too, but admittedly I pitch elsewhere for pieces like that,” Fanelli, who’s been writing about video games for 16 years and who has contributed to Restart, told Aftermath. “I'd agree that Restart isn't looking to do what [Jason] Schreier is doing, and that their content is more focused on the games themselves: news, reviews, previews, etc. I could be wrong, of course, and they could be working on the biggest exposé the industry has ever seen as we speak, but I wouldn't hold my breath.”</p><p>This gets to the core of the conflict around Restart: On one hand, a publication like this is far from unprecedented; just speaking from a personal standpoint, I grew up obsessively poring over Game Informer and its lesser-known Electronics Boutique equivalent GMR while, especially as I got older, recognizing that they existed in part to help sell video games. But while video game magazines and websites have always ridden various cascading waves of marketing hype, there used to be alternatives. Now publications fold on what feels like a regular basis, and traffic/SEO mandates have big sites cozying up more and more closely to corporate interests. </p><p>With a growing number of journalists out of work, companies like <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic</a>, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a>, and <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony</a> have also launched their own editorial efforts that use a similar voice and draw on some of the same talent primarily to sell games. Independent sites are few and far between because – per the <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">object lesson we’ve provided</a> – it’s really hard to do this kind of thing in the current landscape. That tension, perhaps more than Restart’s existence in a vacuum, has left a bad taste in the mouths of some industry figures.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Walmart money could fund valuable journalism, but it never will. That's the truth that's so frustrating for me and many others as it relates to Restart.</p></blockquote></figure><p>"My issue is, no one seems to want to fund investigations, reporting, and criticism,” said Warren. “Journalism is obviously in a terrible place everywhere, but games journalism is especially anemic right now. With all respect to the staff of Restart, I didn't recognize any of them as established journalists known for the kind of reporting that is being underfunded right now. Walmart money could fund valuable journalism, but it never will. That's the truth that's so frustrating for me and many others as it relates to Restart."</p><p>Does the video game industry at large <em>need </em>another Restart-shaped publication when the internet is already inundated with enthusiast sites, sludge farms, and content creators? No, probably not. But with walls closing in on writers of all stripes, the site offers <a href="https://www.restart.run/articles/restart-is-now-accepting-freelance-pitches" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a fresh source of income</a> for those still trying to hack it atop a rapidly-melting ice floe. That’s not nothing, especially considering <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the state of things elsewhere</a>.</p><p>"As a freelancer, my options for pitching features is a very small list – and most of the time I don’t even get a response. My options for pitching features that pay well? It’s like two places," writer, author, and friend of Aftermath Aidan Moher <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aidanis.fun/post/3ldhd2voslk2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Bluesky. "So, honestly, Restart will go on my list and its turn-order placement will be dictated by pay rate."&nbsp;</p><p>“The funding from Walmart, coupled with Moonrock's other work, does scream corporate influence, and the skepticism is understandable. However, in my working with them, it seemed above board,” said Fanelli. “Working with them on the pieces they commissioned was a respectful experience where I was given the freedom to write however I want, Brandy's editing process was quick and simple, and the rates were solid. I never felt limited by them while I worked for them; they trusted me, and I wrote what I wanted to write. I enjoyed writing for them, and I'd do it again if the opportunity arose.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-games-journalism-2024-game-informer-ign"><h3>The Best And Worst Games Journalism Moments Of 2024</h3></a><p>It was the worst of times, it was the less-worst of times</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But you’ll quickly feel the squeeze from 100GB-plus installs, especially if you tend to keep a heavy rotation. Expansion cards are your only relief on Xbox consoles if you’re playing titles optimized for Series X/S. Thankfully, you can get a 2TB expansion card cheaper than ever, with <strong>Western Digital’s WD_Black C50</strong> going for $189.99 ($70 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-Expansion-Officially-Licensed-WDBMPH0020BNC-WCSN/dp/B0DK74LG91?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>. You can also get it in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-Expansion-Officially-Licensed-WDBMPH0020BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44B1VSH?tag=theverge02-20">512GB for $69.99</a> ($10 off) and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-Expansion-Officially-Licensed-WDBMPH0020BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44XVWCH?tag=theverge02-20">1TB for $109.99</a> ($48 off). That said, the 2TB model is the better deal in the long run.</p><p>Because the Series X and Series S use a proprietary storage format, you can’t use an external SSD, an internal NVMe SSD (as you could on the PS5), or a standard external hard drive to play newer games that are optimized for those consoles. You can use those hard drives to <em>store</em> Series X/S games, but expansion cards like the C50 are the only ones you can actually play them from. That’s because they support the platform’s “velocity architecture,” which has a minimum speed requirement and uses unique hardware and software tricks to enable console features like Quick Resume, not to mention other benefits for developers. Anyway, you don’t need to be a computer science major to understand the bottom line: if you want more storage for your Series X/S games, you’ll need an expansion card.</p><div><p>Western Digital’s storage expansion cards for Xbox Series X / S consoles are speedy, plug-and-play cards that match the performance of the consoles’ onboard SSDs. They offer a slightly lower-cost alternative to Seagate’s expansion cards, which were the only game in town for years.</p></div><p><h3>A few more deals</h3></p><div><ul><li>Now through December 31st, home decor brand <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.umbra.com%2Fcollections%2Fend-of-year-sale"><strong>Umbra is running a sitewide sale</strong></a> that takes 20 percent off most products in its store, including the <strong>Cono portable smart lamp</strong> we <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23863589/favorite-smart-home-gadgets-ifa-2023-tech-show">fell in love with at IFA last year</a> that’s down to $76 ($19 off) at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.umbra.com%2Fproducts%2Fcono-lamp">Umbra’s online store</a>, for example. Sadly, the taller <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.umbra.com%2Fproducts%2Fcup-lamp">$130 “Cup” smart lamp</a> with its convenient organizer for a base isn’t discounted, but the Cono is an intriguing tabletop RGB lamp with an X-shaped stand that lets you shine the light vertically or horizontally. As Nanoleaf helped create it, that’s the app you’ll use for manual remote control over Bluetooth. But because it’s also Matter-ready, you can use voice commands and set lighting schedules when it’s connected to a compatible smart home ecosystem.</li><li>Although there’s a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23043644/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-gaming-mouse-price-release-date-specs">newer model with faster polling rates and USB-C charging</a>, the original <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21562618/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-wireless-gaming-mouse-release-date-price-features-weight"><strong>Logitech G Pro X Superlight</strong></a> is still one of the best gaming mice you can buy. It’s starting around $79.99 (50 percent off) right now at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087LP6F4Y?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/mdwzzfqjt5uu0">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://computers.woot.com/offers/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-wireless-mouse">Woot</a>, which is an all-time low price. Through December 29th, Woot is taking an extra $5 off with code <strong>LOGITECHFIVE</strong>. The Superlight is named for its 63-gram weight, but it drops some fan-favorite features to get there, such as RGB, dedicated DPI buttons, and a weighted scroll wheel. However, you still get five programmable buttons (including two mounted on the left edge) and a 25,600 DPI Hero sensor that offers far more optical resolution than most gamers need. The mouse lasts up to 70 hours per charge, though it uses micro-USB for recharging.</li><li>The <strong>Beats Pill</strong> is matching its all-time low of $99.95 ($50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Portable-Bluetooth-Resistant-Compatible/dp/B0D4STT6C2?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/w4d93m3ecxvna">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbeats-pill-wireless-bluetooth-speaker-champagne-gold%2F-%2FA-92268973">Target</a>. Apple’s refreshed Bluetooth speaker updates the line with features like two-way USB-C charging and lossless audio. It also has native support for some iOS&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;Android features, including each operating system’s Find My feature and access to Siri and Google Assistant, but you can’t initiate either via voice. The speaker is built for extended outdoor outings, too, with a battery that lasts up to 24 hours per charge and IP67 protection against water and dust. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24185290/beats-pill-2024-bluetooth-speaker-review">Read our review</a>.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-corrupted-blood-classic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you lived through&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft</em>'s Corrupted Blood incident, you'll probably remember it as one of the most memorable (and potentially terrifying) moments in online gaming history. This week,&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft Classic&nbsp;</em>players got a chance to experience that very same plague anew.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1hkxzs5/looks_like_we_are_going_back_to_2005_someone_in/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Redditor Lightstruckx</a> (via <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2024/12/26/wow-classic-players-manage-to-recreate-the-infamous-corrupted-blood-event/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Massively Overpowered</a>), players on&nbsp;<em>Classic</em>'s Season of Discovery server managed to recreate Corrupted Blood a few days ago, carrying the eponymous debuff into the Alliance capital of Stormwind City, where it proceeded to decimate the population just like the first time.</p>

<p>Lightstruckx's accompanying video shows exactly the kind of carnage you'd expect from Corrupted Blood; players are taking periodic damage ticks from the debuff and dropping like flies as healers fail to outpace the relentless disease.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/world-of-warcraft-classic-corrupted-blood-lightstruckx-video.jpg?itok=yKpjNjvt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/world-of-warcraft-classic-corrupted-blood-lightstruckx-video.jpg?itok=_7-pJfT8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's chaos out here. Screenshot courtesy of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1hkxzs5/looks_like_we_are_going_back_to_2005_someone_in/" rel="nofollow">Lightstruckx on Reddit</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>One commenter beneath Lightstruckx's video <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1hkxzs5/comment/m3i00t7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">imagines the carnage</a> if Corrupted Blood somehow made its way to one of&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft Classic</em>'s hardcore servers, which feature permadeath; you've got one life, and after you lose it, it's over for your character.</p>

<p>Of course, I hope this doesn't happen for the sake of everyone who's managed to build up a treasure trove of loot and gear in hardcore mode, but on the other hand, I can't deny it'd be fun to watch.</p>

<p>In case you aren't familiar, the Corrupted Blood incident happened back in 2005. Hakkar the Soulflayer, a boss in the Zul'Gurub raid, inflicted a debuff on players called Corrupted Blood, which caused their health to tick down periodically.</p>

<p>While players themselves couldn't carry the debuff out of Zul'Gurub, their pets could, and adventurers quickly found that resummoning their deactivated pets outside of the raid would cause Corrupted Blood to be applied in areas it should never have appeared in.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/world-of-warcraft-classic-corrupted-blood-zulgurub.jpg?itok=Fy9DN1YX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/world-of-warcraft-classic-corrupted-blood-zulgurub.jpg?itok=pONpp9hN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pictured: the&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>population after Corrupted Blood was done with it.</figcaption></figure><p>The event led to widespread sociological interest, with <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(07)70212-8/fulltext" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some epidemiologists</a> looking to Corrupted Blood in order to try and understand how a real-life pandemic on a similar scale might play out.</p>

<p>Sadly, the scope and breadth of the original Corrupted Blood incident isn't likely to be repeated today; Blizzard is far more vigilant about such things than it once was. Still, it's almost nostalgic to see this disease murdering player after player yet again, so many years later.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>A giant robotic frown is the first thing you see while flying behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/astro-bot/" data-ref-id="5000-630892">Astro Bot</a> into a droopy, rain-stricken tropical island. A handful of glowing purple locks hold the colossal metal creature to the ground. Destroy them, and the entire world around glows with transformation.</p><p dir="ltr">Free Big Brother--a standout Astro Bot planet--sees a level transform with emotion. Beginning as a darker tribute to Shadow of the Colossus, it evolves into the epitome of platforming joy that rivals exploring the sunkissed secrets of Super Mario Sunshine's Delfino Plaza. Raindrops grow fewer and fewer before the colossal and friendly creature becomes the final stages of the level itself.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether it's Ape Escape or Uncharted, Astro Bot is adept at recreating the feelings that the franchises it showcases made us feel. The adrenaline of ruin-destroying gun battles or the awe inspired by the scale of a toy-sized Jörmungandr are both apparent, even if the feelings only last for a few moments.</p><p dir="ltr">Free Big Brother achieves something even more impressive, imbuing the somber themes of Shadow of the Colossus into a platformer that elicits nothing but smiles, and still makes that sadness feel genuine.</p><p dir="ltr">As soon as Astro Bot, complete with his umbrella hat, touches the sand, the main goal is to destroy each lock holding Big Brother down as soon as possible. The gigantic mech pulls at your heartstrings as it struggles and groans as each lock cracks. Exploring every nook and cranny of this island isn't a priority: Saving Big Brother comes before all else.</p><p dir="ltr">PlayStation fans will immediately recognize the somberness as a tribute to Team Ico, the creators of Shadow of the Colossus. Images of Wander, Mono, Dormin, and the 16 colossi come flashing in as soon as reality sets in.</p><p dir="ltr">It felt fitting to see a piece so clearly inspired by Fumito Ueda, especially as Team Ico used to work alongside Team Asobi before a Japan Studios merger in 2021. Some of the Japan Studio developers were "re-centered" around Team Asobi. Of the 69 credited developers who worked on Astro Bot, one worked on Shadow of the Colossus and 12 worked on The Last Guardian, Team Ico's last game before many of its developers joined Ueda at his new studio.</p><p dir="ltr">This crossover is part of the reason all these tributes feel so incredible. Besides the fact that studios like Naugthy Dog and Santa Monica Studio consulted on the sections that paid tribute to their games, developers who worked on Ape Escape, Gran Turismo 5, Knack, and other games are all credited as developers on Astro Bot. The tributes feel wonderful because some of the people who created the originals created the tributes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4416538-free_big_brother_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416538" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4416538-free_big_brother_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416538"></a><figcaption>The opening segment of Free Big Brother | Credit: Team Asobi</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4416538-free_big_brother_2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As soon as Big Brother is freed, the titanic metal man wades out into the ocean as fresh sunlight begins to soak the island. Once the tropical locale has been explored, he beckons Astro Bot to join him in the water. Astro Bot then ascends the limbs, neck, and head of Big Brother as the entire island comes into view on the horizon.</p><p dir="ltr">The sunlight, view, and music come together--combined with the natural fun of just navigating the tiny robot around a unique space--to create the best moment in Astro Bot.</p><p dir="ltr">It feels especially joyful now that we know that Ueda has been working on a successor of sorts at his new company, GenDesign. He, along with many former members of Team Ico, recently showcased their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-of-the-colossus-creator-reveals-untitled-new-game/1100-6528438/">untitled new project at The Game Awards</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The magic in Astro Bot is that it's more than 50 levels, which packs over 15 hours of gameplay time, and still feels incredibly brief. There are dozens of moments with something as meaningful as that somberness found in Free Big Brother, although nothing reaches the emotional peak that the Team Ico tribute does. Each moment is short, sweet, and leaves you wanting a whole lot more.</p><p dir="ltr">”Having something that’s 12 to 15 hours of condensed fun, where there wasn’t five minutes in which you felt it was long or lacking, is much more valuable than 40 hours when you have some moments that you feel like skipping,” said Astro Bot creative direct Nicolas Doucet in an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-06/playstation-s-astro-bot-is-a-model-for-the-video-game-industry" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Free Big Brother stands out in that 15 hours because of the brief sadness experienced. It's unlike anything else in Team Asobi's adventure. The combination of a narrative beautifully woven into level design, a genuine tribute to a beloved franchise, and fantastic moment-to-moment gameplay makes it one of the standout moments of 2024.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>
