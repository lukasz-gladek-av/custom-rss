            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/into-dead-our-darkest-days-preview-side-scrolling-zombie-survival<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Whether you want to slay zombies or rescue survivors, you'll find opportunities for both in&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>by PikPok. A spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead</em>, a mobile action game, it's the first franchise entry to use sidescrolling mechanics. As a fan of survival games, I was interested in how this would differ from other recent genre titles. Just from the images, I was digging the retro late 70's-early 80's vibe the art really brings forth. Regardless of not having played either of the previous franchise games, I decided to try out&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>Preview - <em>Stranger Things</em> Meets <em>Late Night With the Devil&nbsp;</em>Vibes</h2>

<p>Right off the bat, the art direction for the title is on the nose for a late 1970's city. From the color palette used in text, to the style of clothing survivors wear, to the decor of different locations, everything oozes that end of the decade feeling. Every home has a corded telephone, TV's come with bunny ear antennas, the arcades are filled with retro machines, and the cars are long and boxy.&nbsp;</p>

I personally love Penny and Daphne. Penny is an amazingly stealthy survivor. When armed with a blade, she can quickly take out a zombie without alerting others to her presence. Daphne is a multitasker built for shelter management. Able to get increased output from cooking and making medical items, her lessened damage crowns her as a shelter mother.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scavenging is where all the action in the game takes place. You can send a max of three survivors out per phase, or day and night. Locations can be explored in a number of ways. You can go through the front door, climb a pipe to the roof, or jump to an overhang and climb through a window. Zombies can be stealthily killed from behind, but if you're seen, they can let out a horrible wail that alerts all nearby enemies to your presence. This can be negated by whapping the zombie before it unleashes its screeching howl.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The further towards escape you get the more zombies you'll encounter in a location. You'll have had the ability to upgrade your shelter units, though, allowing you to possibly arm yourself with guns or more durable weapons. Stealth is still important here, as you can quickly get swarmed with upwards of five zombies at a time. Taking hits from them can quickly render your survivor dead. The resources they gathered are left with the body, and all your survivors in the shelter get hit with a Grief state.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-recruit-barb.jpg?itok=HZKUvBUQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-recruit-barb.jpg?itok=KkQXasb9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>States in the game affect how characters interact with each other, what they need when at the shelter, and if they'll just up and leave your group. Grief can lead to the last result if left to turn into depression and hopelessness. This means you'll have to bench your best scavenger sometimes or risk the consequences.</p>

<p>A survivor's death also impacts your strategy moving forward. Are you willing to risk another survivor to get the items that were collected? I often sent someone to collect the backpack of a fallen survivor, especially if they had a gun. Guns are rare to find, so keeping your hands on them when you get them can mean the difference between successfully escaping or failing.</p>

<p>I found myself really enjoying trying to fully clear a location and find all the survivors currently available. There are hidden locations only found by talking to some survivors or finding secret notes. These are often filled with rare loot, including weapons and base materials. Sometimes, there are human enemies guarding these areas, adding a bit of spice to your zombie-killing routine.</p>

<p>There are ways to do no-kill runs at certain locations, which really challenges stealth and escaping alive. You can also kill every zombie you come across, managing the sound various weapons make as well as the lack of weapons you may run into by not paying attention to weapon durability. Depending on your playstyle, you can have a different experience from others while clearing locations.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-stealth-kill-with-bat.jpg?itok=bVZKT2k6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-stealth-kill-with-bat.jpg?itok=h-oi0UhE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The zombie sounds are eerie, even more so when you wear headphones and can hear all their movements. Some zombies cry or hum, and I've never heard anything as creepy. The first time I heard a zombie scream, the hairs on my neck stood on end. The audio is extremely important and highlights all aspects of&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days.</em></p>



<p>One of the major issues I take with the title is the lack of variety. There are plenty of locations you can scavenge, different weapons to use, and survivors with various traits to rescue. The main problem is the layout of the zombies themselves. Whenever you enter a place for the first time, the enemies are always in the same room, use the same movement patterns, and react the same way to loud sounds. If you end up replaying a part of the game multiple times, like the beginning, those areas can quickly become boring to explore. There's less challenge when you can memorize where the zombies are and move around them or stealth kill them without any worry for your survivor.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-escape-plans.jpg?itok=XWweYPPF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-escape-plans.jpg?itok=aXd7ZzP0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This applies to the Escape Plans, as well. Currently, there are two plans you can work towards to make it out of the city. The plans don't change. Their leads are located in the same places, the needed items are always found in the same area when scavenging, and the designated locations to progress the plan are the same. Again, if you play through multiple times, this can make the title more boring than intended.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are still a number of bugs that impact gameplay.&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</em>&nbsp;is in Early Access, so bugs are expected. Some that I've encountered include game crashes, softlocks, zombies attacking through doors, zombies moving through objects, and zombies not spawning correctly. The dev team has said they are working on them.</p>

<p>The number of times I've had to restart due to softlocks and crashes is far higher than it should be. Not only that, but there were different causes of the softlock, and they all resulted in an endless loading screen when returning to the shelter.&nbsp;Since returning to the shelter is when the game saves, this caused me to have to restart a new game multiple times. Depending on where you're at, this could be upwards of 10 hours invested in a save just gone.&nbsp;<span><span><span><span><span><span>Even though </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> has plenty of pros, the progression-ending bugs instantly kill any motivation to continue playing.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-zombie-in-car-bug.jpg?itok=1xsZGe2c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-zombie-in-car-bug.jpg?itok=VStGWbQi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Thankfully, the game is in Early Access, meaning many of these issues are going to be addressed as time goes on. Development is already noted on the EA Roadmap for "curveballs", or world events that will affect your shelter in various ways. Further down the pipeline are additional survivors, NPC traders, an expanded map, more escape plans, and more zombie behaviors. These will certainly change how the game plays and, hopefully, keep it fresh and exciting each time you start a new game. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>PikPok is a leading game studio in New Zealand, so I have faith the development team will be able to remedy the different causes for crashes and softlocks, as well as the other bugs present in the title, before it fully launches. The core mechanics and the story of&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</em>&nbsp;is solid. Flushing it out with more variety or a more challenging mode will only make it a stronger contender in the survival genre.&nbsp;</p>

Or was the representation in the 90s good enough for the time? Fans seem divided on the issue. For some, this revelation is not that big of a deal. One user wrote, “Nobody was upset about this watching this as kids.” Another added sarcastically, “Cause 3 y/o me is so mad rn.”</p><p>One X user called out the show for making the Black Power Ranger “pop-lock before every punch/kick.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But in the wake of the roadmap’s release, Diablo 4’s community has expressed concern about 2025, and questioned whether there’s enough new content to keep them coming back.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/09/d4-roadmap-r7-fp01-1-1743949275184-1744209873506.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“Oh boy! Can't wait for new Helltide color and temporary powers,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1juiw91/the_roadmap_was_just_announced/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Inangelion</a>. “It's gonna be so dope!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a sentiment shared by a number of hardcore Diablo 4 players who were hoping for more excitement around upcoming content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A new season in other ARPGs is like ‘let's put in a little housing system where you build up a home base with vendors that give you more gear’ or ‘let's put in a whole shipping system where traders from other lands bring materials that let you upgrade your items in ways that change your class mechanic entirely,’ “ added feldoneq2wire.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A new season in D4 is ‘what color are we making helltides this time?’ And ‘what powers and reputation skins are we whipping up this time?’ “</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not a Diablo 4 hater, I love the game, but there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of meat on the bone here which is a bit disappointing,” said Fragrantbutte.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“ ‘And more’ is doing a lot of heavy lifting here,” added artyfowl444.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The debate online got to the point where Diablo community manager Lyricana_Nightrayne <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1juiw91/comment/mm3yj10/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stepped into the main thread on the Diablo 4 subreddit to address the complaints</a>: “We added fewer details to the later parts of the roadmap to accommodate for things the team is still working on,” they insisted. “This isn't all that's coming in 2025 :)”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of the issue is Blizzard’s one-shot approach to seasonal content for Diablo 4. Some like that the experience resets somewhat each season, whereas others have complained that it makes engaging too deeply in each new season pointless. Where some say if all seasonal content remained constant Diablo 4 would become overwhelming, others say they’re thinking of ditching the game and not coming back until 2026 when more meaningful content comes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mike Ybarra, former president of Blizzard Entertainment and corporate boss at its parent company, Microsoft, waded into the debate in a post on <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1909926972106342845" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/ Twitter</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Don't ship to check a box,” Ybarra said. “Season's need to get off the cycle of shipping, spending two months to fix issues, then repeating. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Pause and give the team time to really address the end-game issues. Playing for a week to then one or three shot a ‘uber’ boss 500 times for a unique, then quitting until next season is fundamentally not fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Expansions schedule is too long - should be yearly. Reduce ‘story’ investment (costs so much for one time element in a ARPG) and focus on new classes, new mob types, new end-game activities that last more than a few days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If the cycle continues to just ship w/o fixing the fundamental issues, then I'm not sure where Diablo is going. You can add all the end-game activities you want, but you'll be running in place with the same issues. At some point there's just so many random things, it's not worth the effort.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The comments on Diablo 4’s expansions have to do with the delay to expansion two, which was once due out in 2025 but will now launch in 2026. Blizzard’s initial plan for Diablo 4 was to release an expansion every year, and while expansion one, Vessel of Hatred, launched in 2024, expansion two will skip 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our interview, Gibson discussed the reality of continuing to develop Diablo 4 as a live service game with free seasonal content as well as a big paid-for expansion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I definitely feel like gamers are more hungry than they've ever been,” Gibson said. “And even if you delivered on their appetite today, that appetite will shift tomorrow. And so you just have to be in a really good spot to adapt to that situation. Because a lot of times too, what's important this month is going to be completely different three months from now. The priority of things can shift very, very quickly based on another game release or the state of your own game. Or maybe we've discovered something really cool and we want to be able to get it in there to change the formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And so it is definitely a new way of developing. It is definitely high interaction with the community. The interesting thing about Diablo is that we have a lot of different community types, right? We have our casual players, we have our hardcore players. They all fall into subdivisions of types of players inside of that. And so what we look to do is season upon season, look at the things that are important to some of those groups and go after them with focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you take a look at something like what we're doing in Season 8, we know we have a ton of boss lair feedback and so we're adding in the quality of life improvements for those players where that is a big focus of their gameplay type, or we might shift to nightmare dungeons when we're in Season 9. And so it's an opportunity for us to address different groups at different times, leading to an expansion where we're going to be addressing everybody all at once with something big.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Diablo 4 Season 8 launches later in April, with Season 9 currently due out in the summer, and Season 10 later in the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gets-first-gameplay-video-and-info/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2 would be featured in a Direct-style presentation immediately following the Xbox Summer Showcase slated for June 8. However, fans of the game were also treated to a surprise: IGN published the first gameplay video, and more coverage can be expected throughout April as part of IGN First.</p>
<p>The footage sees the player character infiltrating an N-Ray facility with the help of a slightly crazed cultist companion. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-gameplay-the-outer-worlds-2-ign-first" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to IGN</a>, the game features a full-fledged stealth system. Enemies can detect bodies and alert fellow guards, though players obviously have ways to prevent that from happening, including a skill that can disintegrate bodies as soon as they drop.</p>
<p>There are also more effective melee weapons and abilities to perform silent takedowns. Moreover, Obsidian introduced an easy way for players to gauge how much they're going to take out of the enemy's health with a stealth attack, so that they can assess whether a one-hit kill is even possible in the first place.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2: 11 Minutes of Exclusive Gameplay – IGN First" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LhDvnM3wBaQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>New gadgets are being used to spruce up the gameplay variety. In this mission, the N-Ray Scanner allows the player character to spot otherwise invisible cultists. Gunplay also seems improved in The Outer Worlds 2 compared to the first installment, with the developers claiming to have taken inspiration from Bungie's Destiny in that regard.</p>
<p>Movement was also fine-tuned to allow for greater agility, not to mention the addition of a sprint-slide move while aiming down sights. The Bullet-Time-like Tactical Time Dilation returns, and in the footage, we can see the main character tossing a grenade, activating Tactical Time Dilation, and shooting the grenade to have it explode on multiple enemies.</p>
<p>IGN also said that Obsidian mentioned having Fallout: New Vegas as the main inspiration for this sequel. The footage does hint at some of that when, all of a sudden, the player takes down a non-hostile character that had actually provided them with help (and could have been saved if provided with a trauma kit). It looks like there will be a lot of choices and consequences.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is scheduled to launch later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

Meanwhile, many people will likely be excited to see <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> be added to PS Plus Extra and Premium’s game catalog. Personally, I’m more excited about <em>War of the Monsters</em> coming to PS5 and PS4 later this month.

<p>Don’t get your hopes up for Titanfall 3 just yet. After a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/titanfall-3-is-almost-complete-says-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak came out suggesting</a> that Titanfall 3 is “almost complete” along with a number of planned features, one prominent journalist has publicly reported that none of the leaked information is accurate.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XsBHGnG9LQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Breaking News</a>, Jeff Grubb shot down the claims by Apex Legends leaker Osvaldatore. </p>



<p>“This isn’t real,” Grubb said. “I’m sorry. It’s not real.”</p>



<p>Grubb then went on to talk about Respawn having a small team that is “probably messing around with games that have titans in them”.</p>



<p>“Does he ( Titanfall 1 director Steve Fukuda) have something like a prototype that has titans in it? I would guess so,” Grubb added. “I don’t know for sure, but I would certainly assume that that is a safe thing to think.</p>



<p>“Now, is that going to get announced in 2025 and released in 2026? No way.”</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-2025">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase Announced For June 8, 2025</a></h6>



<p>He then touched on the fact that EA has been on a trend of canceling various games at Respawn. Those cancellations include Titanfall Legends which was a “previous version of Titanfall 3”.</p>



<p>“Do not expect an Unreal Engine 5, single player campaign Titanfall 3 with a full multiplayer suite,” Grubb said while saying he hated being the one to rain on the parade. “I’m not sure where this is coming from…don’t get your hopes up for Titanfall anytime soon.”</p>



<p>Do you think EA and Respawn will ever release a Titanfall 3? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1835/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

originally debuted in March 2017. The PS4 and PS5 consoles also didn't arrive in China at launch either, nor did the newest Xbox systems. "Part of that is approvals / regulations, part of that is finding a suitable partner, part of that is demand," Ahmad said.</p><p>Companies not based in China need to have a Chinese partner for product releases. For the original Switch, Nintendo partnered with Chinese internet behemoth Tencent. For Sony, it partnered with Shanghai Oriental Pearl to bring PlayStation consoles to China. Microsoft, meanwhile, made a deal with BesTV to bring Xbox consoles to China.</p><p>The Switch 2 is set for release in the US and other markets on June 5. Nintendo announced a $450 price point for the console, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">some expect a price hike due to the impact of tariffs</a>.

The company said it was taking time to "assess" the impact of the tariffs.</p>

                <p>After launching in 2023 as a Switch exclusive, Disney Illusion Island is now coming to PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC on May 30. The port has been rebranded to <a href="https://howl.link/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442104080764?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends</a>, and it now comes bundled with two previously released DLCs and a new DLC featuring Scrooge McDuck. Preorders are available now, and despite all the included DLC, it's available for $30--that's <strong>$10 cheaper than the base game launched for on Switch</strong>. That makes this an excellent time to dive in and explore everything this family-friendly metroidvania has to offer.</p><h2>Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey and Friends Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4473382-f6dc9c3e-f5a7-4697-8274-34968edf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4473382" data-ratio="0.56264066016504" data-width="1333" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4473382-f6dc9c3e-f5a7-4697-8274-34968edf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4473382"></a><figcaption>Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4473382-f6dc9c3e-f5a7-4697-8274-34968edf.jpg"></figure><p>Physical editions of the game come with an exclusive poster, though it’s only available while supplies last. This isn’t listed as a preorder bonus, but since inventory is limited, reserving a copy of the game is the best way to grab one before it disappears. The poster appears to be a universal bonus available at most retailers. We've verified it's bundled with purchases at Best Buy and GameStop, though double-check the listing if you're purchasing from other vendors.</p><div title="6530722 - Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3358" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6530722 - Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://howl.link/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442104080764?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/17442104080764?u1=subid_value\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442104080764?u1=subid_value ">Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends Standard Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://howl.link/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442104080764?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/17442104080764?u1=subid_value\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442104080764?u1=subid_value ">$30 | Releases May 30</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This is the only version of the game up for preorder.

It's grown to over 250 developers and has joined the ranks of larger triple-A studios now investing 4-5 years in each development cycle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Experienced developers know this is a uniquely challenging moment for companies making single-player games. One major driver of the massive game industry layoffs of the last year has been a series of stumbles at studios that grew too fast after making a hit game. Positive cash flow and healthy coffers unfortunately aren't enough to promise stability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And yet stability is what CEO Piotr Babieno says he's searching for. In an interview with Game Developer at the 2025 Game Developers Conference, the head of the studio known for making games featuring characters grappling with mental illness explained some of his thinking for leading a healthy workplace.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The most important thing," he said, "is to create a safe environment. Every single decision I make is not just about if the business is good, but if we'll be able to take care of the 250 people in the studio, and their families as well."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/behind-the-headlines-at-valve-s-rocky-start" target="_self" data-discover="true">Behind the headlines at Valve's rocky start</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a surprising value to hear from a CEO in the year 2025, when many are choosing to talk about going </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-desperately-wants-investors-to-know-it-s-on-the-generative-ai-bandwagon">all-in on AI</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or publicly criticizing their own employees about their games not having an "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-ceo-says-the-callisto-protocol-suffered-because-it-lacked-a-gameplay-edge-">edge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">." So what precisely, does Babieno define as a "safe environment?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Keeping your studio &quot;safe&quot; is a tremendous challenge">Keeping your studio "safe" is a tremendous challenge</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The word "safe" takes on a whole new meaning for a Polish game studio in the 2020s. Not only are the typical struggles of game development a day-to-day challenge, but, like many, Bloober had to learn about the realities of making games remotely in the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally the country is nervously watching developments over the border in neighboring Ukraine, where Russia's invasion sparks concerns over a broader response </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/poland-nato-rutte-russia-ukraine-49fa0ce0763926f3c57f6783457ec0e6">that could draw in NATO.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> With game development cycles for games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the upcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos: The New Dawn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> running about 5 years, the decisions Babieno makes have huge ripple effects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Russia's invasion seems to be top of mind for Babieno, who explained that Bloober employs developers who hail from Russia and Ukraine—both of whom had to relocate given the circumstances of the war. The studio was also one of the first to publicly halt sales of its games in Russia—not out of spite for the Russian people, Babieno said, but because the company did not want to contribute tax revenue to the government's coffers which could drive spending on its invasion.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-microsoft-ea-and-others-unite-to-make-accessibility-messaging-a-priority" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo, Microsoft, EA and others unite to make accessibility messaging a priority</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Games should connect us rather than make [barriers] between countries or between fans," he said. "I feel we are doing everything we can to support our fans all over the world, but we will never support people who are destroying our world and making horrors bigger than we are able deliver [in our games]."</span></p><p>Image via Bloober Team.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that's a very high level issue. Day-to-day, Babieno said he's grappling with the same things many developers at his company (and around the world) struggle with: self-imposed crunch. "I'm not a good example," he admitted, describing the feeling of wanting to work longer hours because of "passion" for a project. "We are trying to support our team as much as we can and sometimes will increase the time of development if needed to create a good game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bloober apparently also connects employees with psychologists in and around the company to access mental health support (and considering their games are about psychological horror, perhaps some consulting on the topic), but Babieno said regular messaging about "having your own life" is the "first" step in creating that environment.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-games-boss-says-the-streamer-must-seek-to-cause-disruption-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Netflix Games boss says the streamer must strive to cause 'disruption'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the topic of depicting mental health in games—we've heard from developers over the years that sometimes researching real-world injuries, be they </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/id-have-these-extremely-graphic-dreams-what-its-like-t-1834611691">physical</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or mental, can sometimes have a psychological shock of its own. Babieno said he hasn't seen that happen at Bloober, in part because the studio is deliberate about what topics it tackles. "When we are creating a new title, there's always the question of 'what would we like to add to the conversation,'" he said, adding that these topics are meant to encourage "judgment-free" debate on the team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's the "planning" stage that Babieno seemed to circle back to in our conversation. If you want to better understand the company releasing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos: The New Dawn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2025, you need to go all the way back... to 2019.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cronos"><span>Cronos</span> shows the strategic scaling of Bloober's headcount</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Track the arc of Bloober's lineup from 2015 all the way through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and you'll see a fairly steady increase in game scope going from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Layers of Fear</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Observer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, past </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Medium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and all the way through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This was deliberate, said Babieno, and followed a strategic decision in 2015 to commit to horror games. When the company had fewer employees, it focused in on narrative experiences buoyed by environmental storytelling, and scaled up to include more action and player navigation, now seen in the combat-heavy </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because of this, it was a natural step to increase the team and increase the scope of our games," he said, noting that the studio has picked up "more fans" because of this. He echoed a common refrain you hear from indie and triple-A studios, that the company is in business to make high-quality games, not just turn a profit. It does seem the company communicates to its workers that they have to make solid decisions as early as possible, because when they do, they're locking into a long commitment they can't easily get out of.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When we are talking about what will be next, it has to be something we would like to work on for the next five years...to spend a big part of our life to create something unusual."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those kinds of impactful decisions can include something as fundamental as setting. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the second game from Bloober set in the studio's native Poland, a decision that doesn't seem so unusual in 2025 but Babienbo said in the beginning, it was a really risky call when trying to make a game that appeals to a global audience. "That was the conversation in the Polish game industry," he recalled. "That we shouldn't make games in Poland because it might not sell as well as if you made a game set in the United States."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers in other regions might feel buoyed by Babieno's words, as he said the "act locally and think globally" approach has paid off. Developers at the studio have an opportunity to be "faithful" to their homeland but also embrace the "trust" of players that they'll be curious enough to embrace that faith and explore new kinds of horrors in a land they may never have visited.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He tossed out the idea that Bloober could make a game set in San Francisco (itself beset by the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.inman.com/2016/04/15/is-the-san-francisco-tech-boom-harming-business/">horrors of the tech industry</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), but it would never be as good as one made by people living in the United States.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">None of what Babieno described in our conversation should be seen as easy or simple. It's common knowledge that in today's market, just making a good game isn't enough to sustain a business, and you can put "we don't crunch" in your company values all you want, but you might look up one day and realize your whole team has worked until 9PM out of love for the game. Taking on the mantle of leadership is about setting yourself up to make hard decisions. "If you would like to have advice, don't run a game studio because maybe it could kill you" Babieno joked.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Babieno—and Bloober—are still here, still alive and standing in the tough environment of 2025. Perhaps for however difficult the road has been, seeing his job as being about "protecting" his workers may be the kind of principle that could help other studios endure these difficult times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A report from <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Media-Entertainment/Nintendo-postpones-launch-of-Switch-2-in-China">Nikkei</a> reveals that Nintendo has decided to postpone the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-stepping-up-to-be-more-of-a-primary-platform-says-analyst/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in China. According to the report, this indefinite delay comes from Nintendo waiting to see what demand exists for the Switch 2 before its launch in China.</p>
<p>This is not unlike the original Nintendo Switch coming to China. Officially, the original Nintendo Switch arrived in China in 2019, two years after the console was available worldwide. Currently, the Nintendo Switch is sold in China through a collaboration with Tencent, who declined to comment to Nikkei when asked if they would also distribute the Nintendo Switch 2 in the region.</p>
<p>Nintendo's delay in bringing its new console to China isn't the biggest surprise, considering that last November, the company <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-to-close-switch-eshop-and-online-services-in-china-in-2026">confirmed</a> it would be shutting down online services, including the eShop, in China by 2026.</p>
<p>While some of the world's biggest games come from Chinese developers like Genshin Impact or the recent free-to-play success, Marvel Rivals, strict regulations around video games in the region still challenge releasing a game in China and finding success in the country.</p>
<p>Chief analyst at Gamma Data told Nikkei, "<em>The hurdles to success in China remain high. They need to improve the consumer experience while complying with government policies, and there is also the issue of whether they will be able to introduce major international software</em>."</p>
<p>Nikkei's report also adds that the console and the software released will need to go through approval processes from Chinese authorities, which could result in more restrictions on releasing the hardware and software.</p>
<p>Regarding the demand for the Nintendo Switch 2 in China, the report adds that retailers have been accepting pre-orders for the device, both in-store and online—pre-orders that will now presumably be canceled.</p>
<p>There's definitely some demand for Nintendo consoles and games in China, but the rollout of the Nintendo Switch and now the Switch 2 show just how precarious it is to get the console to the region in the first place.</p>

<p>According to Nikkei (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-wont-be-releasing-switch-2-in-china-yet-as-it-reportedly-analyses-demand/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Nintendo is looking into how much demand there would be among Chinese gamers for the Nintendo Switch 2 before deciding to release the console in the country.</p>

<p>Nikkei says that games and consoles in China are subject to exhaustive government inspections, with the Chinese government often imposing restrictions on said software and hardware based on what VGC calls its "intentions". As such, Nintendo may decide the headache of going through said inspections isn't worth the returns it would get by selling the Switch 2 in China.</p>

<p>It's possible, then, that the Switch 2 won't see an official release in China; it's a market largely dominated by mobile and PC games, so it may be that Nintendo decides the potential customer gain isn't worth the hoops it would have to jump through.</p>

<p>Additionally, Nintendo is in the process of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-eshop-online-closing-china-2026" rel="nofollow">closing down the Switch's online services and eShop</a> in China, with the shutdown scheduled for the end of March next year. Evidently, the company doesn't see a benefit to keeping the services online any longer than that, which is another indication that there's not a large audience for the Switch 2 in China.</p>




<p>In case you missed it, the Switch 2 was revealed in full during a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Direct show last week</a>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the world, the console is set for a June 5th release, a date Nintendo insists hasn't changed despite delays to pre-orders in both the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">US</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada" rel="nofollow">Canada</a>. Whether or not it sees a release in China remains to be seen.</p>

            <p>Two Microsoft software engineers who interrupted a Microsoft anniversary event to protest against the company's dealings with the Israeli military have been fired for misconduct, according to a report. Software engineer Ibtihal Aboussad, who is based in Canada and once worked for the company's genAI division, lost her job on Monday 7th April due to "wilful misconduct, disobedience or wilful neglect of duty," according to internal documents picked up by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/07/microsoft-fires-engineers-who-protested-during-anniversary-celebration.html">CNBC</a>. Another Microsoft software engineer, Vaniya Agrawal, had announced that she would resign on April 11th, but according to another document cited by CNBC, Microsoft have terminated her job in advance.</p><!--more-->
<p>Microsoft's business dealings with Israel's defence establishment have been in the spotlight recently thanks to investigations by the Guardian, +972 Magazine, Local Call, Drop Site News and the Associated Press. In a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-ai-technology-737bc17af7b03e98c29cec4e15d0f108">lengthy and very disturbing article from February</a>, the AP claim that the Israeli military's use of Microsoft computing services and OpenAI technologies has "skyrocketed" to "nearly 200 times higher" since the surprise attack on Israel by Hamas and other Palestinian militants on 7th October 2023.</p>
<p>The AP report is based upon interviews with current and former members of Microsoft and the Israeli armed forces, together with internal company data and documents. It claims that the Israeli military have used "AI-enabled systems" for intelligence operations during Israel's subsequent invasion and bombardment of Gaza, which has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people. It also discusses the use of genAI transcription software and Microsoft Azure for mass surveillance. There's a lot more in the full piece, which doesn't begin and end with Microsoft's alleged involvement: the AP also discuss the Israeli military's relationship with other big tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Palantir, Cisco and Oracle.</p>
<p>Prior to Aboussad and Agrawal's intervention, many Microsoft employees have spoken out against their employer's reported involvement with Israel's armed forces. Back in May 2024, Microsoft workers <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">launched a petition</a> calling on the company to disclose all ties with the Israel Defense Forces, submit to an independent audit for potential human rights violations, protect employees speaking up for Palestinians, and overall "end Microsoft's complicity in Israeli genocide and apartheid by terminating all Azure contracts and partnerships with the Israeli military and government". The signatories are also pushing Microsoft to make a formal call for a ceasefire. "The products and services we build are being used and distributed around the globe to surveil, censor, and destroy," the organisers write. "We cannot stand by while our labor is utilized to aid in the oppression of innocent people."</p>
<p>Aboussad and Agrawal both took action on Friday 4th April at separate events organised to celebrate Microsoft's 50 year anniversary.  As reported by CNBC, Aboussad approached the stage during a speech from Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman in Redmond, Washington, calling him a "war profiteer" and declaring that "all of Microsoft has blood on its hands," before being escorted out. "Mustafa, shame on you," she said. "You claim that you care for using AI for good, but Microsoft sells AI weapons to the Israeli military. Fifty thousand people have died, and Microsoft powers this genocide in our region."</p>
<p>Aboussad subsequently spelled out her grievances in an email to Suleyman and Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella, finance chief Amy Hood, operating chief Carolina Dybeck Happe, and company president Brad Smith. "I spoke up today because after learning that my org was powering the genocide of my people in Palestine, I saw no other moral choice," she wrote. "This is especially true when I've witnessed how Microsoft has tried to quell and suppress any dissent from my coworkers who tried to raise this issue." This last part may be a reference to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/microsoft-workers-fired-gaza-vigil">Microsoft's firing last year of Abdo Mohamed and Hossam Nasr</a> after they held a vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza.</p>
<p>In further correspondence cited by CNBC, a Microsoft contact then told Aboussad that her email to executives served as "an admission that you deliberately and willfully engaged in your earlier misconduct", adding that she could have aired her grievances "confidentially with your manager, or with Global Employee Relations. Instead, you chose to intentionally disrupt the speech of Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman." The message to Aboussad concludes "that your misconduct was designed to gain notoriety and cause maximum disruption to this highly anticipated event", and that "immediate cessation of your employment is the only appropriate response."</p>
<p>As for Agrawal, she interrupted a speech by Nadella at another event, and sent a similar email to executives afterwards. "You may have seen me stand up earlier today to call out Satya during his speech at the Microsoft 50th anniversary," Agrawal writes in the email, as reported by CNBC. "Over the past 1.5 years, I've grown more aware of Microsoft's growing role in the military-industrial complex." Agrawal further argued that Microsoft are "complicit" in the bloodshed as a "digital weapons manufacturer that powers surveillance, apartheid, and genocide", and that "by working for this company, we are all complicit."</p>
<p>Microsoft have yet to say anything about all this publicly save for the following statement to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/microsoft-fires-employees-protesting-israeli-militarys-use-of-companys-ai-tech/">PCGamer</a>: "We provide many avenues for all voices to be heard. Importantly, we ask that this be done in a way that does not cause a business disruption. If that happens, we ask participants to relocate." The company have also yet to comment on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">last week's news</a> that the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement have made Microsoft a "priority target", and are <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft">calling on supporters</a> to avoid Microsoft and Xbox gaming services and products.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-winning-awards/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was released on March 20 to a reception that nobody expected. It was lauded in the press, and the reviews were pretty stellar on a universal scale, and then the game went on to sell millions of copies. That performance and the ultimate delivery of the game have led many to believe that it’s a turning point for the series.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been a single month since Assassin’s Creed Shadows hit the market, and it’s already winning awards… <strong><em>Kind of</em></strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-voice-of-the-players">Voice of the Players</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the winner of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/01/players-choice-vote-for-march-2025s-best-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation’s Players’ Choice for March</a>. It was voted the best game of the month based on the results of a poll on the PlayStation Blog, which is about as official as it gets. </p>



<p>Admittedly, the competition wasn’t all that strong in March, except the smash hit Hazelight game, Split Fiction.</p>



<p>I think that Assassin’s Creed Shadows <strong>will </strong>go on to win some prestigious awards this year, as what Ubisoft produced was one of the best games we’ve seen in the series for many years. That’s a sentiment that I echoed in my in-depth review of the game.</p>



<p>Last night, I was fortunate enough to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-lead-actress-shrine-destruction-hurt-heart/">catch up with Masumi</a> (Naoe) at the BAFTA Games Awards, learning more about her role in Assassin’s Creed Shadows and what she thought about the more controversial elements of the game.</p>



<p>It’s not the end of the road for AC Shadows, of course. There is DLC in the pipeline, and Ubisoft is hard at work producing patches to add more quality-of-life improvements, including a recent one that I was desperate for.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Assassin’s Creed Shadows, or have you already moved on and are looking to what comes next? Let me know in the comments or hit up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Completing the Return to Verdansk event requires players to open safes in every area of the map. With that in mind, here are all the safe locations in Prison. </p>



<p>The Return to Verdansk event started on April 3 and runs through April 15. Unlike other events in Black Ops 6 that could be completed in multiplayer or battle royale matches, this one can only be completed in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-player-count-off-charts-as-verdansk-exceeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a> on Verdansk.</p>



<p>Your loadout weapons will make completing this event easier, as they are much better than what you find from ground loot. So, check out which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loadouts are the best in Season 3</a>, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-hdr-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cr-56-amax-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CR-56 AMAX</a>, before starting this challenge.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-warzone-verdansk-safe-location-in-prison">Every Warzone Verdansk Safe Location in Prison </h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-warzone-verdansk-map-return-intel-drop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Return to Verdank event</a>, the objective is to open one safe in each of <span>Verd</span>ansk’s<strong>&nbsp;12 zones</strong>. In the Prison zone, there are nine safes. Despite the POI being nestled in the bottom right corner of the map, Prison is a hot drop, and it will be challenging to open a safe without facing some opposition.</p>



<p>The image below shows where all of the safes are. After opening one, you can move on to the next zone. However, even after opening one, there is still an incentive to open more because each safe has a chance of unlocking <span>Caine’s rare&nbsp;<strong>Trail Blazer operator skin</strong></span>. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Prison is a hotly contested area, so opening a safe won’t be easy. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-warzone-return-to-verdansk-rewards">Warzone Return to Verdansk Rewards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Kali Sticks always wreak havoc in Warzone. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Each Zone has a different reward in the Return to Verdansk event. To unlock the <strong>Kali Sticks</strong>, you must&nbsp;<strong>acquire all 12 zone rewards</strong>. </p>



<p>Superstore, Prison, Stadium, and Hospital will be the most challenging zones to open a safe in because those POIs always attract a lot of players when a match first starts. In addition, it will take at least a few matches to complete this event, as the closing circle limits how many zones you can reach in one match. </p>



<p>And even when other players have completed every zone, safes will always be hotly contested throughout the event because everyone wants the rare operator skin. </p>



<p>Here are all 12 zones and rewards. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Zone </th><th>Reward </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Dam </td><td>“Let’s Plan Something!” <strong>Loading Screen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Miltary Base </td><td>“Jarvdinsk Spomenik” <strong>Emblem </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Quarry </td><td>“Lumberjack Legends” <strong>Calling Card </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Storage Town </td><td>“Deathly Chill Return” <strong>Weapon Decal </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Superstore </td><td>“With Fries, Please” <strong>Weapon Charm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Stadium </td><td>“Breaking News” <strong>Calling Card </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Train Station </td><td>“The Back Adjustment” <strong>Finishing Move </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hospital </td><td>“Love 4 Tha Game” <strong>Spray </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Downtown </td><td>“Cheering the Squad” <strong>Emote </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hills </td><td>Double XP Token (45 minutes)</td></tr><tr><td>Port </td><td>“Shipping to Verdansk”<strong> Sticker </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Prison </td><td>“Wheel of Glory” <strong>Calling Card </strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<hr>



<p>That’s everything you need to know about opening safes on Prison for the Return to Verdansk event. With that out of the way, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-warzone-april-7-patch-notes-buy-stations-receive-major-update-attachments-suddenly-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> fans have much to look forward to. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-2-3-rated-in-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD MW2 and MW3</a> were reportedly rated in Australia, hinting at potential remasters.

                <p>A report recently emerged claiming to have new details on Titanfall 3, but there is more to the story.</p><p>Reporter Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb said on GameBreaking News today that people might want to temper their expectations for a new Titanfall game. As we've known for some time, there is a "skunkworks" team inside Titanfall studio Respawn now working on a new project. And it is true that this team is tinkering with gameplay elements involving titans, Grubb said.</p><p>However, any such project that could theoretically emerge from this skunkworks unit would likely be years away, Grubb added. There is also a possibility that whatever is being made by this team doesn't make it to release. That would be normal part of the creative process, after all.</p><p>"Don't get your hopes up for Titanfall anytime soon," Grubb said.</p><p>The Titanfall 3 rumor said the game was "almost complete" and would have single-player and multiplayer elements. For now, Grubb said he's confident in saying there would definitely be no announcement of the Respawn skunkworks project in 2025, and no release is planned for 2026 either.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INbzQN3gXkA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/INbzQN3gXkA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In 2023, we learned that Respawn veteran Steve Fukuda was in charge of the skunkworks team working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/titanfall-director-making-something-new-but-its-not-more-titanfall/1100-6513762/" data-ref-id="1100-6513762">"something new."</a> Just what this game actually is, however, has never come to light.</p><p>Titanfall fans have been waiting years for a potential sequel to Titanfall 2. It was previously reported that EA canceled a game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/canceled-apex-legends-game-wasnt-titanfall-3-but-would-have-featured-everyones-favorite-titan/1100-6511126/" data-ref-id="1100-6511126">"Titanfall Legends,"</a> that would have blended elements of Apex Legends and Titanfall.</p><p>2014's Titanfall was Respawn's first release after Vince Zampella, Jason West, and numerous other Infinity Ward developers left to start a new company. The game was a success and spawned a sequel, Titanfall 2 (2016), but that would prove to be the final entry in the main series before Respawn shifted focus to its battle royale game, Apex Legends. Since then, fans have called on Respawn to return to the Titanfall series with a bonafide new entry--but as of yet, nothing has materialized. Apex Legends and Titanfall are connected, and some elements of Titanfall have surfaced in Apex Legends before.</p><p>As for what Respawn is developing, we know the studio is working alongside Bit Reactor on a Star Wars turn-based game--it will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawns-star-wars-strategy-game-will-be-revealed-in-april/1100-6530159/" data-ref-id="1100-6530159">officially unveiled on April 19.</a> The EA-owned studio is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-to-develop-final-game-in-star-wars-jedi-trilogy-says-ea/1100-6526559/" data-ref-id="1100-6526559">expected to be working on the next Star Wars Jedi game</a>.

            <p>As we thunder forward through this sunny April (apologies for any undue excitement if your local area is currently sun-free), Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-april-hogwarts-legacy-blue-prince-the-second-episode-of-lost-records-bloom-rage-and-more/">revealed the latest titles joining its PlayStation Plus game catalogue</a> for Premium and Extra subscribers this month. And that includes stellar puzzler Blue Prince, if you're looking to have your noggin particularly meddled with.</p>
<p>Away from the Blue Prince (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-prince-review">Eurogamer just slapped with five shimmering stars</a>, so it's well worth checking out), there's plenty more coming to PlayStation's Game Catalogue. From next Tuesday, 16th April, Premium and Extra members also gain access to the closing instalment of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> originator Don't Nod's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-review">intriguing narrative mystery Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>, EA Sports PGA Tour, and culinary co-op game PlateUp.</p>
<p>As for those Premium-exclusive additions, April brings a tally of two. You've got some classic survival horror action in the seminal Alone in the Dark 2 (which first released on PlayStation back in 1993), and 2003's War of the Monsters, which includes full trophy support as players grow big and smack around other huge beasties, kaijū-style.
</p>
<p>You'll find the full list of this month's titles below:</p>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blue Prince (PS5)</li>
<li>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage – Tape 2 (PS5)</li>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Battlefield 1 (PS4)</li>
<li>EA Sports PGA Tour (PS5)</li>

</ul>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alone in the Dark 2 (PS4, PS5)</li>

<p>Back in January, Sony announced plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-shifting-focus-to-ps5-games-next-year-will-only-occasionally-include-ps4-titles">shift the focus of its PlayStation Plus monthly games and Game Catalog updates toward PS5 titles</a> starting early next year - after which PlayStation 4 games will only "occasionally" feature. "Many of our players are currently playing on PS5 and have shifted toward redeeming and accessing PS5 titles," it said at the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/zootopia-2-fan-comic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week was <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-15-best-things-we-saw-at-cinemacon-2025-2000585331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cinemacon</a>, essentially the <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E3</a> of the film world, for better and worse. Over four days, major studios like Disney and Lionsgate take over Caesars Palace in Las Vegas to unveil logos,&nbsp; trailers, and a cavalcade of surprise cast announcements for their ever-changing release schedules, all of which could have easily been an email. Amid the fanfare, Cinemacon’s sneak peek at Disney’s latest <a href="https://gizmodo.com/disney-sequels-frozen-3-zootopia-2-toy-story-5-bob-iger-1850090994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heavenly mandated sequel</a>, <em>Zootopia 2,</em> was a sleeper agent activation code for brain-broken internet dwellers like myself.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Zootopia</em>, otherwise known as SFW <a href="https://gizmodo.com/beastars-caps-off-netflixs-fall-anime-season-in-spectacular-fashion-2000535938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Beastars</em></a>, is a 2016 animated film in which a rookie cop rabbit named Judy Hopps teams up with a sly, street-smart fox named Nick Wilde to save their society from a political conspiracy. Aside from having a tiger supporting character who is hot to folks who swear they aren’t furries, the film was entertaining, with overtones about social injustice and prejudice that were broad enough to reinforce racism as a deplorable thing to kids. At its core is the buddy-cops-with-romantic-undertones dynamic between Judy and Nick, a relationship Disney seems eager to delve deeper into in <em>Zootopia 2</em>.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1907931511531384859?t=wiNrcP2PzJp0ijU1s0GJtw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grainy cell phone photo shared by Discussing Film from the showcase floor</a>, Judy and Nick are seen in therapy, officiated by a quokka named Dr. Fuzzby, played by Quinta Brunson. The first look left normies puzzled, wondering what had transpired during the nearly decade-long gap between the films to send its heroes to therapy. But to those of us with Tumblr-warped minds — trained to spot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_(Ctrl%2BAlt%2BDel)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Loss”</a> memes in the wild like a <em>Where’s Waldo?</em> and receive breaking news via<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/destiel-confession" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Destial confession memes</a> — this seemingly innocent scene unearthed a relic of internet lore we thought had been buried: the infamous <em>Zootopia </em>abortion fanfic comics. The replies and <a href="https://x.com/JordanInHell/status/1908136314865607160?t=9Bf8zlipppw-43kZPD4j-w&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quote retweets</a> to Discussing Film’s post are flooded with users sharing the first panel of the fanfic comic, citing it as the <em>real </em>reason behind the therapy session, leaving the uninitiated scratching their heads.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, no one needs to know about <em>Zootopia </em>fanfiction in the year of our lord 2025, but I’ve been blighted with this Tumblr knowledge for nine years and have to offload it onto you. So allow me to bridge the gap for those left in the dark.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Zootopia Comic &quot;I Will Survive&quot; Full!!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C_GRqInUwJI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><a href="https://www.zootopianewsnetwork.com/2017/06/i-will-survive-by-borba-full-comic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>I Will Survive: A Zootopia Fan Comic</em> </a>by DeviantArt artist Borba emerged in 2017 and quickly spread across the internet to platforms like Tumblr, Twitter, and even <a href="https://www.avclub.com/somebody-s-out-here-writing-pro-life-zootopia-fan-comic-1821058810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The AV Club</a>. The comic begins with Judy taking a pregnancy test and discovering she and Nick are pregnant. After insisting on taking a long shower before Judy can “ruin the rest of his day,” Nick reacts with joy upon hearing the news. However, Judy reveals her intention to have an abortion.&nbsp;</p><p>What follows is a heated exchange, with Judy expressing concerns about the complexities of bringing an interbred pregnancy to term (a theme explored extensively in <em>Beastars, </em>which is really good and you should watch/read it). Meanwhile, Nick embodies every conservative argument, condemning her decision as a “premeditated sin” driven by career ambitions. Judy slaps Nick across the face, creating <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nick-shocks-judy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one</a> of <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nick-shocks-judy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many memes</a> that live out of context from the comic, before Nick storms out of the apartment.&nbsp;</p><p>But their story doesn’t end there. Borba responded to a DeviantArt question about <em>I Will Survive</em>’s political alignment by claiming it was <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1320605-i-will-survive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“negative for both sides,”</a> then later made a sequel titled <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/born-to-be-alive-i-will-survive-sequel-by-borba-BSyU5qm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Born to Be Alive</em></a>. That story picks up months after Nick and Judy’s falling out, with Nick showing up at Judy’s apartment at 2.a.m, desperate to make up. Upon learning Judy went through with the abortion, Nick pleads for forgiveness for his “past errors and many flaws”—conveniently leaving out the fact that he’d been seeing someone else during their time apart.&nbsp;</p><p>After Judy verbally drags Nick’s ass across the coals for abandoning her in her time of need, Nick insists they should get back together. Suddenly, a fox lady named Shay walks out of Judy’s bedroom, wearing a robe and offering to help. Amid Nick’s panicked “Oh no! No! No"s, Judy explains that Shay was there for her when Nick wasn’t. Judy also reveals she’s been hiding her relationship with Shay because her parents had already disapproved of her and Nick living together without being married; Judy outing herself would’ve brought about more conflict with her parents’ conservative “carrotholic” beliefs. Judy and Nick fall out once more, and Judy falls into Shay's loving embrace. It's no Shakespeare, but the comics made for an entertaining read on Imgur.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Zootopia Abortion Comic - Tales From the Internet" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XwGIutQpFiU?start=96&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Borba’s webcomic saga includes a third installment titled <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/never-say-goodbye-zootopia-comic-by-borba-mXfFluq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Never Say Goodbye</em></a>, where Judy becomes the mayor of Zootopia and the story takes a wild turn and spoofs the assassination of John F. Kennedy, but we don’t need to dive into all that.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no chance <em>Zootopia 2 </em>will make Judy and Nick’s therapy session as dramatic as Borba’s bizarrely well-drawn comic. Still, it feels like a subtle nod, intentional or not, to that peculiar moment when the internet collectively imagined the pair needing therapy. While anything’s possible, including the idea that someone at Disney stumbled across that corner of the internet and decided to drop a subliminal wink to those of us who’d catch it, I can confidently say this is a prime example of how the internet loves to spiral, turning a sneak peek at a glorified ad convention into an unofficial epilogue for a decade-old fan comic.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review"><h3>No Other Game Is Shaped Like Blue Prince</h3></a><p>Defying definition and wholly itself, Blue Prince is one of the most unique games I've ever played.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/manga-no-name-ending-edgerunners"><h3>The Truth Behind The Sudden Conclusion Of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners Showrunner’s Short-Lived Manga Series</h3></a><p>Edgerunners showrunner Rafał Jaki mythbusts the ins-and-outs of creating his historic manga series, No\Name</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Michael Sarnoski, best known for directing A Quiet Place: Day One has signed up for the Death Stranding movie at A24 Productions.</p>
<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/death-stranding-movie-michael-sarnoski-a24-1236360094/">Deadline</a> report he will both write and direct the film which “will delve into the game’s mysteries surrounding the ‘Death Stranding’ — a catastrophic series of events that blurred the boundaries between the worlds of the living and the dead, bringing forth nightmarish creatures into a fragmented world on the brink of collapse.”</p>


<p><em><strong>Spoilers for Death Stranding now follow!</strong></em></p>
<p>Reports suggest that this means the film will be set before the first game so it’s unlikely Norman Reedus would appear as he is the cause of the Death Stranding. Experiments were conducted to study The Beach, and baby BB. The child is accidentally killed and arrives at the Beach, the junction between the worlds of the living and the dead. His sister/mother/extinction entity pal, Amelie, returns BB – aka Sam – back to the world of the living, thus causing Death Stranding.</p>
<p>Although Norman wouldn’t be in the film it does open the doors for the likes of Lindsay Wagner and Mads Mikkelsen to appear in the movie.</p>

<p><em><strong>End of Spoilers!</strong></em></p>
<p>Back in the world of video games Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is out June 26th 2025&nbsp; for PlayStation 5. No other versions have been revealed but as the original Death Stranding has also been released on PC and Xbox , as well is getting a “Directors Cut” with additional content, it will probably go multi-platform at some point in the future.</p>

			<p>Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/playstation-portal-remote-player-system-update-releases-today-with-cloud-game-streaming-beta-ux-enhancements/">announced</a> a new update for its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/">PlayStation Portal</a> handheld device, adding a few basic features to the Cloud Streaming beta that PlayStation Plus Premium members can access.</p>
<p>The Cloud Streaming beta was introduced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-4-0-firmware-stuttering-fixed/">November 2024</a>. At the time, it was just a bare-bones introduction to using the Portal to stream available titles over the cloud instead of directly streaming them from your PS5 console.</p>
<p>Wednesday's update brings a few basic features to the cloud streaming experience, like sorting the available games in the cloud streaming catalog alphabetically, by release date, or how recently they were added to the PS Plus catalog.</p>
<p>You can also now take game captures while playing a game through cloud streaming on your PS Portal, which works the same way it does when taking a screenshot while playing anything on your PS5 or PS Portal.</p>
<p>This update also allows you to pause a cloud-streaming gameplay session, allowing you to put the PlayStation Portal in rest mode with the game paused, though you can't leave the Portal in rest mode for longer than 15 seconds. The cloud streaming session will disconnect once that timer runs out. Similarly, if you've just set your Portal down without pausing the session, after 10 minutes of inactivity, a warning message will appear in the top-right corner of your screen to tell you that the cloud-streaming session will be closed in 60 seconds.</p>
<p>The last two features the update adds are a queue screen you'll be sent to when the streaming server for a game is full. Your wait time will be displayed on the screen, and you'll launch into the game once it's your turn. Lastly, this update adds the ability for you to provide feedback to PlayStation and Sony about the cloud streaming beta through five simple emoticons that let you share your satisfaction with the service from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest.</p>
<p>It's still surprising that the PlayStation Portal didn't support cloud streaming from the jump, but at least we can be glad it's here now. However, the addition of some of these fundamental features still shows the glacial pace at which Sony is adopting cloud streaming despite making a handheld that seems purpose-built for it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/645782/trumps-new-tariffs-leave-small-creators-scrambling<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’ve ever been to an anime or any fan convention, you know that the place that’s often the busiest is artists alley. There, creators sell their wares ranging from commissioned artwork to stickers, enamel pins, stuffed toys, apparel, food, and more. Often these goods are made with the artist’s own hand. Other times, merchants are resellers, importing goods that are hard to find domestically, like gunpla kits, from markets where they’re more abundant. But with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645215/trump-us-tariffs-china-eu">the Trump tariffs in effect</a>, artists alleys might soon become ghost towns. </p><p><em>The Verge</em> spoke to several fandom and gaming-adjacent small businesses about what they’re doing to prepare for the tariffs which threaten to destroy businesses of all sizes throughout the US.</p><div><p id="stocking-up"><h2>Stocking up</h2></p></div><p>An artist who simply goes by Biggles has been doing art commissions for the last eight years.</p><p>“I love drawing Vtubers and I love the community so much that my husband and I ended up opening our own merch store, <a href="https://vt-horizons.com/">VTHorizons</a>,” Biggles said in an interview on Discord. The store is stocked with merchandise of several Vtubers including Biggles herself who streams in the persona of a funny-looking cat on Twitch. “We do acrylics, glassware, metal bottles, stickers, slate rock coasters, and are planning on adding more items.”</p><p>Biggles sources most of the raw materials for her products from China and according to her, the business is thriving. “This is my dream,” she said. “Creating things is why I wake up every day. The tariffs felt like [they were] crashing something I worked so hard for.”</p><p>A lot of businesses, particularly in the gaming and art communities, source their products from China. In the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/business/643970/trade-war-consequences-crazy">trade war</a> initiated by President Trump, China now faces a whopping <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645215/trump-us-tariffs-china-eu">104 percent tariff</a>. Businesses about to see their costs skyrocket.</p><p>“We’ve already had to shift money from investing in new equipment to stocking up ahead of time these past few months,” said Jasen, a maker of <a href="https://www.mimsysstitches.com/">embroidered goods</a> based in Wisconsin. “But if we were to keep our prices the same, eventually our profit margins would reduce to an unsustainable level since we barely count the labor cost of our time spent making the product, marketing it, and selling it at events as it is.”</p><div><p id="uncertainty-reigns"><h2>Uncertainty reigns</h2></p></div><p>Even though the Trump administration has instituted sweeping tariffs on nearly every other country in the world, none of the businesses I spoke to know what that translates to in actual costs. That uncertainty compounds their anxiety as they have no idea if they’ll be able to reasonably eat costs or if they’ll have to raise prices and by how much. </p><p>Most businesses don’t want to raise prices at all. Their products are already aggressively priced in line with their competitors, and others simply don’t want to place any more burden on their customers who themselves will feel the pain of rising costs in every other aspect of their lives.</p><p>“If prices were to go up across the whole economy no one would have the extra money to spend on our business,” Jasen, the embroiderer, said.</p><div><p id="making-it-in-america"><h2>Making it in America</h2></p></div><p>Businesses I spoke to said that they were either stocking up on supplies as they work out longer term plans, or are working to find suppliers from countries not getting double-whacked by tariffs like China. Part of President Trump’s stated goal for these tariffs is to encourage businesses to buy and produce American, and some of the businesses I spoke to would love nothing more. But more often than not, that avenue is simply unfeasible, if not outright impossible.</p><p>“I’ve always tried to have my products manufactured in the US,” said <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vreni.bsky.social">Vreni Stollberger</a>, an illustrator and comics artist who runs a merchandise store for her work. “But there’s a lot of items that you can only get from China. Washi tape, key chains, plush toys, custom apparel, they’re almost impossible to find here and when you do find them, they’re far too expensive to be a viable option.”</p><p>Dustin Holden, whose company <a href="https://makemhz.com/">MakeMHz</a> modifies and updates older video game consoles, is in a similar situation.</p><p>“Even if we redesigned our products to accommodate alternative microcontrollers, power supplies, or analog components,” he said over DM chat. “No domestic equivalents are available.”</p><p>Those who can circumvent the tariffs by bringing production in house are doing so at steep cost and on accelerated timelines. Biggles said it’s costing her tens of thousands of dollars to bring in equipment that’ll let her make her acrylic products at home, a cost she’s not sure she can bear. </p><p>For Tim Zheng, CEO of <a href="https://viteramen.com/">Vite Ramen</a>, an instant noodle company, it doesn’t matter that his business does everything the Trump administration claims it’s trying to achieve, the tariffs still threaten to put him out of business. </p><p>“We make things here,” he wrote in an impassioned email to his customers. “We provide good jobs. We source as much as possible from American suppliers. And yet, we’re still staring down stacks and stacks of price increases across the board.”</p><div><p id="cuts-to-the-heart"><h2>Cuts to the heart</h2></p></div><p>For these business owners, figuring out how they will survive the tariffs is not just a financial imperative. It is emotionally taxing. </p><p>“We have to figure out more ways to get creative while still being creative,” the artist Biggles said. “Right now I’m steaming three days a week for three hours, then all the other days of the week I’m working on merch art, working on private commissions, and now planning shows.”</p><p>For all the business owners I spoke to, the tariffs are more than just a financial and logistical blow, but an existential one as well. The plans they’ve made to expand their businesses are now put on hold, and peoples’ livelihoods have been imperiled for arbitrary reasons beyond their control.</p><p>“I’m scared,” Biggles said. “I’m scared for the [tariffs’] impact and how this will uproot lives.” But there is hope, not in the government reversing its decision but in the communities these businesses have cultivated. </p><p>“I keep at it because as corny as it sounds, nothing in the world is better than drawing a picture that makes someone go ‘hell yeah,’” Stollberger said. “That’s really all I want to do in my life and these goddamn swaggerless [jerks] keep getting in my way!”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
