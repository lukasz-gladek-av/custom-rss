            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/18/2k-reveals-whats-waiting-in-pga-tour-2k25s-clubhouse-pass-seasons/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>PGA Tour 2K25 is swinging its way to release this month on 28th February (and with a week of Early Access starting on Friday 21st), but what comes after that? 2K and HB Studios have now revealed what players can expect with the post-launch seasons of content and the Clubhouse Pass of free and premium rewards.</p>
<p><iframe title="PGA TOUR 2K25 Developer Diary #3 I Seasons &amp; Clubhouse Pass I 2K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3LqpJ9SmtIU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Each season will bring free new courses, quests, challenges and a fresh track of rewards in a Clubhouse Pass. Season 2, for example, will bring The Old Course at St. Andrews Links to all players for free, for example.</p>
<p>For PGA Tour 2K25, Seasons will be tied to the five MyPlayer archteypes, with Technicians set to feature in Season 1, before the Greenskeeper, Magician, Powerhouse and Sculptor get to take the spotlight through the five planned seasons of content. Each one lends itself to a different playstyle, so it could be a bit sucky if you’re best with an archetype that’s fourth or fifth in line.</p>
<p>Each Season’s Clubhouse Pass will be aligned with real-life golf tournaments and events. This will bring 100 tiers of rewards – up from 50 tier in PGA Tour 2K23 – with 34 of these having free rewards that will includ Club fittings, evo tools, level up tokens, equipment, apparel and more. Paying for the Premium pass or having the Member’s Pass from the Legend Edition of the game, will get you rewards at all 100 tiers.</p>

<p>In a nice move, following in the footsteps of a handful of other battle pass-laden games, you can take this at your own pace. Progress through a Clubhouse Pass can continue even after later seasons have been released, cutting down on the FOMO.</p>

		
		

<p>PGA Tour 2K25 is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5 and PC, with a free First Look demo available now. This lets eager golfers check out the MyPlayer customisation, to create up to three player builds with custom appearance, hair, archetype, stats, gear and apparel, and progress up to a 70 OVR rating. There’s the Local Match mode featuring the back nine of TPC Scottsdale and WM Phoenix Open, Training mode and a Quests mode for player onboarding and skills development.</p>
<p>Any progress in the First Look demo carries on to the full game.</p>

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</h5><p><span>February 21st, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PC</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Ryu ga Gotoku Studio</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p><span>If there’s one thing series veterans of the Like a Dragon and Yakuza series have been begging for, it’s more Majima. This Chaotic Good ex-Tojo Lieutenant has been constantly at Kiryu’s heels and only really got his time in the limelight as the deuteragonist in Yakuza 0 and one of the four playable heroes in Yakuza: Dead Souls. For more than twenty years, the Mad Dog of Shimano has yet to take center stage in his own game and all of that is about to change in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>It’s important to note that this is most definitely a Y’s game, if the Y happened to actually stand for Yakuza. Our overly vocal protagonist finds himself shipwrecked in a foreign land and a wicked case of amnesia to book. All he needs is a big, burly sidekick that can bash his way through walls. If old Six Gun Saejima doesn’t fit that bill, I don’t know who would. Anyways, back to the amnesia. The all-important plot device that Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii hinges on as the basis of its adventure. After being accosted by a group of pirate roleplayers (while the clothes aren’t real, for some reason, the swords they carry sure are), Majima finds the concept to be incredibly fascinating and worthy of his next grand adventure. It doesn’t take long before Majima comes up with the bright idea that he needs to somehow return to Nele Island, the source of most of the previous Yakuza title’s story when not meandering around the dual cities of Honolulu and Yokohama. Majima can’t remember a thing about his actual purpose for going there initially but the pieces slowly come together along the adventure.</span></p>
<p><span>After hijacking an enemy vessel and taking some of his saviors (and the ship’s original cook) under his command, Majima soon goes all in on the pirate lifestyle, dressing the part, picking up an old blunderbuss and other pirate-y tools, and quickly picking up the mantle of Sea Dog Majima. Similar to his playstyle in Yakuza 0 and Joryu's kit in Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, Majima has two combat stances to bring out to the brawler melee, each with unique heat actions and taking full advantage of the weapons in his arsenal. Unique to this edition are the ability to equip up to ten rings, each working like a typical piece of armor and bestowing upon Majima stat and sometimes unique passive buffs.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>The actual piracy that Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii centers around feels like a secondary minigame and I found a lot of similarities to Ichiban’s Dondoko Island from the previous game. What I found most engaging was the naval warfare that <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-naval-combat-looks-even-better-than-skull-and-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">felt like a simplified and snappier version of what Ubisoft came up with in Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</a>. When sailing the high seas of Hawaii, Majima can fish up crafting materials and engage in the occasional random encounter or miniboss fight with a named pirate crew; besting the latter increases his pirate rank little by little and permits him to take on higher rank fights in the Coliseum in Madlantis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Naval warfare is separated into two phases: ship combat and boarding. The ship combat is a fairly straightforward action game where you and the enemy ships freely steer around a small arena and try to blast the other ship apart with cannons bolstered to either side of the ship, a front-facing machinegun, or the old standby of just ramming into the enemy vessel. While there are a few boosts you can use to give your ship a nitrous boost or repair and recover damage sustained, you’ll spend most of the time blasting at enemy vessels while trying to outmaneuver their guns and get out of the danger zones. Despite the ship combat being somewhat simplistic in nature and not truly evolving much over the short playtime, it was still a highlight for one of the best Yakuza minigames not named Dondoko Island.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>After capsizing all but the enemy leader’s vessel, the second phase of ship combat opens up with Majima leading a boarding party onto the enemy ship. This descends into an all-out brawl of the entirety of both ships until last man standing. Some of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii’s best battles are these mass battles and even with the short runtime of this year’s Gaiden title, players will look to enjoy a couple of dozen battles that used to be limited to just one or two in most mainline titles and showcase just how fun and fluid Majima and his two combat stances play.</span></p>
<p><span>Majima’s role as pirate captain on the high seas, despite its appearance as an action title, is still largely an RPG numbers game. Those crew you recruit can be assigned to various posts on the ship and either confer passive bonuses or directly increase the ship’s stats in terms of health and damage output. A much smaller 3-person squad can be assigned for special summon abilities during boarding melees while the bulk of your pirate crew can be assigned as the boarding parties themselves and take part in large scale melee brawls both on ship or on land. You’ll still have to raise their morale and either fight alongside them in enough random battles or give them gifts to raise their stats and most crew members fall into different rarities that determine their stat caps and how strong their individual abilities are. If you spend the extra few bucks on the Digital Deluxe Edition of Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii and unlock Kiryu and Ichiban as crew members, you can feasibly ignore a large chunk of the recruitment minigame and steamroll your way through most pirate encounters just by having a few top tier recruits.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>When it comes time to hit the waves in the Goromaru, sailing about can be a fairly simple and boring affair outside of the ship combat. Rather than any sort of large open world to explore, the waters are segmented into smaller maps, each with only a handful of points of interest, usually in the form of rival ship captains or small linear islands to disembark and explore for lost treasures. There’s not a lot of excitement or hidden secrets outside of these points of interest and ship battles, so expect to tune out the one sea shanty that the pirate crew sings ad nau</span><span>seam or at least put on a custom soundtrack of SEGA songs you’ve collected in Honolulu.</span></p>
<figure>

<p><span>One of the last mainline Yakuza: Like a Dragon titles brought in the largest city to date with its depiction of Honolulu and it was a given that the developers wouldn’t let it be limited to just a single game. What I didn’t quite expect was that Honolulu made up half, if not more, than the actual playtime in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. In the forty-some hours it took for me to earn the platinum trophy, I counted that I spent nearly twenty-five hours combing the streets on a Street Surfer, hitting up the Crazy Eats and Sicko Snap for some quick cash and unique loot, and trying to max out my Aloha Links so I could befriend Kei and make her part of the Majima pirate crew. Sadly, so much of Honolulu feels like it’s simply there to pad the brief runtime of Majima’s solo game and while there’s certainly a lot of diversions to see and play, players could just as easily skip over this day trip to Honolulu and just focus on the main story and still feel satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span>Marketing Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii as this grandiose swashbuckling adventure feels a little disingenuous when the actual piracy devolves down into the title’s primary minigame. All of that aside, for a Yakuza side story, Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is an amusing take on the formula and putting one of the series’ most chaotic personas at the helm of a proper followup to the final moments of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.</span></p>

					<h2>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Giving Goro Majima his own game to do whatever the hell he wants and it turning into a pirate adventure on the high seas might sound like an amazing combination, but this is one boat ride that's trapped in the conventions of the Like a Dragon series and doesn't take enough risks to be a must-play standalone title.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Majima's first canon playable experience in 30 years of story
</li><li>Ship combat, while simple, is some of the most fun since Ubisoft's pirate assassin
</li><li>Massive melee fights
</li><li>Ryuji Akiyama's comedic charms shine, especially in the live action Minato Girls segments
</li><li>Some deep cuts for the playable Master System including Star Jacker and Poseidon Wars 3-D</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Being a pirate is a small footnote to the adventure and plays largely like this year's iteration of Dondoko Island
</li><li>Extremely short runtime with intentional padding to run around Honolulu or engage in bounty hunts to raise Majima's pirate rank
</li><li>Poor PS4 performance including freezing and hitching in action sequences
</li><li>Half-length adventure at full-game price
</li><li>Story spoilers for Infinite Wealth dropped from the get-go</li>						</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elder-scrolls-vi-auction-could-let-you-create-an-in-game-npc-for-charity.1112145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-auction-charity-npc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bethesda is holding a charity auction that could allow you to create your very own character to appear in&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, with all proceeds from the auction going to the Make-a-Wish Foundation.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/2KceBLysMenA9JY9LsnSL3/bid-on-a-chance-to-create-a-character-for-the-elder-scrolls-vi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Bethesda says the winner of the auction will get "the opportunity to work with Bethesda Game Studios to create a character to appear as an NPC in&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>".</p>

<p>All money made from the auction will go directly to Make-a-Wish, and the auction is open to anyone in the United States, although you'll probably want to have a fair bit of cash handy if you're planning to bid.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-vi-make-a-wish-foundation-skyrim.jpg?itok=tEaLNbns 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-vi-make-a-wish-foundation-skyrim.jpg?itok=P1vxVeO9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>See that NPC in front of the Dragonborn? That could be your NPC, only in&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>instead of&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>At time of writing, current bidding stands at a whopping $11,650, so you're going to have to bid over that if you want to create your own&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>character. Still, at least everything is going to charity!</p>

<p>Of course, it is worth noting that&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>currently doesn't have a release window; in fact, we know very little about the game, beyond the fact that it's presumably still in development and that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-after-2026-no-ps5" rel="nofollow">probably won't release until next year or later</a>.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that Bethesda doesn't provide any kind of time frame in its post, so it could be a while before you're invited to collaborate with the studio to make your own&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>character.</p>

<p>Again, though, all of the proceeds for the bid are going to charity, so if you've got a lot of money knocking around and you're looking to spend it on a good cause, you could do a heck of a lot worse than this.</p>




<p><em>The Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>was first announced all the way back in 2018, and since then, Bethesda has been relatively radio-silent regarding the game.</p>

<p>We still don't know where it will be set or what the story will be, nor do we know what to expect with regards to gameplay (although we can guess it'll be a first-person RPG along the lines of its predecessors).</p>

<p>If you'd like to bid on the character creation auction, you can do so by heading over to the Make-a-Wish Foundation's <a href="https://my.onecause.com/event/organizations/sf-0018000000bK8c8AAC/events/vevt:fd137384-5aab-481b-bcc9-95db4365f38b/auctions/silent-auction" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Silent Auction page</a> and searching for "Bethesda", where you'll find an opportunity to contribute. Alternatively, you can <a href="https://secure2.wish.org/site/SPageServer?pagename=dfr_landing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">make a flat, non-Bethesda-related donation here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/relic-reveals-b-movie-inspired-turn-based-strategy-game-earth-vs-mars.1112142/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-earth-vs-mars-turn-based-strategy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Company of Heroes&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dawn of War&nbsp;</em>developer Relic has revealed&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars</em>, a turn-based strategy game that looks like it's taking equal inspiration from&nbsp;<em>Advance Wars&nbsp;</em>and classic 50s sci-fi B-movies.</p>

<p>The studio <a href="https://x.com/relicgames/status/1891851631622328551" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">describes</a> the game as a "Relic Labs-style" project, which probably means it's one of the first efforts we're seeing that's part of Relic's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-entertainment-future-plans" rel="nofollow">intention to branch out and create smaller games</a> alongside its flagship real-time strategy titles.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a game inspired by classic sci-fi,&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars&nbsp;</em>takes place during a Martian invasion, which sees Martians "abducting animals and humans and harvesting their atomic essence to create bizarre Martian-creature hybrids". Yikes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earth-vs-mars-relic-map.jpg?itok=knPx8MKf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earth-vs-mars-relic-map.jpg?itok=dDSHUgn- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Earth vs Mars&nbsp;</em>is set during a Martian invasion, but it's a colorful romp inspired by&nbsp;<em>Advance Wars</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather than taking the relatively serious&nbsp;<em>XCOM: Enemy Unknown&nbsp;</em>direction, Relic has chosen a more colorful&nbsp;<em>Advance Wars</em>-style aesthetic for&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars.</em></p>

<p>In a slightly terrifying twist, you'll be able to create human-creature hybrids of your own to take on the Martians. Specifically, you'll be splicing animals from Earth together, as well as with humans, to "create powerful hybrid supersoldiers" to fight alongside the military. Space Marines look positively cute in comparison.</p>

<p>Relic gives examplkes like "the fast-moving cheetah-fly", "devastating human-rhino hybrids", and "deadly squirrel-cow infantry". It's a good thing this game has a cartoony art style, because this all sounds like it has the potential to be genuinely haunting.</p>

<p>As you progress through&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars</em>' 30-plus-mission campaign, you'll gain access to new creatures and encounter new Martian enemies as well, including a "sentient organic weapon" known as the Creep, as well as "the Martians' own mutant creations".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earth-vs-mars-relic-combat.jpg?itok=JLNqI1Ke 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earth-vs-mars-relic-combat.jpg?itok=IVS2OfI9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Advance Wars&nbsp;</em>influence is really shining through here.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the aforementioned campaign,&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars&nbsp;</em>will also include an online multiplayer mode where you can face off against other players, plus a versus mode in which you can battle the AI and a fully-fledged map editor.</p>

<p><em>Earth vs Mars&nbsp;</em>is available to wishlist right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3269230/Earth_vs_Mars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. It doesn't have a release date yet, so stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass will remove 9 games from their library on February 28, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-games-leaving-xbox-game-pass-in-february-nbsp">Games Leaving Xbox Game Pass in February&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Xbox recently revealed February’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-2-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wave 2</a> Game Pass titles, including the Day 1 game Avowed, Watch Dogs Legion, F1 22, and more. The same announcement indicated that 9 games will be removed from the subscription service at the end of February. The list includes the likes of F1 22, Warhammer 40,000: Bolton, Yakuza 3 Remastered, Yakuza 4 Remastered and more. Here is the complete list of the 9 games leaving Game Pass in February:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>F1 22 (Console and PC) EA Play</li>



<li>Gris (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>Maneater (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>PAW Patrol World (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>

Meaning that, instead of looking at a mammoth of a story that can take well over 30 hours at minimum, it's a far smaller slice, this time placing Goro Majima as the main character.</p><p>Despite the absurdity of its premise, Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is indeed canon, the story taking place after the events of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. Majima has amnesia, however, which leads to a fresh start for a standalone tale that is progressively intertwined with the usual swings and roundabouts of a Yakuza story.</p><p>If you're wondering how much there actually is in the game, both from a main story and side activity standpoint, this guide covers how long Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is and what you can expect to find.</p><h2>How Long is Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii?</h2><p>Defining the length of a Yakuza or Like a Dragon is a tough endeavor due to how many side activities there usually are, as well as the usual length of the main story. <strong>For Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, you're looking at around 15 hours to tackle the main story and some side activities</strong> along the way, structured in five chapters. For reference, Yakuza games usually have around 13 or so chapters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443350-20250206034231_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443350" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443350-20250206034231_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443350"></a><figcaption>Optional islands and valuable treasure await on the high seas.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443350-20250206034231_1.jpg"></figure><p>Now, playing one of these games by only focusing on the primary storyline would be a disservice. Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is packed with lots of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-best-skills-to-unlock/2900-6255/" data-ref-id="2900-6255">skills to unlock</a> optional activities to tackle, some of which are:</p><ul><li><strong>Substories</strong>: In usual Yakuza and Like a Dragon fashion, there's an array of smaller stories to tackle. Some are introduced as you progress through the main story, while others require you to go off the beaten path to discover them. You'll either get a new mechanic, minigame, or at least a funny and endearing side story as a result.</li><li><strong>Pirates Coliseum</strong>: Commanding your own ship is a big part of the game, and the Pirates Coliseum is the perfect place to test your current crew and ship loadout. Yes, you can both upgrade and customize the ship, which will come in handy as you confront increasingly harder enemies, both in the coliseum and elsewhere while navigating.</li><li><strong>Crew building and treasure hunting</strong>: Speaking of which, recruiting crew members is a key activity. Most of them have special requests, from gathering items to reaching a specific Pirate Rank level, a reputation system of sorts. Building a good team is crucial to sailing the seas, especially if you're exploring optional islands in search of treasure, which are essentially bite-sized dungeons with a shiny chest waiting for you at the very end.</li><li><strong>Bounties</strong>: Whether you're low on cash or just looking for a challenging smackdown, there are over a dozen fights available to tackle, netting you hefty sums of money in return.</li><li><strong>Honolulu and the usual minigames</strong>: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii places a big focus on the pirate side of things, introducing a new hub called Madlantis as well as waters to navigate and explore. But this is all combined with the existing foundation of Honolulu, Hawaii that was first presented with Infinite Wealth. You get to explore the city at your own leisure and take part in familiar minigames. Most rewards are intertwined with new features like crewmembers and your pirate reputation, making for a great synergy overall.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443340-20250206020423_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443340" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443340-20250206020423_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443340"></a><figcaption>Photo Rally is one of the returning activities from Infinite Wealth. As for the mascot, I promise you he's fine. I think.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443340-20250206020423_1.jpg"></figure><p>As such, the answer to how long Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will depend entirely on what you're interested in doing and for how long. Playing on PC, I have over 26 hours logged in, but the in-game time is lower. Since I played for guides, this meant leaving the game open while I took notes and organized screenshots, for example.</p><p>I also played some minigames through completion, which added time, and there were some activities that I barely took part in, which I'm sure would have added at least another dozen hours to the overall count. Regardless of what you choose to do, the high seas of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii are yours for the taking.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-financials-2024-payday-3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze Studios has released its yearly financial report for 2024, and things are looking pretty grim for a studio that was already arguably on the ropes at the end of the previous year.</p>

<p>In its latest <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-full-year-2024/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Starbreeze says its net sales for 2024 fell by about 70% when compared to the previous year; it raked in just 185.9 million Swedish kronor this year compared to 633.5 million last year, with both&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>games dropping well into the double digits (having achieved triple-digit sales last year).</p>

<p>Pretty much all of Starbreeze's numbers are down when compared to 2023, but it looks like the Swedish developer is trying to keep a brave face, with acting CEO Mats Juhl describing the year as "intense but in many ways also successful".</p>

<p>The acting CEO, who's currently in the position following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">departure of former CEO Tobias Sjögren&nbsp;in March last year</a>, also says Starbreeze has been focusing on "establishing a strong foundation for [its] third-party publishing" this year.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the studio published "Lovecraftian Stone Age" base-builder&nbsp;<em>The Tribe Must Survive&nbsp;</em>this year, as well as the FPS roguelite&nbsp;<em>Roboquest&nbsp;</em>towards the tail end of 2023. We don't currently know what else is on Starbreeze's publishing slate for the future.</p>

He should be avoiding the frontline battles to focus on picking off targets. With the right settings and knowledge of his oft-forgotten mechanics, you’ll be able to keep your team safe.</p><h2 id="h912408"><a id=""></a>Disable Automatic Swing</h2><p>This tip is as vital for Spider-Man as it is for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774">Venom</a></span>. By default, the wallcrawler’s Web-Swing ability will automatically choose a spot to latch onto when used. Unfortunately, this can often result in a swing that veers off-course from your intended direction. It’s strongly recommended that you go into Spider-Man’s hero settings and disable the Automatic Swing option. I can attest that it will start feeling more comfortable and easier to control once you get used to it. Another benefit is that you can start aiming at the ground and Web-Swing will act more like a grapple hook.</p><h2 id="h912409"><a id=""></a>Use his hidden overhead smash melee</h2><p>There is a good chance that you’ve used an overhead hammerblow attack while smacking enemies around with his Spider-Power melee. It inflicts 50 damage, which is double the amount that his Spider-Power punches do, and is a great way to finish off a target. There isn’t any real mention of how to trigger this handy technique, but a couple of minutes in the practice range confirmed that it can be activated in the air after the following situations:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>After a Web-Swing</li><li>After a double jump</li><li>After jumping off of a wall</li></ul><h2 id="h912410"><a id=""></a>Swing in, get an elimination, swing out</h2><p>On paper, Spider-Man’s damage is not something I would describe as amazing. His smaller health pool and lack of self-sustainability also mean that drawn-out fights aren’t quite his forte. Your primary strategy will be to swing in to harass the opposing team and attempt to get eliminations, with support heroes being the primary targets.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-worst-duelists-damage-hela-hawkeye-1851739483&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-worst-duelists-damage-hela-hawkeye-1851739483"><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ Damage Heroes, Ranked From Worst To Best</a></span></p><p>Once you’ve taken out one or two opponents, swing back to safety and get healing from health packs or your team’s healers. Although Spidey’s Web-Swing has three uses and recharges every six seconds, I still recommend saving at least one for your eventual escape.</p><h2 id="h912411"><a id=""></a><strong>Combo your enemies with Spider-Tracers</strong></h2><p>Understanding how to dive with Spider-Man is crucial, but just as important is knowing how to inflict major damage. The trick is to use his Spider-Tracer mechanic to generate burst damage. His secondary fire, the ranged Cyber-Web Cluster, deals 30 damage and attaches a Spider-Tracer to the enemy. Spider-Tracers only last for three seconds, but they’ll deal an additional 45 damage if you manage to follow up with his Spider-Power melee or Amazing Combo ability. The Get Over Here! ability will also change from reeling an enemy to launching Spider-Man toward them with a flying kick.</p><p>An example of the easiest and most basic Spider-Man combo is the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Web Cluster &gt; Get Over Here! &gt; Amazing Combo</li></ul><p>You’ll want to modify this combo further depending on the situation. The typical methods to extend it are to add more Web Clusters or use the overhead smash melee. Just remember that Spider-Tracers won’t stack, although you can land a second one after triggering the first.</p><h2 id="h912412"><a id=""></a><strong>Coordinate with your team when using his Ultimate</strong></h2><p>Spectacular Spin is an amazing ultimate move. Not only does it dish out a decent amount of damage over a sizable range, but it also slows enemies down and can potentially stun them if they take too many hits. The extra 250 bonus health that Spider-Man receives is the cherry on top of a move that can change the momentum of a game.</p><p>Just don’t mistake its usefulness as proof that you can throw it out whenever. The damage can be outhealed by most support characters if they’re quick enough to respond. It’s also possible to get stunned out of this ultimate, which means that extra health will only help you so much. Your chances of getting some eliminations and escaping with health to spare are much better if you coordinate with your team. Pop this ult during a team push or at least when a support hero can cover you with some healing.</p><figure id="" data-id="68ab4bae72361db4da6a7a834838dd99" data-recommend-id="image://68ab4bae72361db4da6a7a834838dd99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1672" data-height="941" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spider-Man runs sidewalls on a wall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Spider-Man runs sidewalls on a wall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68ab4bae72361db4da6a7a834838dd99" data-recommend-id="image://68ab4bae72361db4da6a7a834838dd99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1672" data-height="941" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spider-Man runs sidewalls on a wall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h912413"><a id=""></a>Remember Your Wall Crawl Ability</h2><p>Just like the Hulk and his ability to cling to walls, it feels like most players forget that Spider-Man can do whatever a spider can. Press the jump button when near a wall to enter a crawling state. Pressing the primary attack button afterward will transition into a run. It might look a little goofy, but this is a handy ability that your enemies might not be expecting. I’ve had a lot of success with the move, whether I use it to escape a fight or latch onto a wall after an enemy Jeff tried to eject me off a ledge.</p><hr><p>As long as you make full use of Spider-Man’s kit in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, and don’t save his ultimate to attempt an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-ace-scoreboard-team-kill-mean-1851722529&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-ace-scoreboard-team-kill-mean-1851722529">Ace kill</a></span>, you should be fine. Diving in to pick off just one or two targets at a time does feel strange compared to any other game with the sarcastic webslinger, but it’s a role he excels at and one your team will be thankful for.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I really like <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/">Asus’ ROG Flow Z13</a> for what it is: a convertible tablet with way more gaming power than you would think. Looking at this thing, you might expect to see it propped up at an airport bar, in front of somebody talking into wireless headphones about Tim in Product. But there’s a lot of frame-rendering and multicore processing power inside this glass-fronted slab with a keyboard cover. It's an impressive showcase for AMD's leap forward in integrated power.</p>
<p>The Z13 can rip through <i>Hitman</i> and <i>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</i> on their highest settings at its native 2560×1600 resolution. Turn the resolution down to a reasonable-for-this-size 1920×1080 and you can play <i>Cyberpunk 2077 </i>at its Ultra settings at 45–55 frames per second, depending on your power and upscaling preferences. On a device that is essentially a beefy Microsoft Surface, this is no small thing. The <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-max-plus-395.html">AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395</a> "Strix Halo" inside the Z13, with the latest Ryzen 8060S GPU built into it, is not just capable—it's a step up from most of the gaming laptops out there.</p>
<p>As a Windows convertible, it has some interesting tech and notable upgrades from the 2022 product that was also called the ROG Flow Z13. Its webcam works with Windows Hello and logs you in 95 percent of the time. The keyboard has decent travel, the trackpad has a pleasant smoothness, and you can prop the thing up anywhere along the solid kickstand’s 170-degree range. It’s a Copilot+ PC if that matters to you, and when you’re not pushing ray-traced gaming frames, its battery life is no slouch.</p>
<p>But speaking of slouching, the Z13 will not feel light in your bag. At 2.65 pounds in tablet form and 3.2 pounds with keyboard—about 1.23 pounds heavier than a keyboard-attached <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/surface-pro-11-and-laptop-7-review-an-apple-silicon-moment-for-windows/">Surface Pro 11</a>—it’s among the heaviest of modern tablets and convertibles, and that’s before you weigh in the 1.25-pound power adapter. Using it as a Windows touchscreen tablet is rather awkward. The Z13 is many things, but it is not immune to the physics of battery power and cooling.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>In many ways, it's an in-between device. It could be the perfect compromise for someone who wants to do work and gaming on the same machine, a machine smaller and slightly lighter than most gaming laptops. If this all-in-one minded person is out there, and they’re OK with spending more than $2,000 on their mixed-use passion, I have mostly good news for them.</p>

<p>Facing the screen and keyboard, the Z13 is a black tablet with a black detachable keyboard. Only <a href="https://online-fonts.com/fonts/asus-rog">the Asus ROG font</a> glyphs on the keys and a subtle embossed ROG ally beneath the arrow keys give away that something other than Teams and Outlook is at work here.</p>
<p>Around back, it looks more like it came from the Republic of Gamers. Prominent vent holes are bisected by a clear diagonal cutout that lets through a bunch of RGB lights (which you can customize extensively in Asus’ pre-loaded Aura Sync software). Beneath the hinge, on the bottom half of the Z13, reside the M.2 storage slot, the battery pack, and another access port.</p>

    <p><span>The kickstand on the Z13 Flow has 170 degrees of range and will actually hold the thing up at each of them.</span>
                    <span>

  </div>

<p>Let's not skip over that hinged kickstand, because it is really something. It is the right amount of strong for this not-cheap, not-light device, with a stiffness that is reassuring, if also a bit tricky to get used to. A tiny plastic tab on one side of the kickstand (why not both sides?) operates it. For a tablet that can catch some glare, and could fall glass-first onto a surface, I appreciate these solid hinges.</p>
<p>Whether you’re using it for work or “work,” the Z13's port array is quite useful. The highlight is a full-size HDMI 2.1 port on the left side. There are two USB-C Type 4 ports next to that, each capable of 40Gbps transfer and slower charging. A microSD card insert and a rectangular barrel connector for the 200W power supply round out the left side.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>On the right side, a USB-A port and headphone jack form a nostalgia nook at the bottom, while the top has buttons for power, volume, and a settings button that opens, by default, a “ScreenXpert” app with shortcuts to mic muting, window layout configurations, and a few other things. I have yet to find a way to remap that button, but I’m sure it’s possible.</p>

<p>The keyboard and trackpad attach magnetically, and, as with the hinge, these magnets are not playing. Every time I’ve set up the Z13 on a dining room table or the corner of a desk, I’ve had to pry binder clips, pens, or—one time—a cereal spoon away from the bottom. The upside is that your keyboard case will not come loose in your bag. If you prefer to type with a slight upward slope, those magnets can hold the keyboard firmly in place, propped against the bottom of the tablet screen.</p>
<p>The keys themselves have respectable travel (1.7 mm), which is good if you’re going to use them for shooters or other keyboard games. You can backlight them, but not much light shows around the keys at taller angles, and the letters end up being fairly dim. Asus made reasonable sizing changes to the perimeter keys to fit everything, and I didn’t feel cramped typing on the keyboard. The trackpad is somewhere between serviceable and good, with better responsiveness for small gestures than I expected.</p>
<p>I didn't get to run extensive battery tests on this model, as the firmware changed a few times during my testing period. Asus says the 70 Wh battery is rated for 10 hours, seemingly based on a PCMark 10 "Work Mode" test. You'll almost always want to use the Z13 while it's plugged in with a barrel charger for optimal gaming performance, as even the unplugged "Performance" profile pulls between 45 to 71 W in various configurations; "Turbo" wants 60 to 86 W, and you can push it even further with manual configuration.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>Tablet is its third job (maybe)</h2>
<p>All of the preceding relates to using the Z13 as a laptop replacement, with the keyboard and trackpad attached and the screen upright on a table. How is it as a tablet? Being a pound and a half heavier than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/2022-ipad-air-review-m1-other-tablets-0/">the M1-model iPad Air</a> I’m used to holding for news reading, it was starting from behind. I quickly learned that this device is not meant to be held in a vertical orientation, due to the tiny bezels on the shorter sides that invite accidental touches, as well as the Z13's weight distribution.</p>
<p>Holding it as a horizontal tablet was better, but trying to navigate Windows 11 as a touch interface made me wish for a stylus. I grabbed a generic (non-powered) stylus, used it for a bit, and decided that the best use for a Z13 without its keyboard was viewing videos—on a plane, couch, or bed, perhaps. The hinge makes it easier to use on a lap, couch arm, or other semi-flat plane. But Windows 11 still has a lot of work to do towards becoming a touch-friendly OS.</p>
<h2><b>Screen, sounds, and Armoury</b></h2>
<p>You would hope that the screen on a tablet from the Republic of Gamers would pop, and this one does. It’s a “2.5K” display (2560×1600), 13.4 inches diagonally at a 16:10 ratio, and can refresh at up to 180 Hz. It puts out a maximum 500 nits of brightness, covers 100 percent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3">DCI-P3 spectrum</a>, and has some glare resistance from its Gorilla Glass DXC screen. To me, it looked about as good and balanced as a non-OLED screen can look at this size and distance. It’s particularly impressive when driving games past 60 Hz or watching HDR video.</p>

<p>There are four speakers on the Z13, two embedded into the front and one on each side. They get plenty loud, which is good for a device with fans rated at 50 decibels at their top speed. As for how the speakers sound, they’re about what I expect from a tablet, if a little richer at the low end and midrange, perhaps owing to the slightly thicker case size. I didn’t get to try out the microphone array on the Z13; Asus touts it as having AI noise canceling.</p>

<p>Rounding out the experience of using this device for things outside a fullscreen game are Asus’ apps: MyAsus (device and firmware updates and support), ScreenXPert (side button pop-out bar), Armoury Crate (device performance and gaming-centered settings), and Aura Sync/Creator (RGB lighting). Like most Asus software, these are interlinked apps filled with occasionally useful shortcuts, obsessive tweaks to little things, and roughly 34 points that all want your eye focus at once.</p>
<p>A bewildering array of ideas and priorities exist in these apps. There are tabs inside Armoury Crate named “Content Platform” and “Promotion” that seem built more for Asus executives than humans who use computers. It’s not too hard to avoid these things and stick to your apps and games, though you will likely want to keep them installed for BIOS and device-specific updates.</p>


<h2><b>Heavyweight gaming, for its size</b></h2>
<p>The AMD Ryzen integrated chip inside the Z13 is dubbed the “AI Max+” 395 because everything is maximum AI these days. But this is an impressive little chip in plenty of non-AI scenarios. Running at full “Turbo” settings, this little guy goes hard. It runs at 3.0 GHz and has 16 cores and 32 threads and a 32MB cache, with a unified memory architecture providing up to 96GB video RAM (I had 8GB dedicated in BIOS settings for testing). It’s not a light device, but it’s definitely punching above its weight.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>To provide a broader perspective on the Z13’s chip, I'm including the last two generations of Apple’s MacBook Pro models in some of the tests. AMD’s handouts on this chip put it up <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-slides-claim-strix-halo-can-beat-the-rtx-4070-laptop-gpu-by-up-to-68-percent-in-modern-games">against the dedicated GeForce RTX 4070 GPUs in gaming laptops</a> along with Apple's M4 Pro in benchmarks from Blender, V-Ray, and Corona. Those comparisons raised my eyebrows at first, but they're not outlandish—at least while the Z13 is plugged in and able to run its fans full blast.</p>
<p>Heat, weight, and especially battery life, while harder to definitively test, do matter. If you don't need to worry about them, though, the Z13 can do some heavy graphics work (and maybe local AI, too, if so desired). I ran all the tests shown using the Z13's highest pre-set "Turbo" profile, to mirror how the other devices were set for maximum performance. You could technically push this thing even further with manual configurations in Asus' software; I stuck to Turbo for consistency.</p>


<p>As for game performance, the Z13 and its new Radeon 8060S GPU show an impressive bump in integrated GPU performance. It was hard to pick devices to compare it against. Sometimes it was leaving other integrated GPUs in the dust, and performing more on the order of dedicated gaming laptop GPUs, but not always. In various benchmarks, the Radeon 8060S traded first place with a GeForce 3070 (with 8GB memory) inside a HP ZBook Studio G8 laptop.</p>
<p>This configuration of the 8060S is darned close to—and sometimes beats—what we saw <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/geforce-rtx-4060-review-not-thrilling-but-a-super-efficient-299-workhorse/">in the dedicated GeForce RTX 4060</a>&nbsp;and in laptops with dedicated RTX 4060 chips. Leaked 3DMark tests from last week, possibly based on earlier silicon, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amds-beastly-strix-halo-ryzen-ai-max-matches-the-rtx-4060-laptop-in-leaked-3dmark-tests">seem to back this up</a>. It's wild to think of an integrated gaming tablet GPU keeping pace with dedicated gaming laptop GPUs in heavy ray-traced <em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>benchmarks. But it's happening.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>It's not quite in the realm of dedicated&nbsp;<em>desktop</em> GPUs, of course. If you're playing at 1080p, it’s a formidable gaming device for modern titles. But if you want ray tracing or the 1600p experience, you’ll be seeing frame rates below 60 fps. The only work-around there is an eGPU setup, and that is, well, something we're not testing for here (or recommending for all but the most niche of workflows or gaming desires).</p>


<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>I've played the just-released action RPG <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/avowed-review-wait-are-we-the-baddies/"><em>Avowed</em></a>, a bit of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, some <em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em>, and the charming little game <em>SteamWorld Heist 2</em> on the Z13, using either a controller or the detachable keyboard. I've docked the Z13 to my TV, and after some typical Windows-second-screen wrangling, I found it pretty fun to play just slightly older games at 60-plus frames per second in my living room, powered by this little glowing slab underneath.</p>
<p>I've also used the Z13 as my primary computer on a plane trip and long weekend. When there's a flat surface to type on, it's a Windows laptop with almost no lag. When I have to hold it or rest it on my lap, it's wonky, at least until I adapt to how Windows wants me to work. When it was in my backpack, it felt a bit heavier than the iPad I'm used to, but I could probably get over that after a trip or two, if I had a modern game I wanted to bring along.</p>
<p>AMD's integrated graphics capabilities are the star of the show, pushing forward the notion of what a gaming tablet can do, all in a form that's probably as thin as thermodynamics allows.</p>
<p><em>This post was updated at 9:20 a.m. to add some more context to the benchmarking results.</em></p>

            <p>
Microsoft has announced its line-up of Xbox Game Pass titles for the latter half of February. 
</p>
<p>
This begins with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, which Microsoft also noted down in its list for the first half of the month too. Hmm! Otherwise, there's a thin selection of other titles on offer. Well, you're probably still playing with your fungus hero anyway.
</p>
<p>
Here's the full line-up of Xbox Game Pass titles for the rest of February:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Avowed - 18th February (Ultimate, PC)</li>
<li>EA Sports F1 24 - 20th February (Ultimate, PC)</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader - 20th February (Standard, Ultimate, PC)</li>
<li>Watch Dogs: Legion - 20th February (Standard, Ultimate, PC)</li>
</ul>

<figcaption>Is this an Xbox? Probably yes.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipoW24t90fw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
All Game Pass subscribers, including those on the service's Standard tier, get post-Brexit London simulator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs-legion">Watch Dogs: Legion</a> to play around with on 20th February. Enjoy its sunnier version of Britain's future, complete with crime-loving grannies and even more drones. Tactical turn-based isometric RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a> is available then, too.
</p>
<p>
Other than Avowed, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC subscribers this month also get EA Sports <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f1-24">F1 24</a>, should you prefer cars to magical combat.
</p>
<p>
As ever, whenever Microsoft giveth, it also taketh away. Nine games are set to leave Xbox Game Pass on 28th February, including several Yakuza titles and PAW Patrol World. Hopefully there's no tears:
</p>
<ul>
<li>F1 22 (Console and PC) - EA Play</li>
<li>Gris (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Maneater (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>PAW Patrol World (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Space Engineers (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Wo Long Fallen Dynasty (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza 3 Remastered (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza 4 Remastered (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.
</p>
<p>
For everything else in Microsoft's subscription service, you can check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-games-list-this-month-price-6400">Eurogamer's handy Xbox Game Pass guide</a> detailing the many titles available.

		<p>Nintendo has announced an end to their My Nintendo Gold Points reward scheme, ending what was a nice little cashback bonus for purchases on the eShop in the run up to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch.</p>
<p>From 25th March 2025, you will no longer earn Gold Points when making digital purchases from the eShop or when redeeming download codes. After that point, you’ll have up to 12 months from the date you earned any points to spend them on the eShop.</p>


<p>There’s further exceptions to this cut off date, as any physical games that were released prior to 25th March will still have a Gold Points redemption available to them for up to 2 years from their original release date. Any digital pre-orders placed before 25th March will also award points at the time that the purchase is completed – cancelling a pre-order will obviously exclude you from earning those points.</p>
<p>For full details, <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/news/7db7f9327a48ec83">visit the My Nintendo announcement.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/08/youll-soon-be-able-to-use-my-nintendo-gold-points-in-the-nintendo-switch-eshop/">Introduced back in 2018</a>, Nintendo Gold Points award 5% of the amount you pay when purchasing digital content, and 1% redeemed from physical games, which can then be used to fund further purchases of digital software and DLC via the eShop. It’s been a great incentive over the past 7 years, putting a few coins back into your pocket and encouraging you to keep spending and/or subsidising that next big game launch.</p>

<p>Nintendo has decided to cancel the programme practically on the eve of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">the Nintendo Switch 2’s reveal</a> and expected release. With rumours that Nintendo could push for higher game prices, and the huge player base that the Switch has going into the console transition, this kind of scheme isn’t needed anymore – it was a sweetener to help fuel platform growth after the disappointment of the Wii U.</p>
<p>Other rumours and speculation suggest that Nintendo could also be planning for a price increase for Nintendo Switch Online, and it’s entirely possible that they reconsider or restrict <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Nintendo-Switch-Online/Exclusive-benefits/Exclusive-benefits-Nintendo-Switch-Online-2719183.html">the Switch game vouchers benefit for subscribers</a>, which allows you to spend £84 to get two vouchers for certain first party and exclusive games.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Mario’s been spotted running around in a pair of swimming short on his way to a McDuck-like vault filled with all those gold coins he no longer needs to share!</p>

			<p>Today, Wired Productions and Shanghai-based indie developer Pollard Studio have announced the release date of <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-in-a-trilogy-of-trailers-released-for-karma-the-dark-world-paying-homage-to-david-lynch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARMA: The Dark World</a>. The upcoming first-person psychological thriller game will be available on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010911/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1376200/KARMA_The_Dark_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/karma_the_dark_world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-dark-world-karma-3921c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>) starting March 27, priced at $24.99. Pre-orders will be able to enjoy a 10% discount on either platform, and owners of a prior Wired Productions title on Steam can get an extra 10% off.</p>
<p>The game will also be enhanced on PlayStation 5 Pro thanks to full-featured PSSR integration, which will enhance image quality, definition, and texture clarity—along with improved reflections and distance rendering—providing what is being described as 'rock solid 60fps performance' at 4K resolution. An Xbox version is also being developed and will launch later.</p>
<p>Leo Zullo, Managing Director at Wired Productions, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Wired Productions has always championed storytellers who push the boundaries and craft compelling narratives. Yonghe Wang and Pollard Studio team have raised the bar and have delivered a rollercoaster assault on the senses, in an abstract, surreal, dark yet hauntingly beautiful cinematic gaming masterpiece. If Kojima, Christopher Nolan and the late and great David Lynch ever had the chance to work on a project from China, KARMA: The Dark World might just be the end result.</em></p>

<p>KARMA: The Dark World is a first-person psychological thriller game set in a dystopian alternate East Germany in 1984. In this time and place, the Leviathan Corporation rules with an iron fist, controlling its citizens through mass surveillance, social class rules, mind-altering drugs and the promise that the gates to utopia will open for those who serve.</p>
<p>Players will become Daniel McGovern, a Roam Agent for Leviathan's Thought Bureau. Using advanced technology to enter the minds of the accused, they will investigate crime scenes, interview suspects, and report their findings back to Leviathan.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-gold-points-reward-scheme-to-end-in-march.1112067/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gold-point-scheme-ending-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that its Gold Points reward scheme will be coming to an end in March, but you'll still be able to spend the points you've accrued after the closing date.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/news/7db7f9327a48ec83" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official announcement</a> on its website, the Japanese gaming giant says you'll no longer earn Gold Points for Switch purchases after March 25th. However, since Gold Points expire twelve months after purchase, any you have left over will still be valid until a year after you acquired them.</p>

<p>Naturally, this means that not only will you not be able to earn Gold Points through buying games on Switch, but you also won't get them through Nintendo's website or through redeemed download codes anymore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-gold-points-ending-cycle.jpg?itok=sj9DujkX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-gold-points-ending-cycle.jpg?itok=rKUvpCaw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo's Gold Point scheme is coming to an end soon.</figcaption></figure><p>If you pre-order anything via the Nintendo eShop prior to March 24th, you'll still earn the Gold Points for that pre-order, even if the payment is processed after March 25th.</p>

<p>However, if you cancel that pre-order, then you won't get Gold Points anymore, even if you re-up your pre-order at some point later down the line. Bear that in mind if you're umming and ahhing about one of your pre-orders right now.</p>

<p>Nintendo confirms later in the announcement post that you'll still be able to spend your Gold Points for up to a year after you get them, even if you're spending them after the cutoff date. You just won't earn any more from that point onwards.</p>

<p>No reason is given in the post for Nintendo's decision to end the Gold Point scheme, but I'm assuming that it has something to do with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">impending arrival of the Switch 2</a>, which may bring a scheme that replaces Gold Points with it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-gold-points.jpg?itok=1ivxFvzf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-gold-points.jpg?itok=_xII6sKn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch 2's arrival is imminent, which could have something to do with the discontinuation of Gold Points.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're not aware of Gold Points, they're a reward scheme by which you earn points for certain Switch games or other software you buy. You can then use those points to get discounts on future store purchases.</p>

<p>If you're thinking of buying anything on Switch, it's probably best to do it before March 25th so you can get your hands on those sweet, sweet Gold Points. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Another small patch for VALORANT has been deployed, with patch 10.03 giving the minimap a visual upgrade and updating the effect of slow abilities. The smaller patch size is due to the soon-to-start <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-masters-bangkok-2025-teams-schedule-prize-pool-where-to-watch/">Masters Bangkok event</a>, and the patch will deploy a day later than usual due to a Riot holiday.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-valorant-10-03-patch-notes">Full VALORANT 10.03 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>The slowing abilities of Chamber, Skye, and Harbor will now slow dash abilities. Dash abilities include Jett’s Tailwind and Neon’s Slide. Previously, agents like Jett and Neon could dash at full speed even if they were caught by a slow, but now <strong>slowing abilities will slow a dash by 50 percent</strong>. These abilities now all slow dashes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Chamber’s Trademark</li>



<li>Skye’s Trailblazer</li>



<li>Harbor’s Cascade and High Tide</li>



<li><a href="https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Status_Effect#Concuss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concussive</a> abilities:
<ul>
<li>Astra’s Nova Pulse</li>



<li>Breach’s Fault Line and Rolling Thunder</li>



<li>Cypher’s Trapwire</li>



<li>Deadlock’s Sonic Sensor</li>



<li>Gekko’s Wingman</li>



<li>Harbor’s Reckoning</li>



<li>Neon’s Relay Bolt</li>



<li>Tejo’s Special Delivery</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The minimap visuals have been updated, providing “increased gameplay clarity and fidelity.” The minimap now uses shading to clearly show elevated spots across the whole map, as well as ziplines.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-valorant-patch-10-03-bug-fixes">VALORANT Patch 10.03 Bug Fixes</h2>



<ul>
<li>Fixed issues where explosive damaging utility could kill sentinel trap abilities like Vyse’s Arc Rose from vastly outside its intended radius.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where you could not move/use the buy menu while the remake vote screen is displayed. This new voting widget also color corrects the confirmation button to be green and the decline button to be red.</li>



<li><strong>(Console):</strong> You can now add and edit friend notes for your Riot friends.
<ul>
<li>You can use the friends list search field to filter your friends list by player name or tag.</li>



<li>When you have more than four party invites, the friends list will now hide them so you can still see your friends. You can click ‘Show More’ to display any hidden invites.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>(Console): </strong>Fixed an issue where Remake-ended matches in Competitive queue would display incorrect end-of-game screens after the game.</li>



<li><strong>(Console): </strong>Fixed an issue where navigating players on the Leaderboard would sometimes highlight multiple players.</li>



<li><strong>(PC): </strong>Fixed an issue on the Premier tournament bracket screen where match score was occasionally displayed in black.</li>



<li><strong>PC: </strong>Fixed an issue where the Premier tournament bracket was not properly centered on some ultrawide displays.</li>
</ul>

                <p>Nintendo has officially announced that its Gold Points rewards program will soon be discontinued, as the loyalty service will end on March 25, 2025. Originally introduced as a method to earn a discount on purchases through the Switch eShop and the official Nintendo website, Gold Points are currently acquired by purchasing digital or physical copies of games.</p><p><a href="https://my.nintendo.com/news/7db7f9327a48ec83" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Nintendo</a>, any points earned before the cut-off date will still be usable and will remain valid for 12 months after they've been earned. This includes digital purchases and preorders made on or before March 24, and physical games can still be registered for Gold Points rewards so long as the game is released by March 24. </p><div

As for why Nintendo is discontinuing the loyalty program, it hasn't given a concrete answer yet in its official announcement.</p><p>One possible reason here could be the upcoming launch of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2 console</a>, as Nintendo might be looking to gain as much financial momentum as possible when its Switch successor arrives. The Switch 2 is already generating an impressive amount of hype, so it's likely that Nintendo doesn't need to incentivize people to purchase games for the system during this initial launch period.</p><p>For a closer look at the console, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/now-we-know-exactly-when-switch-2-nintendo-direct-is-happening/1100-6529256/">Switch 2 Direct is scheduled for April 4</a> and Nintendo will also host global <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-to-try-the-switch-2-before-its-released/1100-6528849/">Switch 2 Experience events</a> to give people hands-on time with the device.</p>

			<p>The latest versions of the Unreal Engine 5 feature systems designed to prevent shader compilation issues, but they reportedly don't work well without additional work from developers.</p>
<p>During their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry went over a recent <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/tech-blog/game-engines-and-shader-stuttering-unreal-engines-solution-to-the-problem">blog post</a> shared by Epic on the Unreal Engine official website detailing why shader caching stuttering issues occur, highlighting how the shader compilation process designed in the past reached a breaking point in Direct3D 11 with the increase in shader code, and how it was addressed in modern APIs like Direct3D 12 and Vulkan with the introduction of PSOs, Pipeline State Objects, which opened up a lot of other issues, even in Unreal Engine despite the engine providing solutions for developers to compile PSOs so that game performance isn't impacted which continue to be worked on and improved. The blog post also addresses the misconception that shader compilation stuttering issues were introduced in DirectX 12, as they are a result of the increased shader code and general complexity, rather than anything the API has introduced over the previous version.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, these systems Epic introduced to reduce stuttering issues reportedly don't function as intended without developers' intervention. According to what technically-minded developers have told Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia, these systems don't work properly from Unreal Engine 5.1 to 5.4 and require specialized work to actually make them function as intended. Still, Digital Foundry found what Epic has outlined in the blog post, such as addressing Global Shaders issues which cause a lot of issues in a lot of games, and working with hardware and software vendors to adapt drivers and graphics APIs very promising, so hopefully, future versions of the engine will provide better experiences on PC than the current versions do.</p>

<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version 5.5, which introduces an experimental new feature dubbed the Nanite of lights called <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-5-megalights-performance-improvements/">MegaLights</a>, Sequencer improvements, and much more. You can learn more about this version of the game engine on its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-5-is-now-available">official website.</a></p>
