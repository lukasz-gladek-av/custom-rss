            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cambridge-dictionary%E2%80%99s-new-gaming-words-are-kind-of-a-mess.937824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cambridge-dictionary-new-gaming-words<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Cambridge Dictionary has shared a list of over 3000 words it's added to its dictionary this year, and the new words under the gaming category are...questionable, to say the least.</p>
<p>In a post on its website, the Cambridge Dictionary runs down some of the new words it's added to its ranks so far in 2024, with categories like "slang and informal language", "music", and "modern life" all getting new additions.</p>
<p>Of course, "gaming" is also one of the categories, and new words that have been added to the dictionary in this vein this year include "MMORPG", "PvP", and "speedrun", to name but a few.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-cambridge-dictionary-mmorpg.jpg?itok=q6nIM3RZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-cambridge-dictionary-mmorpg.jpg?itok=E0XzzYDi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"MMORPG" is one of the Cambridge Dictionary's new words.</figcaption></figure><p>The Cambridge Dictionary defines "speedrun" as completing a game "as quickly as possible, especially by taking advantage of any glitches", which is mostly fine.</p>
<p>"Side quest", meanwhile, is defined as "a part of a computer game that hs its own aim and story but is not part of the main game". I guess we can let that one slide, although there are plenty of pedantic things we could say about it.</p>
<p>Things get a little weird, though, when we look at the Dictionary's definition for "PvP". The definition itself is a touch wobbly, referring to a game in which "there are many players who are each other's opponents", which feels a bit off. Is&nbsp;<em>Tekken&nbsp;</em>not a PvP game when played offline?</p>
<p>The example, though, is where things break down a little. The Dictionary's example reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don’t enjoy PvP, how about PvE, or “player versus engine”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, that's not what PvE stands for, but the strange thing is that the Cambridge Dictionary does get this right on the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/pve" rel="noopener" target="_blank">actual definition page for PvE</a>, referring to "player versus environment". How strange!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tekken-8-cambridge-dictionary.jpg?itok=pl0Cv8yQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tekken-8-cambridge-dictionary.jpg?itok=GY5Rnn2j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>might struggle to qualify as a PvP game under the Cambridge Dictionary's definition.</figcaption></figure><p>That's not all, though. The Cambridge Dictionary lists "backread" as one of its online gaming-related words, but the definition of backread simply relates to scrolling through a backlog of group messages to catch up with the latest info.</p>
<p>"Backread" doesn't feel like an explicitly gaming-related word, which is probably why it also appears in the "internet" category, but "review bomb", which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earth-defense-force-6-review-bomb-epic">almost inarguably</a> applies to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/once-human-review-bomb-privacy-netease-response">games as well</a>, seems absent from the gaming word group. Hmm.</p>
<p>I'm just ribbing the Cambridge Dictionary, but its list of new words is genuinely fascinating, so make sure to check out <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/news-and-insights/news/cambridge-dictionary-new-words-2024#group-section-Gaming-Ph8PE2Sagz" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the blog post</a> for a few more, including amusing entries like "chef's kiss", "porch piracy", and "microsleep".</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206529/intel-13th-14th-gen-crashing-instability-cpu-voltage-q-a</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206529/intel-13th-14th-gen-crashing-instability-cpu-voltage-q-a<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Monday, it initially seemed like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/22/24203959/intel-core-13th-14th-gen-cpu-crash-update-patch">beginning of the end for Intel’s desktop CPU instability woes</a> — the company confirmed a patch is coming in mid-August that should address the “root cause” of exposure to elevated voltage. But if your 13th or 14th Gen Intel Core processor is already crashing, that patch apparently won’t fix it. </p><p>Citing unnamed sources,<em> </em><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-finally-announces-a-solution-for-cpu-crashing-errors-claims-elevated-voltages-are-the-root-cause-fix-coming-by-mid-august"><em>Tom’s Hardware </em>reports</a> that any degradation of the processor is irreversible, and an Intel spokesperson did not deny that when we asked. Intel is “confident” the patch will keep it from happening in the first place. (As another preventative measure, you should update your motherboard BIOS ASAP.) But if your defective CPU has been damaged, your best option is to replace it instead of tweaking BIOS settings to try and alleviate the problems. </p><p>And, Intel confirms, too-high voltages aren’t the only reason some of these chips are failing. Intel spokesperson Thomas Hannaford confirms it’s <em>a</em> primary cause, but the company is still investigating. Intel community manager Lex Hoyos also revealed some instability reports can be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/1e9mf04/comment/lefz09c/">traced back to an oxidization manufacturing issue</a> that was fixed at an unspecified date last year.</p><p>This raises lots of questions. Will Intel recall these chips? Extend their warranty? Replace them no questions asked? Pause sales <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205416/amd-zen-5-ryzen-9000-desktop-delay">like AMD just did</a> with its Ryzen 9000? Identify faulty batches with the manufacturing defect?   </p><p>We asked Intel these questions, and I’m not sure you’re going to like the answers. </p><div><p>Why are these still on sale without so much as an extended warranty?</p></div><p>Intel has not halted sales or clawed back any inventory. It will not do a recall, period. The company is not currently commenting on whether or how it might extend its warranty. It would not share estimates with <em>The Verge</em> of how many chips are likely to be irreversibly impacted, and it did not explain why it’s continuing to sell these chips ahead of any fix. </p><p>Intel’s not yet telling us how warranty replacements will work beyond trying customer support again if you’ve previously been rejected. It did not explain how it will contact customers with these chips to warn them about the issue.</p><p>But Intel <em>does</em> tell us it’s “confident” that you don’t need to worry about invisible degradation. If you’re not currently experiencing issues, the patch “will be an effective preventative solution for processors already in service.” (If you don’t know if you’re experiencing issues, Intel currently suggests <a href="https://youtu.be/wkrOYfmXhIc?si=XzCym6UjLcF3_yW2&amp;t=497">the Robeytech test</a>.)</p><p>And, perhaps for the first time, Intel has confirmed just how broad this issue could possibly be. The elevated voltages could potentially affect any 13th or 14th Gen desktop processor that consumes 65W or more power, not just the highest i9-series chips that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125036/intel-game-crash-13900k-14900k-fortnite-unreal-engine-investigation">initially seemed to be experiencing the issue</a>.</p><p>Here are the questions we asked Intel and the answers we’ve received by email from Intel’s Hannaford:</p><p><strong>How many chips does&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;estimate are likely to be irreversibly impacted by these issues?</strong></p><p>Intel&nbsp;Core 13th and 14th Generation desktop processors with 65W or higher base power – including K/KF/KS and 65W non-K variants – could be affected by the elevated voltages issue. However, this does not mean that all processors listed are (or will be) impacted by the elevated voltages issue.</p><p>Intel&nbsp;continues validation to ensure that scenarios of instability reported to&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;regarding its Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors are addressed.</p><p>For customers who are or have been experiencing instability symptoms on their 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processors,&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;continues advising them to reach out to&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;Customer Support for further assistance. Additionally, if customers have experienced these instability symptoms on their 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processors but had RMA [return merchandise authorization] requests rejected we ask that they reach out to&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;Customer Support for further assistance and remediation.</p><p><strong>Will&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;issue a recall?</strong></p><p>No.</p><p><strong>Will Intel proactively warn buyers of these chips about the warning signs or that this update is required? If so, how will it warn them?</strong></p><p>Intel&nbsp;targets to release a production microcode update to OEM/ODM customers by mid-August or sooner and will share additional details on the microcode patch at that time.</p><p>Intel&nbsp;is investigating options to easily identify affected processors on end user systems. In the interim, as a general best practice&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;recommends that users adhere to&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;Default Settings on their desktop processors, along with ensuring their BIOS is up to date.</p><p><strong>Has&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;halted sales and / or performed any channel inventory recalls while it validates the update?</strong></p><p>No.</p><p><strong>Does&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;anticipate the fix will be effective for chips that have already been in service but are not yet experiencing symptoms (i.e., invisible degradation)? Are those CPUs just living on borrowed time?</strong></p><p>Intel&nbsp;is confident that the microcode patch will be an effective preventative solution for processors already in service, though validation continues to ensure that scenarios of instability reported to&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;regarding its Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors are addressed.</p><p>Intel&nbsp;is investigating options to easily identify affected or at-risk processors on end user systems.</p><p>It is&nbsp;<em>possible</em>&nbsp;the patch will provide some instability improvements to currently impacted processors; however customers experiencing instability on their 13th or 14th Generation desktop processor-based systems should contact&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;customer support for further assistance.</p><p><strong>Will&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;extend its warranty on these 13th Gen and 14th Gen parts, and for how long?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>[No answer yet.]</p><p><strong>Given how difficult this issue was for&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;to pin down, what&nbsp;proof will customers need to share to obtain an RMA?&nbsp;(How lenient will&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;be?)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>[No answer yet.]</p><p><strong>What will&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;do for 13th Gen buyers after supply of 13th Gen parts runs out? Final shipments were set to end last month,&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-axes-13th-gen-core-i5-i7-i9-k-series-cpus-lineup-will-be-discontinued-by-may-24th-2024"><strong>I’m reading</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Intel&nbsp;is committed to making sure all customers who have or are currently experiencing instability symptoms on their 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processors are supported in the exchange process. This includes working with&nbsp;Intel’s retail and channel customers to ensure end users are taken care of regarding instability symptoms with their&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;Core 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processors.</p><p><strong>What will&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;do for 14th Gen buyers after supply of 14th Gen parts run out?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Same as above.</p><p><strong>Will replacement / RMA’d chips ship with the microcode update preapplied beginning in August? Is&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;still shipping replacement chips ahead of that update?</strong></p><p>Intel&nbsp;will be applying to microcode to 13th/14th Gen desktop processors that are not yet shipped once the production patch is released to OEM/ODM partners (targeting mid-August or sooner). For 13th /14th Gen desktop processors already in service, users will need to apply the patch via BIOS update once available.</p><p><strong>What, if anything, can customers do to slow or stop degradation&nbsp;ahead of the microcode update?</strong></p><p>Intel&nbsp;recommends that users adhere to&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;Default Settings on their desktop processors, along with ensuring their BIOS is up to date. Once the microcode patch is released to&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;partners, we advise users check for the relevant BIOS updates.</p><p><strong>Will&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;share specific manufacturing dates and serial number ranges for the oxidized processors so mission-critical businesses can selectively rip and replace?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Intel&nbsp;will continue working with its customers on Via Oxidation-related reports and ensure that they are fully supported in the exchange process.</p><div><p><strong>Why does&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;believe the instability issues </strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/1e9mf04/comment/lekoj61/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><strong>do not affect mobile laptop chips</strong></a><strong>?&nbsp;</strong></p></div><p>Intel&nbsp;is continuing its investigation to ensure that reported instability scenarios on&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;Core 13th/14th Gen processors are properly addressed.</p><p>This includes ongoing analysis to confirm the primary factors preventing 13th / 14th Gen mobile processor exposure to the same instability issue as the 13th/14th Gen desktop processors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>That’s all we’ve heard from Intel so far, though Hannaford assured us more answers are on the way and that the company is working on remedies. </p><p>Again, if your CPU is already damaged, you need to get Intel to replace it, and if Intel won’t do so, please let us know. In the meanwhile, you’ll want to update your BIOS as soon as possible because your processor could potentially be invisibly damaging itself — and if you know your way around a BIOS, you may want to adjust your motherboard to Intel’s default performance profiles, too.</p><p>Lastly, here is that Robeytech video that Intel is recommending to Redditors to potentially help them identify if their chip has an issue. Intel says it’s looking into other ways to identify that, too. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-update-to-morrowind-like-rpg-dread-delusion-adds-a-big-nautilus-with-a-town-built-inside-its-shell.937818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-update-to-morrowind-like-rpg-dread-delusion-adds-a-big-nautilus-with-a-town-built-inside-its-shell<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>In a recent interview, the director of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> said that if you made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a> today, it would struggle to find an audience. "If you play that right now," he said, "there is no compass, no map, literally the quests are like 'go to the third tree on the right and walk 50 paces west'... And if you did that now, no one would play it. Very few people would play it." Well sir, have you heard of a little open world RPG called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dread-delusion">Dread Delusion</a>? It's pretty good. And what's more, it has just added a whole new area with - let me see - a giant floating squid creature with an entire town of citizens living inside its shell. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>This "final content update" will add the Cephalok, "a magical creature filled with rare materials, where legends tell of some Wikkans who built a castle inside of its shell." To get inside the floating beast you'll need to have unlocked the airship. Naturally, there'll be some new enemies to deal with, but also "powerful, late-game items" like weapons and equipment, plus "new airship components to further customize your flying vessel".</p>
<p>There's also a "hard mode" included in the update, which will see your attacks and spells costing more stamina and mana to perform, while enemies will also hit harder and attack in groups. Items and ingredients will also be rarer, say developers Lovely Hellplace, which presumably means you'll have to be more judicious about healing and such. All this comes after last week's big performance patch, which fixed a lot of smaller things like FPS drops when entering new regions.</p>
<p>I admit picking on TESO director Matt Firor's quote from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-the-checklist-conquered-the-open-world-from-morrowind-to-skyrim">Edwin's recent musings on the open world genre</a> is not entirely fair. For one thing, there is a map <em>and</em> a compass in Dread Delusion. It's not a particularly clear map (a big ongoing quest involves finding the landmarks required to fill in all the blank spaces for the cartographer's guild). But it is one concession to players keen to experience the Morrowindy RPG without getting hopelessly lost. That aside, Dread Delusion is a game that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-needs-a-morrowind-remake-when-you-can-explore-the-beautiful-nightmare-of-dread-delusion">trusts the player to discover the weirdness of its world</a> at their own pace. It takes an old-school approach that modern open world games (like those from Bethesda) don't follow because, as Firor's words suggest, they are often preoccupied with selling to a broad audience. </p>
<p>Dread Delusion doesn't want a broad audience. It wants the kind of people who think mushrooms ought to be twelve feet tall and luminous. It wants an audience of sickos who will pledge allegiance to a moaning god suspended from the rafters of an abandoned house like a sac of spider eggs. It desires a player who will see a giant nautilus floating in the sky and think: "I bet there's something weird inside that big lad."</p>

Don’t they just make it harder to do your job? Well according to Kinema, a union is only as good as the people at the helm, just like any other democratic institution.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unions are only as good as the people at the helm, as with most organizations">Unions are only as good as the people at the helm, as with most organizations</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“There's an argument to be said that the democratic functions [of a union] can be taken over for bad means—it's true,” Kinema said. “And there is a rich history of labor organizing, especially dating far back into like the twenties through the sixties, where there were issues with, for instance, the mafia getting involved with the teamsters.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But such instances are often the result of institutional and exterior influence, according to Kinema. “Often that was the police working with the mafia to infiltrate and take over leadership of those unions, and usually that followed when there was previous progressive or socialist leadership of those unions who then got purged because of government regulations [and] ‘red scare’ type stuff.”&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“So you have to understand that history,” she said. “When you purge progressive leadership from the union movement, what follows is reactionary leadership in the union movement, right?”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unions can lead to meaningful change">Unions can lead to meaningful change</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mitchell argues that in the right hands, a union can not only affect meaningful change in an individual’s workplace, but also for everyone else working in the United States.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Unions are huge for pushing workers’ rights to legislation,” she said. “Workers unions are why we have ‘eight hours a day, five days a week,’ they're why we have child labor laws, they're why we have sick leave, paternity leave, maternity leave.”&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it has to be a concerted effort, she adds. “It's not like one little union from a Kentucky coal mine decided ‘Hey, I only want to do eight hours a day.’ That took way more, they had to get together. They all had to work together to accomplish that and to achieve that and to push for legislation for that to become reality.”</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendants-new-major-content-update-is-releasing-early/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1816820774793335103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, Nexon announced that the anticipated Week 5 Update for The First Descendant will now release early on July 31, 2024.</p>



<p>Nexon originally planned to release the update just a day later on August 1, 2024. So, it isn’t arriving much earlier than previously expected, but the move can still be rare.</p>



<p>Also, Nexon further revealed a look at the Ult Valby cosmetic. The footage was purely cinematic and did not include any new gameplay. As seen in today’s brief teaser, the Ult Valby has a more suggestive look than previous cosmetics.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📢Big News: The Week 5 Update is coming to Albion a day earlier<br>Be ready to dive into the crystal-clear waves with Ult Valby on 7/31! 🌊✨ <a href="https://t.co/chXjRybAsu">pic.twitter.com/chXjRybAsu</a></p>— The First Descendant (@FirstDescendant) <a href="https://twitter.com/FirstDescendant/status/1816820774793335103?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>The Week 5 update will introduce new Descendants, gear, balancing changes, and more. Nexon recently teased an image of Luna <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1816413089207857305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a>, a new descendant described as a “buff-type supporter” who uses music for their special abilities.</p>



<p>Nexon elaborated on the Week 5 update with an <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2608718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official preview</a> yesterday. There will be a new Peace Mediator weapon, Arche Concretion module, the “mutated Devourer-type Gluttony,” and more.</p>



<p>The First Descendant recently faced some fan backlash over similarities to Destiny 2 imagery. However, the developers promptly issued <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-developer-issues-response-over-destiny-2-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a clear response</a>, and committed to adjustments for related content.</p>



<p>Nexon also recently announced that the new third-person looter shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached 10 million players</a> across all platforms in a single week. </p>



<p>The First Descendant first launched just weeks ago, and is available now on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>

                <p>As far as board games go, few are as well-known as Monopoly.

                <p>Earlier this week, it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indie-game-publisher-humble-games-reportedly-lays-off-all-staff/1100-6525236/" data-ref-id="1100-6525236">announced that publisher Humble Games laid off its entire staff of 36</a>. This mass layoff did not solely affect its immediate staff, but also the developers and games under the publisher, such as the developer of Coral Island now facing uncertainty regarding its Xbox, Switch, and PlayStation versions.</p><p>Developer Stairway Games revealed in a statement that the Humble Games layoffs have left it unable to release updates for the console versions of its game, due to Humble typically handling them. The team explained that an incoming hotfix is unable to be released outside of Steam and that they really "have no idea" how to release this update to console players due to the lack of backend permissions on those platforms. Stairway also acknowledged the long wait for the Switch port, which was announced for 2024, but has yet to be released.</p><p>You can read the full statement below, in which the developer acknowledges the situation "f***ing sucks."</p><p>The game <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coralisland/coral-island-reimagining-the-farm-sim-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">previously raised $1.5 million</a> and reached its Kickstarter stretch goal for console and Switch. As a make-good to those who backed the Kickstarter to receive a Switch key, Stairway is offering replacement keys on Steam.</p><p>Some of the noteworthy games published by Humble Games previously include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/a-hat-in-time/" data-ref-id="5000-248933">A Hat in Time</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/carto/" data-ref-id="5000-505832">Carto</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/one-step-from-eden/" data-ref-id="5000-489002">One Step From Eden</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forager/" data-ref-id="5000-479738">Forager</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/slay-the-spire-review-trend-setter/1900-6417497/" data-ref-id="1900-6417497">Slay the Spire</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/temtem/" data-ref-id="5000-482689">Temtem</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/moonscars/" data-ref-id="5000-560764">Moonscars</a>.</p><p>This is not the first time mass layoffs <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">have occurred within the games industry in the past year</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mirthwood-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mirthwood-release-date-brings-a-morally-charged-life-sim-in-september.937770/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mirthwood-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>V Publishing and Bad Ridge Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>release date, and the game, developed by a two-man indie outfit, will be out later this year.</p>
<p><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>is a life sim that offers a spicy dash of morality alongside the usual farming, getting to know the townspeople, and cozy adventuring, and it's launching on PC on September 11th. There's no word on a console version just yet.</p>
<p>The devs explicitly cite&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stardew-valley"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>&nbsp;(that's the originals, not the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fable-2025">new Xbox project</a>),&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rimworld"><em>RimWorld</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sims-4">The Sims</a>&nbsp;</em>as inspirations for&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>, so if any of those games are your jam, this one should be on your radar.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mirthwood-release-date-farmstead.jpg?itok=JGdbKIRo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mirthwood-release-date-farmstead.jpg?itok=fUVq8xkT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>will have a few unusual twists on top of its farming sim gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>You begin as an adventurer who's fleeing "a continent swept with war" and looking for a fresh start. However, somewhat unusually for a life sim, that fresh start doesn't have to be a morally upstanding one.</p>
<p><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>blends typical life sim gameplay - managing and upgrading a farmstead, exploring the local environs for monsters to slay (in a cozy way, obviously), and meeting townsfolk - with a morality system inspired by&nbsp;<em>inFamous&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>.</p>
<p>Bad Ridge says you'll be able to take either a good or an evil path through&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>, and presumably, villagers' responses to you will change depending on what kind of person you are.</p>
<p>You can add&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Don't Starve&nbsp;</em>to the list of inspirations&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>can claim, by the way, as this release date trailer will attest to.</p>

<p>When you interact with villagers, you'll do so via a&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-inspired interaction system that lets you choose from a variety of different conversation topics, and building relationships will also potentially unlock new quests for you to chase.</p>
<p>In short, while&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>offers yet more cozy game-style shenanigans, it looks like it's doing enough to differentiate itself from the legions of its peers currently harvesting their crops and romancing the townspeople.</p>
<p>You can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272900/Mirthwood/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">on Steam right now</a> ahead of its September 11th launch. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-7th-continent-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions.937767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/7th-continent-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>The 7th Continent, a game that emerged from a wildly successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/the-7th-continent-what-goes-up-must-come-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kickstarter</a> campaign, has not only met but exceeded the high expectations initially set for it. It's an immersive game that draws inspiration from choose-your-own-adventure novels, video games, as well as legendary authors Jules Verne and H.P. Lovecraft. It's not just one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games"><u>best cooperative board games</u></a> but also an exhilarating solo experience that has earned its place among the medium’s finest.</p><p>As with other successful board games, The 7th Continent has seen several expansions that further iterate upon the core gameplay and add more harrowing scenarios. Given the number of releases over the years, however, it might be difficult to decide which packages to consider and in which order. That’s why we have crafted this handy buying guide that will walk you through the various releases and what each offers. Luckily, starting isn’t too difficult as there is really only one place to begin, the base game.</p><h2>The Base Game</h2><p id="the-7th-continent"><h3 data-toc-title="The 7th Continent">The 7th Continent</h3></p><div catalogid="0337b024-a14d-4c5b-8a95-55c3c3d47e1e" id="205233"><div id="205233" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $69.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 14+</li><li>Players: 1-4</li><li>Play Time: 5-1000 mins</li></ul><p>The 7th Continent is a heavily thematic board game that immerses players in the story of explorers returning to the newly discovered titular land. Together, they must remove a curse placed upon them during their last expedition. The continent, still largely uncharted, remains treacherous and mysterious, unfolding before players as they explore. The game doesn’t give players much direction when it comes to lifting the curse. Instead, players are dropped into a dangerous world, asked to explore, and must deal with various perils as they appear. This enveloping narrative, combined with the game's unique mechanics, creates a challenging and captivating experience.</p><p>Mechanically speaking, The 7th Continent is a narrative-driven card game with an expanding board of tiles that are placed when players meet various requirements. Like other explorative survival board games, it features crafting, combat, and even RPG elements. However, it’s The 7th Continent’s unique mechanics that set it apart from other titles in the genre, making it an unforgettable experience. For example, the card deck players draw from to resolve actions and add to their respective hands also serves as their life force. Once players work their way through the deck, they risk pulling a curse card, ending the game and resulting in a loss. Also, you might notice that campaigns can run quite long; luckily, however, The 7th Continent includes a handy save feature that allows players to pause, pack up the contents, and pick up the story at a later time. Still, due to its length, it might be difficult to get the same group of players together, but you can also take The 7th Continent at your own pace as a single-player campaign, considering it is one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games"><u>best solo board games</u></a> currently available.</p><p>The various curses in the box make up the scenarios, and there are four alone in the base game—each of which takes players hours to complete. Multiple curses can be combined in the same campaign to add even more variability to the base game. With plenty of random events baked in, the Core Box offers plenty of replayability on its own, but players looking to revisit the mystifying world on multiple occasions may want to check out one of The 7th Continent’s several expansions.</p><h2>Main Expansions</h2></div><p id="crystals-songgame-modes-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Crystal's Song/Game Modes Expansion">The 7th Continent: The Crystal's Song &amp; Game Modes Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="ce12b08d-8d49-4133-93ac-48fa4e1c20b2" id="205235"><div id="205235" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: The Crystal's Song &amp; Game Modes Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $12.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Curse</li><li>3 New Game Modes</li><li>1 Divider</li><li>40 New Cards</li></ul><p>While The Voracious Goddess curse in the Core Box was initially the recommended starting point for new players, The Crystal’s Song curse in this expansion has since become the ideal first scenario thanks to its brief and tutorial-esque introduction to The 7th Continent’s mechanics. In fact, publisher Serious Poulp bundles The Crystal’s Song and the Core Box together as a starter pack. Additionally, the expansion includes an easier Prodigy Mode, an advanced Immortal Mode, and a tense Traitor Mode that gives players secret objectives. Not only is this the first expansion most players should pick up, but it’s actually a recommended purchase alongside the base game if possible.</p></div><p id="the-icy-maze-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="The Icy Maze Expansion">The 7th Continent: The Icy Maze Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="c8df1164-8e0a-4d52-a44d-00829d7f204e" id="205238"><div id="205238" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: The Icy Maze Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Curse</li><li>96 New Cards</li></ul><p>The 7th Continent Website actually recommends playing The Icy Maze before The Bloody Hunt – the last curse in the Core Box, which requires an in-depth knowledge of the map and mechanics. It’s certainly not a requirement to play The Icy Maze before finishing the base game, or at all, even, but if you feel that cutting your teeth on the more advanced Bloody Hunt is trying your patience, just know it’s designed too. The Icy Maze places an emphasis on movement, eventually giving players a greater understanding of the various corners of the continent.</p></div><p id="the-forbidden-sanctuary-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="The Forbidden Sanctuary Expansion">The 7th Continent: The Forbidden Sanctuary Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="6006ab1f-937c-49c8-9805-67d12c8bc070" id="205239"><div id="205239" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: The Forbidden Sanctuary Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Curse</li><li>96 New Cards</li></ul><p>The Forbidden Sanctuary is the next recommended curse from the makers of The 7th Continent. This curse takes players to a mysterious temple riddled with booby traps. Learning the secrets hidden inside can be treacherous, but it’s necessary to lift the curse. Like the other expansions listed here, The Forbidden Sanctuary is designed to fit right into the Core Box and requires the base game.</p></div><p id="the-veins-of-the-earth-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="The Veins of the Earth Expansion">The 7th Continent: The Veins of the Earth Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="af25c1a2-53b8-4a43-8249-1ece716cec6b" id="205240"><div id="205240" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: The Veins of the Earth Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $25.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Curse</li><li>149 New Cards</li><li>Barge Standee</li><li>4 Dividers</li></ul><p>The Veins of the Earth expansion gives players a look at what lurks below the continent. Underground waterways span the entire continent, which players will discover as they float along on their barge. The added layer to this mysterious land is accompanied by its own set of perils for explorers to stumble across. Initially, The Veins of the Earth was bundled with A Prison of Clouds, Forgotten Passages, and The Crystal’s Song in a collector’s expansion box available through Kickstarter. All of these, except for The Crystal’s Song, can still be purchased in the What Goes Up, Must Come Down bundle – a nod to the title of the original expansion title.</p></div><p id="a-prison-of-clouds-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="A Prison of Clouds Expansion">The 7th Continent: A Prison of Clouds Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="454603f2-2491-4269-99c0-8b2daf2dfe7a" id="205241"><div id="205241" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: A Prison of Clouds Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $25.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Curse</li><li>169 New Cards</li><li>Hot Air Baloon Standee</li><li>4 Dividers</li></ul><p>While The Veins of the Earth explored the underground passages of the continent, A Prison of Clouds has players taking to the skies in a hot air balloon. The two expansions together serve to expand the map vertically, and A Prison of Clouds even allows players to land on the continent whenever they choose and explore on foot. In fact, it’s a necessary excursion as you will certainly face strong headwinds and intense hunger along your journey that will require you to trek on foot for a bit.</p></div><p id="forgotten-passages-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Forgotten Passages Expansion">The 7th Continent: Forgotten Passages Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="a65f4dde-7f3d-49df-8f84-6dff2313cbdf" id="205242"><div id="205242" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: Forgotten Passages Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>3 New Explorers</li><li>115 New Cards</li><li>3 Character Standees</li></ul><p>While Forgotten Passages doesn’t include any new curses against which players can test their skills and luck, the expansion does include plenty of new cards and three new explorers with various abilities. Joining the cast are the skilled hunter Anjika, American aviator Amelia Earhart, and English Gentleman Phileas Fogg, along with his valet Jean Passerpartout. Not to mention, new alternate terrain cards change up the map enough to keep players on their toes.</p></div><p id="facing-the-elements-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Facing the Elements Expansion">The 7th Continent: Facing the Elements Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="33a51758-e1e8-43a7-8e36-ee6dc3e93e8f" id="205245"><div id="205245" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: Facing the Elements Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>40 New Cards</li><li>5 Cardboard Figures</li><li>5 Plastic Stands</li></ul><p>As if curses and traps weren’t enough, Facing the Elements adds various acts of nature to the world of The 7th Continent. These random events can throw a wrench in your excursion entirely, or they can perhaps aid you in your exploration. Again, there’s no new curse here, but these wild card events can help keep things interesting and add even more depth to an already content-rich game.</p></div><p id="fear-the-devourers-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Fear the Devourers Expansion">The 7th Continent: Fear the Devourers Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="d59ac834-1997-40b3-9029-e05a94dd27ad" id="205246"><div id="205246" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: Fear the Devourers Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>30 New Cards</li><li>7 Rock Worm Standees</li></ul><p>Fear the Devourers adds the fearsome Rockworm to The 7th Continent. These random exploration cards fold right into the base game and can pose quite a challenge. If not immediately dealt with, these creatures will remain a persistent threat. Players who want a bit of extra challenge added to the base game without a ton of extra rules should check out Fear the Devourers.</p></div><p id="the-flying-roots-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="The Flying Roots Expansion">The 7th Continent: The Flying Roots Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="fd1c2bf2-ba5a-4d18-8e66-849625fc1060" id="205247"><div id="205247" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: The Flying Roots Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>40 New Cards</li><li>6 Flying Roots Standees</li></ul><p>Like Fear the Devourers, The Flying Roots adds another interesting element to the base game. Unlike the Rockworms, however, it’s initially unclear what the flying roots’ intentions actually are. While these plants aren’t necessarily nefarious, their presence can serve as quite a hindrance. This new mysterious addition is perhaps a bit deeper and has more in store for players who choose to investigate them further.</p><h2>Mini-Expansions</h2></div><p id="path-of-repentance-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Path of Repentance Expansion">The 7th Continent: Path of Repentance Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="2f018944-4f91-4740-a540-3d87bdf1a905" id="205249"><div id="205249" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: Path of Repentance Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $10.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>30 New Cards</li></ul><p>Path of Repentance is a small but meaningful expansion that further deepens the thematic experience of The 7th Continent. This mini-expansion builds upon the sleep mechanic from the base game but goes the extra mile to illustrate just how mentally distraught the crew is over the looming curse. To speak too much about the Path of Repentance would spoil the experience, but just know that, especially at $10, this mini-expansion is well worth the price of admission.</p></div><p id="comfort-creatures-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Comfort Creatures Expansion">The 7th Continent: Comfort Creatures Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="7c9fcb34-e17f-4f6a-882f-a8c088f6a168" id="205250"><div id="205250" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: Comfort Creatures Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $10.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>30 New Cards</li></ul><p>Comfort Creatures inserts a bit more randomness and fun into the 7th Continent experience. This mini-expansion adds an egg that will hatch into a mysterious creature if cared for. Hatch and raise the newborn beast to potentially gain a powerful companion to aid you on your journeys across the strange land.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>The 7th Continent is an excellent cooperative board game for small groups and a great solo experience as well. The base game is required for all expansions, many of which add new curses that can either replace or supplement the base scenarios. Other expansions add new players, foes, and mechanics. The Crystal’s Song is a great purchase alongside the base game, as it helps onboard new players with its streamlined tutorial scenario.</p><p>For even more great tabletop recommendations, see our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time"><u>best board games to play right now</u></a>.

The movie follows a group of mis-fits, anthropomorphic mutants on a mission to locate the engineer of the Ark who has mysteriously gone missing. They believe he holds the key to a mystical place of salvation known as Eden. But the deeper they venture, the more they discover that things are not what they seem outside the Ark, and soon they begin to question their existence as mutants."<br>In 2020, the first sizzle reel for the film was released.

                <p>The Night Market in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> is a special festival that takes place across three days in winter. It runs from winter 15-17 on the beach, from 5 PM to 2 AM. The night market includes a few special vendors, along with some special event attractions as well. Vendors also change inventory every night, so it is worth checking in each day.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Night Market attractions</h2><p dir="ltr">The Night Market is open from 5 PM to 2 AM winter 15-17 on the beach. Unlike other festivals, most homes and stores are still open during the three-day stretch, and some of the villagers will break their schedule and go each night.</p><p dir="ltr">During the Night Market, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-desert-trader-guide/1100-6525178/" data-ref-id="1100-6525178">Desert Trader</a> will be closed in the Calico Desert and are instead at the market, giving out free coffee each night.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fishing Submarine, found on the west side of the market, can take you underwater to do some fishing for 1,000G. There are three special fish that can only be caught here: Midnight Squid, Spook Fish, and Blobfish. The animation to go underwater takes about 30 in-game minutes and the same is true to come back up, so give yourself enough time to get home.</p><p dir="ltr">The Mermaid Show can be found on the east side of the market. Entering the boat will start the show, which lasts 1 hour and 40 minutes of in-game time. After the show ends, you can stay inside the boat and discover the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-mermaid-show-secret/1100-6524848/" data-ref-id="1100-6524848">Mermaid Show secret</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The shrouded figure can be found in front of Willy's shop.

The stock stays the same every night.</p><p dir="ltr">The famous painter Lupini is at the Night Market, selling a painting for 1,200G. The painting selection rotates each night, with the offerings changing every year on a three-year cycle, for a total of nine unique paintings.</p><p dir="ltr">The Magic Shop boat has a selection of decorations, seeds, and rarecrows. This vendor has two unique items you can only get from them: the cone hat and iridium fireplace. Outside of that there is a rotating selection of seeds. The seeds cost the same as they do at Pierre's, so it can be a good opportunity to get out of season seeds.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-traveling-cart-guide/1100-6524808/" data-ref-id="1100-6524808">Traveling Cart</a> is also at the Night Market, offering a randomized selection of goods each night. The selection is fully random, just like normal. There aren't any unique items guaranteed to be there, but it is three extra opportunities for them to randomly sell an item you might be looking for.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/what-are-warbands-in-world-of-warcraft-the-war-within/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/what-to-do-before-the-war-within-pre-patch-update-in-world-of-warcraft/">pre-patch</a> for the latest WoW expansion has been released, introducing the Warbands system to the game. For those who want to get stuck into the game but aren't sure what Warbands are, this guide will explain everything you need to know about the system.</p>
<p>While this <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24061008/the-war-within-warbands-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature is specific</a> to The War Within expansion for World of Warcraft, it has been released early to let players begin gearing up and preparing for the upcoming battles on August 26.</p>
<h2>What are Warbands?</h2>
<p>Warbands allow players to have account-wide progression across the characters in the Warband. Whether your characters are Horde or Alliance, in The War Within Renown, you gather one character that will transfer to all of your characters. There will also be a Warband bank to store items between all characters.</p>
<p>The most important thing to note about Warbands is that the characters are region-locked. For example, if you play across the EU and NA, you won't be able to put characters from both regions in the Warband. You can only have EU characters in an EU Warband and vice versa. However, suppose you have characters across multiple realms. In that case, you can have them all grouped in a Warband, eliminating the need to mail items and currencies between characters, which can be incredibly time-consuming.</p>
<p>Here is all of the shared content available across your Warband characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achievements</li>
<li>Reputation</li>
<li>Transmogs</li>
<li>Currencies</li>
<li>Warbound Gear</li>
<li>Flight Paths</li>
<li>Dedicated Bank Space</li>
</ul>
<p>Warbands are one of the most valuable additions to World of Warcraft, as they allow players who use alts to progress faster through the game. For example, suppose you're running Mythic+ dungeons across multiple characters as soon as you unlock the Keystone Dungeon teleporters on one character. In that case, you'll then have access to them on your other characters.</p>
<p>The biggest pro of Warbands is that it converts character-specific WoW elements into account-wide elements so that players' achievements can be acknowledged. With the addition of the Warband-specific bank, players will gain access to five tabs with 98 inventory slots on each tab. It's important to note that if you want to utilize the bank, you must purchase the tabs for more gold per tab.</p>
<p>Warbands also introduces a new keyword for gear. This is "Warbound until Equipped," which means the gear can be transferred between characters. However, once equipped, it becomes Soulbound, and can no longer be transferred between your characters.</p>
<p>That's everything you need to know about Warbands in World of Warcraft and how you can utilize them in the upcoming expansion for WoW, The War Within.</p>

Ultimately, budget issues and Verbinski’s insistence on an R-rating led to the project falling through. With new budget issues facing the Netflix adaptation attempt, I’m sure fans are feeling a bit worried.That might not be the only issue facing Netflix’s <em>BioShock</em>, as the schedule of director Francis Lawrence may also cause issues. </p><p>While Lawrence remains attached to the project, the director has an ever-growing list of other films on his plate. As discussed by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vg247.com/francis-lawrence-begins-filming-the-long-walk-adaptation-bioshock-movie-on-hold&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vg247.com/francis-lawrence-begins-filming-the-long-walk-adaptation-bioshock-movie-on-hold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VG247</em></a></span>, Lawrence is currently shooting an adaptation of Stephen King’s <em>The Long Walk</em>, and will also helm the next <em>Hunger Games</em> prequel movie. Those are both closer on the horizon, but farther off projects like sequels to<em> I Am Legend</em> and <em>Constantine</em> could also mean <em>BioShock </em>may be in need of a new director before long. </p><p>With or without Lawrence, it seems that <em>BioShock </em>isn’t anywhere near shooting, let alone premiering in a theater near you, so fans will just have to wait and cross their fingers that even a smaller version of <em>BioShock </em>on the big screen will remain true to the game.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You have so many settings to tweak in 7 Days to Die before delving into the game for the first time. It can feel overwhelming. Here’s a complete rundown of the 7 Days to Die difficulty settings, along with which you should choose!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-7-days-to-die-difficulty-settings">What Are the 7 Days to Die Difficulty Settings?</h2>



<p>7 Days to Die launches into 1.0 with six difficulty settings, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Scavenger</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 50</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 200</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Adventurer</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 75</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 150</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Nomad</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 100</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 100</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Warrior</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 150</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 83</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Survivalist</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 200</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 66</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Insane</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 250</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 50</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Primarily, the various difficulty settings in the game alter the amount of damage you do to zombies and the amount of damage you take from zombies. You’ll absolutely notice the change in combat difficulty when increasing from Scavenger to Insane, for example.</p>



<p>Everything else about the game world remains the same, no matter the difficulty setting you choose!</p>







<h2 id="h-which-difficulty-is-right-for-you">Which Difficulty is Right For You?</h2>



<p>How much of a masochist are you? Playing on Survivalist or Insane is a sure way to wind up in a ditch somewhere before you visit the trader for the first time. But if you’re an experienced player, it might be the only challenge you eke out of the game these days.</p>



<p>For new players, I recommend playing no higher than Nomad. It’s essentially “Normal” in other games, though 7 Days to Die does recommend you play on Adventurer to start, which provides a slight buff.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6 appears to be safe from the video game strike.</p>



<p>When news broke that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game voice actors and performers</a> were going on strike on July 26, many gamers started to wonder about what it would mean for major games in development. Specifically, what would it mean for GTA 6? </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Grand Theft Auto 6 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c12j12N4yVU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1816829359878975818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ethan Gach of Kotaku</a>, not much at this moment.</p>



<p>Gach was told by a rep for the studios that GTA 6 is “exempt”  from the strike. </p>



<p>“While not struck, this game is produced by a struck company,” SAG-AFTRA says of work on GTA 6. “If you have been engaged under a daily contract for this game, you can show solidarity with your fellow union members by choosing not to sign new contracts on the game. However, you may work the game and will not be disciplined for doing so.”</p>



<p>Currently, GTA 6 is scheduled for a fall 2025 release. There had been rumors of a delay to 2026. However, at this moment, those remain just that, rumors.</p>



<hr>



<p>Do you think GTA 6 will ultimately be delayed because of the video game strike?

The creatures will begin to multiply over time, making each month a bit more exciting than the last. You'll start with just three Pikmin in January, but fast forward to June, and the entire calendar is overrun with diminutive creatures. It's a cool concept, and one that makes it more interactive than your standard wall calendar.</p><p>Along with pages for every month of 2025, you'll get a planning spread for September-December 2024 to help you roll into the new year. There's also plenty of grid space to jot down notes or appointments, as well as indicators for major holidays and for different moon phases.</p><p>If you haven't yet played Pikmin, you can pick up the remastered <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1812345747935746675%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-adorable-pikmin-calendar-is-now-up-for-preorder%2F1100-6525333%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pikmin 1 + 2</a> for Switch for $50 or <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1813071636702711255%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-adorable-pikmin-calendar-is-now-up-for-preorder%2F1100-6525333%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pikmin 4</a> (the latest entry in the series) for $60.

"A small puddle might seem like an impassable ocean to you and your Pikmin, but toss in a handful of Ice Pikmin and voila, the sea freezes up and you can cross it.

                <p>Members of the actors' union SAG-AFTRA are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">now on strike</a> over concerns about AI, but development on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is unaffected. A spokesperson for the group representing game publishers in the labor negotiations confirmed this to <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta6-voice-actor-strike-saf-aftra-1851606082?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>.</p><p>"I can confirm GTA VI is exempt," the representative said, adding that any game that was in development prior to September 2023 is exempt as well. Live-service games are unaffected by the strike situation, too, so content for games like Fortnite should continue to release normally.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">strike began today, July 26, at 12:01 AM</a>. It's the first time SAG-AFTRA video game actors have gone on strike since 2016, when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-video-game-voice-actor-strike-is-ending/1100-6453577/" data-ref-id="1100-6453577">work stoppage lasted for about one year. </a></p><p>SAG-AFTRA and game publishers like Warner Bros., Activision, Disney, and others, negotiated for about two years prior to the strike being called. The key sticking point appears to be regulation of generative AI technology.</p><p>The actors' union says protections against AI are necessary because without it, game companies could train AI to replace human talent. "We strike as a matter of last resort. We have given this process absolutely as much time as we responsibly can. We have exhausted the other possibilities, and that is why we’re doing it now," SAG-AFTRA chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez said, as reported by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sagaftra-video-game-performers-ai-strike-4f4c7d846040c24553dbc2604e5b6034" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Associated Press.</a></p><p>For its part, the video game publisher representative, Audrey Cooling, said the video game companies have offered "meaningful AI protections." Cooling added, "We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations."</p><p>SAG-AFTRA actors covered by the strike include more than 2,500 performers who do things like voiceover, motion capture, and stunts, along with singers and dancers, among other jobs.</p><p>In January, SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sag-aftra-approves-ai-voice-acting-for-video-games/1100-6520224/">signed a controversial agreement</a> with AI voice software company Replica Studios. The agreement, which essentially approved AI voice acting in video games, was criticized by voice actors, many of whom <a href="https://x.com/blumspew/status/1744854178869211228" rel="nofollow ">claimed they were never consulted</a> about the agreement.</p><p>As for GTA VI, the game is slated to release in 2025, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">pretty much every Rockstar Games title in the past 10 years has been delayed.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-yasuke-apology-sucks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this week Ubisoft, the company behind the <em>Assassin's Creed</em> series,<a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1815674592444187116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> felt the need to issue a lengthy statement</a> in response to complaints about its upcoming <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</p><p>The game, set in 16th-century Japan, has been embroiled in a number of controversies since its reveal a few months back, from<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apology-for-using-historical-re-enactment-group-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-not-enough-group-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a minor scuffle over a flag in an art book</a> to<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/assassins-creed-shadows-earns-ire-of-japanese-people-with-inaccurate-architecture-costumes-and-etiquette/#:~:text=In%20terms%20of%20Japanese%20architecture,%2C%20with%20non%2Duniform%20borders." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> some more valid concerns over the game's architecture</a> (which is normally a series strongpoint) to<a href="https://x.com/mrjeffu/status/1815993456579461156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a minor conservative party trying and very much failing to make the game a political scapegoat</a>.</p><p>Then, you know, there's a lot of people's main issue: that one of the game's two protagonists (Yasuke) is a black man,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> despite him being an <em>actual historical figure</em></a>, which instantly makes him more historically-accurate than...any other <em>Assassin's Creed</em> protagonist, ever.</p><p>Normally the guys complaining about a black man in a video game are the same ones crying foul over historical accuracy, so this is a wonderful example of just how uninterested these guys are in...actual historical accuracy,<a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-no-there-are-women-in-battlefield-v-1826275455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> as I've written about previously</a>:</p><blockquote><p>To truly present something “accurate” to the time period would probably result in a game you wouldn’t really enjoy playing. What we often see in a “historical” FPS action game is just the visual trappings. And that’s okay—it’s a mass-market action game, not a history lesson.</p><p>What angry dorks mean when they say “historical accuracy” is not a game that’s accurate to the time being presented, then, but accurate to the aspects of that time (or the popular historical re-telling of it) that are sympathetic to their current political and cultural beliefs.</p><p>It doesn’t bother them that a randomly-created soldier with no training can jump behind the controls of a complex fighter aircraft, or expertly handle a cross-section of enemy weapons. They don’t care that the streets of European cities aren’t recreated 1:1, or that uniform details aren’t strictly adhered to, or that&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>’s war is fought to time limits and kill counts.</p><p>Those things are acceptable compromises. It’s a video game, and those are video game things that the Second World War just needs to accommodate with its representation in order to work. Yet introduce something as relatively harmless (it has zero impact on gameplay!) as women or black soldiers where historically there were none, and suddenly the sky is falling.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The perfect response to dealing with shitheads like this is to simply live your life pretending they don't exist.<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-star-wars-controversy-ratings-this-is-all-terrible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Their opinions are ill-formed, bigoted and unsuitable for mainstream consumption, and so should be ignored at all costs</a>. Let them howl at the moon all they want, let their furious emails wash against the walls of your inbox, these people simply are not worth your time.</p><p>Those of us in the media learned that lesson a <em>long </em>time ago. A decade ago, in fact, when Gawker's Max Read wrote "<a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/how-we-got-rolled-by-the-dishonest-fascists-of-gamergat-1649496579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How We Got Rolled by the Dishonest Fascists of Gamergate</a>", an evergreen piece on the dangers of confusing a bunch of angry tweets with a movement of any significant size or importance. You do not, and should not, have to listen to these pricks!</p><p>Yet here we are, in 2024, and Ubisoft hasn't learned a damn thing. While the apology appears at first to be mostly addressed to the series' Japanese fans (<a href="https://x.com/JusticeKazzy_/status/1815820378482303058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most of whom, being actual fans of a series that has long played loose with history, won't care!</a>), it also touches on the matter of Yasuke's place in history, which is a <em>wild </em>thing to commit to public record.</p><p>As Trone Dowd<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-apology-yasuke-racist-trolls?s=03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> put so well on <em>Inverse</em></a>:</p><blockquote><p>...by issuing this weird, non-explanation for the very normal creative decision to tell its version of a popular historical figure’s story, Ubisoft only lent legitimacy to bad faith complaints seeped in racism. The vocal minority didn’t take issue with the many historical inaccuracies of the series past. For nearly two decades, they seemed perfectly satiated by a prompt telling them Assassin’s Creed is “inspired by historical events and characters,” not painstakingly recreating them. But these gamers launched a cultural battle once they knew they’d occasionally have to step into the shoes of a Black figure in Japan.</p><p>Ubisoft didn’t have to explain its creative decisions. It shouldn’t spoon-feed obvious answers to a delusional movement based on bigotry. But it did. And by doing so, it’s validated a straw man argument bolstered by people who have no zero interest in the quality of the game and the simpletons who’ve decided to fall for their grift. Instead of smothering it with logic and standing firmly by its artistic vision, Ubisoft has needlessly poured gasoline onto a smoldering fire. And now, the most annoying trolls on the internet will likely never shut up about it.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This fucking sucks. Ubisoft, you should know better, and for everyone creatively involved in the game who had no part in issuing this spineless statement, I'm sorry you're having to continue putting up with this.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-remasters-leaked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>remasters appear to have been leaked by merchandise spotted by eagle-eyed attendees at this year's San Diego Comic-Con.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered-branding-seen-at-sdcc.937002/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ResetEra thread created by user Mama Robotnik</a>, cards bearing the legend "<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver I &amp; II Remastered</em>" were spotted at Comic-Con. The cards also bear the logo of developer Crystal Dynamics, along with a QR code.</p>
<p>Scanning the code takes you to a page on which you can sign up for the newsletter of Dark Horse Comics, whose logo is also featured on the cards. Per a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soul-reaver-remasters-seemingly-confirmed-by-a-statue-at-comic-con/1100-6525310/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GameSpot report</a>, the cards were next to a statue depicting&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver</em>'s main characters Raziel and Kain, and Dark Horse will be handling that statue's launch in August.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-defiance-raziel.jpg?itok=RrjIgwa7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-defiance-raziel.jpg?itok=N5Yk-HNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The last proper&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain&nbsp;</em>game was 2003's&nbsp;<em>Defiance</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Per GameSpot, Dark Horse wouldn't say anything about the remasters, and the cards depicting the games' names had been taken away by the time the publication's staff arrived at the relevant booth.</p>
<p>Crystal Dynamics is one of the studios that survived the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter">great Embracer purge</a> of the last year or so, and the&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain&nbsp;</em>is still firmly under the studio's stewardship.</p>
<p>Remastered versions of&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>and its direct sequel would be a good way to test the waters for a potential new project, but honestly, I'd just be happy to see Raziel and Kain return again.</p>
<p>Who'll be handling the remaster is another matter entirely; Crystal Dynamics' logo being on the Comic-Con cards would seem to imply they'll be working on the games, but it could equally be a different studio entirely, as was the case for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered">this year's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>remasters</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-remasters-soul-reaver.jpg?itok=9dA-ocMU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-remasters-soul-reaver.jpg?itok=v03DEyLz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We've already had three remasters of beloved PlayStation-era platforming-heavy action-adventure games this year.</figcaption></figure><p>It's anyone's guess right now, but Aspyr would seem like a fairly obvious choice, although that studio's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-aspyr-response">work with the&nbsp;<em>Battlefront&nbsp;</em>remasters</a> might give Crystal Dynamics and Embracer pause for thought.</p>
<p>In any case, it looks like the revival of the&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain&nbsp;</em>franchise might be imminent after twenty years of dormancy. We don't talk about&nbsp;<em>Nosgoth</em>. Stay tuned for more!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/26/fall-in-love-with-sexy-household-objects-in-date-everything<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>In Date Everything, those looking for romance don’t need to look any further than their refrigerator, smoke alarm, or dining room table. That’s because this wacky sandbox dating sim by developer Sassy Chap is all about forming relationships with everyday household objects that, it turns out, are actually pretty hot.</p>

<p>The game bestows players with special “Dateviator” glasses that allow them to speak with objects and see them in their true, absurdly attractive forms. Dozens of objects await your affection – even elements like air and water can be courted – and branching dialogue can lead to three relationship resolutions for each character (Love, Friend, Hate). Whatever you decide will be reflected in the ever-changing 3D overworld that is your house.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dlxxzmOXRf0" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Date Everything boasts over 100 voiced characters played by performers that include Felicia Day (<em>Critical Role</em>, <em>Supernatural</em>), Johnny Yong Bosch (<em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</em>, <em>Bleach</em>), and Grey DeLisle (<em>Scooby-Doo, Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>). Given the huge amount of speaking roles, Date Everything boasts 1.2 million words and 70,000 voiced lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Date Everything looks delightfully silly, but it unfortunately doesn’t have a release window. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.</p>
