            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-psn-account-requirement-incentives<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that it's walking back the mandatory PSN requirement for certain PlayStation games on PC, and what's more, you'll get in-game incentives for those titles if you do decide to link a PlayStation account.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Sony says that beginning with the PC release of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em>&nbsp;- which is due to launch tomorrow - you'll get "more benefits to playing with an account for PlayStation Network" on PC.</p>

<p><em>Spider-Man 2</em>, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-system-requirements" rel="nofollow"><em>God of War Ragnarok</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</em>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb" rel="nofollow"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em></a>, will all be getting "in-game content unlocks" for PSN account users, and you won't be required to sign up for a PlayStation account to play them on PC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-psn-account-bonuses-sony.jpg?itok=W4HxF2Y8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-psn-account-bonuses-sony.jpg?itok=j6h2rUbk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony says some of its PC games, including&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, will reward you for signing up with a PlayStation account.</figcaption></figure><p>If you do sign in with a PSN account, you'll gain early access to the Spider-Man 2099 Black Suit and Miles' 2099 suit in&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>, and you'll get the Armor of the Black Bear set in&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>, which was previously only available in New Game Plus.</p>

<p>You'll also get extra points "to activate bonus features and unlock extras" in&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</em>, as well as a jacket for Ellie themed around Naughty Dog's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a>.</p>

<p>Finally, in&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, you'll get access to the Nora Valiant outfit. Of course, you will need to own all of these games on PC if you want these rewards; they're not forthcoming on PlayStation 5, since you need a PSN account to play on that console anyway.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-sony-pc-psn-account.jpg?itok=DK46RJ5b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-sony-pc-psn-account.jpg?itok=S0NuUAhY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want some in-game goodies for&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered&nbsp;</em>on PC? Sign up for a PSN account.</figcaption></figure><p>There is, of course, no mention of any multiplayer games losing their PSN account requirement; games like&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>will still require a PSN account for their multiplayer components.</p>

<p>Curiously, it's also worth noting that a couple of single-player Sony PC releases, like&nbsp;<em>Horizon Forbidden West&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, won't offer any goodies for signing up to a PSN account.</p>

<p>This will, however, likely set a precedent whereby single-player PlayStation games will no longer require PSN accounts to use on PC. We'll have to wait and see whether that's the case for future PC releases. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Open world spec op gun-brandisher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phantom-line">Phantom Line</a> takes place during a paranormal crisis of such intensity that the outbreak of nuclear war gets relegated to bullet point five on the latest press email. Atomic apocalypse? Ehhh. That's a roadside picnic compared to what S.T.A.L.K.S this alternately Lynchian and Tarkovskian battlefield. You'll <em>wish</em> you'd been dusted by nuclear fire when you're being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains.
</p>
<p>
If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line's headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there's now a demo available via the developer <a href="https://discord.com/invite/uHheyk2PBA">Discord</a>.

"Crashland on Jantar Island together with up to 3 of your friends (1 - 4 player co-op)," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2400840/view/534340870063784015?l=english">explains the announcement post on Steam</a>. "Plan, prepare, and adjust tactics to the open world with dynamic events. Gear up with new guns, weapon attachments, and night vision to be ready for any danger you encounter. Discover new captivating locations as you navigate towards the Black Forest Research Facility and fight the anomalies once contained there."
</p><p>
When playing the game solo, you can command other husks to serve as decoys or scouts and any other roles your supposed 'human friends' consider beneath them, or are too dense to execute correctly (that's me, hello). The NPC opposition appears split between regular soldiers, whom you're encouraged to regard as distractions, animals, whom you're encouraged to kill and eat, and invaders from other dimensions, whom you're encouraged to both slaughter and, er, become.</p>
<p>"Humanity is at war - to fight the anomalous horror, you must turn into one yourself," explains the mailout. This is done by augmenting your body with "exotic elements". Surely no downsides there. "Go die again," adds the press release, reassuringly.
</p>
<p>
Between jaunts to the battlezone, you get to hang out in a nuclear submarine, customise your artificial body, and trick out your cabin with all the phat weaponry you've acquired. Fingers crossed that it also contains a cheerful stove and a sit-down button. My husks deserve to put their feet up, now and then.</p>
<p>The basic game flow here reminds me more of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> than S.T.A.L.K.E.R., except that instead of boss lairs full of rotten hay you're diving into gobbets of spacey sci-fi horror game - in particular, I'm reminded of the backrooms of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-evil-within-2">The Evil Within 2</a>. There's no PvP element, seemingly, so you at least don't have to worry about other teams camping the exits. Anyway, you can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400840/Phantom_Line/">Steam</a>.

Not only do you need the headset (which retains its $549.99 MSRP as of writing), you’ll need a computer powerful enough to handle VR gaming. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-prepare-ps-vr2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-prepare-ps-vr2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can view the PC requirements to use the VR2 here</a></span>, but the TLDR is that <strong>you’ll need a relatively powerful graphics card that has a spare DisplayPort for you to use.</strong> That last part is perhaps most important: You need to have a monitor <em>and</em> your PSVR2 headset plugged in at the same time. The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 came out in 2019 and is listed as a minimum requirement, though Sony recommends either a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or later for “best performance.” You’ll also have to buy the correct peripherals to make it work, since the PlayStation VR2 box isn’t going to give you everything you need out of the box. </p><p>If these obstacles seem surmountable and you’re determined to see your PlayStation Headset and your PC work together in gaming harmony, here’s everything you’ll need to get it up and running.</p><figure id="" data-id="cab3988a81bd4a774d98b8b589139497" data-recommend-id="image://cab3988a81bd4a774d98b8b589139497" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1333" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A promotional image of the PlayStation VR2 PC Adapter.

Unfortunately, you still might have to spend some extra cash. <strong>The first thing you’ll need is a spare DisplayPort cable</strong> to connect your adapter to your graphics card. Yes, <strong>you <em>do </em>need to have your monitor and headset connected at the same time</strong>, so this isn’t a corner you can reasonably cut. </p><p>The second thing you might need is <strong>a supported Bluetooth dongle</strong>. We’ll get into this below, but some PSVR2 Adapter owners have reported needing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the Bluetooth dongles recommended by Sony</a></span> to get the smoothest performance possible. This will probably cost you about $20, though you can find lower prices if you shop at the right time.</p><p>Combined with the headset, this means <strong>you’ll need to spend between $60 and $90 in total to get your PlayStation VR2 headset to work on your computer</strong>. That’s much cheaper than buying a new headset just for your PC, but you’ll have to decide if that’s a price you’re willing to pay before you even drop cash on <em>Half-Life Alyx</em>.</p><h2 id="h5338"><a id="3"></a>Step 3: Set up your PlayStation VR2 Headset on your PC</h2><div><p>Once you have all the necessary components together, plug your adaptor into a power outlet and use your DisplayPort cable to plug the adaptor into your computer’s GPU (make sure you use the right slot!). Plug your headset into the adaptor, turn it on, and then open up Steam. </p></div><p>Next, find and download both <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the PlayStation VR2 app</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam VR</a></span>. Open the PlayStation VR2 App, and it’ll take you through instructions for connecting your controllers via Bluetooth. Follow the instructions, and then open the Steam VR app. If done correctly, you should see a window that looks like this when you hover your mouse over Steam VR on your taskbar.</p><figure id="" data-id="3d3807d4358e93ea3d71e9b45b9f97b6" data-recommend-id="image://3d3807d4358e93ea3d71e9b45b9f97b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="264" data-height="148" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A window for Steam VR that shows the PlayStation VR2 headset and accompanying controller icons lit up, which indicates they’re connected." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A window for Steam VR that shows the PlayStation VR2 headset and accompanying controller icons lit up, which indicates they’re connected." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d3807d4358e93ea3d71e9b45b9f97b6" data-recommend-id="image://3d3807d4358e93ea3d71e9b45b9f97b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="264" data-height="148" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A window for Steam VR that shows the PlayStation VR2 headset and accompanying controller icons lit up, which indicates they’re connected." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In my testing, it doesn’t seem like you need to launch the PlayStation VR2 app every time you want to use Steam VR after the initial setup. <strong>Make sure you turn on your headset whenever you want to use it</strong>, otherwise Steam won’t recognize either the device or the accompanying controllers.</p><h3 id="h5339"><a id=""></a>What if I can’t connect my PlayStation VR2 controllers to my PC via Bluetooth?</h3><p>Depending on your setup, you may run into a wall trying to get your VR controllers and your PC to get along. While frustrating, there are a few common culprits that lead to this issue. The first is that your motherboard in your computer may be missing a Wi-Fi antenna, which will weaken both your system’s Wi-Fi connection <em>and </em>its bandwidth for Bluetooth devices. <strong>If your PC came with an antenna that you just never screwed in, I strongly recommend setting that up</strong>. You’ll get a stronger wifi connection too!</p><p>The second common culprit is… well, computers are weird. Your controllers may not even show up in your Bluetooth menu because, I don’t know, your hardware is in a bad mood I guess? In this scenario, restart your computer and give the connection process another shot. </p><p>If your back is really against the wall and you just want to use your headset, <strong>I did find that plugging each controller directly into my computer works</strong>. This of course relies on you having two USB-A to USB-C cords hanging around, but if you own a PS5 and PSVR2 headset, you should have two to work with. I’d only label this a temporary fix, as all the wires will make any game with motion controls cumbersome at best and dangerous at worst. But for games that only require basic pointing and shooting, this setup can work.</p><p><strong>If you have any persistent connection issues, or the controllers just aren’t responsive enough, I recommend looking into </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>one of those Sony approved dongles</strong></a></span>. The adapter probably should have come with one of these to save you the headache, but them’s the breaks.</p><h2 id="h5340"><a id="4"></a>Step 4: Enjoy your VR Headset!</h2><p>It’s certainly inconvenient to have to spend extra money on accessories to get this headset to work, and the Bluetooth connection issues can become a hassle if you’re not one who likes to tinker. But after jumping through the initial hurdles, I found PlayStation VR2 works pretty well on PC. It’s relatively easy to pick up and play, and the OLED screen looks great, too. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam reviews</a></span> indicate that some folks deal with software crashing and other glitches while using it, and you should be aware that those reports exist. That said, that hasn’t been my experience so far.</p><p>Despite a good experience when it’s all up and running, I wouldn’t recommend investing in PlayStation VR2 if your primary use case is PC VR gaming. If nothing else, the PlayStation VR2’s relative scarcity means its less supported than more widely-adopted alternatives like the Meta Quest, so there’s no guarantee that future games will be made with the PlayStation headset in mind. Additionally, some of the neatest features of the headset—such as eye tracking and HDR—aren’t supported by the PC adapter. But as long as you know all that going in, the PC adapter does its job and gives you access to Steam’s robust ecosystem of VR games. Let’s just hope that Sony actually makes more of these things so you can actually purchase one!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With February fast approaching, Sony has announced the next batch of monthly titles coming to its PlayStation Plus subscription service - this time featuring heists, at least one high, and a whole lot of gobble-adjacent platforming.
</p>
<p>
Starting next Tuesday, 4th February, PlayStation Plus members across all subscription tiers - that is Essential, Extra, and Premium - gain access to the following three titles:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Payday 3 (PS5)</li>
<li>High on Life (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Pac-Man World Re-Pac (PS4, PS5)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Starting with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a>, it's the latest entry in Starbreeze Studios' co-operative heist series, which released in 2023 - and while it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-seeks-long-term-success-after-disappointing-launch">struggled to usurp its predecessor</a> in terms of popularity, it's still a decently good time. Vikki Blake called it a "furiously good fun, if criminally unadventurous" follow-up in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-review">three star review</a>, noting it unfortunately fell short of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-2">Payday 2</a> in "almost every aspect". Still, its arrival on PlayStation Plus might just help give it a boost.
</p><p>
As for High on Life, Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell <em>really</em> wasn't a fan when this comedic shooter from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/squanch-games">Squanch Games</a> - the studio founded by Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland - launched back in 2022. Edwin proclaimed it a "mediocre shooter with an unfunny attitude problem", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-review">slapping it with</a> the dreaded (and now rather antiquated) Eurogamer Avoid.
</p>
<p>
Finally, there's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pac-man-world">Pac-Man World</a> Re-Pac - a bouncy remake of Namco's 1999 3D platformer Pac-Man World. We didn't review this one when it arrived in 2022, but it currently has a Very Positive rating over on Steam, which is a promising sign.
</p>
<p>
All the above will be available to PlayStation Plus members from 4th February to 3rd March, leaving less than a week to claim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-playstation-plus-games-for-january">January's monthly games</a> - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe, and Need for Speed Hot Pursuit: Remastered.
</p>
<p>
Sony also notes PlayStation Plus' Monthly Games and Game Catalog will shift their focus toward PS5 games starting in January 2026. PS4 titles will only "occasionally" feature from early next year, it explains, "as many of our players are currently playing on PS5". It does, however, add, "We may still provide titles that can be playable on both PS4 and PS5 consoles after this date".

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/eternal-strands-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/eternal-strands-review.1095042/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/eternal-strands-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Eternal Strands begins with a calamity. In this magical world, Weavers use their command of elemental forces for the good of the people. That is, until they sealed themselves within their lands – the Enclave – and left the rest of the world to war and chaos following an event known as the Surge. The remaining Weavers, and magic in general, become about as popular as Justin Bieber at a heavy metal concert, and that’s where we meet Brynn, our hero.</p>
<p><iframe title="Eternal Strands - Launch Trailer | Yellow Brick Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h0t1dpycx-s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>She’s on the road with a Weaver band, attempting to do right by her Weaver heritage, while also looking for a place or group to call her own. Through sheer dumb luck, this group break through the Veil that surrounds the Enclave, beginning the game’s adventure as they find a settlement and begin to explore this abandoned realm.</p>


<p>It’s an evocative starting point, and is followed through with major storytelling accompanied by attractive animated cutscenes, crafting a world that you feel invested in from the off. It’s a shame then that once the opening has concluded, the narrative slows to a glacial pace, with Brynn mostly venturing into the unknown to search and collect something, before bringing it back to base.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you’ll barely notice, as Brynn’s exploration is consistently enthralling. If you’ve played any recent survival game, you’ll recognise many of the crafting and foraging mechanics that Eternal Strands uses. Your earliest encounters see you chopping down trees and bushes, gathering various resources while fighting off the low-level creatures you find dotting the landscape before returning to craft a new item or strengthen an existing one, and then heading out to do it all again.</p>


<p>Where Eternal Strands finds its own identity is in the use of the titular Strands. These Strands are fundamentally the Weavers’ &nbsp;form of magic, giving them elemental powers such as fire and ice, or telekinesis that allows you to throw enemies into crevasses or drag armour off them. There’s more than a hint of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a> about the way these powers function, and that’s an immense compliment, even if it’s not wholly reimagined.</p>
<p>New or improved Strands can be gained by taking down the giant enemies that form the other highlight of the game: combat. The different elemental powers can be used in a variety of ways, and become even more interesting when you mix them together. The Ice strand lets you freeze enemies in place, leaving enemies open to a solid thumping with one of your swords, or you could take the extra time to launch them across the map with a different Strand. Alternatively, you could set them, and the ground around them, on fire, watching their health slowly dwindle while everything burns.</p>
<p>The early moments culminate in the arrival of the first Ark, a huge robotic construct intended for building that seems set on dismantling you. Here, you’ll find a smattering of Shadow of the Colossus, and a smidgen of Dragon’s Dogma, as you’re tasked with clambering and climbing up this immense foe while attempting to stay firmly attached to them, rather than grabbed and flung away. As you climb, you can attack specific parts of the Ark, chipping away at armour, cogs and connectors, until you can hack away at the soft and squishy stuff within.</p>
<p>These types of encounters are brilliant, and up to a point, they’re replayable, so you can return to them for the materials you gain from them, letting you strengthen your loadout to deal with the next area’s stronger baddies.</p>

<p>Alongside the incredible giant beasts and memorable smaller creatures you fight, the character design of Eternal Strands is excellent, helping to bring the wonderfully presented world to life. I have to admit, I was often a bit dumbfounded by just how good the game looked, though its smaller-scale leanings become clearer when you dig into it further.</p>
<p>Little things, like the way you’ll come across houses you can’t enter, but can damage the entirety of with a swing or two of your sword, or just the way the mechanics, especially climbing, can feel a bit clunky. That said, as long as you don’t expect AAA production values, you’ll find Eternal Strands a great-looking and vibrantly imagined video game, and one which you’ll love spending time with.</p>
<p>That’s helped by the reliably excellent audio provided by Austin Wintory. His compositions heighten the medieval fantasy setting, adding drama to the action-packed showdowns, while gently easing you into the more thoughtful and melancholic moments of the game’s narrative or your character’s downtime in the central hub. There’s a quiet plaintiveness to Eternal Strands that I wasn’t expecting, with the sense of loneliness and decay accentuated by Wintory’s work.</p>

<p>Your base plays host to various crafting stations, and there’s a nice interplay between discovering new items and reforging your weapons and armour to include them. Brynn doesn’t actually level up, instead taking the Monster Hunter route of putting your progress into your equipment, and I particularly enjoyed the way that each component can alter the colour and composition of each item. There’s just about enough variety here, with new blueprints found out in each area, but I would have liked more armour and weaponry options as well as distinct visual looks to kit Brynn out in. That’s probably being a bit greedy though.</p>
<p>Eternal Strands grabs you with a force not unlike the telekinetic energy Brynn uses. You’ll find hours melt away exploring the world, while you fight against the elements and put your different powers to use in new and interesting ways. Few games achieve the same feat, and while it’s smaller in scale, it shares Breath of the Wild’s ability to wholly absorb you in its mechanics and world. At times, the solitude and disquiet may become overwhelming, and the narrative could feel grander, but this is a genuine delight, and, in many ways, an unexpected one.</p>

            <p>You'll have to bear with me for this one, because the press release we received for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-battlemarked">Demeo X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</a> contains about an 86/14 split between scrambled hypeguff and actual tangible information. In brief, it's a VR collaboration between D&amp;D traffickers Wizards Of The Coast and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo">Demeo</a> studio Resolution Games that aims to simulate a tactical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> tabletop experience without any of the boring bits, like seeing your mates' genuine reactions to things or having your frigid digitised soul warmed at the hearth of human kinship. Here is - in a sense of the word so loose I fear imminent smiting by a bellicose scribe god for typing it - a trailer:</p>

<p>It's aiming for a focus "on social strategy rather than social roleplay, encouraging group tabletalk focused on tactics and decision-making". To this end, it supports up to four player co-op cross-platform, with two story campaigns and more planning as DLC in the future.</p>
<p>Alice Bell (RPS in <a href="https://shows.acast.com/total-playtime/episodes/episode-1-everything-we-missed-since-we-got-fired">new podcast</a>) enjoyed Demeo's TTRPG hangout space when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/demeos-pc-version-is-a-cool-trpg-hangout-that-probably-wont-get-as-many-players-as-it-deserves">she played it a few years back</a> with Edders (RPS in peace also, let me know if you start a podcast), although noted it might struggle to find an audience. It does seem to have kept a humble following <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1484280/Demeo/">on Steam</a>, where it sits at a 'very positive' rating.</p><p>"BATTLEMARKED continues Hasbro’s strategy to leverage our extensive catalog of world class IP to create digital games through licensing and internal studio development," reads the presser. Last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dds-makers-are-spending-1-billion-on-their-own-video-games-promising-theyll-be-quality-and-authentic-like-baldurs-gate-3">we learned of Hasbro's wry</a> "more Baldur's Gates, more money" strategy, a scheme so devilish and brilliant that only the finest business minds in the land could have concocted it. They've invested a cool billion dollars across four studios in the hope to replicate Larian's success.</p>

<p>Sony has announced the PlayStation Plus monthly games for February 2025 will be Payday 3, High on Life, and Pac-Man World Re-Pac.</p>



<p>All <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-payday-3-high-on-life-pac-man-world-re-pac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">three of the games</a> will be available for PlayStation Plus members starting February 4.

<h2 id="h-february-2025-s-free-playstation-plus-games">February 2025’s Free PlayStation Plus Games</h2>



<p>Of the three games coming on February 4, Payday 3 is the biggest name. First released in September 2023, the latest game from Starbreeze has seen its share of ups and downs over the last year-plus. High on Life was released in December 2022 while Pac-Man World Re-Pac launched in August 2022.</p>



<p>Payday 3 will be available for PS5 while High on Life and Pac-Man World Re-Pac will be available on both PS4 and PS5.</p>



<p>Speaking of PS4, Sony <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-announces-focus-on-ps5-games-for-future-ps-plus-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that it’s shifting away</a> from adding PS4 games to the free monthly games and PlayStation Game Catalog starting in January 2026. Instead, the focus will be on PS5 titles.</p>



<p>“As we shift to PS5, PS4 games will no longer be a key benefit and will only be occasionally offered for PlayStation Plus Monthly Games and Game Catalog starting January 2026,” Sony said.</p>



<p>Until February 3, PlayStation Plus Members can still add January’s games to their library. Those games include Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered, and The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe.</p>

<p>Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4080 graphics card was faster than the RTX 3080 card it replaced. But it was also faster than the RTX 3080 Ti, 3090, and 3090 Ti. One of the good things about a new graphics card generation is that the new cards bring the last generation's inaccessibly expensive high-end performance down to cards that more people can actually afford.</p>
<p><span>That's not the case with the new $999 RTX 5080, which beats <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/nvidia-rtx-4080-super-review-all-you-need-to-know-is-that-its-cheaper-than-a-4080/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the previous-generation RTX 4080 Super</a> by a little bit and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-review-second-only-to-the-4090-for-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">older RTX 4080</a> by a slightly larger bit but doesn't come close to beating or even replicating the performance of the outgoing 4090.</span></p>
<p>Nvidia points to its new DLSS Multi-Frame Generation technology as a mitigating factor here, leaning on its AI-generated frames to close the gap that the 5080's raw rendering performance can't close on its own. And sure, it's nice that this card&nbsp;<em>can</em> do that. On paper, the 5080 is also technically a good value compared to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/review-nvidias-geforce-rtx-5090-is-the-first-gpu-that-can-beat-the-rtx-4090/">the flagship RTX 5090</a>—between 60 and 75 percent of the performance for half the price (though talking about the MSRP of any of these cards at launch is strictly theoretical, given <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-finally-admits-looming-rtx-50-series-gpu-shortage-rtx-5090-rtx-5080-stockouts-may-happen">allegedly short supply</a> and the demand from both actual buyers and scalpers looking to make a buck).</p>
<p>But the 5080 really feels a lot more like a 4080 Super Super—meaningfully better than the 4080 but still in the same general performance category. It's an upgrade, especially for anyone coming from a 30-series or older GPU, but it's a disappointing break from Nvidia's past precedent.</p>

<p>Of Nvidia's mid-generation Super refresh for the 40-series last year, the 4080 Super was already the mildest improvement over the original card, with just a few hundred extra CUDA cores and very mild clock speed increases. Its biggest and most important improvement was that it brought the old 4080's original $1,299 price tag down to a somewhat less offensive (and, again, strictly theoretical) price of $999.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The strategy with the 5080 looks pretty similar. You get a mild increase in core count (up 10.5 percent over the original 4080 and only 5 percent over the 4080 Super), plus the same 16GB of RAM on the same 256-bit memory interface. Switching from GDDR6X to GDDR7 does get you a decent bump to memory bandwidth, though, on the order of just over 30 percent compared to the 4080 and 4080 Super.</p>

      As with the 5090, the 12-pin power connector is now slightly recessed and angled so it doesn't stick out as far in your case.

<p>But all of that is incredibly mild and incremental compared to the big across-the-board jumps in core count, memory bus width, memory size, and memory bandwidth that you get when you go from the RTX 4090 to the RTX 5090. The 5080's core counts and memory bandwidth also stay well below the RTX 4090's. This has the benefit of not blowing up the 5080's power requirements—at 360 W, it's only 40 W higher than the 4080, and in our actual testing, the 5080 didn't actually consume that much more power on average—but it also means that the 4090 and 5090 continue to stand apart from the rest of the lineup, inaccessible to anyone with less than a couple thousand dollars to spend on a GPU.</p>
<p>As for the physical design of Nvidia's Founders Edition version of the 5080, it's identical to that of the 5090, just as the 4080 looked like the 4090. The 5080 does feel lighter than the 5090, which makes some sense—a card with much lower power consumption and half as many CUDA cores doesn't need the same kind of cooling apparatus. But the dimensions and connectors on both cards are exactly the same.</p>

<p>In our testing, the 5080 ran a little warmer than the 4080 did under load, but only by about 5° Celsius. The 5080 Founders Edition runs 11° or 12° cooler than the 5090 Founders Edition, so it should be a bit easier to keep your system cool with one of these installed.</p>

<h2>Testbed notes</h2>

<p>Our gaming testbed is identical to the one we used for our RTX 5090 review. Compared to reviews from 2023 and 2024, we're using a faster CPU (the Ryzen 7 9800X3D) and a beefed-up power supply. We've also added some newer games to our test suite and discarded a few that weren't challenging the cards enough.</p>
<p>As with the 5090, we focused on 4K tests for this review. The 5080 is half the price of the 5090, but you could still buy a good 1080p gaming PC or a pair of game consoles for the same money—it ought to be capable of playing modern games smoothly at high settings and resolutions. (If you are curious about 1440p performance, look at the benchmarks we've run with DLSS enabled—we run these in "Quality" mode, which at 4K means a 1440p internal resolution.)</p>
<h2>Performance and power</h2>
<p>In our 5090 review, we observed that its performance improvement over the 4090 generally scaled linearly with its CUDA core count and its power consumption—all three usually increased by between 30 and 35 percent, depending on the game.</p>


<p>The 5080 did a bit better than this, with average frame rates that were generally between 10 and 20 percent faster than the regular 4080 and between 5 and 13 percent faster than the 4080 Super. A combination of cores, marginally higher clock speeds, and memory bandwidth increases help give it a boost.</p>
<p>But especially compared to the 4080 Super, these numbers look less like a generational performance increase and more like what you could get out of a 4080 Super with a particularly good overclock. We point this out not because people are upgrading their GPUs every generation but because people with an older 30-series, 20-series, or even 10-series GPU who have been waiting to upgrade won't really be rewarded for waiting for this generation.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          


<p>DLSS Multi-Frame Generation is meant to bolster the card's performance numbers, and as with the 5090, they do look impressive on paper. As we covered in that review, Multi-Frame Generation (MFG) is exclusive to the 50-series, and it's an amped-up version of the Frame Generation technology that was introduced in the 40 series. Both versions take two rendered frames and use AI to interpolate extra frames in between, sort of like a supercharged version of TV motion smoothing. The 40-series cards can generate one frame this way; the 50-series cards can generate up to three.</p>

      Multi-frame generation looks great on paper, but it's misleading to compare MFG frame rates to natively rendered frame rates.

      </figure>

<p>Hardware Unboxed on YouTube has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_fGlVqKs1k">a good in-depth look at MFG and its trade-offs</a>, which are mostly the same as the trade-offs with regular FG. It's useful when your rendered frame rate is already fairly high, giving the algorithm plenty of data to use when generating frames and making individual errors or artifacts harder for your eyes to spot. But it's not a cure-all for low frame rates. It can also increase latency because user input is only being polled at your actual rendered frame rate, and running the Frame Generation algorithm actually reduces that frame rate by a bit.</p>
<p>The RTX 5080 is fast enough that it can hit the frame rates needed to make MFG look good, but it will still be game-dependent and scene-dependent. It's a good way to augment rendering performance, but contrary to Nvidia's messaging, it's still not a substitute for better rendering performance.</p>
<h2>Technically an upgrade</h2>

      The RTX 5080 isn't bad; it just doesn't move things forward a whole lot.

<p>This is not really the generational leap that GPU buyers were probably hoping for from an RTX 5080. It is the third-fastest GPU on the market, but it's far short of the 4090, and it performs more like a second refresh of 2022's RTX 4080.</p>

          
                  </div>

        <div>
          
          
<p>The worst thing about the 5080 is that it suggests that <em>every</em> 50-series GPU other than the 5090 will be a very mild upgrade over its 40-series counterpart, with Nvidia leaning heavily on Multi-Frame Generation for the typical generational performance improvements. That will trickle down to cards like the 5070 and 5060 series, the kinds of cards that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most people actually buy and use</a>.</p>
<p>Multi-Frame Generation <em>can</em> put up big frame rate numbers, but as with the old Frame Generation, you want a good base frame rate for the best results; improvements to traditional rendering performance still matter. This is OK for the 5080, which is still fast enough to deliver high base frame rates, especially with an assist from DLSS upscaling. But we'd expect this to be a bigger problem for the RTX 5070, which is the only card announced so far to come with <em>fewer</em> CUDA cores than its Super predecessor.</p>
<p>The main takeaway is that the 5080 isn't the kind of generational upgrade that Nvidia has usually delivered up until now, where a new GPU could match or beat the rendering performance of previous-generation cards at higher performance tiers. The days when the GTX 1060 could beat the GTX 980? Long gone. Even in the 40-series, the RTX 4070 could usually match or beat the RTX 3080; that kind of jump looks extremely unlikely this time around.</p>
<p>The best argument for grabbing a 5080 right now, if you can find one at $999 in the first place, is that the only cards that come close to its performance are either way more expensive than they're supposed to be (the 4080 Super) or not cheap enough to justify the Nvidia-specific features you give up (AMD's Radeon 7900 XTX).</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Good frame rates at 4K resolutions</li>
<li>Redesigned Founders Edition will be an easier fit for many PC cases</li>
<li>Power consumption only mildly increased over last generation</li>
<li>Still the third-fastest GPU you can buy</li>
<li>A relatively decent value at $999—if you can find it for $999</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Trying to find one at $999</li>
<li>Barely an upgrade over the RTX 4080 Super</li>
<li>Multi-frame generation is interesting but not a cure-all for low frame rates</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>The rest of the 50-series GPUs don't look like very promising upgrades, especially the RTX 5070</li>
</ul>

                <p>PlayStation has revealed this month's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. All PS Plus members will be able to claim a trio of freebies starting February 4--<strong>Payday 3</strong>, <strong>High on Life</strong>, and <strong>Pac-Man World: Re-Pac</strong>. If you haven't claimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-january-2025/1100-6528590/" data-ref-id="1100-6528590">January's PlayStation Plus free games yet</a>, make sure to do so before next Tuesday.</p><p>Sony also mentioned that it will focus more on offering PS5 titles through the monthly games and Game Catalog benefit starting January 2026. While PS4 owners may still receive free games as part of the subscription,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-moving-away-from-monthly-ps4-games/1100-6529101/" data-ref-id="1100-6529101"> Sony says these will only be occasionally handed out from next year</a>.</p><h2>Payday 3</h2><p>It hasn't exactly been smooth sailing for Payday 3, which was supposed to kick off the next era of the popular bank-heist-simulator series. While the core game isn't bad, numerous server issues and low player numbers made for a rough launch, but developer Starbreeze hasn't thrown in the towel on Payday 3. yet. As part of an effort titled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-will-add-solo-mode-and-lots-more-in-a-series-of-patches/1100-6521545/" data-ref-id="1100-6521545">Operation Medic Bag</a>, Starbreeze has been steadily improving on the game with several patches and an offline mode.</p><h2>High on Life</h2><p>If you're a fan of Rick and Morty, then High on Life will appeal to you as it shares much of the same oddball humor as the hit animated series. A first-person shooter that features <em>very</em> talkative guns and an alien space cartel who get "high" on humans, the game was made by Squanch Games, a studio founded by Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland and Tanya Watson. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/justin-roiland-resigns-from-squanch-games-amid-domestic-violence-allegations/1100-6510838/" data-ref-id="1100-6510838">Roiland resigned from the company in 2023</a>, following a series of controversies.</p><h2>Pac-Man World: Re-Pac</h2><p>A remake of the original Pac-Man World platformer, Pac-Man World: Re-Pac is a charming game featuring the Bandai Namco icon. Its gameplay was overhauled and its graphics were updated for this 2022 release, which saw Pac-Man embark on a quest to save his friends and family from the ghosts who had kidnapped them.</p><h2>PlayStation Plus Free Games for February 2025</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4435512-ps-plus-feb-2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435512" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4435512-ps-plus-feb-2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435512"></a><figcaption>PS Plus February 2025 free games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4435512-ps-plus-feb-2025.jpg"></figure><p><em>Available February 4 until March 3.</em></p><ul><li>Payday 3</li><li>High on Life</li><li>Pac-Man World: Re-Pac</li></ul>

                <p>Sony has announced a key change for the future of PlayStation Plus. Sony will shift away from offering PS4 games as it looks to focus on PS5 games instead. Sony said it's making this change as part of the evolution of PS Plus overall. This isn't starting soon, though, and will begin in January 2026.</p><p>"As we shift to PS5, PS4 games will no longer be a key benefit and will only be occasionally offered for PlayStation Plus Monthly Games and Game Catalog starting January 2026. We may still provide titles that can be playable on both PS4 and PS5 consoles after this date," Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-payday-3-high-on-life-pac-man-world-re-pac/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>PS4 games that players have already redeemed from PS Plus are not affected, provided players stay subscribed to PlayStation Plus. "For Game Catalog, PS4 games will still be available to play until it leaves the catalog as part of our monthly refresh," Sony said.</p><p>Sony went on to say it plans to "continue to evolve" PS Plus and will "optimize the benefits you receive" over time. "As we shift our focus to PS5, we look forward to adding new PS5 titles monthly for you to enjoy," Sony said.</p><p>Sony made this announcement as part of a wider reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-february-2025/1100-6529091/" data-ref-id="1100-6529091">the February batch of free games for PS Plus subscribers</a>.

                <p>We've all participated in some form of online trash talk at some point in our lives. UFC fighter Brian Ortega, whose professional record is currently 16-4, was on the receiving end of some serious berating during a Fortnite game and decided to do something about it.</p><p>Ortega posted a video on his social media where he had a light-hearted confrontation with a young fan named Emi. Ortega flew from Los Angeles to North Carolina to exact his revenge in a way that might have Emi thinking differently about who he talks trash to online, as the former champion planted him in a rear naked choke and put him to sleep momentarily.</p><p>"A lot of people ask me, 'Hey, play with me on Fortnite!' Cool, cool. Only problem is, you guys be talking mad you-know-what," Ortega said. "So I had a homie, an online homie, start talking mad smack. The real reason why I flew to North Carolina is because he was talking shit, we made a bet. I said, 'Bro, I’ll fly over there and choke you out.' Here he is. I showed up."</p><p>The camera panned to Emi sitting down. Ortez continued by asking Emi "You going to go to sleep?"</p><p>Emi responded with "yes" while lightly laughing.</p><p>Ortega then applied a fully locked-in rear-naked choke to the fan and squeezed until he passed out. After a few seconds, the young man then woke up and flashed a peace sign to ensure Ortega's audience he was all right in the end.</p><p>"Shit, man! I took a nap! That felt weird," Emi added. "That shit was kinda fun!"</p><p>"When talking crap on Fortnite turns into a real-life lesson," Ortega wrote in the post. "For all my gamers out there, remember you never know who you might be playing with--respect to Emi for taking it like a man. No one was harmed in the making of this video. Professionals only."</p><p><em>Image source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IVFp2l2jl8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UFC</a></em></p>

            <p>
A new update to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has added the ability for players to trade cards, but the mechanics of the system have come under intense criticism from fans. 
</p>
<p>
Trading require players use up valuable resources and adhere to a lengthy list of restrictions in order to acquire cards they don't already have. 
</p>
<p>
"Let's face it, the game does NOT want you to trade cards," is the title of one <a href="https://i.redd.it/n6122su3iufe1.jpeg">thread</a> on the Pokémon TCG Pocket reddit, which is awash with complaints, memes and outright disbelief at how trading has been implemented.
</p>
<p>
In general, trading is limited to players on your friends list, and only one trade can be conducted at a time. Currently, only cards of One, Two, Three or Four Diamond rarity can be offered for trade, alongside One Star rarity. (To be clear: you cannot trade Two or Three Star or One Crown rarity.)
</p><p>
Beyond that, trading is subject to further rules. Firstly, you can only trade cards of the same rarity - meaning a trade for a One Diamond rarity card will mean you have to offer up another One Diamond rarity card in return, limiting the selection of cards that can be offered for trade with each other.
</p>
<p>
Next, you will need to use Trade Stamina, which recharges over time or change be boosted using Trade Hourglasses. In addition to this, if you trade cards of a Three Diamond rarity or higher you'll also need to expend Trade Tokens, another consumable that can be earned in-game. Three Diamond rarity cards require 120 Tokens, One Star cards require 400 Tokens, while Four Diamond cards require 500 Trade Tokens.
</p>
<p>
Want some more rules? Go on, then. Cards with a Flair can only be exchanged for cards with a Flair. And you can only currently trade cards from the game's Genetic Apex and Mythical Island booster packs. Promo cards cannot be traded.
</p>
<p>
Trade Tokens can be acquired by junking other cards, but fans have complained at the amount of cards required in order to gather enough Tokens. For example, you will receive 100 Trade Tokens for junking a One Star card, but it will cost 400 Trade Tokens in total to trade for another One Star card.
</p>
<p>
"It's simple - the game doesn't want anyone trading cards," wrote on fan. "It's rubbish."
</p>
<p>"If (and that's a big if) they hand it out like flair dust it'll get easier," wrote another in a different reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1iciykf/trades_are_very_expensive/">thread</a>. "But right now, it's insanely expensive to trade, and I highly doubt they make trade tokens as easy to accumulate."</p><p>"This trading update is an insult," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ick9qr/as_a_whale_this_game_isnt_getting_another_dime/">wrote</a> a player who described themselves as a whale - a heavy spender on the game  - that was never the target audience for trading as they had bought so many packs already. "This just feels awful for everyone else," the continued. 
</p>
<p>"It simply doesn't work. It fits such a narrow scenario of someone who is missing card X but happens to have a bunch of dupes to burn. So insanely narrow. It's just frustrating. The greed is just so excessive I can't be inclined to spend another $.
</p>
<p>"They should probably remove 'Trading Card Game' from the title screen. It's just insulting to look at."</p>
<p>If you're trying to navigate the new update, Eurogamer can help out with a guide to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-how-to-trade-cards">Pokémon TCG Pocket trading and how to trade cards</a>, as well as a deeper dive into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Pok%C3%A9mon%20TCG%20Pocket%20Trade%20Tokens%20and%20how%20to%20get%20Trade%20Tokens">Pokémon TCG Pocket Trade Tokens and how to get them</a>.</p><p>Why is the trading system so prohibitive? It's likely that any mechanic that could stop players buying packs will have to be balanced by high costs to ensure the game continues to make money. Will the system get changed? While the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-reportedly-surpassed-200m-in-first-month">continues to rake in cash</a>, it seems unlikely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nic says that RPG remake sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> is "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">uneven, unfocused, and unmissable</a>". You also can’t miss its regular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-pc-performance-best-settings">performance hiccups</a>, which most often manifest as little but frequent stutters that occur as you’re moseying around its poorly planet. </p>
<p>Or can you? News comes via Nic himself that modder FrancisLouis, whose previous works include performance-enhancing rejigs of various games (and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthill2/mods/151">one</a> that turns the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>’s pipe weapon into a rigid, A-posing wife), has produced <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/1">Fantasy Optimizer</a>: an overhaul of how FF7 Rebirth handles shaders and streamed visuals. Both Nic and myself have tried it out on our respective rigs, and it works! Mostly.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In my case I still get the occasional hitch when traversing new areas, but otherwise, it does run noticeably smoother. Especially during the fighty bits, which pre-mod could suffer from microstutter every time I pulled out my fancier moves. Nic sounds like he’s had even more luck, with less visible object pop-in on top of the smoothness enhancements. </p>
<p>The NexusMods description does, to be fair, warn that Fantasy Optimizer can work better on some PCs than others. To quote: "While these changes are designed to improve performance for most players, results can vary depending on your system’s hardware, software setup, and specific in-game situations.</p>
<p>"Some players may see noticeable improvements, while others might not experience significant changes."</p>
<p>Still, it’s worth giving it a go if you’re getting a bit bored of all those minipauses. Installation is easy too: first, head to <strong>Program Files (x86) &gt; Steam &gt; steamapps &gt; common &gt; Final Fantasy VII Rebirth &gt; End &gt; Content &gt; Paks</strong>, then create a new folder named “~mods” (without the quote marks). Then download the mod pak from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/1?tab=files">NexusMods</a> (I recommend Version 2), extract it from the download folder, and paste it into that ~mods folder.</p>

<p>Mere days ago, FF7 Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-thinks-mods-breathe-life-into-the-pc-market-following-previous-request-to-please-not-give-cait-sith-a-dump-truck-ass">was bigging up</a> the game-sustaining power of a free and open modding ecosystem, while politely asking modders to refrain from giving - and these are Nic's words, not mine - Cait Sith a dump truck ass. "Mods have played a significant role in the rise of the PC market", he says. "Look at series like Fallout or The Elder Scrolls – even years after release, new mods breathe life into these games, making players want to come back to them."</p><p>Hamaguchi added that "Volunteer communities often move faster than the companies that produced the source material", while - in my mind - slowly turning his head to look at FrancisLouis, who was replacing the Buster Sword with Aerith's character model in the next building over, before giving an almost imperceptibly small yet immediately understood nod of approval.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PlayStation wants you to have a PlayStation Network (PSN) Account when you play their games on PC. And it’s willing to give players freebies for doing just that.</p>



<p>In a post on the PlayStation Blog, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/">the company announced</a> a number of new incentives for players on PC who also have a PSN account. Games like Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, God of War Ragnarök, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered will be given in-game content if they create and link their account.</p>



<p>“An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC,” PlayStation said. “Players who still opt to sign into a PlayStation Network account will also enjoy added benefits like trophies and friend management.”</p>



<p>When you login to your PSN account, you will get the following depending on the game:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2:</strong> Early unlock suits: the Spider-Man 2099 Black Suit and the Miles Morales 2099 Suit</li>



<li><strong>God of War Ragnarök:</strong> Gain access to the Armor of the Black Bear set for Kratos at the first Lost Items chest in the Realm Between Realms (previously only accessible in a New Game+ run) and a resource bundle (500 Hacksilver&nbsp;and 250 XP)&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></li>



<li><strong>The Last of Us Part II Remastered:</strong> +50 points to activate bonus features and unlock extras and Jordan’s Jacket from Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet as a skin for Ellie&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered:</strong> Gain access to Nora Valiant outfit</li>
</ul>



<p>Sony added that more games from PlayStation Studios will get benefits in the future.</p>

                <p>When it comes to court battles, very few individuals would want to be on the opposite side of Nintendo. The video game company famously defeated Universal Pictures in a Donkey Kong-related case four decades ago, and it's rarely lost a high-profile case. But now, there's at least one man who can claim a legal victory over Nintendo: Don Mario. Well, sort of.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-loses-trademark-fight-against-super-mario-supermarket" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Don Mario is the owner of Super Mario, a local supermarket in San Ramón, Costa Rica. Nintendo seemingly left the Super Mario shop alone for years, and only opposed the store's name when Don Mario had to renew the trademark with Costa Rica's trademark authority, the National Register. Apparently, one of the reasons why Don Mario--and his son, Charlito--emerged victorious is that supermarkets are among the few Super Mario trademarks that Nintendo never bothered to register.</p><p>"Thank you enormously to my legal advisor and accountant José Edgardo Jimenez Blanco who took care of the registration and the subsequent fight for the right to a trademark," wrote Charlito Mario on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/supermariosr/posts/pfbid0oDC4Z9GKPdLtrDiGmG3tXRNW6qTZXgGwn7T93WPmHPWm8m2Q6jDhxmNpPaV63zUXl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>. "For a moment, we thought about throwing in the towel. How were we going to win the [fight against] such a commercial monster? ... Well... Edgardo and I stood firm and a few days ago we received the good news. Super Mario is here to stay."</p><p>As for Nintendo, the famously litigious company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-had-to-play-detective-to-find-an-alleged-switch-pirate/1100-6527794/" data-ref-id="1100-6527794">went after an alleged Switch pirate in court</a>, and reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reportedly-sent-lawyers-to-genki-about-switch-2-mockup-at-ces/1100-6528776/" data-ref-id="1100-6528776">sent lawyers to visit Genki</a> after it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">showed off a Switch 2 mockup</a> during CES. Nintendo's patent attorney Koji Nishiura also recently explained <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-lawyer-explains-why-the-company-believes-some-emulators-are-illegal/1100-6528831/" data-ref-id="1100-6528831">why the company believes some emulators are illegal</a>.</p>

<p>Explaining what happened in the first place, Microsoft said it announced the DLC too early, "before it had been built." Looking back on this, the team said, "We now feel that announcement was premature."</p><p>"We know that this is a huge disappointment, and many of you were excited for more content. We were able to put out a patch for the game towards the end of last year but understand that it was not the size and scope you were hoping for," the developer said.</p><p>The Age of Empires development team went on to say that, although the promised DLC is not coming, the studio will keep the game's servers online and provide customer support services. The team also pointed fans to the official <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/?q=&amp;game=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Age of Empires 3 mods</a> page to find something new to play.</p><p>The canceled DLC was originally expected to launch in 2024, but was delayed indefinitely prior to its cancellation. Details about what the content would be were never disclosed.</p><p>The last expansion for Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition was 2022's Knights of the Mediterranean. Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition is not the newest edition of the game, as Microsoft released Age of Empires IV in 2021 and Age of Mythology: Retold in 2024.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 is looking more and more like a massive upgrade over the previous versions of the upscaler, as its Performance preset can deliver better image quality and detail than DLSS 3.8's Quality preset.</p>
<p>A new comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> puts Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, STALKER 2, God of War Ragnarok, and Horizon Forbidden West running at 1440p resolution with NVIDIA DLSS 4 at the Performance preset side by side running with NVIDIA DLSS 3.8 at the Quality preset, highlighting how the new version of the upscaler delivers impressive image quality and detail despite upscaling from a lower base resolution. In some cases, the results are truly remarkable, such as in God of War Ragnarok at the 7:10 mark, where the finer details on the Draupnir Spear look quite sharp, compared to DLSS 3.8 at the Quality preset.</p>
<p><iframe title="DLSS 4 Performance Mode vs DLSS 3.8 Quality - DLSS 4 Performance is Better than Quality? | RTX 4070" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XGX0LMBroi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Super Resolution is capable of delivering much better image quality than previous versions of the upscaler thanks to the new Transformer model, which will be supported by every NVIDIA RTX GPU. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/">Multi Frame Generation</a>, on the other hand, will only be supported by RTX 50 series card, promising to boost performance considerably even in demanding scenarios, as seen earlier this month in Cyberpunk 2077, which can run at above <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/">120 FPS on an RTX 5080 at 4K resolution with path tracing</a> using the soon-to-be-launched new Frame Generation tech.</p>
<p>More information on NVIDIA DLSS 4 can be found on NVIDIA's <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-snap-developer-to-self-publish-mostly-following-unplanned-outage.1094931/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-snap-self-published-skystone<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>developer Second Dinner has announced that it will move "almost all" publishing responsibilities for the game in-house, with support from an external publisher.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1884400415925817429" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Second Dinner says that in order to ensure there's no repeat of the unplanned outage that saw the game go down for several hours earlier this month, "almost all operational and publishing responsibilities" will now be handled by Second Dinner itself.</p>

<p>The studio won't be going it alone, though; it'll be receiving support from US-based publisher <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/skystone" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Skystone Games</a>, whose name you might recognize from indie titles like&nbsp;<em>It Lurks Below</em>,&nbsp;<em>Spacelines from the Far Out</em>, and <i>Tyrant's Realm</i>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-snap-publisher-in-house-gameplay.jpg?itok=FeA5oA7e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-snap-publisher-in-house-gameplay.jpg?itok=wwPh_W5F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>will now be self-published...sort of.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-snap-back-online-dev-says-new-publisher" rel="nofollow">went offline earlier this month</a> when it was caught in the crossfire of an impending TikTok ban (which later turned out to be temporary after President Trump issued a 90-day reprieve for the app).</p>

<p>Following that outage, which Second Dinner called "a surprise", the developer vowed to find a new publisher for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>"in order to make sure this never happens again".</p>

<p>There's seemingly no animosity between Second Dinner and current publisher Nuverse, either. The developer says the transition is happening "with the help of" Nuverse, and that the switch is "a full-team effort between Second Dinner, Nuverse, Skystone, and Marvel".</p>

<p>It's unclear what the new publishing arrangement will mean for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>itself, but for now, it's likely going to be business as usual; the game is available once again via mobile storefronts, and its servers are back online as well.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap</em>, it's a card battler in which you collect and battle cards themed around Marvel superheroes.</p>

<p>The game is available to play right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997040/MARVEL_SNAP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nvsgames.snap" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/marvel-snap/id1592081003" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>.
