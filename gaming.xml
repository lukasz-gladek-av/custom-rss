			<p>Arc System Works was one of the studios we predicted would appear <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">at the State of Play Japan</a>, specifically with a release date for Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. Well, we were right that we'd get to see Arc System Works and with more Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, but we did not get a release date revealed, and are still saddled with an expected release window of '2026.' That said, there is a new closed beta lined up before the end of the year.</p>



<p>Arc System Works also showed off more gameplay for Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, and two of the game's developers also made an appearance during the live stream to talk more about the game, and how the studio wanted to blend Japanese art styles with the style of the comic books.</p>



<p>The new closed beta will run from December 5-7, and adds Spider-Man and Ghost Rider to the roster of playable characters to try out in the beta. It'll also include two new stages, and a bevy of fixes and tweaks based on feedback from the game's first closed beta earlier this year.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you registered for the first closed beta and participated, then you'll be automatically registered for this one. If you registered for the first one and didn't participate, then you should keep an eye on your email inbox for an invitation. If you didn't register for the first closed beta but want to try your luck this time, then <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls/#closed-beta/">you can register at this link</a>.</p>



<p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls is due to launch on PC and PS5 sometime in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pixel-9-now-priced-like-budget-android-phones-amazon-strikes-hard-at-google-2000643048</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Google's Pixel 9 brings flagship AI, exceptional camera tech and all-day power - at a record low price.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Amazon just delivered a serious blow to Google by chopping <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5365/">the Pixel 9 128GB down to an all-time low of $544 on its own platform</a>. This unlocked smartphone is normally $799, but you <strong>can currently get it for 32% off</strong> which places Google’s flagship in the same price bracket as mid-tier Android devices. The irony isn’t lost here: Amazon is making Google’s premium phone more affordable than Google ever has.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5365/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Google’s Flagship Gets the Budget Phone Treatment</h2>
<p>The Pixel 9 is equipped with a <strong>large 6.3-inch Actua display</strong> for sharp visuals-be it when scrolling through social media or watching videos on a commute. This screen size comes as a sweet spot: big enough for comfortable viewing and compact enough to be managed by one hand when you juggle coffee and groceries. Display technology ensures colors pop without the oversaturated look that some phones push just a bit too hard and gives you an accurate representation whether editing photos or simply browsing.</p>
<p>Under the hood, you get 128GB of storage (which works out to about 30,000 photos) or several dozen apps, before you have to start thinking about cloud backup. In many ways, the<strong> 24-hour battery life</strong> lets you leave your charger at home without anxiety for a full workday and into an evening out. Google achieved this by combining power management on its processors with display optimization that adapts to whatever you’re doing, whether that’s reading email or streaming content.</p>



<p>Where the <strong>Pixel 9 really earns its keep is in the camera system</strong>: The heavy lifting is done through Google’s computational photography which means the phone is processing multiple exposures in milliseconds to create shots that look professionally edited straight out of the camera app. Night photography becomes actually useable rather than a grainy mess, thanks to algorithms that brighten shadows while keeping highlights in check.</p>
<p><strong>Integration with Gemini</strong> places Google’s AI assistant right into the core of your workflow: You can ask it to summarize long email threads, draft responses with a specific tone, or pull information from your photos and documents without having to jump between apps. This is not just a repackaged voice assistant; it understands context from your screen and can help with tasks like planning trips by scanning flight confirmations and suggesting activities based on your destination.</p>



<p>What’s great is that <strong>unlocked means you are not tied to any carrier’s payment plan</strong> or restrictions. You can switch providers without dealing with unlock requests or compatibility issues, and international travel is easier, as you can just pop in a local SIM card. This flexibility alone can save you hundreds over a two-year period compared to locked alternatives that charge premium rates for roaming.</p>
<p>Right now, you’re paying just $565 for flagship specs and Google’s best camera tech; that’s less than what many mid-range phones sell for.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Everything We Saw At PlayStation’s Japan-Centric State Of Play]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-japan-marvel-dragon-quest-2000643049</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-we-saw-at-playstation%E2%80%99s-japan-centric-state-of-play.1350547/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, Sony held a State of Play showcase to talk about upcoming PlayStation 5 games, but this one was a little different. This one was specifically focused on Japan-developed games, as well as projects from other Asian studios. The State of Play Japan showcase was hosted by <em>Ys&nbsp;</em>actor Yuki Kaji, and was only streamed in Japanese, even in other territories. It did have English subtitles, though, so if you want to watch the 40-minute presentation, you can do so below. If you just want the highlights, though, we’ve got you covered.</p>

  <h2><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagining</em></h2>  <p>Kicking off the show was&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest VII Remastered</em>. I don’t know why I was surprised that the trailer was in English. I guess I just assumed the “Japanese audio with English subtitles” extended to the trailers as well. But anyway, we saw a pretty story-heavy trailer of this from-the-ground-up reimagining of <em>Dragon Quest VII</em>. The game is coming out on February 5.</p>

 <h2><em>inKONBINI: One Store, Many Stories</em></h2>  <p>Next up is a management sim&nbsp;called&nbsp;<em>inKONBINI: One Store, Many Stories</em>, in which the player runs a corner store. You’ll manage your merchandise, chat with customers, and collect stuff from the vending machines in April 2026.</p>

 <h2><em>Coffee Talk Tokyo</em></h2> <p>The next entry in the coffee shop social simulator series&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk&nbsp;</em>is&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk Tokyo</em>, which is exactly what it sounds like. You’ll make coffee for patrons in a cyberpunk Tokyo on March 5.</p> <h2><em>BrokenLore</em></h2>  <p>Two new games in the&nbsp;<em>BrokenLore </em>horror series are coming. The first is <em>Unfollow</em>, which is all about the dark side of social media. It’s coming on January 16. The next entry will be called <em>BrokenLore: Ascend</em>, and will have a focus on vertical climbing movement. It will launch next summer.</p>

  <h2><em>Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly</em></h2>  <p>Sony decided to get a bunch of spooky stuff out of the way at once, as next up is a remake of <em>Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly </em>helmed by <em>Dead or Alive </em>and <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>developer Team Ninja.&nbsp;Yeah, that shit looks as creepy as it did on the PS2. The remake will launch on March 12.</p>

 <h2><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em></h2>  <p>Koei Tecmo also showed off a new DLC for&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>called <em>Visions of Four Heroes</em>. It launches on January 22.</p> <h2><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></h2>  <p>Oh hey, at least one of the teams under PlayStation Studios is here for the show. Polyphony Digital showed up with the <em>Gran Turismo 7 Power Pack</em>, which will add new racing modes to the game later this year.</p>

 <h2>Rapid-fire announcements</h2>  <p>Next up we saw a few smaller games like <em>MotionRec</em>, a sci-fi puzzle platformer,&nbsp;<em>Wandering Sword</em>, an HD-2D RPG set in ancient China, the PS4 and PS5 release of <em>No Sleep For Kadame Date –&nbsp;AI The Somnium Files</em>, and <em>Tokyo Xtreme Racer.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <h2>Bandai Namco’s DLC minute</h2>  <p>Bandai Namco had a few DLCs to announce for some of its games. First up was&nbsp;<em>Once Upon a Katamari</em>, which is getting two DLC packs with new levels, cosmetics, and music. <em>Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac&nbsp;</em>is getting&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>levels, which are available today.&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>‘s first DLC includes a new story chapter that adds five new Digimon to the roster, and is coming this winter. <em>Super Robot Wars Y</em> is getting its first collab DLC, which adds characters from&nbsp;<em>Kamen Rider</em>.</p> <h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></h2> <p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is also getting some DLC. The Free Title Update 4 will launch on December 16, and adds more monsters to hunt and additions to the RPG’s endgame.</p> <h2><em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em></h2> <p>Because the crossover slop never ends,&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds&nbsp;</em>is getting more crossover characters as DLC from&nbsp;<em>Nights</em> and <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>. It’ll also get Tangle and Whisper, some lesser-known <em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>characters. Oh yeah, and the Spongebob pack is coming on November 19. Blah.</p>

 <h2><em>Never Grave: The Witch and the Curse</em></h2>  <p>Next up is&nbsp;<em>Never Grave: The Witch and the Curse</em>, an action platformer that looks like the kind of thing you’d play if&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>just wasn’t enough torment for you. The game will launch on March 5.</p> <h2><em>Blazblue: Entropy Effect X</em></h2>  <p>I see Arc System Works’ logo and I perk up. The studio is making a new entry in the <em>Blazblue: Entropy Effect </em>subseries with <em>Entropy Effect X</em>. The action platformer has the team’s incredible visual flare and looks super challenging. It will launch on February 12.</p>

 <h2>More rapid fire game updates</h2>  <p>Nextt we got another series of bite-sized looks at some smaller games. First up is twin-stick shooter/platformer <em>Damon and Baby</em>, followed by a new Prinny-infested action RPG from the <em>Disgaea </em>team called <em>Kyouran Makaism</em>.&nbsp;<em>Fate Trigger</em>, a fast-paced hero shooter featuring ten distinct playable characters, wrapped up the segment.</p> <h2><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em></h2>  <p>Damn. The host mentioned a beloved Square Enix series and my&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>copium started up. But no, instead we got a new look at <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em>. It sure looks like one of those! Square Enix has released a demo that will allow you to carry over your saved data to the main game when it launches on December 4.</p> <h2><em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em></h2>  <p>Now that’s the Arc System Works game I wanted to see. The studio’s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Marvel&nbsp;</em>game is putting an anime fighter spin on the comic book icons.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls&nbsp;</em>is getting a new beta test that will include new stages and add Spider-Man and Ghost Rider as playable characters. The test will take place from December 5 to 7.</p>

 <h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2>  <p>Bandai Namco wasn’t done with DLC, actually.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>got its own special little segment for its&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows&nbsp;</em>expansion. If you and your friends are ready to head back into The Lands Between, you can do so December 4.</p> <p>Oh, that was the end? Alrighty then. RIP to the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>fans who were holding their breath. We’ll do this whole song and dance again at The Game Awards.</p>

The first ran from September 5 to 7, and featured online play, limited offline functionality, and six playable fighters. This new closed beta, which runs from December 5 to 7, adds Spider-Man and Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes) into the mix as playable characters and adds various other features to give players a better chance to test out the upcoming fighter.</p><p>This second closed beta adds Savage Land, which was revealed at Tokyo Game Show, and the X-Mansion, which was revealed today. These two iconic locales come primarily from the X-Men side of the Marvel Universe, and the X-Mansion features Colossus, Beast, Professor X, and other mutants lingering the background. The new beta will also include more consistent online play with no breaks in the gameplay schedule, rollback netcode, expanded offline features, and spectator mode.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHHTVR47-8k"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHHTVR47-8k" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>With the inclusion of these two new characters into this next closed beta, that brings the full roster for December's closed beta to eight characters: Captain America, Doctor Doom, Ghost Rider, Iron Man, Ms. Marvel, Spider-Man, Star-Lord, and Storm. We do not know how many playable characters will be available in the final game, but if we look at Dragon Ball FighterZ, it included 23 playable characters at launch (including unlockables), plus another 22 post-launch, bringing the total to 45. Marvel has no shortage of well-known characters, so it stands to reason we have quite a few more to learn about in the lead up to launch and after.</p><p>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC at some point in 2026.

            <p>Never Grave: The Witch and The Curse has finally got a release date. Announced during tonight's State of Play event, the side scrolling action game will be coming out on the 5th March, 2026 on the PS5 and PS4.</p>
<p>Developed by Frontside 180 and published as part of Pocketpair's relatively new video game publishing arm, the game received a new gameplay trailer as part of the announcement.</p>
<p>This trailer not only shows off a few new boss fights, but also an equipment screen, what appears to be a skill tree, and some fancy magically-charged combat. You can watch it yourself below.</p>

<p>Frontside 180, a fully-owned subsidiary of Pocketpair, dropped a Steam demo for Never Grave in January 2024. Since then, it's been cooking away in the background. It's the second game to come from Pocketpair's publishing arm, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-studio-pocketpair-wont-publish-games-with-ai-we-dont-believe-in-it">which Pocketpair staff have said will not work with games using AI, NFTs, or Web 3</a>.</p><p>

The first game to come from Pocketpair Publishing was Dead Take, which is a fantastic indie project <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgent-studios-reveals-full-cast-for-dead-take-including-sam-lake-jane-perry-and-laura-bailey">starring popular voice actors Ben Starr, Neil Newbon, and others.</a></p><p>Never Grave: The Witch and The Curse certainly looks charming. Here's hoping Frontside 180 can magic away the months so March comes all the quicker.</p>

            <p>
Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set to receive three new free Sega characters over the next few months.
</p>
<p>
The first, coming next month, is NiGHTS from the iconic Sega Saturn game. Though not officially announced by Sega previously, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-leak-reveals-more-iconic-characters-coming-to-its-roster-which-retro-fans-will-love">character is present on the back of the physical version of the game</a>, so their inclusion has been known since before the game's release. Still, at least we know they're coming in December.
</p>
<p>
NiGHTS will be followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-monkey-ball">Super Monkey Ball</a>'s AiAi, the cute little banana-grabbing monkey who's been let out of their ball. AiAi will join in January 2026.

<p>
Last up is Tangle and Whisper, dual characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog spin-off comic series that debuted in 2019. Tangle is a lemur and Whisper is a wolf.
</p>
<p>
These three will join Persona 5's Joker and Like A Dragon's Ichiban, who were both recently added to the game as free additions.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after the game's release, the paid Minecraft DLC was released, featuring new characters and a new track. Capcom's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-adds-mega-man-next-year-with-post-launch-roadmap-now-revealed">Mega Man will also join next year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A second closed beta for Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls has been announced and it launches December 5, 2025 at midnight Pacific Time. It will run until December 7 at 11:59 PM. On the 5th and 6th of December you will be able to battle both online and with CPU opponents, with this being reduced to online only on the 7th of&nbsp; December.</p>
<p>You should be able to<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls/#closed-beta/"> sign up for the closed beta here.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls - New Closed Beta Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHHTVR47-8k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The six playable characters from the first beta, Iron Man, Doctor Doom, Ms Marvel, Storm, Captain America and Star-Lord, will be joined by Spider-Man and Ghost Rider. Two new stages, Savage Land and the X-Mansion have been added to the beta. You will also be able to use the communal space and spectate games.</p>
<p>“Based on feedback received from the previous closed beta, we’ve implemented numerous improvements, including balance adjustments, performance optimizations, visual enhancements, and user experience upgrades. More details will be shared as we get closer to the beta test,” explains Kazuto Sekine, Game Director and Lead Battle Designer.</p>

<p>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Soulsis a tag fighter but it is pushing the boundary to be a 4v4 system. There are different ways to approach it. You can use one fighter with the other three in the team being assists, or swap through each character to work out the different styles that they have.</p>
<p>The game is a big collaboration between Sony, Marvel and Arc System Works, who have developed some of the most celebrated fighting games of the past decade including Dragon Ball FighterZ and Guilty Gear Strive.</p>
<p>Looking back at Dragon Ball FighterZ, in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/29/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/">our glowing review</a>, Dave wrote,&nbsp;“By shattering some boundaries, Dragon Ball FighterZ has combat that’s more than worth getting into, but also a diverse roster and some phenomenal presentation. The Story Mode could have been improved if it were more streamlined, but it’s a mere blemish on an otherwise spectacular game.”</p>

<p><iframe title="Elden Ring Nightreign The Forsaken Hollows - Gameplay Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7GO1FjenwI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Forsaken Hollows will bring additional Nightfarers, Bosses and more into the multiplayer spin-off to one of FromSoftware’s most beloved games.</p>
<p>The update will introduce the Scholar and the Undertaker as two new playable Nightfarers. They’re described as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scholar</strong> –&nbsp;An academic who walks the Lands Between. Boasting impressive arcane levels, he gains incredible advantages through battlefield observation.</li>
<li><strong>Undertaker –</strong>&nbsp;An abbess who was mandated to slay the Nightlord. Boasting impressive strength and faith, she sends enemies to the afterlife with ruthless efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two new bosses will also feature in this DLC expansion, and there will be the new area of The Great Hollow, which adds a cavity to explore under Limveld. This includes exotic ruins and temples, sacred towers from forgotten peoples, and crystals and have a life-draining miasma that you’ll probably want to avoid.</p>

<p>Those that pre-order the DLC will receive a digital artbook and mini soundtrack as downloadable apps, though these were previously available as part of the Deluxe Edition and Deluxe Upgrade Pack. In fact, The Forsaken Hollows DLC is included for those who bought the Collectors Edition or Deluxe Edition of Nightreign.</p>
<p>While good, Elden Ring Nightreign didn’t gather quite the same level of acclaim of its predecessor and currently sits on a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-nightreign/">77 on Metacritic</a>, though that didn’t stop millions of eager FromSoftware fans diving in as soon as possible. We gave the game a solid<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/elden-ring-nightreign-review/"> 7/10 in our review,</a> with Jason saying, “Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun multiplayer offshoot, but it also doesn’t come close to the dizzying heights we’re used to seeing from FromSoftware. It’s an interesting experiment, and I am glad it exists despite my mixed feelings, but it’s a shallow happiness when I expect far more profound experiences from this company.”</p>

			<p>Just as the community <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-in-the-works-fromsoftware-kadokawa/">was bemoaning the lack of post-launch support</a>, Elden Ring Nightreign developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">at the State of Play Japan</a> that new DLC is coming to Elden Ring Nightreign, and it'll arrive before the end of the year. The new expansion, The Forsaken Hollows, will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming December 4, 2025.</p>



<p>This paid DLC expansion adds a few new features to the game, with two new playable Nightfarers to players to try out, two new bosses that FromSoftware is currently being quite tight-lipped about, and what sounds like a new area to explore within Limveld.</p>

<iframe title="Elden Ring Nightreign The Forsaken Hollows - Gameplay Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7GO1FjenwI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The two new Nightfarers are called the Scholar and the Undertaker. The Scholar is described as "<em>boasting impressive arcane levels,</em>" and gains "<em>incredible advantages through battlefield observation</em>," while the Undertaker features "<em>impressive strength and faith</em>."</p>



<p>It's not exactly an in-depth description of either character's kit, but it's seemingly all we get for now. We'll definitely learn more the closer we get to the DLC's launch.</p>



<p>As far as the new bosses, all FromSoftware marketing representative Miku Watanabe has to say in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launches-dec-4-on-ps5-ps4/">PlayStation Blog post</a> is: "<em>Players will confront two new bosses tormenting Limveld</em>." So, it seems like the new bosses also go in the category of, 'things we'll learn about later.'</p>



<p>Lastly, the DLC also adds The Great Hollow, a hole that has opened up in Limveld that players will get to explore in the new DLC, described as a place that is "<em>strewn with exotic ruins and temples; sacred towers denoting the remains of an ancient people; and crystals that exude a cursed, life-draining miasma</em>."</p>



<p>The DLC will be available for $15 USD, though if you purchased the Deluxe Edition of Nightreign, then you'll just get the DLC added to your library when it arrives on December 4, 2025. Hopefully, we won't have to wait too long to learn more about the DLC.</p>

<p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls got a new trailer during today’s State of Play Japan. In it, the second closed beta was announced, alongside who’ll be included.</p>







<p>Revealed in June, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-tokon-ps5-closed-beta-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fighter from ARC System Works</a>, creators of Guilty Gear, teams up with the superheroes of Marvel. Many have already gotten their hands on it with the closed beta and at EVO. Given ARC System Works’ track record, it’s safe to say it’ll be one to watch. Now, thanks to today’s State of Play, we have a bit more information on when the next chance to play will be.</p>



<h2 id="h-second-closed-beta-for-marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-coming-december-5th-7th-2025">Second Closed Beta for Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls Coming December 5th-7th, 2025</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>The trailer, seen above, we get a look at some new gameplay of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. We see new stages, including the X-Mansion with some familiar faces. Most importantly, we see a new closed beta announced for PlayStation 5. The beta will occur from December 5th through December 7th and run all 72-hours. New characters not in the first beta include Spider-Man and Ghost Rider.</p>



<p>Via <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-closed-beta-2-arrives-dec-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the PlayStation Blog</a>, the beta will be open to all who participated in the first one. Furthermore, those who expressed interest but didn’t get in will now be considered for this one. As for the schedule, on&nbsp;December 5 and 6, CPU battles and online matches will be available, with&nbsp;December 7 being only online battles.</p>



<p>The roster, for Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls includes Iron Man, Captain America, Ms. Marvel, Spider-Man, Star-Lord, Storm, Ghost Rider, and Doctor Doom. More characters are expected to join before the game’s 2026 release. There are a ton of heroes to choose from, so the possibilities are somewhat infinite. Still, it’ll be exciting to see how ARC System Works approaches these characters and how they may differ from other Marvel fighting titles.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>'s new major DLC update has finally been revealed. Titled The Forsaken Hollows, the DLC was announced during tonight's Sony State of Play livestream through a new trailer.</p>
<p>The Forsaken Hollows is set to release on 4th December. In the trailer, we see footage of some familiar characters, before revealing additional bosses on the way. That includes the iconic Artorias from Dark Souls - much requested by players - as well as the Dancing Lion from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion, and a field boss version of the Gladius Nightlord.</p>
<p>Then there are the new playable characters. The first is the Scholar, an academic with impressive arcane levels who "gains incredible advantages through battlefield observation". The other is the Undertaker, an abbess with strength and faith skills who "sends enemies to the afterlife with ruthless efficiency". There's also a new Shifting Earth event called The Great Hollow, featuring exotic temples, the remains of an ancient people, and crystals exuding a cursed life-draining miasma - it looks similar to the Ancient Ruins of Rauh from Shadow of the Erdtree. And who are those holy knights with golden spears?</p>

            <p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls is getting another closed beta, this time with two new stages as well as Ghost Rider and Spider-Man playable. It'll be available starting the 5th of December, and will run interrupted for 72-hours.</p>
<p>To participate in this beta, eager players will have to sign up at the PlayStation beta website just like in the first closed beta test. This closed beta test will also feature the lobby system, which will allow beta testers to run around a large social space between matches.</p>
<p>In the new gameplay trailer released alongside the beta announced, we see both Ghost Rider and Spider-Man in-action, including a few glimpses at special moves and super attacks which are awfully tantalising. You can watch the announcement yourself below!</p>

<p>This appears to be a similar build to what was playable at Evo France, though that public build was limited only to the two new characters. The uninterrupted nature of this second beta test may seem an odd note, but that's because the first closed beta was broken up into separate testing periods.</p><p>This proved to be a major point of frustration for early players, and so it seems as though Arc System Works and Sony has listened to feedback and provided an opportunity for eager fighting game fans to really grind the game out next month.</p>
<p>If you fancy it, you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-preview">Eurogamer's Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls preview</a> here for an idea of what the game is like, and whether or not you should be excited. In it, the game is described as: "a visual carnival, a celebration of comic books, movement, and wall-to-wall action".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Kaznori Yamauchi made a brief appearance during the State of Play Japan stream with a key announcement for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>. With the GT7 Spec III coming out on 4th December, Polyphony Digital has also prepared a new Power Pack DLC to go alongside.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gran Turismo 7 - Power Pack Add-On Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkAuyjsfmuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Gran Turismo 7 Power Pack is a premium DLC that’s all about bringing fully fledged endurance racing to the popular sim racer for the first time.</p>
<p>This is a pretty big bundle, which will include in its bundle of content:</p>
<ul>
<li>50 new races across 20 themed categories, inspired by global automotive and motorsport traditions.</li>
<li>24-hour endurance racing for players who crave the ultimate test of skill and stamina.</li>
<li>Full race weekends: Practice, qualify, and compete in the main event for a true racing simulation.</li>
<li>Gran Turismo Sophy 3.0 AI for intense, tail-to-nose battles that push your limits.</li>
<li>Includes 5,000,000 in-game Credits</li>
</ul>
<p>This is really for the endurance racing lovers, with a wide array of races that will include country-inspired circuits and some of the most legendary endurance racing events – the 24hrs of Le Mans no doubt included in that, but I’m hoping for a 24hr of Lemons event as well.. Gran Turismo Sophy 3.0 will aim to offer the most taxing AI racing challenge and competition possible through this.</p>

<p>While the Spec 3 update will be free for all players of GT7, the Power Pack will be paid DLC. Pricing has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that full-on 24-hour races have featured as part of a Gran Turismo game. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/11/24/review-gran-turismo-5/">GT5</a> you could race a full 24 hour race yourself, and put your B-Spec AI drivers into the mixer for some progression while you’re not actively playing the game, but endurance racing provides different challenges for the racing AI, pit stop strategies and more.</p>
<p>Of course, we’d have loved to have seen longer form racing included in GT7 from the off – it’s often a bit of an afterthought, given the demands i puts on both players, game designers, and testers – but Polyphony should be credited with consistently updating and expanding their games with free content, new tracks and more.</p>
<p>Spec 3 will be a big update for the 2022 racer, with the following new and improved features:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 new tracks (Yas Marina Circuit, Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve)</li>
<li>8 new cars</li>
<li>‘Dunlop’ tyres</li>
<li>Data Logger</li>
<li>Collector Level cap increased</li>
<li>Unlimited car invitations in Brand Central</li>
<li>Enhanced Weekly Challenges</li>
<li>New opening movie</li>
<li>New Menu Book ‘Seasonal Menu’</li>
<li>New events in ‘Circuit Experience’</li>
<li>New Curations in ‘Scapes’</li>
<li>Improvements to online races</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As one of the big announcements to kick off the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">State of Play Japan event,</a> Koei Tecmo announced that Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake, a remake of the classic entry into the Fatal Frame franchise, will arrive on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 this coming March 12, 2026.</p>



<p>A new trailer for the remake was showcased during the live stream event, which concluded with a reveal of the game's release date. It's the latest re-release in the Fatal Frame series after the<a href="https://wccftech.com/fatal-frame-mask-of-the-lunar-eclipse-release-date/"> remaster for Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse</a>.</p>



<p>A post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly-remake-launches-march-12/">PlayStation Blog</a> that went live shortly after the trailer premiered delved into the main characters in the game and an overview of the game's story, but unfortunately did not go into too much detail about what is being upgraded in this remake. </p>



<p>"<em>Every element has been enhanced — from graphics and sound to controls. The texture of each character’s skin and clothing has been meticulously refined, while the setting of Minakami Village has been beautifully reimagined with striking contrasts of light and shadow to create an atmosphere that is both haunting and lifelike</em>," writes Makoto Shibata, director of the Fatal Frame series at Koei Tecmo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in late October</a>, Bethesda released Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition yesterday for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X, as a way to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the original launch. </p>



<p>This new version of the critically acclaimed post-apocalyptic open world roleplaying game includes all the six official DLCs released by Bethesda Game Studios (Far Harbor, Automatron, Nuka-World, Contraptions Workshop, Vault-Tec Workshop and Wasteland Workshop), as well as over 150 Creation Club items, including new quests, companions, armors, weapons, skins, player homes, and objects to add to the Settlements system. Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, which will launch next year for Nintendo Switch 2, is priced at $59.99 for new users, $39.99 for those upgrading from the original game, and $19.99 for those upgrading from the Game of the Year edition.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>However, just like with <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-anniversary-edition-out-now-free-update-weighs-5-3gb-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> four years ago, this new edition breaks many essential mods that users had based their modlists around. The main reason is that F4SE, the equivalent of SKSE, an extender upon which many mods are based, no longer works (until its creators update it).</p>



<p>And just like with Skyrim Anniversary Edition, modders have quickly come up with a method to revert Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition to the previous version of the game (v1.10.984), thus preventing the breaking of your precious mods.</p>



<p>The first to post a guide on how to do that was Nexus Mods user ocramuias (in the comments section of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this page</a>). Here's an abridged version of that guide:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open the Steam console by pressing Win + R and pasting <strong>steam://open/console</strong></li>



<li>Run the following command inside the Steam console: <strong>download_depot 377160 377162 5698952341602575696</strong></li>



<li>This forces Steam to download the Fallout4.exe file (38 MB in size) from the previous build, version 1.10.984, which was originally released on May 13, 2024. When the download is complete, open the folder shown in the console log. This can usually be found in <strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\content\app_377160\depot_377162</strong></li>



<li>Once there, you must back up your current executable. Navigate to your game's installation directory (for example, <strong>C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Fallout 4</strong>), and rename the existing Fallout4.exe to Fallout4_111137.exe. Now, copy the previously downloaded file into that folder and replace the existing .exe file.</li>



<li>At this point, it's time to disable automatic updates for Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition. You can do that in Steam &gt; Library &gt; Fallout 4 &gt; Properties &gt; Updates &gt; set "Only update this game when I launch it". From now on, you'll always have to launch the game through <strong>f4se_loader.exe</strong> rather than Steam.</li>



<li>Also, set Fallout4.exe to Read-only by right-clicking with the mouse and going to Properties. This will prevent Steam from overwriting it.</li>
</ol>



<p>Enjoy!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A highly advanced AI-powered robot took a tumble in Russia during a technology presentation. Unfortunately for the robot and its creators, the fall happened while the <em>Rocky</em> theme song played, and it was all recorded and shared online.</p> <p>On November 11, <a href="https://unn.ua/en/news/in-russia-the-first-humanoid-robot-fell-at-a-presentation-it-was-covered-from-the-audience">AIdol showcased some AI-powered autonomous robots</a> at the Yarovit Hall Congress Center in Moscow. <a href="https://www.mskagency.ru/photobank/1063641">Photos from the event</a> posted by the <em>Moscow City News Agency</em> show that the company had a few different robots on hand for the event, letting people get up close to them, take selfies, and <a href="https://www.mskagency.ru/photobank/1063641">even kiss the creepy-looking bots</a>.</p>

 <p>However, at some point during the event, one of the robots was presented on stage and began to walk like someone who had had one too many drinks. Just a few moments later, <a href="https://www.mskagency.ru/photobank/1063636">the bot crashed forward</a> onto the floor, leaving broken bits of plastic and metal on the ground. After the fall, someone tried to use a black curtain to cover up what had happened, but the curtain was twisted up, and it took far too long to hide the situation. While all of this happened, inexplicably, it sounds like the <em>Rocky</em> theme song was playing in the background. Let’s watch:</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:4aqzua5vsewimmusg66fyajl/app.bsky.feed.post/3m5eso76zcs2a" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigiz35sfxgm3s6kshx57kkxjdzsxt26i7zvwddao2cgjnallgr3zm"> <p lang="en">Joke of the day from Moscow: Russia tried to unveil its first humanoid AI robot, Aidol. Key word: tried. The robot collapsed during its debut, forcing organizers to cut the presentation short.

This is top-tier comedy. In fact, it was so funny that I wasn’t sure it was real. I mean, there was that <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/12/13/hi-tech-robot-on-russian-state-tv-turns-out-to-be-a-fraud/">fake robot back in 2018</a> in Russia that turned out to be a man in a suit. Perhaps this was fake, too? But looking around, it does seem like this event happened and was covered by a news agency in Moscow.&nbsp; This is all a bit embarrassing for the folks involved, but at least the robot never stepped on a Lego and <a href="https://b1.mskagency.ru/c/1119897.jpg">screamed in pain…oh no!</a></p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/goodnight-universe</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-goodnight-universe-switch-2-a-supernatural-adventure-quirky-heartwarming.1350388/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155043/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>In 2021, publisher Skybound Games put out <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/before_your_eyes">Before Your Eyes</a> on PC and Mac (later on mobile and PSVR2), which offered an innovative control mechanic in which you primarily interacted with the game through eye movement and blinks. Alongside this cool gimmick, Before Your Eyes was lauded for its gripping emotional story, quickly turning it into an indie favourite that garnered a passionate following.</p>
<p>Now, the developers at GoodbyeWorld Games have created a spiritual sequel called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/goodnight-universe">Goodnight Universe</a>, which both builds on some of the themes of its predecessor and introduces some cool ideas of its own. Though it currently lacks the eye control feature on Switch 2 (a Camera update is planned "sometime after launch"), it still proves a worthwhile narrative experience.</p>
<p>Goodnight Universe places you in the role of Isaac, an infant with the mind of a grown man and psychic powers, born to an unremarkable and ordinary nuclear family. Isaac can babble and cry and do all the things that a normal baby can do, but every now and then he causes a little chaos by flexing his psionic abilities in ways that confuse, frighten, and delight those around him who haven’t caught on and believe that Isaac is simply just a ‘normal’ baby.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160473/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet there’s, of course, the lingering mystery of <em>why</em> Isaac can do these things, and the plot naturally thickens once he catches the attention of the Aio Corporation, a tech company which seems to have some understanding of Isaac’s powers and has its own agenda for how to utilise them.</p>
<p>While the twists throughout the relatively brief (~four-hour) narrative are certainly intriguing, this is ultimately a soulful and heartwarming tale about the importance of family and the finite nature of time. As Isaac narrates his experience, you’re getting a first-row seat to all the ups and downs of ordinary family life, and not all of it is pretty.</p>
<p>In one instance, you’re witnessing a wholesome interaction between Isaac’s sister, Cleo, and his dad, while in another you’re tuning in to his dad’s private thoughts while he reads a bedtime story and learning of various insecurities and concerns he struggles with as the family's main provider. Domestic life can be messy in so many beautiful ways, and Goodnight Universe does a great job of showcasing this while keeping things interesting with the goofy antics of its primary protagonist.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160465/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While there are some key moments in which you can express yourself and choose <em>slightly</em> diverging routes for a given scene, this is a largely linear tale that plays out somewhat like an interactive Pixar movie. Every now and then, you’ll get to choose something — such as whether Isaac responds with happiness or sadness to what another character said or did — and this leads to a few unique lines of dialogue, but there aren’t any bigger moments that lead to completely separate paths and different routes.</p>
<p>Some may be disappointed by this, but I appreciated the single-minded nature of the narrative, as it allows you to more easily immerse yourself, rather than keep stepping out to determine which route might be more interesting.</p>
<p>Gameplay follows the structure of a simple point-and-click adventure game in which you primarily scan the environment for the next interactable object or person needed to move the scene forward. Sometimes you’re given a neat checklist to follow with multiple objectives, while others you must intuit what’s next based on what the characters are doing.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160468/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Isaac can read minds and manipulate objects from afar, leading to all sorts of mischief as you innocently poke and prod at the world, leaving those around you bewildered as dishes seemingly wash themselves and toys aren’t found in the same places they were left.</p>
<p>There are some light puzzles to solve every now and then, but progression is basically a matter of identifying the correct object you need to manipulate in the environment and then doing the action needed to make it move or dance or fly across the room.</p>
<p>You do gain a few new abilities as the narrative progresses and Isaac gets more of a handle on his powers, but it’s very rare that the path forward isn’t made obvious either by the game literally telling you what to do next or very strongly hinting at it. Those of you who are looking for challenge won’t find it here, then, but the gameplay isn’t so braindead that you disengage.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160474/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Just like Before Your Eyes, the controls for Goodnight Universe feel designed around eye-tracking software for video cameras, but... well, the Switch 2 version doesn’t support this at launch. As a result, you’re left to navigate the interface using the right stick to move the cursor and camera, which often feels more tedious than I’d like. It’s the sort of control scheme that’s <em>fine,</em> but it feels clunky and unintuitive, which tends to take you out of the narrative that’s clearly trying to place you in Isaac’s shoes.</p>
<p>While I wouldn’t say that stick controls are a dealbreaker, it’s nonetheless worth keeping in mind that you’re missing out on a key component of the intended game experience when playing it on console before the planned update arrives.</p>
<p>Visually, Goodnight Universe employs a simplistic but charming art style that leans well into the cartoonish absurdity of its protagonist’s abilities. The exaggerated proportions and environments vaguely call to mind the art style of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari</a> series, but there’s plenty of room for detailed character expression and smooth animation as scenes play out. Naturally, all this unfolds without any frame hitches or skips, highlighting the much-welcomed power boost that the Switch 2 hardware brings over its predecessor.</p>

<p>As far as the audio is concerned, music is sparsely utilized to punctuate scenes and elevate the atmosphere, often adhering to tracks that lean into the whimsy and sci-fi elements of the story. The music takes the backseat, however, to make room for the excellent voice acting, which significantly adds to the overall experience.</p>
<p>Not only are all the performances passionate and nuanced, but little details in the sound mixing contribute lots to the immersion, such as when listening to a character’s thoughts and hearing their internal monologue come at you from different ‘directions’. At boot up, you’re encouraged to play this game with headphones and I couldn’t agree more; the soundscape here is something you’ll want to pay lots of attention to.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Goodnight Universe is an enjoyable and quirky narrative adventure game that feels like a satisfying follow-up to the deeply emotional experience of Before Your Eyes. Isaac’s supernatural adventures are as entertaining as they are heartwarming, and though it isn't terribly long, it makes full use of every moment.</p>
<p>The only major drawback here is that the Switch 2 doesn’t support the eye and face tracking control style of the PC version at launch, which notably does take away somewhat from the core experience. All the same, I’d suggest you pick up Goodnight Universe if this one has already caught your eye. It provides a memorable narrative journey and is the sort of game that you’ll still be thinking about long after putting it down.</p></section>
