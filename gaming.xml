			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console will be unveiled sometime in January and will be released only two months after its reveal, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported in a new video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintyPrime">Nintendo Prime</a>, a rumor discovered on Weibo suggests the new Nintendo console will be finally revealed in January for a March 2025 release, possibly towards the end of the month. As for production and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-shipments-7-million/">shipment of units</a>, over 650,000 units have already been shipped in various regions, and a huge quantity of components has been produced since September.</p>
<p><iframe title="RUMOR: Nintendo Switch 2 is Releasing in March 2025!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tItqYDzDoIE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While a random post on a Chinese forum is generally not a very reliable source, things are different in this particular case. As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1h1bmwo/update_on_the_rumor_switch_2_will_be_revealed_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, this user got a lot of Nintendo announcements right before they were made in the past and has since deleted all of their posts. Some of the announcements that were gotten right were pretty difficult to guess, such as The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky The First remake announcement, so it definitely looks like this user has access to insider information in some way.</p>
<p>Despite the source of the rumor looking reliable, we have to take what they have revealed about the Nintendo Switch 2 with a grain of salt until the system is finally revealed and dated, which shouldn't take too long if these rumors are correct. We will keep you updated on the matter as soon as possible, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Victor von Doom is just as menacing as his name suggests, and the villain—sometimes anti-hero—is a natural fit for Marvel Rivals. We already know the imperious presence of the doctor is confirmed, so let’s check out the latest on his arrival and see if he needs an appointment.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> has a blockbuster, star-studded cast of characters befitting of a Marvel shooter. Meaning, that it makes sense to have (arguably) one of the most influential and memorable <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-characters-are-in-marvel-rivals-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters</a> in the biggest attempt to date to bring the epic universe to games.</p>



<p>It’s no secret Doctor Doom is coming to Marvel Rivals, that much is certain. However, a lot of confusion is directed toward his potential debut—let’s take a look.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-doctor-doom-coming-to-marvel-rivals">When is Doctor Doom coming to Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The faces of evil. Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Neither NetEase nor Marvel has given an official launch date for Doctor Doom in Marvel Rivals—and there aren’t even any leaks to give us a glimmer of hope.</p>



<p>The lack of a Doctor Doom announcement is bizarre given the character’s eponymous trailer back on July 26: “Marvel Rivals | Cinematic Trailer | No One Rivals Doom.” While the majority of the trailer features an array of the Rivals stars fighting each other, the main focus is on Doctor Doom.</p>



<p>Curiously, he doesn’t feature on the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes/index.html?heroId=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals hero page</a>—despite his trailer—and if he doesn’t appear at launch, I’d expect him to be the focal point of at least one of the first two seasons.</p>



<p>If anything spells bad news, it’s two Doctor Dooms, and yet we’re here unable to verify the launch date of one—keep checking back as we wait for official confirmation from either developer or publisher on the character’s Marvel Rivals launch.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-who-is-doctor-doom-in-marvel-rivals">Who is Doctor Doom in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p>Doctor Doom’s origin story is as sinister and foreboding as any: His mother was taken by Mephisto, and his father succumbed to death as an indirect effect of someone else’s actions. Cue the warpath of the vicious Victor von Doom. His brilliant use of magic and a mind for inventing and creation makes Doctor Doom one of the most-feared villains in Marvel—and history, to be honest.</p>



<p>He’s a genius, and Fantastic Four lovers will be intimately acquainted with Victor as they regularly clash. Hardened fans will debate for weeks on end who the greatest supervillain in the Marvel universe is; however, you only need to check different ranking lists to see Doom’s name appear at the top—in many cases <em>the </em>top spot.</p>



<hr>



<p>Do you think Doctor Doom is the greatest Marvel villain ever? Or does someone else breed evil that tiny bit better? While you deliberate on this, be sure to read up on the hero shooter’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-maps-game-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps and modes</a>, as well as the live-service title’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-marvel-rivals-money-laundering-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">money laundering controversy</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> development studio Polaris Quest has announced Light of Motiram, an open-world survival crafting game with mechanised animal-like creatures which - no matter which way you shake it and squint - looks remarkably similar to Guerrilla's Horizon series, but with some additional <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> elements thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>"In a world overrun by colossal machines, explore the vast open world, build your base of operations, advance technology, train Mechanimals, and take on formidable bosses," reads the game's official description.</p>
<p>"Starting from the primitive age, forge a new path of development. Defy the machination, survive with Mechanimals."</p>

<p>Light of Motiram itself promises realistic physics-based building, co-op and cross play, precise combat and "epic" fights. But, there is no denying its overall look is incredibly 'Horizon'. One image shows humans in tribal gear using bows and spears to fight off an advancing Tremortusk-like creature.</p>

<p>These similarities have not been missed by the wider gaming community. "I am colossally amused," wrote video games industry analyst <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1862013988038681065">Serkan Toto</a>. "There is no shame left."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Sony, Tencent and Pocketpair for further comment on today's announcement. Light of Motiram doesn't have a release date yet, but is coming to PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/light-of-motiram-094dff">Epic</a>.

<p>As for Guerrilla, the Sony developer seems to be done with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone">Killzone</a>, instead now favouring its Horizon series.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, art director Roy Postma said Guerrilla's decision to start working on the Horizon series was a conscious choice by the studio, and one which would see it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/killzone-developer-done-with-series-guerrilla-says-of-switch-to-horizon">move away from the darker and more violent Killzone games</a> the team was initially known for.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Microsoft says its plans to let users buy and play games directly via the Xbox app on Android are being held up by a new legal issue.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, Xbox chief Sarah Bond blamed the hold-up on "a temporary administrative stay recently granted by the courts". 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-games-will-soon-be-available-to-purchase-in-the-xbox-app-on-android-in-the-us">previously said it would launch the functionality</a> before the end of the month.

<p>
"At Xbox, we want to offer players more choice on how and where they play, including being able to play and buy games directly from the Xbox app," Bond <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bondsarahbond.bsky.social/post/3lbxhvgggek2k">wrote</a>. "I recently shared our ambition to unlock these features first with the Google Play Store on Android devices in the US while other app stores adapt to meet consumer demand.
</p><p>
"Due to a temporary administrative stay recently granted by the courts, we are currently unable to launch these features as planned. Our team has the functionality built and ready to go live as soon as the court makes a final decision. We are eager to launch and give more choice and flexibility to players."
</p>
<p>
The legal issue in question appears to be <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/">Google's 16th October appeal</a> against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-wins-major-google-lawsuit-further-opening-up-android-phones-to-third-party-stores">changes to Android and its Google Play store ordered as a result of the Google vs Epic Games lawsuit</a>.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games successfully argued that Google operated an illegal monopoly via its smartphone app store. Last month, a judge ruled that Google would now have to allow third-party storefront apps in the US next year other than the Google Play Store, and that Android users be able to pay via alternate means, rather than just Google Play Billing.
</p>
<p>
Google said it would appeal the decision as it appeared to contradict the ruling of Epic's less-successful Apple trial, that because Apple existed it did not have a monopoly, and because the changes would make Android less safe and secure for users.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Google for more.
</p>
<p>Separately, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-open-web-based-mobile-game-store-this-summer">Microsoft is also working on its own web-based Xbox mobile game store</a>, which was set to launch in the summer. In August the company stated testing had begun, but it's still unclear when it will properly launch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzards-old-manual-art-is-a-real-nostalgia-trip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warcraft-2-tides-darkness">Warcraft I &amp; II</a> remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, and the world will feel my pain. </p>
<p>Anyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World Of Warcraft</a>, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of <a href="https://www.frazettamuseum.com/collections/framed-art">Frank Frazetta</a>'s style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">his excellent Space Marine piece</a>. </p>
<p>Anyway, a valued RPS community member <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rockpapershotgun">on the Discord</a> shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years. </p>

<p>Here's the piece in question. Shout out to CMaster on the Discord. </p>

<p>Thing is, I've most definetely seen this piece before, because the original <a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/misc/StarCraft.PDF">Starcraft manual</a> that houses it was primo toilet reading back in the day. But it was still a shock seeing it again, especially considering how different it is to the style I associate Blizzard with currently. Here's a few more for the Zerg and Protos.</p>

The mutalisk, especially, isn't worlds away from some of Starcraft II's art. But things get really interesting when you look at a few bits from <a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/misc/Warcraft%202%20Battlenet%20edition.PDF">Warcraft II's manual</a>.

In contrast, here's a more recent orc from <a href="https://blizzard.gamespress.com/World-of-Warcraft/Focus/Warlords-of-Draenor-concept-art">Blizzard's archives</a>. As far as I can tell, it's a concept piece from the 2014 expansion Warlords Of Draenor.

<p>If you prefer this more recent piece, I absolutely get it. While I'm not a fan of the softness and stylisation myself, it's very distinctly a Warcraft orc. This could just be an effect of familiarity, sure, but you could identify that as Blizzard immediately, while the older piece could be from any number of DIY, grungy OSR manuals. Personally, though, that's why I love it.</p>
<p>Here's a human. Sorry about the text. Bloody love their text, humans do.</p>

<p>Anyways, that's it, that's the post! As I said, figured a few of you might get a kick out of seeing the old art, especially if it's your first time. Also, I'm contractually obligated to write 'orc' at least twelve times a week.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-announces-a-blatant-horizon-zero-dawn-knockoff-called-%E2%80%98light-of-motiram%E2%80%99.1047282/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Tencent have announced with developer Polaris Quest that it will be releasing a new game called ‘Light of Motiram’ for PC which looks awfully like Horizon Zero Dawn.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://lightofmotiram.com/EN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> came yesterday (first spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/mechanimal-open-world-survival-crafting-game-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>), revealing that the game will launch for PC on Steam and the Epic Games Store, but the publisher did not give an official release date.</p>



<p>The game has already been ripped apart on social media for being a fairly blatant Horizon Zero Dawn ripoff, but we’ve attached some images below to make up your own minds.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>The summary of the Light of Motiram reads,</p>



<p><strong>A Mechanimal-Ruled Open World<br></strong><br>“Earth and human civilization as we once knew it are gone. Across untamed wilderness, giant mechanical beasts roam freely, while humanity struggles to rebuild from the dawn of a new primitive era.</p>



<p>Journey from lush tropical rainforests to barren desert landscapes and snow-capped mountain peaks— as you discover unique Mechanimals and mysterious ruins in different regions, gradually uncovering the secrets of MOTIRAM.</p>



<p><strong>Survive in the Wilderness</strong></p>



<p>In this mechanical wilderness where civilization is a distant memory, primal cultures, extreme weather, and lurking Mechanimals will constantly test your survival skills. Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses, every step is fraught with danger and requires courage. Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land.</p>



<p><strong>Realistic Physics-Based Building</strong></p>



<p>Unleash your creativity with a freeform building system powered by realistic physics simulation. Construct a fortified stronghold or a cleverly designed shelter, every beam and brick is subject to real-world physical forces, ensuring that your structures are both visually stunning and able to withstand environmental challenges. Let your imagination run wild as you explore the endless possibilities of architecture.</p>



<p><strong>Precise Combat Epic Boss Fights</strong></p>



<p>Dodge, block, and counterattack with precise timing and execution. Sharpen your battle skills in life-or-death situations, deftly weaving through enemy assaults, dodging deadly blows, and seizing opportunities to counterattack. Don’t forget to coordinate with your Mechanimal partners—choosing the right companion can make your combat twice as effective.</p>



<p>Journey with Mechanimals at Your Side</p>



<p>Over 100 customizable Mechanimals await your taming and training. Whether you need combat support or a boost to production, each Mechanimal possesses unique abilities and growth potential. Through personalized customization, you can give them exclusive battle modes and production traits, transforming them into your most powerful allies.</p>



<p><strong>Seamless Co-op &amp; Cross-Play</strong></p>



<p>Team up with up to 10 players to tackle daunting challenges together. No matter where you are, embark on adventures with your friends anytime and enjoy a seamless gaming experience. From hunting mechanical beasts, gathering resources to construction projects, progress never stops.</p>

Fans desperate for an announcement from Sony have so far fed on scraps from director Hidetaka Miyazaki, who is asked about the prospect of more Bloodborne pretty much every time he’s interviewed by press.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, in February, ahead of the launch of FromSoftware’s Elden Ring expansion Shadow of the Erdtree, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">M<u>iyazaki said that because the developer doesn’t own the Bloodborne IP</u> he couldn’t speak about its future</a>. He did, however, admit Bloodborne would benefit from releasing on more modern hardware.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS4 Games (Summer 2020 Update)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the release of the PS5 Pro brought little cheer to Bloodborne fans, who have reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-ps5-pro-can-you-see-the-difference">Sony's $700 mid-gen console upgrade barely improves the game at all</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, fans have the surprise in-game server maintenance notice, which just so happens to coincide with PlayStation’s 30th birthday on December 3. Why would Bloodborne undergo server maintenance now, nearly a decade after its launch? And why would it fall on PlayStation’s 30th birthday, which Sony is already celebrating with a number of initiatives?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are debating this now, but amid the frenzy of speculation there are messages of caution. “Friendly reminder that they’ve periodically done server maintenance before and that’s exactly what it’s always been: server maintenance,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/1h1b8nf/comment/lzabylz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warned redditor amygdalapls</a>. “Not a new patch, not an update, not anything along those lines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do wish it was more but alas. Brace for disappointment!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Bloodborne server maintenance seems designed to coincide with potentially big announcement events, just to mess with fans. In 2022, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/zeqdf2/bloodborne_undergoing_maintenance_during_the_game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloodborne underwent server maintenance on the same day as that year’s The Game Awards</a>, sparking a similar cacophony of speculation and excitement we’re seeing today. Then… nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does add a dash of spice to the debate this time around is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-confirms-sonys-buyout-intent-but-insists-no-decision-has-been-made-at-this-time">Sony’s confirmed attempt to buy FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a> as part of a deal that could be confirmed imminently. That acquisition, should it go through, sparks all sorts of questions of its own, including whether Sony would seek to make FromSoftware’s future games PlayStation exclusive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, though, it seems more Bloodborne disappointment is on the cards, and the wait for that elusive 60 frames per second next-gen upgrade will continue — perhaps forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The entry-level Hisense R6-series 4K smart TV offers a limited set of features in exchange for a rock bottom price. It has built-in speakers and Roku smart TV baked in.

So what's the difference between this TV and the 2024 LG Evo C4 model? Aside from the (current) $300 price difference, not much. The most important trait -- picture quality -- is more or less identical. Where the C4 improves on the C3 are an upgraded processor, newer WebOS interface, and a 144Hz refresh rate.</p></div><p id="tv-deals"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="TV Deals">More Black Friday TV Deals</h3></p><div catalogid="7081af7a-201a-46cb-8bbd-72bebe48deeb" id="209609"><div id="209609" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Azul</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You can pick up a copy of <a href="https://zdcs.link/9g3YNn?object_uuid=5df8a364-5c42-4b70-8566-334ca9ab558b&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=721116655.1681141708" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Azul</a> for only $20 for Black Friday.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-is-getting-cross-play-photo-mode-and-12-new-subclasses-in-patch-8.1047261/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/28/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-cross-play-photo-mode-and-12-new-subclasses/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/baldurs-gate-3">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> will be getting full cross-platform multiplayer and progression, a big new photo mode and a new subclass for all 12 character classes in the game – including a Drunken Master Monk! All of this will be arriving with Patch 8 sometime in 2025, though Larian will open the floodgates for a stress testing phase before then to try and iron out as many issues as possible.</p>
<p>Stress testing Patch 8 will hopefully begin in early January, with more details to come in their next Community Update post and a sign-up process. This will hopefully avoid rapid hot fixes after the update’s release.</p>


<p>We’re a few months on from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4593196713074709213">the last patch for Baldur’s Gate 3</a>, and while Larian said at the time that they would move away from big feature updates to their smash hit RPG, there were still a good few things left on their to-do list. Cross-platform multiplayer and photo mode were stated at the time, but new subclasses are a real surprise.</p>
<p>Cross-platform multiplayer – AKA cross-play – will allow all players across PS5, PC, Mac and Xbox to party up using the Larian Network that was established for Divinity: Original Sin 2. The bonus to this is that it will also introduce full cross-platform progression as well, so you can bounce back and forth between console and computer. Lovely!</p>
<p>Then there’s a proper Photo Mode coming in Patch 8 that will basically let you do whatever the heck you want. You can toggle this from the HUD by the minimap or with F9 on PC, or by clicking in both sticks on a controller, at which point you can then set the stage with character positioning, funny poses, switch up your party, and even include summons and Wild Shapes.</p>

<p>Photo Mode will have lens settings for FoV, exposure, depth of field and focus; scene settings to toggle characters on and off, so you can remove NPCs, and to select from 40 static and animated poses, each with variations and facial expressions; post-processing for colour-grading, contrast, saturation, highlights, brightness and vignette; frames to decorate the shot; stickers with over 300 available including emojis, icons, blood splatters, textures, objects and items, and cat ears.</p>

<p>And then there’s 12 new character subclasses, which Larian describe as follows:</p>
<h3>Bard – College of Glamour</h3>
<p>As a College of Glamour Bard, you’ll find you have the power to heal friends and command enemies in equal measure. Cast Mantle of Inspiration to bestow your allies with 5 temporary hit points. And should an enemy attack while it is cast, they’ll find themselves Charmed. Play your hand correctly and you’ll be able to use this to your advantage with Mantle of Majesty. Target Charmed enemies and you can command them to flee, move closer, freeze, drop to the ground, or drop their weapon.</p>
<h3>Barbarian – Path of Giants</h3>
<p>Opt for the Path of Giants, and your newfound giant strength will make it easier for you to yeet friend and foe alike. Forget chugging potions to pump those muscles, these Barbarians benefit from the Giant’s Rage passive that grants both strength and size – allowing you to deal additional damage with Throw attacks. Pockets weighing you down? Not for you and your increased carry capacity!</p>
<h3>Cleric – Death Domain</h3>
<p>As a cleric of death, you’ll find a few dark new tricks up your sleeves – from spells that specialise in necrotic damage to three new necromancy cantrips. This includes Toll The Dead, a cantrip that causes 1~8 damage when your cleric rings the bell of impending doom – a number that scales if your target has already been damaged. We’ve also added the homebrewed ability to explode nearby corpses, damaging enemies.</p>
<h3>Druid – Circle of Stars</h3>
<p>These Druids look to the stars for answers, accessing powers beyond those offered through the classic wildshapes. Taking on one of three Starry Forms for their power – the constellations of the Archer, Chalice, and Dragon. Each one favours a different play style and strategy – the Archer dealing radiant damage with astral arrows, the life-giving Chalice restoring hitpoints to you and others nearby, and the wise Dragon, allowing you to deal damage with an added bonus to constitution rolls. The Starry Forms offer not just a celestial aesthetic, but practical, powerful options to enhance your role as a healer, fighter, or strategist.</p>
<h3>Paladin – Oath of the Crown</h3>
<p>You’ve been sworn to uphold the principles of law. Stay true to your oath and you’ll be rewarded with the power to aid your allies and disrupt your foes. Guide your companions in battle with Righteous Clarity, taunt enemies with strategic interrupts, and keep your party standing strong with Divine Allegiance, absorbing their damage while restoring their health.</p>
<h3>Fighter – Arcane Archer</h3>
<p>Mastering the dual arts of magic and marksmanship, the Arcane Archer subclass offers unique skills on top of new shooting animations. Banish foes to the Feywild, removing them from the battlefield for a turn, or unleash Psychic damage that forces enemies to make a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the start of their next turn.</p>
<h3>Monk – Drunken Master</h3>
<p>Putting the brew in homebrew, as the Drunken Master, you have the ability to consume alcohol straight from your inventory, as well as drink from bottles you see around the Sword Coast, in order to recover Ki. By sharing the bottle with your enemies using Intoxicating Strike, you’ll generate a buff towards your Armour Class and your Chance to hit Drunk targets. Drunk enemies are also susceptible to the Drunken Masters’ other abilities, like Sobering Realisation – which sobers up drunk targets, dealing physical and Psychic damage.</p>
<h3>Ranger – Swarmkeeper</h3>
<p>The Swarmkeeper subclass provides Rangers with three kinds of deadly swarms to assist them in combat. The Cloud of Jellyfish deals extra lightning damage – potentially shocking your enemy. The Flurry of Moths deals Psychic damage, giving you the potential to Blind your enemy. The Legion of Bees deals piercing damage and forces the enemy to make a strength-saving throw or be knocked back 15ft. Each swarm also has the ability to provide you with teleportation capabilities!</p>
<h3>Rogue – Swashbuckler</h3>
<p>This Rogue subclass introduces a range of new actions fit for the piratical life. Play dirty by tossing sand at enemies to Blind them. Flick your weapon at a target to Disarm them. Or use your new Fancy Footwork passive while meleeing your enemy to ensure they can’t make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.</p>
<h3>Sorcerer – Shadow Magic</h3>
<p>As a Shadow Magic Sorcerer, you deal in a form of magic that makes you deadliest in darkness. This subclass gives its sorcerer Superior Darkvision, as well as the ability to Shadow Walk between places of dim light or darkness. It also lets you call forth the perfectly homebrewed Hound of Ill Omen to harass your foes, and use Strength of the Grave to prevent you from being downed – ideal for those attempting Honour Mode runs.</p>
<h3>Warlock – Hexblade</h3>
<p>Hexblade Warlocks make a pact with an entity from the Shadowfell that manifests in the form of magical weapons. Curse your enemies and force their souls to do your bidding. Slay any enemy that isn’t generally an element of nature, construct, giant blob, or already dead, and you’ll be able to raise their spirit from their corpse for ten turns. This new summon can deal necrotic damage and will rip away a chunk of your enemy’s soul to provide your Hexblade Warlock with healing.</p>
<h3>Wizard – Bladesinging</h3>
<p>The Bladesinging subclass merges swordplay with wizardry. Expect new spellcasting animations when casting spells with your weapon, a new Bladesong ability to grant you supernatural speed, agility, and focus, plus gives you a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make.</p>

            <p>
The Cabin Factory is described as a horror game but it's sort of about deciding whether you are, in fact, playing a horror game. There is indeed a factory and it does indeed produce cabins - jolly, Center Parcs-style affairs made of big, merry logs, which roll up fully constructed on a conveyor belt. Your job is to enter and inspect them in first-person. What are you inspecting them for? Ghosts.

<p>
If you see anything paranormal, scoot on back to the factory floor and hit the red button to condemn the structure. If the building appears normal, press the green one (you won't, seemingly, have to worry about other habit certification requirements, such as checking that all the kitchens have fire blankets - different department, I guess). In the event of a haunting, the predictable complication is that the spooks might not let you leave. Quite why your employer keeps accidentally building haunted houses remains to be seen. Where exactly do they get the logs for those walls?
</p>
<p>
I'm interested in The Cabin Factory partly because it could be an amazing prank. Maybe none of the cabins harbour ghosts! Perhaps the whole thing is a vicious social experiment on the part of developers International Cat Studios, to see how many players can be induced to imagine supernatural antics. 
</p><p>
It would be a neat way to save development resources with regard to ghoulish lighting effects, fraught violin soundtracks and such. Perhaps other self-described "horror" games could follow their example. Imagine a Silent Hill game in which Silent Hill is a perfectly unremarkable town, haunted only by the spectres players bring in with them. Hang on, isn't that what Silent Hill is anyway?
</p>
<p>
The other thing that interests me about The Cabin Factory is the precise level of eerieness that separates a haunted house from a house that just has a lot of shoddy wiring and ill-fitting carpentry. What kinds of layout, atmospheric elements, and special effects will they introduce that provoke alarm but do not kindle the certainty of an eldritch infestation? How do you tune, say, a creaking floorboard so that it sounds almost like the footfall of a poltergeist but, on reflection, is probably just a creaking floorboard? What species of rising damp looks almost, but not entirely like the Babadook?
</p>
<p>

The third thing that interests me about The Cabin Factory is that it could be a commentary on game testing. It gives International Cat Studios a certain leeway when it comes to glitches - that's interference from beyond the grave, not a misbehaving shader! I wonder if there's any odds of a licensed multiplayer mode where they wheel on houses from other, unfinished games and have you comb them for frame-rate drops styled as phantom interventions, using a PKE Meter that actually just shows you a graph of CPU activity.
</p>
<p>
The Cabin Factory is out 13th December. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3311740/The_Cabin_Factory/">read more on Steam</a>. The obvious movie pairing here is Cabin In The Woods.

Its main attraction is a new and 'mysterious' island, which is said to be six times as large as Sakurajima, the previous island to be added to the game. Players will find 'powerful tower bosses' and many new Pals in this new location, and there will also be a sizable amount of new content. The game is also currently discounted by 25%, making it a great time to jump into Palworld for newcomers.</p>
<p>Moreover, PocketPair has confirmed a collaboration with Terraria, the massively successful indie game released in 2011. This collaboration will take place next year, though there are no further details on what will be included.</p>
<p>Following the incredible success enjoyed at launch, when Palworld surprisingly secured the second place on Steam's all-time concurrent players chart (it would later be surpassed by Game Science's Black Myth: Wukong), the game's development slowed down a bit. However, PocketPair recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-trailer-still-gets-showcased-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> the game on PlayStation 5, welcoming a whole new player base, and it is now being developed for mobile platforms, too, thanks to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-is-coming-to-mobile-with-pubg-publisher-krafton-securing-global-license-for-the-title/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deal with PUBG's Krafton</a>.</p>
<p>One platform where players will never be able to play this game is the Nintendo Switch. In fact, after much deliberation, Nintendo has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> PocketPair for patent infringement. Recently, the Japanese independent studio <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> more details about the lawsuit. Nintendo alleges that the following three patents were infringed upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patent No. 7545191<br>
[Patent application date: July 30, 2024]<br>
[Patent registration date: August 27, 2024]</li>
<li>Patent No. 7493117<br>
[Patent application date: February 26, 2024]<br>
[Patent registration date: May 22, 2024]</li>
<li>Patent No. 7528390<br>
[Patent application date: March 5, 2024]<br>
[Patent registration date: July 26, 2024]</li>
</ul>
<p>As a remedy, Nintendo asks for an injunction against Palworld (which would remove it from being available to players) and two payments of 5 million yen plus late payment damages to The Pokémon Company and Nintendo Co., Ltd.</p>

            <p>Picking things up. Putting the things in boxes. Setting prices. Managing employees. Wiping the sweat from your creased brow and knowing, even if your meagre salary doesn’t get you very far, at least you put in an honest day’s graft to acquire it. All things done by pathetic fools that don’t realise the true CEO grindset actually involves no-wifing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> all day and subsisting entirely off the the Lucozade-bottled urine of overworked drivers forced to make the agonising decision between self respect and continued employment. I might be conflating billionaires here.</p>
<p>Also, coincidentally, all things you can do <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3128740/Beff_Jezos_Simulator/">in the demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beff-jezos-simulator">Beff Jezos Simulator</a>. Now, work <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation games</a> aren’t my absolute favourite. But, hey, I do love a good fantasy game. And what spellbinding vision of a farflung reality could be more fantastical than a game in which a billionaire actually does some work?</p>

			<p>We've seen game clones in our day, but perhaps none has ever been so blatantly inspired by a game like Light of Motiram, a newly announced open world game that practically mimics every key visual element of Guerrilla's Horizon Zero Dawn.</p>
<p>Young redhead female protagonist? Check. Gorgeous natural environments to explore following the collapse of civilization? Check. Animal-like machines? Check, check, check. Big boss fights that require precise timing and execution? You got the gist.</p>
<p>To be honest, Palworld is far more removed from Pokemon by comparison, and that one has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a lawsuit from Nintendo anyway. We'll see if Sony moves to sue as well. It would have to go against Tencent, as the developer of Light of Motiram is Polaris Quest, one of the Chinese giant's subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Anyway, to be fair, there are a few gameplay differences compared to Horizon Zero Dawn and its sequel, Forbidden West. To start with, this game features extensive survival and building mechanics:</p>
<p><em>In this mechanical wilderness where civilization is a distant memory, primal cultures, extreme weather, and lurking Mechanimals will constantly test your survival skills. Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses. Every step is fraught with danger and requires courage.</em></p>
<p><em>Unleash your creativity with a freeform building system powered by realistic physics simulation. Construct a fortified stronghold or a cleverly designed shelter. Every beam and brick is subject to real-world physical forces, ensuring that your structures are both visually stunning and able to withstand environmental challenges.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Light of Motiram | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P_liwn7B7As?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The taming and training mechanics are also far more in-depth than in Guerrilla's game. Light of Motiram promises over a hundred customizable Mechanimals to tame and train.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the game supports seamless cooperative multiplayer for up to ten players to adventure together. The official description also mentions cross-play, although Light of Motiram has only been announced for PC and will be released via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/light-of-motiram-094dff?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> at an unannounced time. By the way, minimum and recommended system requirements are already available and should not be a problem for anyone who has built a gaming PC in the last five or six years.</p>

<p>In Marvel Rivals, you wage war across a rich depth of Marvel licenses from Thor to Black Panther. Many of the universe’s respective characters and native lands are represented in the hero shooter, so let’s run you through every confirmed map and game mode so far.</p>



<p>I’ve played many online multiplayer shooters, and it’s incredible how opinions can vary depending on the title’s maps and game modes. These are core fundamentals of a shooter’s identity, meaning if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>‘ DNA is flawed in this regard, it could fail before it even gets started.</p>



<p>However, based on the Marvel Rivals alpha and beta tests, I’d suggest this is unlikely. So without further ado, here’s every map and game mode locked and loaded in for Marvel’s star-studded hero release.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-marvel-rivals-map">Every Marvel Rivals Map</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A rich tapestry of content. Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>We currently know of nine maps in Marvel Rivals, and these battle arenas are distributed amongst the same few locations. Check out every single map confirmed so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven</li>



<li>Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface</li>



<li><a href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Tokyo_2099:_Shin-Shibuya"></a>Tokyo 2099: Shin-Shibuya</li>



<li><a href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Tokyo_2099:_Spider-Islands"></a>Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands</li>



<li>Tokyo 2099: Warped Ninomaru</li>



<li>Wakanda: Birnin T’Challa</li>



<li>Wakanda: Hall of Djalia</li>



<li><a href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Yggsgard:_Royal_Palace"></a>Yggsgard: Royal Palace</li>



<li><a href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Yggsgard:_Yggdrasill_Path"></a>Yggsgard: Yggdrasill Path</li>
</ul>



<p>More maps might accompany the official launch of the multiplayer title, so stay tuned for even more content. Also, with Marvel Rivals taking up the live-service trend, a fruitful conveyor belt of maps is only the beginning. </p>



<p>With so many Marvel licenses to use, I’d love to see the Avengers Tower or the Quantum Realm set the scene for an epic battle!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-marvel-rivals-map-rumors">All Marvel Rivals Map Rumors</h2>



<p>In addition to confirmed locales, many more Marvel Rivals maps are purportedly on the way—courtesy of a leak.</p>



<p>According to journalist <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ross Miller on X</a>, another f<strong>ive maps are already in development (or finished)</strong> and likely coming to Marvel Rivals in a future content update. They <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller/status/1788079410530185237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">outed</a>, “Hydra Erebus Base, The Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda, Klyntar, Empire of Eternal Night, and Krakoa” as major locations.</p>



<p>Each of the five areas is expected to have maps within too. Take this all with a grain of salt, but it makes for interesting reading.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-marvel-rivals-game-mode">Every Marvel Rivals Game Mode</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals is gearing up for launch with four game modes: <strong>Conquest</strong>, <strong>Convergence</strong>, <strong>Convoy</strong>, and <strong>Domination</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-conquest">Conquest</h3>



<p>Conquest is a variation of Call of Duty’s Kill Confirmed in which players need to bank points for a kill by collecting the fallen enemy’s coin. The key difference here is the value of a coin increases the longer time goes on.</p>



<h3 id="h-convergence">Convergence</h3>



<p>We’re using Overwatch as our template here as you need to capture a control point first to trigger a payload, which the attacking team needs to guide to the end of the linear route. Conversely, the defending team has to prevent the payload from reaching each checkpoint by pushing it back and repelling opposition forces.</p>



<h3 id="h-convoy">Convoy</h3>



<p>Convoy is an honorable imitation of Overwatch’s classic Payload and Convoy modes. There are no capture points here, it’s a straight-up escort or defense mission (depending on your given side) of a moving objective along a fixed path.</p>



<h3 id="h-domination">Domination</h3>



<p>For Marvel Rivals’ Domination game mode, it’s a basic race to capture a control point and hold it until one team reaches the threshold. If one team achieves 100% completion, but at least one enemy player is present, it goes to overtime to determine if the game continues.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is expanding yet again with 12 new subclasses, including drunk monks, teleporting beekeepers and shadow sorcerors]]></title>
            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-expanding-yet-again-with-12-new-subclasses-including-drunk-monks-teleporting-beekeepers-and-shadow-sorcerors</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-expanding-yet-again-with-12-new-subclasses-including-drunk-monks-teleporting-beekeepers-and-shadow-sorcerors<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Way back in June, treacherous, fickle Larian declared that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> patch 7 would be their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-update-will-be-larians-final-handover-to-players">final handover to players</a> of the well-good D&amp;D RPG, with the focus then shifting internally to Larian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">two currently untitled new game projects</a>. CEO Swen Vincke did, however, caveat that while the overall level of post-release support would be "diminished", there would be a few more updates. We interpreted that to mean bug fixes and the like. Certainly, I wasn't expecting brand new subclasses for every class in the game, which is what you'll get with the just-announced Baldur's Gate 3 patch 8, together with new crossplay functionality and a full-figured photo mode.</p>
<p>The subclasses in question are a fanciful bunch. Take Drunken Master for the Monk class, which lets you intoxicate enemies and then rapidly sober them up to inflict physical and psychic damage. As a Ranger Swarmkeeper, meanwhile, you can wield a "legion of bees" like a battering ram and then teleport to the swarm's location to stick the boot in. The Fighter's Arcane Archer subclass lets you temporarily banish people to another dimension, the Cleric's Dark Domain lets you blow up corpses, and the Rogue's Swashbuckler gets to flick sand in faces, jolt weapons from hands and generally speaking just wind adversaries up. Fire up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735?l=english">the Steam announcement post</a> for the full list.</p>
<p>As for the new photo mode, this gives you a bunch of lens settings such as FOV and focus level, together with scene settings such as the ability to toggle off either party members, NPCs and enemies. It also lets you choose facial expressions and pick from around 40 static and animated poses, each with variations. There are also post-processing effects such as contrast, saturation, highlights, brightness and vignetting, and a choice of frames and stickers.</p>
<p>The sweetener is full cross-play functionality with full cross-platform progression. No longer will that Xbox player you know have to play Baldur's Gate 3 solo. You'll be able to invite them into your game and, as the case may be, cover them in angry bees. </p>
<p>There's no release date for the patch just yet, but Larian are doing early public "stress-testing" in early January. You'll be able to register your interest beforehand.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's only $35.19 on Fanatical, and full price at $39.99 on Steam. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-complete-list-of-nominees-goty">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree was also nominated for Game Of The Year at The Game Awards.</a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">10/10 review of Shadow of the Edrtree</a>, we said, "FromSoftware says Shadow of the Erdtree is the only expansion Elden Ring will get, so it’s fortunate that it’s hard to imagine a better DLC than this – as long as you’re not hoping for it to do anything radically outside the box. Everything I loved about the original has been condensed into an incredibly tight package – one that’s the size of many standalone games all on its own, and can only be considered “small” in comparison to the absolutely massive world of Elden Ring itself."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Erdtree’s absolutely jam-packed with secrets, valuable treasures, challenging boss battles, and horrific monstrosities to face off against, as well as cool new weapons, spells, Ashes of War, Spirit Ashes, talismans, and more to play around with and use to find even more novel ways to tackle its memorably brutal battles. Add on some very interesting lore revelations, not to mention the same spectacular visual design and stellar music that accompanies its larger-than-life bosses, and you’ve got what is certainly one of the best DLC expansions I’ve ever played."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Helldivers 2 for $27.99</h2></div><div catalogid="194b9695-169d-4e37-9fe9-61a3b74e5835" id="212142"><div id="212142" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>HELLDIVERS 2 (PC)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This chaotic multiplayer gem is playable on Steam Deck and only $27.99 on Fanatical, or $31.99 on Steam. (<em>If you watch the video review below, you'll also see me make a ridiculous decision at 7:10 while trying to get back to the ship</em>)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2 review</a>, we said, "Helldivers 2 is the rare modern multiplayer game that does almost everything right. It gives you a ton of freedom, feels fantastic to play, and has a smart progression system that doesn’t nickel and dime you or rely too much on a paid battle pass. It manages to keep its missions fresh by introducing a ton of enemies, modifiers, and objectives, and varying them in interesting ways."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are some matchmaking and performance issues that still need to be worked out, and you can only go so far by yourself or with random players – but if you’ve got a solid squad, it’s an incredible time, and certainly one of the most fun multiplayer shooters I’ve played in years. When I’m not Helldiving, I’m thinking about Helldiving, counting down the time until my next drop. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to pour myself a nice, hot cup of Liber-tea and get back at it. Those bugs and robots look like they could use some freedom, and Managed Democracy isn’t going to spread itself. For Super Earth!"</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Dragon Ball: Sparking!

Zero</a>, we said, "Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is a final flash from the past, sometimes to a fault, as demonstrated by its archaic menus and remedial training tools. Its Episode Battles have the kind of reaction-heavy difficulty that doesn’t really exist in most games these days, more than once crossing the line between challenging and frustrating."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But the feeling of traveling back to a simpler time when games didn’t have to be balanced or competitive to be fun is a good one, especially when that action stays so true to that of the show it’s recreating. Reliving a story that was foundational to my youth, looking and sounding as great as I remember it, with the opportunity to alter it in sometimes dramatic new ways is clever, and the addition of tools to attempt to create our own stories could elevate the experiment even further if a community can figure out how to make the most of them."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Silent Hill 2 Remake for $41.99</h2></div><div catalogid="d5e33a22-3373-4490-acf3-364348dc0e8a" id="212136"><div id="212136" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Silent 2 Remake (PC)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill 2 got a beloved remake this year, and it's already available for $41.99 on Fanatical, but still $55.99 on Steam. Silent Hill 2 was also nominated for several awards at The Game Awards, including Best Narrative, Best Action/Adventure game, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review">review of Silent 2</a>, we said, "Silent Hill 2 is a welcome modernisation of a survival horror masterpiece. It smoothly polishes down the rough edges of the original game’s combat while taking a piece of heavy grit sandpaper to scuff up every rust and mold-covered surface of its nightmarish environments, successfully making them appear far more abrasive and menacing to explore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Previously primitive boss battles have been transformed into substantially more intense encounters, and its intimidating audio design kept me acutely aware that every fog-cloaked street I walked down could quickly hurry me towards my own dead end. It does feel a little padded out in parts, and I do wish that Bloober Team had streamlined some of its more convoluted puzzle sections to prevent the story’s momentum from sagging on occasion. Still, intermittent pacing problems aside, Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">God Of War for $17.99</h2></div><div catalogid="3e0c6059-d396-4973-b8ce-c62b559716ed" id="212137"><div id="212137" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>God of War (PC)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Steam Deck-verified RPG made quite the splash when it was revealed.

But I didn’t expect it to be a thrilling journey in which every aspect of it complements the others to form what is nothing short of a masterpiece."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s a game in which Kratos, a previously one-note character, becomes a complex father, warrior, and monster, embattled both on the field and within his own heart about how to treat his son; one in which the world opens up and shifts, offering rewards in both gameplay and knowledge of its lore that I treasured with each accomplishment. The obvious care that went into crafting its world, characters, and gameplay delivers by far the most stirring and memorable game in the series.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ghost of Tsushima - Director's Cut for $41.99</h2></div><div catalogid="d047a1d6-f7e1-4bdd-a56b-bd78580f7306" id="212138"><div id="212138" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ghost of Tsushima - Director's Cut (PC)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Jin Sakai's journey to reclaim Tsushima comes with some extras in the Director's Cut version, which was originally a PS5 exclusive.

By steadily introducing new abilities instead of stat upgrades, its swordplay manages to stay challenging, rewarding, and fun throughout the entire 40 to 50 hours that it took me to beat the campaign."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A few aspects are surprisingly lacking in polish in comparison to other first-party Sony games, especially when it comes to enemy AI and the stealth part of its stealth/action split. Still this is an extraordinary open-world action-adventure game that solves several issues that have long gone unaddressed in the genre, while also just being an all around samurai slashin’ good time."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Persona 5 Royal for $20.99</h2></div><div catalogid="c354d2d3-5b3c-4ef1-8341-85b5f6172395" id="212140"><div id="212140" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Persona 5 Royal</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This game helped put Persona on the map— (even though Persona 3 has a superior cast and story.

In response to the questions, CFK and 21c.Ducks plan to introduce all the various aspects of <em>Chrono Sword</em> to the world.</p><p>In the action RPG genre, combat systems are a key component of gameplay. <em>Chrono Sword</em> maintains the action elements of the souls-like genre while providing new shades unique to <em>Chrono Sword</em>, all to provide a more immersive gameplay experience. Let’s look into the innovative combat systems featured in <em>Chrono Sword</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Chrono Sword</em> centers around the heavy enemy and player hits common to the Soulslike genre, but various attack commands make the action faster and more intense.</p><p><strong>1) Quick Evade</strong></p><p>Instead of a roll, a quick press of the evade button allows players to skirt out of the way of enemy attacks.</p><p>In contrast with rolling away, which can help with avoiding attacks, evade allows for a stable evade detection system that allows players to avoid enemy attacks while setting up for a counterattack.</p><p><strong>2) Attack Cancel</strong></p><p>During an attack, a well-timed press of the action cancel button allows players to cancel the current attack and continue into a quick successive attack or immediate block/evade. The timing and efficiency of attack canceling can vary depending on the weapon selected.</p><p><strong>3) Finishing Attacks</strong></p><p>If players drive through an enemy after an attack cancel, enemies will fall to their knees in a brief stun animation. If players then close in on the stunned enemy and press the interact button, they will perform a finishing attack for a great deal of damage.</p><p><strong>4) Skill Attacks</strong></p><p>If players press a direction button while charging a strong attack, they will perform a strong skill attack that changes the attack into a completely different movement. There are two command skill attacks for each weapon.</p><p><strong>5) Useable Items</strong></p><p>Players can use a variety of items in combat by pressing the Use Item button.</p><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> has an arsenal of short-range and long-range weapons. Firing arrows can add damage from a safe distance or keep an enemy in a stunned state, and whetstones can imbue a weapon with fire, frost, or lightning properties.</p><p><strong>■ About the Game</strong></p><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> is a pixel art Soulslike action RPG developed by Korean dev team 21c.Ducks that tells the story of the dark gothic fantasy world of Adelnor, where players must travel between the past and future to unlock its secrets.</p><p>Revealed first to the public in 2019, this Soulslike action RPG garnered a great deal of interest in Korea and abroad for its unique pixel graphics and gameplay. Selected as the first game in the collaboration campaign by North American crowdfunding site Kickstarter and the global game testing platform Game Round.Inc in 2020, it raised over seventy thousand dollars to successfully reach its funding goal.</p><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> is a new take on the Soulslike genre, departing from the full 3D <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,415 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPGs</a> on the market, choosing instead to fashion their Souls-like with pixel art and a quarter-view perspective. Since the announcement of this game, indie team 21c.Ducks has poured their hearts and souls into developing a strong storyline and advancing both the action and RPG elements of their Souls-like entry.</p><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> renders its vast, three-dimensional world in pixel graphics. Players then step into the role of ‘time traveler,’ venturing freely between the past, present, and future in maps that seamlessly transition without loading screens. Developer 21c.Ducks has featured <em>Chrono Sword</em> in game exhibitions at home and abroad, where it was noted and awarded for its gameplay. They then took this experience and used it to further improve both gameplay and level design.</p><p>In addition, it has built on the heavy hits known to fans of the Soulslike genre while implementing new systems to create quicker, fiercer action.</p><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> featured the latest demo version at the <a title="Companies > Happinet Corporation [39 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/happinet-corporation">Happinet</a> booth at the Tokyo Game Show 2024, where it succeeded in attracting the attention of many players. After being unable to show its new face for so long, this new version of <em>Chrono Sword</em> drew attention as it focused on the action and RPG elements of the game, setting it apart from the demo released during the Kickstarter campaign.</p><p>Building off of this interest, <em>Chrono Sword</em> participated in the Steam Next Fest starting on October 14, 2024, where it was seen by even more players from around the globe. It succeeded in attracting even more interest by releasing a version touting more content than the one featured at Tokyo Game Show 2024.</p><p>21c.Ducks began their development path in 2015 with mobile game <em>Timing Hero</em>, moving onto release <em>Super Pixel Racers</em> on PC in 2018, distinguishing themselves for their abilities in game development and raising awareness about their company. Then once they unveiled <em>Chrono Sword</em> in 2019, the game was nominated for the Grand Prix / Judge Selection / Excellence in Art awards at the Busan Indie Connect Festival (BIC) that very year. Then in 2022, it won a special award for excellence at the Burning Beaver festival.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Thanksgiving isn't traditionally the time for receiving gifts, but that's not stopping Digital Extremes from doing a giveaway of its own. The developer behind Warframe is offering its 2008 third-person shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-sector-review/1900-6188387/" data-ref-id="1900-6188387">Dark Sector</a> for free, but you only have until November 30 to claim it.</p><p>Digital Extremes shared the announcement on X, as well as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29900/Dark_Sector" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dark Sector's page on Steam</a> where the game is temporarily yours for the taking.</p><p>Digital Extremes credits Dark Sector for inspiring Warframe, and the game was initially released on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. The story puts players in control of covert operative Hayden Tenno as he embarks on a mission behind enemy lines in the Eastern European nation of Lasria. He'll soon discover that there's a deadly secret that leaves him infected by a bio-weapon called the Technocyte Virus.</p><p>Ordinarily, the Technocyte virus turns its victims into mindless killing machines. Hayden avoided that fate--for now at least--and he's been left with superhuman abilities that may give him the edge if he wants to make it out of Lasria alive.</p><p>During the summer, Digital Extremes offered up a preview for Warframe's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframe-1999-looks-like-the-party-of-a-lifetime/1100-6526024/" data-ref-id="1100-6526024">Warframe: 1999</a>. The story thrusts players on an alternate Earth, and it looks very intriguing so far. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframes-developer-partners-with-make-a-wish-to-feature-child-in-upcoming-expansion/1100-6525153/" data-ref-id="1100-6525153">Digital Extremes granted a child's Make-A-Wish</a> to be a voice actor in the upcoming expansion when it arrives later this year.</p><p>If you're looking for more recent games and big sales, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tons-of-popular-pc-games-are-discounted-for-black-friday/1100-6527990/" data-ref-id="1100-6527990">check out our Black Friday roundup</a>!</p>

Post written by Jordan Mallory.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While designing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Brode and his team faced the interesting challenge of making a game simple enough for an extremely wide audience to vibe with, while still somehow giving themselves enough design space to introduce new cards and mechanics regularly over the course of several years. Solving these problems first required a concrete understanding of what the core game is, and to obtain that, the team had to experiment.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Becoming an expert in the game you are designing">Becoming an expert in the game you are designing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Part of the process is becoming an expert in your game, right?" Brode says. "When we first started out, I didn't know the right number of cards per location, the right number of locations, the right number of turns for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the right number of energy to start with. We tried seven turns and five turns, and starting on turn two and nine cards per location and four cards per location, three cards per location and two cards per location, and infinite cards per location. We tried everything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, Brode continues, these variables coalesce into the foundation of the product, and once that's all settled, you can go about the business of actually designing cards. But how much viable content can your new game actually support?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You need to actually make sure you can make a bunch of stuff," Brode says. "Like if your goal was 'Hey, let's make Tic Tac Toe a live service game,' and we're gonna add cards you can play before every turn of Tic Tac Toe … there's a couple designs that may be kind of interesting and not broken but not that many."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For this hypothetical, Brode would ideally design out a year's worth of content just to see if the idea had legs. "Even if you don't end up shipping any of those cards, you're like, 'Oh my God, I've used all the design space, Tic Tac Toe is too simplistic. I just can't come up with another 500 of these for the next 10 years.'"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Second Dinner is sitting at the Godot table">Second Dinner is sitting at the Godot table</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant also speaks with Brode about Second Dinner's embrace of Godot for another project that's already in development. The engine has grown leaps and bounds over the last few years, Brode says, thanks in-part to its open source nature and the responsive folk shepherding the project. And for his team specifically, Godot offers tremendous value in its ability to issue over-the-air updates for "literally anything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because we're writing the whole game in [GDScript] … this means if we wanted to do something like launch on a platform that is maybe notoriously difficult to get new content and new features shipped live to players quickly, well, we can just do that over the air without having to go through an approvals pipeline for [a] AAA platform," says Brode. "That could take a long time and we just don't have to do that. We can just quickly get stuff to players in a day or something. That's really mega, especially for a live service project."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Listen to the rest of our really mega conversation on your podcast platform of choice, and might we be so bold as to suggest adding </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gdconf.com/">GDC 2025</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to your March to-do list for more valuable insights from leading developers?</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.
