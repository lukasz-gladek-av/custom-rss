            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24241002/playstation-5-ps5-pro-comparison-differences-specs-software-ray-tracing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After various rumors and leaks, the PlayStation 5 Pro is finally official — complete with a new GPU, $700 price point, and<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240906/sony-ps5-pro-disc-drive-separate-price"> no built-in disc drive</a>. But is that pretty much it? What makes this new console 40 percent more expensive than the existing PS5 you can buy today for $500? The same one that’s bound to go on sale during the holidays, not long after the Pro’s November 7th launch date.</p><p>What are the differences between the PS5 and PS5 Pro that make it (depending who you ask) a worthwhile upgrade or a superfluous expense?</p><p><h3>Spec and performance differences</h3></p><p>The PS5 Pro has three core performance improvements over the standard PS5, according to Sony’s<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DX24BzyzQQ-8%26rco%3D1"> technical presentation announcement</a>, hosted by PS5 lead architect, Mark Cerny. It’s got a new, more powerful GPU for more compute power and faster rendering; advanced ray tracing for improved in-game reflections and more immersive lighting; and a new PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) upscaler to keep frame rates high without sacrificing resolution and image quality.</p><p>The GPU is really the star of the show, as Sony is saying it promises to have 67 percent more compute units and 28 percent faster memory yielding 45 percent faster rendering. But the CPU and storage speed in the PS5 Pro is unchanged, so while it should deliver 4K resolution <em>and</em> maintain 60 fps or greater, it’s possible the console won’t load or boot up games any faster.</p><div><figcaption><em>It’s still no looker like the PS4 and PS2 were.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>The biggest change for current PS5 owners here is that playing on a PS5 Pro will no longer require choosing between Performance and Fidelity modes (the decision many current games force on users for either prioritizing frame rate smoothness <em>or </em>crisper visuals). But Sony could just move those goal posts with the PS5 Pro, since the upcoming console also supports 8K gaming. It’s possible Performance and Fidelity modes will still be with us if playing games in 8K means once again sacrificing frame rate — which it’s sure to do. The difference there is that most people will not care, because<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/11/18177493/tvs-ces-2019-8k-samsung-lg-oled-rollable-micro-led-trends"> who the hell owns an 8K TV</a> right now?</p><p>As for ray tracing, that’s a feature that’s been supported in the PS5 since launch. But the PS5 Pro’s <em>advanced</em> ray tracing is promising to make it better, with more dynamic reflections and light refractions. Basically, games with pretty lighting and lots of reflections should look a bit prettier (rejoice,<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22958005/gran-turismo-7-review-ps5-ps4"> <em>Gran Turismo 7</em></a> fans). So far, ray tracing on the current PS5 has been a little lackluster compared to what’s possible on PCs with high-end GPUs (which, to be fair, cost more than a PS5 Pro on their own). But that’s more to do with the games themselves than the console. Many titles aren’t optimized for ray tracing on console, although there have been some PS5 standouts like <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em> that have good ray tracing performance. The PS5 Pro should just make them look better without compromising for the sake of frame rates.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>PSSR (no, don’t try to pronounce that) can tidy up details, like this background in </em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart<em>, while the frame rates are kept high.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The PSSR AI-driven upscaler is the most technical software trick of the PS5 Pro’s features. It’s a lot like Nvidia’s popular DLSS feature on PCs, and it’s a post-processing asset that helps achieve higher frame rates at high resolutions. The standard PS5 uses more conventional anti-aliasing, while the PS5 Pro will utilize machine learning to scale things based on what’s being actively rendered on your screen. It’s one of those things that works in the background to tidy up small details.</p><p>Another way the PS5 Pro should be more performant than the current PS5 is its support for Wi-Fi 7 (the PS5 has Wi-Fi 6, and never even made the jump to 6E when the Slim came out). That may be helpful with downloading massive games to the Pro’s 2TB internal SSD at faster speeds, but only if your home network supports Wi-Fi 7 — which most people have not yet adopted due to the cost involved. Notably this feature will not help Remote Play on the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review"> PlayStation Portal</a>, as Sony’s one-trick pony handheld for console streaming is bafflingly limited to Wi-Fi <em>5</em>.</p><p><h3>Physical hardware differences (what we know so far)</h3></p><p>Outside of the new GPU and the remixed cooling system it will require, the biggest physical differences in the PS5 Pro are its design and the absence of a disc drive. The Pro will be tall and long like the original PS5, but with the thinness of the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions"> revised Slim model</a>. It has a new finned design element across the side slashes on its removable plates (which Sony will sell customizable replacements for at a later time).&nbsp; Personally, I think it’s still a bit ugly, and I fear Sony’s refusal to show the front of the console in horizontal orientation means there’s another weird trick planned to let it rest on its side. The Slim used silly-looking little legs like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_saver">pizza saver</a> to keep it balanced. I’d hate for the pricier Pro to do the same.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>This is the only view of the PS5 Pro in horizontal position we’ve got so far. I’m wagering there are some hilarious little removable legs under there like the slim.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>The lack of a disc drive can be remedied by purchasing the same $79.99 modular drive Sony already sells for the PS5 slim. So instead of having the option for buying a PS5 Pro with or without a disc drive (the practice Sony started with the very first PS5 at launch), you’re only left high and dry to get your own. It’s fair to think a “pro” console calls for all the bells and whistles, including physical media that some diehards may prefer, but this may just be the start of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241265/sony-ps5-pro-game-console-disc-drive-end">digital-only future</a> for the next generation of consoles. And at least the M.2 slot is maintained on the Pro, for adding even more speedy storage.</p><div><figcaption><em>This time you have to supply your own ugly bump on the side that is the disc drive.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>Another bit of ever-changing I/O on PS5 consoles are the USB ports, which on the PS5 Pro continues the slow march toward being nearly entirely USB-C. Here’s a simple breakdown of the USB ports on all three PlayStation 5 consoles since launch:</p><div><ul><li>PlayStation 5 (original): One USB-C and one USB-A on the front / Two USB-A on the rear</li><li>PS5 (slim): Two USB-C on the front / Two USB-A on the rear</li><li>PS5 Pro: Two USB-C on the front / One USB-C and one USB-A on the rear</li></ul></div><p>So you still get four USB ports in total on the PS5 Pro (thankfully) and most of them are USB-C. We don’t know how fast each of them are on the Pro, but considering both the<a href="https://gmedia.playstation.com/is/image/SIEPDC/ps5-support-USB-ports-01-04nov20?$1600px$"> original PS5</a> and<a href="https://gmedia.playstation.com/is/image/SIEPDC/support-cfi-2k-usb-ports-06nov23$en?$1600px$"> the slim</a> have three SuperSpeed 10Gbps ports and one slower port it’s likely a safe bet the Pro will follow suit.</p><div><div><figcaption><em>The four USB ports of the original PS5.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>The revised USB ports of the slim PS5. The asterisk denotes which port the PSVR 2 must use.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div></div><p>One thing that is not changing are the controllers. The PS5 Pro will ship with the same old white DualSense controller, complete with its potentiometer-based analog sticks that can develop drift over time. The Pro would have been a nice opportunity for the DualSense to switch to drift-free Hall effect sticks, but no such luck.</p><p><h3>Who is the PlayStation 5 Pro for?</h3></p><p>This is the second console generation with a mid-cycle “Pro” model release, and while the PS4 Pro seemed to be generally well received in 2016, let’s not forget it launched at the PS4’s original price of $400 alongside a <em>cheaper </em>slim model. The market is much different now, with the slim PS5 offering no price reduction (aside from the occasional bundled game) and the PS5 Pro coming at a steep $700 (or $780 with the add-on disc drive).</p><p>The PS5 Pro seems mostly for the PlayStation superfans who might just buy it at nearly any price. But there are other people who are looking for something they can just turn on and play — no messing with drivers or dealing with the configurations and costs of a gaming PC. For those people, the PS5 Pro feels like a great option, even if the cost might have them balking at first.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players who have the title unlocked, which requires completing a bunch of 10th anniversary content, and buy the toy replica will also get an exotic ornament for Ace of Spades called “Pocket Ace” that looks just like the NERF version and drops when <em>Destiny</em>’s Episode 2 Revenant update arrives on October 8. </p><p>That’s how an artist who goes by Tofu discovered that what seemed like her work was being used for the game. “I achieved the in-game title of ‘Legend’ and the game prompted me with an ad telling me I could buy the nerf gun,” she told <em>Kotaku</em>. “I clicked on it just to check it out and had that ‘wait a second, this looked familiar’ moment when I saw it.”</p><p> Tofu had made a stylized print of Ace of Spades back in 2015 for a friend when it was first added to the game as an obtainable exotic weapon in <em>The Taken King</em> expansion. “The engravings, the painted stripes, are all details that do not appear in the game so I got suspicious right away,” she said. “When I then checked my original files that I still have in my archive I noticed that no, it was literally 1:1, you can clearly see scratches and swirls in the engravings matching perfectly.”</p><p>She shared a comparison online including breakouts of all the parts that seemed to match her design in a tweet aimed at getting Bungie’s attention. “While I’m obviously disappointed I don’t blame Bungie for this, I know they outsource this kind of work and this is obviously a case of a contractor cutting corners,” Tofu said. “And, when this has happened in the past Bungie has apologized and been on top of it so, I am remaining hopeful.”</p><p>Bungie didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache hit 25:single/related:de02193810622b2be3a436909cdf8d4e --><!-- empty -->
<p>Here at Ars, we've been publicly musing about whether the world was ready for a disc-free game console <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/08/is-the-world-ready-for-a-disc-free-game-console/">since as far back as 2015</a>. Now, though, the better question might be whether the world ever needs a new game console with a built-in disc drive at all.
</p><p>Yesterday's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/">announcement of the PlayStation 5 Pro</a> seemed to treat the existence of disc-based games as an afterthought. You had to be watching pretty closely during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdEBSx--XSc">Mark Cerny's "technical presentation" video</a> to notice that the coming PS5 Pro is only available in a single disc-drive-free model. And you'd have to read pretty deep into <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/">the official PlayStation blog post</a> on the subject to discover that "PS5 Pro is available as a disc-less console, with the option to purchase the currently available Disc Drive for PS5 separately."
</p><p>That <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/disc-drive-for-ps5-digital-edition-consoles">$80 disc drive accessory</a> was introduced as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/ps5-slims-new-external-disc-drive-requires-online-pairing-before-use/">an optional upgrade</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/redesigned-ps5-models-slim-down-one-of-the-bulkiest-consoles-ever/">the Digital Edition of the PS5 Slim</a> last year, alongside a Slim model that <em>does</em> have a pre-installed disc drive. But now, just one year later, Sony has decided that it only needs a single "disc-less" model of the PS5 Pro as the default.</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>Want to let your Digital Edition PS5 Slim (or PS5 Pro) play physical games? An $80 snap-on disc drive can help with that.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>On Microsoft's side, things seem to be trending away from console disc drives as well. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/microsoft-reveals-first-disc-less-xbox-series-x/">new Xbox models the company is releasing this holiday season</a> include the first "all-digital" edition of its top-end Xbox Series X, available for about $50 less than the standard edition. Microsoft is also introducing a new "Galaxy Black" Xbox Series X model with a disc drive this holiday season, but it will only be available "in limited quantities," Microsoft said.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Things have come a long way since 2013, when Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/microsoft-considered-disc-free-xbox-one-as-late-as-mid-2013/">privately mulled a disc-free version of the Xbox One</a> before scrapping the plans because of what Phil Spencer called "bandwidth and game size" concerns (the "All-Digital" Xbox One S would eventually <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/everything-we-know-about-the-first-discless-xbox-one-console-coming-may-7/">limp out in 2019</a>). Things have even changed considerably since 2020, when Gamestop's initial allotment of PS5 units <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/ps5-retailers-have-many-fewer-digital-edition-systems-for-pre-order/">was tilted 3-to-1 toward standard, disc-drive-equipped model</a>, according to Ars' analysis.</p>
<h2>A shrinking minority</h2>
<p>It's hard to read too much of the disc-free console hardware trend for the moment. The original editions of the PS5 and Xbox Series X still exist with disc drives, of course. And on Sony's side, that optional disc drive attachment exists as an important release valve for any PS5 Pro customers who want to pay more to enjoy games on discs.</p>
<p>But Sony's statistics suggest there's no need to treat physical game discs as the default anymore. Digital downloads represented <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1cs13sj/the_digital_ratio_for_full_game_software_sales_on/">70 percent of PlayStation's full game sales for the 2023 fiscal year</a> (ending March 2024) and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2022/07/nearly-80percent-of-all-ps5-ps4-games-are-bought-digitally">nearly 80 percent of such sales</a> for the April to June quarter of 2024. That's up from downloads representing 53 percent of PlayStation game sales in the 2019 fiscal year and way up from 19 percent in the 2015 fiscal year.</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>The number of physical console game releases continues to decline even as the number of digital game explodes.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The numbers are similar across the industry. For years now, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/fewer-and-fewer-console-games-are-seeing-a-physical-release/">most distinct console games have not been released as a physical product</a>, a trend that now includes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/alan-wake-2-and-the-death-of-disc-based-video-games/">major games like <em>Alan Wake 2</em></a>. Third-party publishers like Capcom report that <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/despite-90-of-its-sales-now-digital-capcom-claims-it-wont-stop-producing-physical-games/">90 percent of their sales now come from purely digital games</a>. In the UK, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/82-of-street-fighter-final-fantasy-diablo-and-f1-sales-were-digital-uk-monthly-charts">downloads represented 82 percent</a> of sales for the most popular new console releases in June 2023.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Given trends and numbers like that, why would Sony or Microsoft think a pre-installed disc drive should even be a relevant option for any gaming console going forward? Why would a console maker assume a critical mass of consumers want to spend an extra $50 or more for a disc drive they may never use?</p>
<p>Why not consolidate down to a single, disc-free model as the default and relegate physical games to "needs a weird peripheral" status? The PS5 Pro's disc-free release suggests Sony is now ready to treat disc-based gamers like virtual reality fans—a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/putting-sonys-4-2-million-psvr-sales-in-context/">small slice of the market</a> that needs to invest in non-standard hardware to play in their non-standard way.</p>
<h2>Long overdue</h2>
<p>This doesn't mean physical games are going away soon. There's still a sizable minority of gamers who want to own their games on physical media for valid reasons, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sonys-axed-concord-is-surprise-collectors-item-disc-prices-rise-175/">collectability</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/modern-gaming-is-a-challenge-for-those-without-high-speed-internet/">accessibility</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/87-of-classic-games-are-out-of-print-thats-a-problem-for-gaming-history/">long-term preservation</a>. Major publishers and <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/">specialist outfits like Limited Run Games</a> will continue to cater to this market segment for the foreseeable future.</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>This image, like game rentals as a whole, is now a relic of a bygone era.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to gaming hardware, though, the final push away from built-in console disc drives as the standard is overdue. On the PC, Steam made buying a disc drive for your gaming rig <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/is-there-a-reason-for-a-pc-gamer-to-need-a-blu-ray-drive.1473909/">feel like an anachronism</a> years ago. In music, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/06/apple-muscles-past-amazon-to-number-three-position-in-music-sales/">the iPod</a> and then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/record-companies-made-2-4b-last-year-from-streaming-but-its-not-enough/">streaming services</a> have led stores like Best Buy to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbyowsinski/2018/07/07/best-buy-cd-sales/">stop selling physical CDs altogether</a> (though vinyl sales are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/sales-of-vinyl-albums-overtake-cds-for-the-first-time-since-the-late-80s/">a small but growing niche</a>). In film, sales and rentals of movies on disc <a href="https://buttondown.com/diversetechgeek/archive/2023-us-home-video-revenue-streaming-dominates/">now represent just 3.6 percent of home movie spending</a>, dwarfed by both digital sales and rentals (a combined 10 percent) and subscription streaming (86.3 percent).</p>
<p>Console gaming now seems poised to be the next media format where physical media no longer drives the hardware market. Soon, the idea of a game console with a disc drive may seem as outdated as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/12/from-the-wirecutter-the-best-external-blu-ray-drive/">a laptop with a disc drive</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/no-headphone-jack-nintendo-did-it-first/">an iPhone with a headphone jack</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pubg-mobile/" data-ref-id="5000-561140">PUBG Mobile</a> is taking action against climate change with a new Play for Green initiative, one that lets players battle it out on a version of the game's iconic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-is-bringing-back-the-original-erangel-map-for-a-limited-time/1100-6522901/" data-ref-id="1100-6522901">Erangel map</a> ravaged by climate change.</p><p dir="ltr">The map is a collaboration between PUBG Mobile developers Lightspeed Studios and Krafton in conjunction with University College London professor Mark Maslin, who has written multiple books on the dangers of climate change. Using Maslin's research, the PUBG Mobile development team reimagined what the ruins of Erangel would look like 100 years from now given the current rate of climate change if no further action is taken. That translated into Erangel becoming an apocalyptic hellscape, one plagued by sandstorms, drought, and largely devoid of plant life.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who want to explore the map themselves, there's two modes featuring the climate-ravaged Ruins of Erangel. One, Ruins of Erangel: Sandstorm is the battle royale experience PUBG players are familiar with, as players struggle to survive against not only sandstorms but other players. Ruins of Erangel: Exploration is a narrative version of the map that guides players through the progressive effects of climate change to the map's environment.</p><p dir="ltr">It's all in conjunction with a new "Run for Green" in-game challenge going from September 11-24. During that time, the game will keep track of the distance the PUBG Mobile community runs in-game, with progress contributing towards milestones that will help aid projects looking to preserve natural environments in Brazil, Indonesia, and Pakistan. Players will also unlock in-game customization items and a special garden in the game's Home mode that can be outfitted with endangered trees and plants by progressing the Run for Green campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">Endangered California Redwood and Giant Baobab trees are additionally being added for use in the game's creative World of Wonder. Creative-minded players who create variants of the climate-change ravaged Ruins of Erangel map using the new items will have their work judged by the PUBG Mobile team and be eligible to win a share of a $12,500 prize pool. If players collectively play the official new Play for Green map or user-created ones 10 million times, the PUBG Mobile team will double their contribution to the environmental projects chosen as part of the campaign.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4365757-pubgrunforgreenevent.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365757" data-ratio="0.56469708302169" data-width="1337" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4365757-pubgrunforgreenevent.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365757"></a><figcaption>The Run for Green event will see players unlock in-game rewards as well as help protect natural resources.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4365757-pubgrunforgreenevent.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The event is part of the Playing for the Planet initiative, an alliance of video game companies pledging to help reduce the environmental impact of the video game industry and supported by the United Nations Environment Programme. Both Xbox and Sony are members of the initiative, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-to-be-first-carbon-neutral-game-console-with-/1100-6470034/" data-ref-id="1100-6470034">Xbox testing the creation of carbon neutral consoles</a>. According to a global survey of PUBG: Mobile players earlier this year, 88% of players who participated were concerned about climate change, with an even larger percentage stating they have already experienced the effects of climate change in their country.</p><p dir="ltr">Vincent Wang, head of PUBG Mobile publishing at Tencent Games, said in a press release that the power of gaming can be used to help address one of the biggest challenges of our time.</p><p dir="ltr">"With initiatives like the Ruins of Erangel maps and the Run for Green event, we're not just creating immersive content for our players--we're inspiring a global community to take real-world action," Wang said.</p><p dir="ltr">The Play for Green initiative is just the latest event to come to PUBG Mobile. A limited-time event last year added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-mobile-is-adding-dinosaurs-and-it-looks-awesome/1100-6514248/" data-ref-id="1100-6514248">dinosaurs to the battle royale</a>, and the mobile game is no stranger to collaborations with other franchises, including anime <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/pubg-mobile-x-dragon-ball-super-official-crossover-trailer/2300-6464420/" data-ref-id="2300-6464420">Dragon Ball Super</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/pubg-mobile-spyxfamily-collaboration-live-now/2300-6463883/" data-ref-id="2300-6463883">Spy x Family</a>.</p>

            <p>
Starbreeze Studios has announced major changes to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a>'s creative leadership team - with former game director Miodrag Kovačevićas "stepping away" from the role - as the co-operative shooter continues to struggle against its decade-old predecessor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-2">Payday 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Back in February, Starbreeze <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-seeks-long-term-success-after-disappointing-launch">admitted</a> Payday 3 player activity was "currently at significantly lower levels than [it] would like", and a month later, CEO Tobias Sjögren was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starbreeze-ceo-tobias-sjogren-ousted-by-board-following-payday-3-flop">ousted from his role</a> after the company's board determined the studio "needs a different leadership". But a quick look at Steam Charts suggests Payday 3's playerbase continues to be dwarfed by that of its predecessor: Payday 3 saw a <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/1272080">monthly average</a> of around 844 Steam players in August - its highest monthly average since December last year - while Payday 2 <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/218620">attracted</a> 15,508 players (the game's <em>lowest</em> monthly average since December last year). 
</p>
<p>
And now Starbreeze has confirmed yet more leadership changes as it continues its efforts to attract more players to Payday 3. "As we are nearing our first anniversary for Payday 3, and the start of our second year," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/PAYDAYGame/status/1833868133691511218">statement shared on social media</a>, "we wanted to give a brief update on the Payday 3 leadership."

<p>
"Going into year 2," it continued, "[Miodrag Kovačevićas] will be stepping away from his former role as game director, and focusing his efforts as a designer elsewhere on the project. In the interim while researching and planning year 2, [Andreas Häll Penninger and Almir Listo] will be the creative force behind the upcoming updates we hope you keep enjoying and playing".
</p>
<p>
Acknowledging his new duties in a <a href="https://x.com/almirlisto/status/1833869599009317281">separate post</a>, Listo - Payday's global brand director and head of community - wrote, "I have worked on the Payday franchise for the past 12 years together, and I am thrilled about the upcoming content we are preparing for you all! Thank you for your continued support - we salute you."
</p>
<p>
On its release last year, Payday 3 struggled with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-players-endure-second-consecutive-day-of-server-issues-preventing-them-from-playing">matchmaking issues</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-requires-an-always-on-online-connection">unpopular online-only requirements</a>, while its first major patch was hit with repeated delays, eventually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3s-much-delayed-first-patch-is-finally-here">arriving</a> two months after the game's troubled launch. Since then Starbreeze has released two additional major bug fixing patches <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3s-second-operation-medic-bag-patch-is-now-available">under the name Operation Medic Bag</a>, and introduced an early <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-is-finally-getting-an-offline-mode">offline mode</a>. Amid all this, the studio revealed it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">working on a Dungeons and Dragons game</a>.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-review">awarded Payday 3 three out of five stars</a> last year, calling it a "shallow shooter that doesn't offer anywhere near enough bang for your ill-gotten buck."

			<p>Today, a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/11/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-september-the-plucky-squire-night-in-the-woods-under-the-waves-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new blog post</a> dropped on the PlayStation website, announcing the PlayStation Plus game catalog for September. Compared to previous months, this month seems to be a heavy focus on indie games, with it getting the most recent release of The Plucky Squire, which will be a day-one release for PlayStation Plus. Those who have an active PlayStation Plus Premium or PlayStation Plus Extra will get access to these games and can own them until their subscription runs out.</p>
<p>The Plucky Squire is the headliner, joined by games such as Night in the Woods and Under the Waves, new classics, and a PS VR2 game offering to those who are on PlayStation Plus Premium, which includes the game Pistol Whip. All of the games being added to PlayStation Plus will be available from September 17.</p>
<p>In addition to the game mentioned, games such as Chernobylite, Wild Card Football, Space Engineers, Road 96, Ben 10, and Far Cry 5 are being added to September's catalog, giving players a lot of variety and games for all the family. Far Cry 5 has been in the PlayStation Plus catalog before and is being re-released again for PlayStation 4 users.</p>
<p>Regarding PS VR2 and classics being added to the list, Pistol Whip is the main PS VR2 game that will be available to play and is the only PS VR2 game on the PlayStation Plus September catalog. However, for those who want a hit of nostalgia, games such as Secret Agent Clank, Sky Gunner, and Mister Mosquito are all being added to the PlayStation Plus September lineup.</p>
<p>Already, the comments under the blog post are not happy with this month's lineup. People say last month was terrible, and this month is giving away games that are already on sale, which feels disingenuous to some of the PlayStation gamers out there. However, some people are happy with the games, especially with games such as Under the Waves, Sky Gunner, and Mr. Mosquito being some of the more hyped-up games in the comments for those who want a hit of nostalgia.</p>
<p>Overall, Sony appears to be in murky water regarding&nbsp;<span>its&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> announcement. The console costs</span>&nbsp;an exorbitant amount of money, not including a disk drive and stand. On top of that, the PlayStation Plus catalog has been predominantly disappointing for gamers for multiple months now, with nothing seeming to be worth adding to the library, according to some of the comments.</p>

</ul>

<p>In our Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, Jason said, <em>“I find myself wishing Shadow of the Erdtree had a continuation from one of the endings of Elden Ring, or ventured back to explore the Shattering itself. Instead, it feels like a filler episode in Naruto. Sure, the fights are cool, and there’s a new progression system to work through, but what is the point if nobody is going to acknowledge it again for the rest of the series. But hey, at least the Convergence Mod team will have a field day with all of this new stuff to play with.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-tips-and-tricks/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On the surface, Space Marine 2 appears as a straightforward action game. You move through a level, smashing, ripping, and tearing apart Tyranids, but it’s much more. If you don’t time your parry or dodge properly, you’ll take severe damage that can end your mission early. We’ll help you complete the task, Ultramarine. Here are our Space Marine 2 tips and tricks to help you better serve the Emperor!</p>



<h2 id="h-first-complete-the-space-marine-2-campaign">First, Complete the Space Marine 2 Campaign</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Most people want to dive straight into the PvE Operations or PvP Eternal War game modes in Space Marine 2, but we recommend completing the campaign first. The story mode, which does allow for three-player co-op, unlocks additional PvE content in Operations mode, and if you choose to skip the story, you might spoil the tale.</p>



<h2 id="h-don-t-be-afraid-to-lower-the-difficulty">Don’t Be Afraid to Lower the Difficulty</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s a certain power fantasy that stems from playing as an Ultramarine. You want to be the meanest machine in the galaxy, stomping on Tyranid tails and tearing apart your foes with a Bolter, right? But on higher difficulties, you’re a piece of meat, and Titus can and will die with as little as a single well-placed strike. While you grasp the game’s combat and mechanics, don’t hesitate to lower the difficulty. It’s super satisfying to stomp through a level unrivaled by any Xenos!</p>



<h2 id="h-learn-to-parry-and-dodge">Learn to Parry and Dodge</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Just because you’re a massive Primaris Space Marine doesn’t mean you’re immune to any and all damage. It would help if you still took care to avoid damage by learning to wield the parry and dodge mechanics effectively. The campaign teaches you both early on, but they take time to master. </p>



<p>When you spot the blue circle around an enemy, parry. When you spot the red circle, dodge. It’s all about timing your prompts and knowing when to click the correct button on your controller or keyboard.</p>



<h2 id="h-explore-your-surroundings">Explore Your Surroundings</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you move through each level, specifically in the story mode and PvE Operations, you’ll note various pathways, outcroppings, and crates. Occasionally, you’ll spot the body of a fallen Ultramarine, and they usually have some equipment, like a weapon or a Relic, that will help you complete your objectives. </p>



<p>But people tend to forget about crates. After all, this is a video game. If you crush, shoot, or smash the crates littering the levels, you’ll often receive ammunition, grenades, and Medicae kits that will come in handy!</p>



<h2 id="h-executions-keep-you-in-the-fight">Executions Keep You in the Fight</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>When you deal enough damage to an enemy, they’ll flash red, indicating they’re vulnerable to an execution or finishing move. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve played Operations only to witness players either outright ignore the flashing notification or continue shooting the enemy with a Bolter. Don’t! Race into the fray, slam that execute button, and perform a finisher on the Tyranid foe!</p>



<p>When you perform a melee finishing move, you’re invulnerable. It’s a few seconds of breathing room to regain your composure and plan your next steps. But it also restores your armor.</p>



<p>This is just the beginning of our Space Marine 2 tips and tricks! We’ll have more as we delve deeper into the game!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/video-game-industry-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a hellish few years for people employed in the video game industry,<a href="https://aftermath.site/search?s=layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> as big studios have been laying off workers every chance they get while smaller studios are just straight up closing</a>. We’ve all read the stories, and scanned the numbers of people affected, but what happens to the individual in the wake of their career (and life) being upended?</p><p>A career video game developer's first instinct upon being laid off--or quitting a job that had become too much--might naturally be to go and find another job in video games. That's how previous boom and bust cycles have tended to work in this business. But as the layoffs continue and funding for new studios dries up, in 2024 the math simply doesn't add up. There just aren't enough jobs for all those looking.</p><p>Leaving those affected with a dilemma: they can either keep trying to find a job in the cruellest game of musical chairs imaginable, or they can walk away and try to do something else with their lives. For some, this means feeling pushed away from the career they'd once given their lives to, but for others it’s a chance at a fresh start that won't condemn them to decades of secrecy, turmoil and exploitation.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-back-to-school-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As part of our Back to School week</a> we spoke with a number of video game developers who, over the past few years, have been forced out of their jobs and are now trying something new. In doing so we're not trying to advocate for people leaving video games, nor are we trying to glorify the act of pursuing something else; each story is an individual story, some of them full of regret, others grateful at new opportunities.</p><figure><blockquote><p>There is a joy in doing something you are really good at, and I miss that feeling.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Bruce </strong>(not their real name) has had a rough few years. Having left a small indie studio whose funding fell through in 2022, they'd been working as a level designer on an online multiplayer game before being laid off in April 2023. Deciding to walk away from games entirely, they're now trying to find a desk job, in particular one as "boring and stable as possible".</p><p>"I'm currently doing a state-sponsored web development program for unemployed people, which is about 630+ hours and is basically a condensed, fullstack web dev course aimed at developing web apps (like storefronts, managing employer databases, etc). I wanted to pair it up with a two-year program of the same type, but since it's a very popular course I couldn't get a spot. So I'm probably going to do some more certifications and try and get a job in web dev early next year."</p><p><strong>Saf Davidson</strong> had been Lead Narrative Designer on a project (now cancelled) at Eggnut,<a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/news/eggnut-tails-noir-studio-shut-down-layoffs-2637769/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a New Zealand studio that closed down a few months ago</a>. She was laid off on Christmas Eve, 2023. After spending a few days feeling "super miserable and terrified of the future", she woke up one day and just went "nah, screw this".</p><p>"I'd been travelling around the States visiting family/friends for a few weeks before getting laid off, and the whole time I was there, everyone kept remarking on how much I knew about plants and how big of a nerd I was being about the different ecosystems", she says. "I think that kind of triggered the unconscious thought process of 'hey maybe I'd like to do something with this'".</p><p>Having finally snapped after being "treated like shit" in games, she decided to go back to university and study plant science. Albeit, with some inspiration from...games. "<em>Halo's</em> Dr Halsey is one of my favourite characters in the world, which I know is insane to say because she's absolutely not someone to idolise as a scientist, but there's a biologist in the last episode of season 2 of the terrible terrible <em>Halo </em>show who says something like 'Doctor Halsey is the reason I became a biologist' and I've never felt more called out in my life.</p><p>"Halsey's got pretty awful morals, but I have to admire her work ethic, you know?", Davidson says. "I can also trace wanting to be a botanist specifically back to playing <em>Control</em> when it came out. The person/people who did the plants in that game put an insane amount of love into them, which broke through my plant blindness (a real thing!) and made me really start paying attention to plants. Not sure I'd be here without the adeniums of <em>Control</em>. So it's largely thanks to games that I want to be a scientist, for good and bad reasons."</p><figure><blockquote><p>...you really do only live once. So I saw the layoff as an opportunity rather than a dire end.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Frank </strong>(not their real name) had been a Senior Concept Artist in video games who, after struggling for months with an IP director who did everything from ask "extremely unprofessional questions during team meetings" to uploading the team's NDA-riddled work to AI platforms without the artist's permission, was recently laid off. Having originally planned to spend a career working in games, their experience has encouraged a dramatic workplace shift.</p><p>"The interactive story element of games has always drawn me in", they say, "but my heart breaks to see this medium stolen by people who only see dollar signs. The game industry won't get better until we profoundly unionize, which I'm hopeful (and doubtful) for, but until then I need to take care of my own.</p><p>"The experiences I had at that game studio did so much more damage than mentioned here. Two therapists have now been so shocked and appalled by what I've relayed that they've been stunned speechless."</p><p>They're now hoping to transition to live-action movies, and are currently working on an initial film, with dreams to turn it into a franchise. "I wanted to do this for decades now, honestly", they say. "My work in games was a career, but it was never my life goal. It sounds silly, but you really do only live once. So I saw the layoff as an opportunity rather than a dire end."</p><p><strong>Anna Willoughby</strong> worked in UX at Blizzard, but after being laid off recently has decided to leave not just games, but the tech space entirely.</p><p>"The games industry is just such a mess", she says. "There's WAY too much enthusiasm around generative AI and generally scammy vibes coming from the C-suite at these companies. Creators and developers are just being abused left and right. The community is amazing but the management is awful. I'm also disillusioned with tech more generally right now, and am just not sure where to go from here".</p><p>Anna is now working as a line cook. "My current role was kind of just…I needed some money and knew I wanted as physical a job as possible. I've been at a desk for 20 years. It's wreaked havoc on my body and brain. My brother was working for a family friend at a country club restaurant and I was like…please let me do some manual labor, I need to move my body [laughs]".</p><p>While Anna would love to return to games if the industry is "regulated a bit more, and the labor movement keeps building", she's not holding her breath. Instead, she's hoping to soon open up her own food truck.</p><figure><blockquote><p>A lot of game dev career changes are actually really difficult because a lot of disciplines are super specialized to games.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Devon Wiersma</strong> had been part of an indie studio in Canada called Beans, working on a game for Devolver Digital. When the publisher pulled the plug on funding in early 2023, Devon--and around 30 of his co-workers--were laid off. While he's now able to work on his own personal games in his spare time, he's spending most of his days as a Course Director at a local university, while also applying for part-time jobs everywhere from libraries to fast food.</p><p>"I used to work at McDonalds for years before getting into game development, and ironically over the years I worked in game dev the prospect of working in a kitchen has become more appealing than being in games", he says. "My reasoning is that at least positions like these would allow me to actually spend my day getting some amount of exercise (vs. game development where I spend all day trapped sitting in chairs) and I always felt it was just more personally fulfilling to help feed people as a baseline."</p><p>While many of the career changes highlighted in this piece might seem swift, Devon reminds us that moving out of video games into something else isn't as easy <a href="https://x.com/simonparkin/status/1833418977944514798?s=46&amp;t=j3I4mG5u4HJArgR7jOFk_g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as driving an Uber or going to the beach for a year</a>. "A lot of game dev career changes are actually really difficult because a lot of disciplines are super specialized to games", he says. "The remark I always hear from programmers in games is that if they didn't like working in games they'd simply go off and work at a bank, because it's boring work but pays way better, or how UX designers might just leave games to work on apps, or webdev, or products as a last resort.</p><p>"For disciplines like Game or Level Designers (which is what I'm specialized in) it's a really tough thing to do without significant retraining, because our skills are so specialized to games; while soft skills are helpful, some of the closest parallels to Level Design outside of games, like architecture or city planning, require super specific training that would involve diving back into post-secondary education. I just often see the sentiment of 'If you don't like games then work somewhere else' and well...for some people in this industry that's nearly impossible to do without reshaping your whole career."</p><p><strong>Chris Ory</strong>, a veteran developer who had spent over a decade in video games, was recently laid off<em> twice in one year</em>, both times at companies with what he describes as "unbelievably toxic work cultures".</p><p>"After almost three years of toxicity and struggle I was completely burnt out", he says. "The idea of rolling the dice interviewing to join another possible shit show was paralyzing. I couldn't even step into my home office without a feeling of dread. I still don't go in there. I've given it to my wife as an exercise room. There were not a lot of interesting options encouraging me to fight through the negativity and get back on the horse. Also I am 46 and looking at my future in a notoriously ageist industry, I started calculating how much longer I was even going to be marketable."</p><p>During this time Chris, a vintage BMW bike enthusiast, inadvertently stumbled upon a new, very different career. Moving to Wisconsin after the second layoff, he sent his '81 R65LS to a place called<a href="https://boxerworks.org/pages/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Boxerworks</a>, one of the few shops in the entire United States that specialised in old BMWs. "Shortly after I got laid off the second time Nathan, Boxerworks' owner, called to let me know he had found an engine I had been waiting for. We started talking about my situation and it came up that he was looking to hand his business off to the right person.</p><p>"It was very important to him that someone would come in and continue his legacy, run the shop as a mom-and-pop operation and maintain the reputation, quality and positive work environment he had cultivated over the years", Chris says. "The opportunity to take over something so established and well respected in a hobby I loved seemed too rare to pass up. I took the plunge and came down here to see if I was that 'right' person. Four months in and things are going well."</p><p>Despite living over <em>four hours</em> away from Boxerworks, Chris is making it work by staying at home for four days then commuting to the store and staying overnight for three. As rough as that is (and it's something he's looking to rectify by opening a second shop closer to home), and as unpredictable as owning a small business can be, when I ask him if he'd ever be willing to go back to games, he's not so sure.</p><p>"That is a question I've been asking myself a lot over the last few months", he says. "There are lots of feelings mixed up there. I've seen so much of the games industry and been through the grinder enough to know the industry is pretty much as shit as it looks from the outside, but there are amazing people in it and working with them can be absolute joy. That makes it hard to think rationally about diving back in.</p><p>"I was very good at what I did. I was a great designer, I was a great design manager, I really deeply understand player behavior, player needs and the business of games. There is a joy in doing something you are really good at and I miss that feeling. But I feel an incredible freedom not having the whims of some tech exec be in control of my livelihood for the first time in a decade. Completely changing careers with little forethought at 46 is terrifying. I have so much to learn before I could even begin to take Nathan's place in the shop. I am totally over my head in a way that I have not been in nearly 15 years, my income has been decimated, I have 6 employees I am responsible for, a 75 year-old man's legacy in my hands, and I am happier than I have been in years."</p><figure><blockquote><p>...my heart breaks to see this medium stolen by people who only see dollar signs.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Trudy</strong> (not their real name), a writer, left their job in games earlier this year, and are now pivoting away from the industry given not just everything that has happened in the last 12 months, but everything that's been happening in games for a lot longer than that.</p><p>"Harassment and abuse has become an occupational hazard with a high mental and emotional cost, which makes it difficult to do the work with a clear head", they say. "Pile this on top of the contracting industry and the cost-benefit analysis doesn't add up."</p><p>With a background in education, they're now returning to that "to remind myself how rewarding it is to help people directly", while pledging to continue making games on the side. "A job in the industry doesn't affect my ability to make games for myself. Games is as much an artistic practice as it is a career path, so I'll protect my peace as much as possible."</p><hr><p>Remember, every time you read about 10, or 100, or 1000 layoffs in the video game industry, they're not cold statistics. Every one of those figures is a person. A life that has been upended, with enormous consequences for not just the individuals directly involved but their family and friends. Every single person affected by layoffs and departures has their own story to tell, their own history in the business and their own motivations for pursuing whatever comes next.</p><p>As we've seen here, sometimes a move away from the video game industry, with all its toxicity and uncertainty and exploitative working conditions, can be the best thing for a person. Other times it can be a traumatic experience, a lifetime's worth of expertise and passion crushed in an instant. Regardless of the circumstances behind someone leaving video games behind, I think the one thing that's clear hearing everyone's stories is that the choice, no matter its outcome, should have been theirs to make.</p><p><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank">Back to School&nbsp;</a>is a week of stories about changes, nostalgia, and learning new things.

Thankfully, if you’re still keen on an Ultimate membership, CDKeys is offering <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdkeys.com%2Fxbox-live%2F1-month-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-xbox-one-pc">one-month subscription codes</a> for $11.19 ($9 off) and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdkeys.com%2Fxbox-live%2F3-month-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-xbox-one-pc">three-month codes</a> for $29.79&nbsp;(about $30 off). These aren’t the lowest prices we’ve seen, but they sure beat paying the subscription’s new price of $19.99 a month.</p><p>If you need a refresher, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate grants access to a massive library of downloadable games for Xbox consoles and PCs. Naturally, that includes first-party titles&nbsp;like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a><em>&nbsp;and </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23589879/hi-fi-rush-making-of-interview-xbox"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a> but also great third-party games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23697355/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23852390/starfield-review-xbox-pc"><em>Starfield</em></a>. It’ll also grant you access to highly anticipated games due to be released soon, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24173655/xbox-fable-game-release-date-2025-trailer"><em>Fable</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24174839/perfect-dark-reboot-xbox-microsoft"><em>Perfect Dark</em></a>, and other games that’ll be available within the next year or so. An Ultimate subscription also provides access to other perks including&nbsp;exclusive deals, an EA Play membership, and online multiplayer, making it a great value overall, especially at this discounted price.</p><p>We’re aware CDKeys isn’t a well-known merchant, but it’s a trusted retailer here at <em>The Verge </em>that often sells discounted gaming codes. That being said, if you would feel more comfortable making a purchase from a more reputable seller, Woot is offering <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/digital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-5">three-month subscription codes for $36.49</a> and <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/digital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-5">one-month codes for $13.79</a> until 1:59AM PT on September 14th.</p><div><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to more than 100 titles, including new first-party releases on day one, which you can play on multiple devices.

That’s not as crisp as the display found on Amazon’s higher-end Fire tablets, but it’s sharper than the Fire HD 7 and good enough for basic entertainment needs.

If you’re new to gardening or are just looking for something relatively low-maintenance, I can’t recommend the AeroGarden enough. The LED-equipped planter is easy to use, with six pods that can grow vegetables, flowers, and herbs. You’ll have to buy most seed pods separately, but AeroGarden does include a complimentary starter kit and a bonus packet of lettuce seeds, so you can get started growing your indoor garden immediately. </li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The PS5 Pro is now a fast-approaching reality. The $700 mid-generation upgrade arrives on November 7, approximately a year in advance of the game that will likely push the four-years-old base PS5 to its very limits: Grand Theft Auto 6. But how essential will the PS5 Pro be to enjoying GTA 6 at its very best? It’s a question more complicated than it first seems.</p><p>“I think there's good evidence to suggest that the [GTA 6 trailer from last year] was running on either PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X,” says Richard Leadbetter, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/authors/richard-leadbetter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technology editor at Digital Foundry</a>. As such, the impressive level of graphical detail seen in that trailer should be achievable using the power of the original 2020 model PlayStation 5. It stands to reason, then, that the new PS5 Pro will be more than capable of delivering what we saw in that short glimpse of Vice City.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Frame rates, though, are an entirely different thing. When asked if GTA 6 could realistically run at 60 frames-per-second on the PS5 Pro, Leadbetter is blunt in his analysis: “No. Grand Theft Auto games have always run complex simulations that push the CPU hard, which is why every GTA game has initially launched on their target platforms at 30fps (or lower!). </p><p>“The PS5 Pro uses the same CPU as the PS5 and it would be extremely challenging to hit 60fps if the base PS5 version is targeting 30fps,” he explains. “This isn't a GPU problem, it's a CPU problem.” </p><p>There’s a multitude of simulation work running concurrently and constantly in GTA to keep its open world ticking. Every street is, at the very minimum, a stage for complex traffic and pedestrian simulations – AI routines and physics calculations that bring those roads and sidewalks to life. GTA 6 will very likely feature one of the most realistic depictions of city life we’ve seen in a video game, and so will be significantly taxing on the CPU as it renders all sorts of NPC behaviours. That leaves little bandwidth to boost those frame rates. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Grand Theft Auto games have always run complex simulations that push the CPU hard, which is why every GTA game has initially launched on their target platforms at 30fps.</p></div><p>Still, thanks to the PS5 Pro’s other enhancements, GTA 6 will undoubtedly look better on the new console. It just likely will not be the 4K 60fps experience many will be expecting following Sony’s boastful presentation. “What you will get will be higher quality visuals, but likely still running at similar frame-rates [to the base console],” says Leadbetter. “If GTA 6 can't sustain a locked 30fps (GTA 4 and GTA 5 couldn't on PS3 and Xbox 360), PS5 Pro can run the CPU with a 10 percent bump to clock speeds – so you may get more stable performance.</p><p>“Of course, all bets are off if Rockstar is targeting 60fps on the standard PS5 - but we've seen no evidence so far to suggest it is.” </p><p>While it seems unlikely that the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 4K 60fps, there’s still reason to believe the new console will prove an impressive machine. Right now, though, there’s little evidence of its transformative abilities. “I think the hardware's certainly capable, but the actual presentation confused me,” says Leadbetter. “Nine minutes just isn't really enough to describe in depth the features the machine has and the philosophy behind the design.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Leadbetter also notes that the games showcased during the presentation were already fantastic graphical showcases in their original forms, and so were not ideal demonstrations of the Pro’s machine learning-based upscaling technology. Why was it the already gorgeous Horizon Forbidden West and Spider-Man 2 being shown off when we could have seen how transformative PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution could be for games that have shaky image quality on the standard PS5? </p><p>“Combine that with poor presentational techniques and YouTube's inadequacies as a video delivery platform and you didn't see much of an improvement,” says Leadbetter.  </p><p>While Sony has chosen to so far only preview enhancements to games that barely require them in the first place, we can at least be relatively confident that those titles in desperate need of a performance boost will be catered for. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a> states that up to 8,500 games will be improved thanks to the PS5 Pro Game Boost feature. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We might even <em>finally</em> get Elden Ring locked to 60 frames per second.</p></div><p>“I think [the improvements will] be quite cool actually, assuming the extra 45 percent of GPU power is fully available to existing games,” enthuses Leadbetter. “Many titles have dynamic resolution scaling. You should see clear image quality improvements there. Similarly, a lot of games have frame-rate issues in their 60fps performance modes – I'd expect those to be cleaned up. We might even finally get Elden Ring locked to 60 frames per second.”</p><p>One thing Leadbetter thinks is less likely to make an impact is the Pro’s 8K capabilities. While he foresees a very small number of tech-focused developers, like Gran Turismo 7 creator Polyphony Digital, making 8K resolution options available for PS5 Pro, he doubts other studios will work on such modes “because the audience out there is vanishingly small.” </p><p>“I had an 8K screen for four years, but even as an RTX 4090 owner, I have little interest in 8K gaming when high frame-rates at max 4K are so much more desirable,” he says.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Game Enhanced for PS5 Pro So Far</h3></div></output><p>Talking of Nvidia’s RTX graphics cards, PC gaming has been the much-debated topic following Sony’s reveal of the PS5 Pro’s eye-watering $699.99 price tag. I’ve seen several suggestions across social media that it’s better value to just save up a ‘little extra’ money and buy a PC that will prove more powerful than the PS5 Pro. It’s an argument I personally think is flawed – a strong 4K, high frame-rate PC will set you back notably more money than the cost of the new console. And, when it’s built, it simply won’t be capable of doing the thing many prospective PS5 Pro owners want: playing GTA 6 at launch with the best possible graphics. (GTA 6 will ship on console first, remember.)</p><p>Leadbetter has a similar outlook. “You will struggle to get that kind of visual quality on a similarly priced PC,” he says. “The closest GPU on the market now with that kind of feature set and performance is the RTX 4070 – which is a fair bit better, I'd say. But your base cost there is $540/£480. And then you need to factor in CPU, motherboard, memory, storage, power supply and case. </p><p>“You could offset the extra cost against the fact that you don't need extra subscription costs over time, I suppose, but I think you're missing the fundamental point of what PS5 Pro is and who is going to buy it.</p><p>“It's a console, not a PC – and there are still key differences there, not least in a viable living room experience. I'd also say the Pro is designed to appeal to core PlayStation users with a library built up over many years. That library will not transition over to PC so those users are effectively starting from scratch.”</p><p>Of course, that’s not to say that the PS5 Pro is a ‘good deal’. “That user base likely has a physical game library, too – so the notion you don't even get a disc drive for your £699/$699 is nuts,” Leadbetter concludes. </p><p>There may be other people looking at the PS5 Pro and failing to see a good value proposition, too, although for entirely other reasons. “I think Phil Spencer watched the presentation and felt vindicated in the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-reiterates-there-is-no-need-for-a-mid-generation-refresh-for-xbox-series-xs-right-now">decision not to make a 'pro' console for this generation</a>,” Leadbetter theories. “Xbox players already have a great way to play high-end Xbox games – and that's on PC, where the enthusiast has more freedom to pick and choose the kind of hardware they want.” </p><p>It’s true: Microsoft has been running three different platforms from the very start of the generation, offering a solution for players of all tastes and budgets. It is arguably Xbox’s biggest advantage over PlayStation. Who needs a Series X-X when you can play Starfield at 4K60 on a PC? <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-runs-at-30fps-on-xbox-series-x-and-s-obsidian-confirms">Avowed’s 30fps lock</a> simply isn’t a problem if you’ve already shelled out for an RTX 40-series graphics card. </p><p>But, as we’ve already said, the PS5 Pro is not a PC. It’s a different beast entirely. Is it the console the PlayStation hardcore needs, though? Let's see how fast it flies off the shelves this November. </p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 - Space Marine Arsenal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Epic released this statement to clarify Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2's usage of an Epic online services. The game installs an Epic Online Services client after the player accepts a EULA, even on Steam. Developer Focus confirmed in a <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/forums/27-bugs/threads/43800-quick-note-on-the-most-common-issues#post-207833" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post</a> that the Epic client facilitates optional cross-play and syncs friend lists across services. However, linking Steam and Epic accounts is completely optional and will not affect gameplay.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/maligned-epic-account-login-requirement-results-in-new-steam-game-getting-review-bombed/1100-6525349/" data-ref-id="1100-6525349">Earth Defense Force 6 got criticized</a> for requiring an Epic Games login for online play. Helldivers 2 faced similar complaints for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-be-forced-to-link-a-psn-account-sarting-this-month/1100-6523147/" data-ref-id="1100-6523147">requiring a PSN login</a>. As for Space Marine 2, the sequel has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-is-already-breaking-franchise-records/1100-6526389/" data-ref-id="1100-6526389">broken Warhammer records</a>. Nearly a quarter-million players booted the game up on Steam, besting Total Warhammer III's previous concurrent player-count.</p>

                <p>Last year saw a megaton of fantastic games arrive on PC and consoles, including the surprise release of Dead Island 2. Stuck in development hell for what seemed like an eternity, Dead Island 2 wasn't a GOTY contender, but it still had plenty of cheeky charm. And if you've been waiting to play it, you can grab the upcoming Dead Island 2: Ultimate Edition which includes the base game and tons of extra content for $70.

You'll also get some gear to help you survive the zombie apocalypse, like various weapon packs, premium skins for all six Slayers, and more cosmetics to apply to each character. Here is a list of all the included weapon and item packs:</p><ul><li>Deadly Weapons Pack</li><li>Memories of Banoi Pack</li><li>Golden Weapons Pack</li><li>Pulp Weapons Pack</li><li>Red’s Demise Pack</li><li>6 Slayer's Premium Skin Packs</li></ul><p>Preorders for the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions of Dead Island 2: Ultimate Edition are available for $70 at Best Buy.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you missed it when it first came out, Dead Island 2 is a horror-action first-person game that unfolds in Los Angeles after the city was overrun with zombies. It has a great sense of humor, plenty of interesting gameplay systems, and it's one of the best 7/10 games of 2023.
